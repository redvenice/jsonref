But the question of who owns land in Britain has been bound up with wealth, inequality and exclusion for centuries.Traveller communities are likely to be worst affected by the government’s plans, so a good place to start is Damian Le Bas’s The Stopping Places, a lyrical memoir about life on the road. Le Bas’s journey is a quest to rediscover his Romany roots, and along the way explore the challenges and prejudices facing Travellers.Rightwing populism needs a marginalised group to blame for society’s ills, and we’ve been here before: in the 1990s, the Conservatives introduced the Criminal Justice Act to crack down on Gypsies, anti-roads protesters and raves. George McKay’s Senseless Acts of Beauty is a wonderful history of the forgotten counterculture that sparked this clampdown, from the free festivals of the 70s to the Dongas tribe who occupied Twyford Down to halt a bypass. Land, and who controls it, lay at the heart of this uprising.Much remains off-limits, however, and one of the reasons why is the prestige that comes with owning land – none more so than the sporting estate. Such pretensions are memorably skewered in Roald Dahl’s Danny the Champion of the World, in which a boy and his father poach pheasants from the local bigwig’s wood. After his father is caught in a mantrap – the epitome of the landowning gentry’s desire to exclude the great unwashed – Danny hatches a cunning plan to get his own back.Since devolution, Scottish politics has taken a very different path to England’s – on land as on so much else. Andy Wightman’s magnum opus The Poor Had No Lawyers is an essential guide to who owns Scotland and why land reform has flowered there in recent years.And for a bitingly witty history of the Highland clearances, take a look at John McGrath’s play The Cheviot, The Stag and the Black, Black Oil.Exclusion from the land can be viewed through the prism of race as well as class. Official surveys show that BME communities are much less likely to visit the countryside than white Britons. The Forestry Commission’s appointment of Zakiya Mckenzie as a writer-in-residence is one recent nod towards trying to decolonise the countryside. Mckenzie’s poem “Writer in the Forest” explores feelings of belonging in nature: “This land that I own as every part of myself  Yet know I have no ultimate claim to contend”. It’s a philosophy that we urgently need to embrace: that the Earth does not ultimately belong to us – rather, we belong to the Earth.• Who Owns England? by Guy Shrubsole is published by William Collins (RRP £20).

Both write books, have had long experience with drug addiction, and are bearers of the hepatitis C virus (Thayil’s Booker-shortlisted first novel, Narcopolis, was dedicated to “HCV”). The author and his creation also share the tragedy of having lost a young wife. In Low, after quitting her “dream gig” in publishing, Dominic’s wife Aki fulfils a long-nurtured death wish by hanging herself in the couple’s New Delhi apartment, leaving him to find her body.From this morbid seed flowers what turns out to be a surprisingly colourful and enjoyable novel. Low plays out over a single weekend as Dominic, so freshly bereaved he’s still carrying his wife’s ashes in a white urn, flies on a whim to his native city of Mumbai without packing so much as a change of underwear. His quest is to perform the Hindu rite of immersing his beloved’s ashes in pure and flowing water, none of which is to be found in Delhi. His true destination, though, is oblivion. Flailing in grief and guilt, Dominic gorges on every substance he can lay his hands on. Mumbai being the city whose junkie subsoil Thayil first sifted in Narcopolis, that amounts to a fair few: Dominic ingests cocaine, heroin, sleeping pills, opium, a great deal of alcohol, and, in a rare appearance in literary fiction, the synthetic upper mephedrone or “meow meow”.With its hectic lost-weekend time frame and plot essentials – druggy excess, random encounters, a loved one’s ashes – Low reads like an Indian cover version of Bad News, the second of Edward St Aubyn’s Patrick Melrose novels. For all his emotional turmoil, Dominic is a companionable protagonist. Sending texts to dealer and junkie friends from his Mumbai years, he lets himself go with the megacity flow, briefly bonding with characters who appear and haphazardly vanish over the course of a dedicated binge. “All hail prescription meds,” he intones, impressed by the deranging coalition of sleeping pills and meow meow. “All hail the wide umbrella of the narcotic.”The rather flimsy plot recedes in importance before the logic of the binge and its oneiric delirium: it’s not so much what will happen next, as where will the next drink, line, pill or pipe come from. Dominic’s concern with balancing his highs and lows, uppers and downers, booze and powder generates its own kind of narrative dynamism. Occasionally he pauses to reflect on all the excess: “What was the lure of the high? Now there was a question a sensible person would duck, simply because the answer was so plain, so ruinous. You paid in money and time for a drug that obliterated money and time.”As the weekend blurs past in a succession of taxi rides, dim bars and hotel suites, Dominic engages his deceased wife in hallucinatory dialogue. An erratic chapter assumes the perspective of her disembodied spirit, swirling about in the ashes Dominic lugs around Mumbai. Recollections of the couple’s life together in New York and Delhi sketch Aki as a doomed, wraithlike figure. “Ever since I was little, I’ve wanted to die,” she tells Dominic at the outset of their relationship. Although we learn of his sense of “abject failure as a husband and a man”, the novel never manages to convincingly probe the nature of that failure, nor of the anxiety that “always bubbled under, untouched by the ongoing blizzard of alcohol and drugs with which he tried to obliterate it”. Low works best not as a nuanced examination of grief and suicide, but as a narcotic hurtle through the surface agitations such traumas effect – which, it must be said, is rather more fun.And Thayil is having fun here – maybe too much. The jokey, pop-culturally allusive prose can stray into imprecision. Similes and descriptions fall wide of the mark: expecting politicians to behave honourably is “like expecting a goose to appreciate the semantics of boo”. Donald Trump is bafflingly labelled an “addle-brained fuck trinket”.The novel’s most amusing motif concerns Dominic’s tender gratitude for the American president’s endearing incompetency. To him, Trump is “everyman”, and “a comfort to the troubled mind”. “That was why he needed plenty of screen time with the man, first thing in the morning and last thing at night, if possible … that unmistakable voice, the crazed lullaby.” Thayil’s fiction suggests a strange truth about Trump that the industry of appalled opinion pieces rarely broaches: we’ll miss him when he’s gone.As much as cocaine and meow meow, Mumbai itself is Thayil’s muse here. He relishes painting the city’s famous sights – the Gateway of India, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel – no less than its underworld dens and the dealers, soaks and dissipated heiresses who inhabit them. Like traversing a traffic-clogged Indian sprawl in the midday heat, drug and alcohol blowouts are notoriously enervating: Low offers vicarious kicks without the comedown.• Rob Doyle’s Threshold is published by Bloomsbury.

With a €1tn ($1.1tn) investment package, it hopes to transform Europe into a carbon-neutral economy by 2050.But much of that €1tn for the commission’s proposed green deal would be generated through financial-leverage effects. In 2020, the EU will formally allocate for such purposes only around €40bn, most of which is already included in the budget from previous years arguably, only €7.5bn of additional funding under the plan would actually be new.As with the previous commission’s 2015 Juncker plan, the trick, once again, will be to muster the lion’s share of the quoted sum through a shadow budget administered by the European Investment Bank (EIB). The commission, after all, is not allowed to incur debt but the EU’s intergovernmental rescue and investment funds are.In essence, the EU is doing what the major banks did before the 2008 financial crisis, when they circumvented regulation by shifting part of their business to off-balance-sheet conduits and special-purpose vehicles. In the case of the EU, the guarantees offered by the commission and inidual EU member states are sufficient for a high credit rating, and thus for the issuance of European debenture bonds. The funds generated will be used for public and private purposes, and sometimes even for public-private partnerships. But should the guarantees be called in one day, eurozone taxpayers will be the ones to foot the bill.These planned shadow budgets are problematic, not only because they would allow the commission to circumvent a prohibition against borrowing, but also because they implicate the European Central Bank. To be sure, the ECB president, Christine Lagarde, has already announced that she wants the bank to play a more active role in climate-friendly activities within the eurozone. And the ECB is now considering whether to pursue targeted purchases of bonds issued by institutions that have received the commission’s climate seal of approval.In practice, of course, this most likely means that the ECB would buy up the “green” bonds now being devised by the EIB. Those purchases will then reduce the interest rates at which the EIB can take on debt, ultimately leading to activation of the printing press to provide the money for spending on climate policy.It is laudable to want to do something about climate change. But under the current plan, the ECB would be pushed into a legal grey area. The institution is not democratically controlled, but rather managed by technocrats on the executive board. Every member state, big or small, appoints its own representative, who then has equal voting rights, personal immunity, and the autonomy to operate free from any parliamentary accountability.Moreover, under the Maastricht treaty, the ECB board is primarily obligated to maintain price stability, and may support separate economic-policy measures only if doing so does not endanger its ability to fulfil this mandate. In the case of the green deal, the dangers are obvious. If the additional demand created by an expansion of green projects is funded by printing money instead of collecting taxes, it will not withdraw demand from other sectors of the European economy and would therefore be potentially inflationary.Situations like this serve as a reminder of why article 123 of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union strictly prohibits the ECB from taking part in the financing “of Union institutions, bodies, offices or agencies, central governments, regional, local, or other public authorities, other bodies governed by public law, or public undertakings of member states”. But, of course, the ECB has already circumvented this rule by purchasing around €2tn in public debt from the market, thereby stretching the limits of its mandate to a legally dubious degree.The latest plans to circumvent the Maastricht treaty will not improve matters. Before the financial crisis, the ECB was concerned only with monetary policy. During the crisis, it turned into a public bailout authority rescuing near-bankrupt banks and governments. Now, it is becoming an economic government that can print its budget as it sees fit.The impending violation of the spirit of the Maastricht treaty will be twofold: the EU will be assuming debt covertly, and it will be doing so through the printing press. As such, the commission’s plans will further undermine the credibility of the very institution on which Europe relies for its financial and macroeconomic stability and its long-term growth prospects – and this at a time when the world is becoming even more uncertain, competitive and aggressive.• Hans-Werner Sinn, is professor of economics at the University of Munich.

I kept a daily diary for about a week, wrote the odd letter or postcard, and that was that.I almost never communicated in writing with any of my friends, many of whom I started school with in 1971 and am privileged still to be close to. For the first 20 years of our friendship, I don’t think the five of us exchanged more than a dozen letters. In the past 20 years, however, via phones and computers, we have written tens (perhaps hundreds) of thousands of words on hundreds of subjects, many of them personal and intimate. We’ve all had to learn, usually through trial and error, the craft of writing, considering the meaning and nuance of every word. And we’ve had to learn concision. Yes, these means of communication might be reductive, but all these words surely add up to a lot more than nothing.So for every pouting, selfie-sharing, influencer-influencee teenager getting on your wick, let’s try to consider that they are having to be wordsmiths in a way that people of my generation never were."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8c49f49b883c3274909db46797b8e2757214aa9f/0_0_4928_3279/master/4928.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6a3b19a80abfeb03326935c4c1f9e9ba 700w","title":"terry jones monty python actor film director","story":"After directing the Python films and creating such characters as the Virgin Mandy and the monstrous Mr Creosote, he went on to make Personal Services and The Wind in the Willows• Terry Jones dies aged 77• Jones’s legacy – a life in picturesTerry Jones, who has died at the age of 77, was the Python with a sweetly open, guileless face and a rich voice that he often tortured into a high-pitched, strangulated warbling for his many “Hello, Mrs Smoker” drag roles. He was also the Python credited for inspiring the team’s consistent surrealist denial of conventional structure. It was Jones who took on the directing role for the Monty Python movies: sharing the credit with Terry Gilliam for Monty Python and the Holy Grail in 1975, but taking the helm on his own for their masterpiece, Monty Python’s Life of Brian, in 1979, and the rather more patchy Monty Python’s The Meaning of Life in 1983. His parallel and post-Python career was successful: with Michael Palin, he created the much-loved Ripping Yarns for BBC TV and wrote well-regarded popular books on medieval and classical history.But Jones’s face is stamped indelibly on my mind for the creation of two movie characters – one good, one horribly evil.In Life of Brian, he played Mandy, the woman who is at first mistaken by the three wise men for the Virgin Mary, and whose son Brian is, in adulthood, to be fatefully mistaken for the Son of God. Jones’s Mandy is one of his classic dressing-up-as-a-panto-dame roles, and yet he invests this tetchy, bewildered, cantankerous sketch character with a weird innocence, and her sayings live on in popular culture. As the mob of Brian’s deluded followers gather outside her humble dwelling, Mandy says, “He’s not the Messiah, he’s a very naughty boy!” and “There’s a mess here, but no Messiah!” These are lines that have been endlessly revived by headline writers and commentators, forever being used to puncture the hubris of politicians and sports stars. It is something in the lines’ simplicity. The messMessiah play on words is so simple, the sort of lame dad joke that a regular civilian might make, not an Oxbridge wit.Jones’s other claim to movie fame is a horrifying monster: Mr Creosote, the grotesquely fat glutton in The Meaning of Life who shows up in a posh French restaurant, presided over by John Cleese’s oleaginous maitre d’. Mr Creosote clears his palate by vomiting convulsively everywhere and then proceeds to eat himself to an explosion, the trigger being a final, incautious “waffer-thin” mint, and is shockingly still alive at the end, his stomach and ribcage wrenched open. Mr Creosote was co-created by Jones and Palin, and rewritten by Cleese and Graham Chapman, and his aggressive greed has become legendary – a meme before there was any social media to fit it into. And people forget the final, horrible thing about Jones’s creation: amid the blood, intestines and sick that have washed all over the floor, Jones reappears as an antisemitic cleaning lady mopping it up, musing that, whatever else has happened, at least she doesn’t “work for Jews”.What on earth does Mr Creosote mean? Is he a satire of greed? The arrogance of the rich? Maybe. The important thing is that his horrible aggression is indulged by the maitre d’, who is indifferent to the other, more polite but evidently less important diners who are upset, but know that they mustn’t make a fuss. Importantly, the restaurant is a traditional theatre of British embarrassment – like the Fawlty Towers dining room – a place where generations of postwar Britons were terrified that they would show themselves up as unsophisticated, or be humiliated by the waiters, or get served bad food and be too scared to complain. If you’ve ever felt uncomfortable in a restaurant, Mr Creosote is your worst nightmare and your greatest hero: the guy who spectacularly destroys all those painful little snob rules about fine dining. Or maybe Mr Creosote is just there to gross us out for the sake of it: a British La Grande Bouffe.After Python, Jones undertook a number of projects for film and television, including writing and directing a well-received, all-star movie version of The Wind in the Willows, starring himself as Mr Toad, Steve Coogan as Mole, Eric Idle as Rat and Nicol Williamson as Badger.But, for me, his most startling directorial outing outside Python was a bizarre film that only gets more bizarre in retrospect – Personal Services (1987), written by David Leland (who went on to write Wish You Were Here starring Emily Lloyd). It is the story of a brothel-keeper inspired by the case of Cynthia Payne, whose prosecution for her suburban BDSM establishment with its alleged top-drawer clientele caused much giggling in the press. The film stars Julie Walters as Christine and Danny Schiller plays her “maid” – weirdly, just the kind of drag role that Jones might have created for a Python sketch. The sheer tackiness and nastiness of Personal Services is what is striking now, not its alleged comedy-romp value. It’s like Britain’s last kitchen-sink movie, a film that focuses on pure domestic drear.I last saw Jones on stage in the summer of 2014, in London’s O2 Arena, when he took part in Monty Python Live (Mostly), their hugely lucrative reunion show. I remember being awestruck and even slightly tearful to see the old gang together. Jones’s illness was said to be advanced at that stage, but to me he looked absolutely sharp. He radiated innocence and fun."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7e4b96fbb8e4f29ea38dbd5da1f114357dc24439/0_0_6908_4145/master/6908.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cb7badffb01d99353775ae2d25d549d9","title":"maths experts secret perfect espresso","story":"It’s all in the grind, say mathematicians who turned to equations to solve mysteryWhat’s the secret of the perfect espresso? It’s a question that has long troubled cafe owners around the world, but now mathematicians say they have worked out the formula for achieving the perfect brew – and it all comes down to the daily grind.“There is a common experience, particularly for people making coffee in their homes, and baristas as well, that you brew two espressos one after the other, you use the same ground coffee and seemingly you brew it in exactly the same way, yet the two shots can taste quite different to one another,” said Dr Jamie Foster at Portsmouth University, a co-author of the research.But by using coffee that is ground coarser than usual, Foster and colleagues say there is less variation from cup to cup – a switch that also brings other benefits: it is faster, cheaper, and produces less waste.Writing in the journal Matter, Foster and colleagues report how they set out to explore how to optimise coffee making by developing mathematical equations to model the processes occurring in the bed of coffee as water is forced through when making an espresso.The team found that for a given water temperature and pressure, the model suggested that the finer the grind, the greater the proportion of coffee that ends up dissolved in the water.Foster said, intuitively that made sense: “If the little chunks making up the bed of coffee are smaller then there is more surface area for the water to come into contact with.”That would mean to reduce waste and produce the most efficient coffee, cafes should grind their coffee as fine as possible.However when the team carried out tests with a coffee machine in a real cafe, they found that at very fine grinds the model broke down beyond a certain point..The team says that leads to differences in the extraction yield from different areas of the coffee bed, and variation from cup to cup as different sized parts of the bed can clog up each time. That variability is reflected in the flavour: a higher “extraction yield” is typically more bitter, while lower makes for a more sour cup.“The key to making the shot reproducible is you want the particles just large enough that the flow is uniform and predictable, but as small as they can be to maximise the surface area,” said Foster.Crucially, he added, cafes typically use coffee that is ground too finely, meaning the taste is unpredictable.Foster and colleagues add that by grinding slightly more coarsely, the barista can subsequently lower the mass of coffee used for each shot – or the amount of water passing through it – to get the desired taste more consistently and at lower cost.But while there appears to be a sweet spot for grinding, quite what that is can vary – something Foster said means coffee-making remains something of an art.“A barista chooses the temperature and the pressure and the beans to make it taste the way they like, and then you make the extraction reproducible and efficient by fiddling with the grind setting,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53cd3fef82e1377687b8a36ee970f770d36e0ccf/0_385_6000_3600/master/6000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d60ea500b98a75fbbc36c9eda1beb29e","title":"the poor deserve more than ration book food staples","story":"In the nine years since I first visited a food bank they have become dispiritingly commonplace – as have the weird ideas about what we’re supposed to donateOne thing I never thought this was was a story about food. I didn’t even look inside the parcels it would have felt incredibly intrusive, a little like poking through someone else’s shopping trolley. The first backlash moment I remember was when someone – a reader, I couldn’t possibly guess of which newspaper – spotted some Maldon sea salt on a food bank shelf. Thus was the truth unmasked: that these people were not hungry at all, they were just in it for the incredibly expensive salt. Jack Monroe, the Bootstrap Cook, who has done the extraordinary work of building a recipe encyclopaedia from the foods you might get at a food bank, pointed out that they were just working with whatever people had donated. Users may, occasionally, get some peaches in armagnac that would not be proof positive that they weren’t destitute.Despite making perfect sense, the point did not land: the new normal was that food had to be extremely basic, otherwise food bank users were somehow in breach of their “contract”. There is necessity and there is pleasure, and if they ever coexist, the need is a lie. Monroe has worked tirelessly against this, insisting on pleasure in whatever bag of lentils she chances upon, but she seems to be doing this almost singlehandedly. By 2017, some supermarkets were handing out suggested shopping lists if you wanted to donate: tinned meat, fish, fruit, veg, soup and pulses UHT milk tea, coffee, rice and pasta. Of course, they have to be tinned, since they can’t be perishable (although arguably, usage is so high now that shifting a few bananas wouldn’t be very hard).Absent a can of condensed milk, this is exactly the food my mum used to keep in the cellar (she said in case we got snowed in, but really for the untoward event of a nuclear war). To give “austerity” its fullest meaning, this – minus the pasta – is a postwar shopping list, the food you would eat without complaint in the immediate aftermath of a national disaster. The Trussell Trust typically tries to include some biscuits, but its offering is still strikingly pared down. This is about more than what people happen to donate: there are conventions, now, around what you’re supposed to donate. So in Cardiff, two Christmases ago, there was a glut of baked beans and tea bags, but an urgent shortage of sponge puddings. That made perfect sense: if a food parcel is political, which it is, then its contents will be scrutinised, and somebody, somewhere, will call a pudding empty calories. Why would a person in genuine need eat an empty calorie? Beans? Now there’s an honest food. Basic enough that nobody is getting something for nothing.It is actually the food itself, more than the widespread experience of hunger, that distils the difference between charity and social security. With charity comes the end of privacy, since your basket is everybody’s business. But it also builds a very functional view of the body, insofar as the least it requires to survive is also the most that it needs, as though you are talking about horses, or rabbits (dogs are exempt from this narrative God knows how they got away with it, but it would be considered very inhumane never to give a dog a treat). And the fact that you can imagine all these foods on the basics list of a ration card, instead of ringing any alarm bells (hang on a second: we didn’t have a war we don’t have a national food shortage), only serves to reinforce the notion that it is somehow character-building, because, you know, wars are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/003071a354fb4a14fdb811bce3d594c43869ae74/0_94_3165_1899/master/3165.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac9de8c9bf1be2a50e534f00f928d0c4","title":"leicester west ham premier league match report","story":"Leicester got back their mojo but lost their talisman when Jamie Vardy limped off with a glute injury. “He’s a fantastic player and really important for us but you’re never going to succeed if you rely on just one player,” Brendan Rodgers said.The absence of the Premier League’s top scorer certainly did not matter against a dishevelled West Ham, as Leicester strutted to their first league win since New Year’s Day owing to two goals by Ayoze Pérez and one each by Harvey Barnes and Ricardo Pereira. Their position in the top four looks secure, with this result leaving them 14 points clear of fifth-place Manchester United.As for West Ham, a successful penalty by Mark Noble gave them fleeting hope of scrounging a point but they left with what they deserved, which was nothing other than a reminder that they need to get their act together quickly if they are to avoid being overtaken by at least one of only three teams below them in the league.David Moyes admitted he was “extremely disappointed” and he knows the fixture list offers no imminent respite, with West Ham’s next four leagues games including two against Liverpool and one against Manchester City. “The Premier League always throws up surprises and we have to be looking to make one of those shocks happen,” said Moyes, whose team were a different kind of shocking at the King Power Stadium.The previous meeting between these teams, just last month in London, led to the dismissal of Moyes’ predecessor, Manuel Pellegrini. The latest one offered more evidence that Moyes has a big job on his hands, as West Ham were, in his own words, “very poor,” especially in a first half in which their only response to Leicester’s vibrant start was an indecipherable blather.Leicester came into the game in stuttering form, having lost their previous two matches. Rodgers made two alterations to the lineup who began Sunday’s defeat by Burnley, with Ben Chilwell and Youri Tielemans coming back into the side. Wilfred Ndidi’s amazingly fast recovery from knee surgery was confirmed by his presence on the bench – “he’s genetically blessed,” said Rodgers, who had to throw on the Nigerian earlier than planned because Nampalys Mendy hobbled off with knee trouble after half an hour.Leicester were a goal up by then thanks to a fast start in which they fizzed with the intensity they had lacked in recent games. “We got our authority and personality back,” Rodgers said. Barnes created and scored the breakthrough goal, receiving the ball at the edge of the D before slipping it to Pereira and dashing towards the six-yard box in the hope of a return pass. Pereira’s dink over the advancing Darren Randolph might have reached the net without assistance but Barnes prodded the ball over the line just to make sure, claiming his third goal in four matches.West Ham’s guileless play suggested they would only get back into this game if Leicester lapsed into complacency or if their whole team were struck down by injuries.Vardy, as it happened, soon had to limp off but Leicester increased their lead before the break, Barnes scampering down the left before pulling back a cross for Pereira, who drove a fierce shot into the bottom corner from 15 yards.Moyes made a double substitution at half-time and West Ham at last carried a vague threat but they needed an intervention from the referee to make a breakthrough. In the 48th minute, West Ham were awarded a penalty when Ndidi and Sébastien Haller made a wholesome challenge for the ball and the striker fell to the ground. Noble applied dubious justice from the spot.After moderate pressure from the visitors, Leicester roared back. Tielemans, Barnes and James Maddison all went close before Angelo Ogbonna brought down Kelechi Iheanacho in the 79th minute. Pérez converted the penalty, and doubled his tally stylishly two minutes from time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82ec7cc543fa803cde416b586ac039cf9eead6a4/0_213_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=798e515733627654e6cd9af05916cf2d","title":"manchester city financial fair play breaches 2012 13 accounting sponsorships uefa champions league","story":"• Accounting rejected and £118.75m of sponsorships questioned• City could face Champions League ban in second Uefa inquiryManchester City were found to have made inadmissible submissions to Uefa over financial fair play in 2014 and were reported for not making their bank statements available, the  can reveal.City’s submissions for the 2012 and 2013 financial years were questioned in relation to £118.75m in sponsorships from companies in Abu Dhabi, the home state of the club’s owner, and their accounting methods over transfer fees and the formation of two new companies were rejected.Almost £60m was added to the club’s losses by the European game’s governing body as a result of findings relating to accounting methods, the ’s investigation can reveal.The findings against City were made by consultants appointed by Uefa in spring 2014 to delve further into the accounts the club submitted.  can reveal Uefa concluded City had made losses totalling approximately €180m in 2012 and 2013, vastly exceeding the €45m FFP maximum deficit allowed, provided those losses were covered by an owner.Uefa’s first inquiry into City over FFP has been known about for six years. So too has the deal which City eventually and reluctantly agreed with Uefa to limit their transfer spending. But the detail of the process, revealed today by the , has never officially been made public. understands that within Uefa there were people who believed the regulations should have been more strictly enforced in 2014 and one staff member working on FFP is said to have left shortly after the settlement was agreed.The exposure of these details has come as a second investigation into City’s FFP compliance, sparked by revelations in November 2018, is nearing completion.The Abu Dhabi sponsorships became bitterly contested issues in November 2018 when Der Spiegel published “leaked” internal City emails and documents which suggested the club’s owner, Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan, was largely funding the Etihad sponsorship deal himself, unknown to Uefa.The “adjudicatory chamber” of Uefa’s Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) is understood to be hearing the charges made against the club this week.If its panel finds the charges proven it could ban City from the Champions League, the trophy the club has most coveted since the start of Mansour’s £1.3bn project and transformational 2016 appointment of Pep Guardiola as manager. City are certain to appeal against any adverse finding to the court of arbitration for sport.In 2014 European football’s governing body was led by the now Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, and leaks published in 2018 by Der Spiegel appear to show he was personally involved in the settlement.The club risked severe sanctions for the scale of its deficit including possible exclusion from the Champions League, yet a controversial settlement was agreed in May 2014. City vehemently objected to the process and the conclusions, and were seriously threatening legal action against FFP, arguing that the break-even principle could be considered unlawful.The consultants reported to Uefa that City had not provided them with bank statements so that the payments, including from the sponsoring companies, could clearly be seen, the  understands.City did make available their online bank account, which went back 12 months to the spring of 2013, but that did not cover 2012 or most of the 2013 financial year, which together constituted the first accounting period of Uefa’s FFP regulations.City are understood to have replied that the paper bank statements were not accessible to the club’s management at the time the consultants came to Manchester. The club’s hierarchy suggested to Uefa that the consultants could have made further requests for statements before highlighting that they had not been provided.The consultants are also understood to have reported to Uefa that some multimillion-pound sponsorship contracts with Abu Dhabi companies had not been signed. City dismissed that as an issue, telling Uefa that they also had contracts with non-Abu Dhabi sponsors which had not been signed, and that it was clear the deals had been done because the sponsorships were being fulfilled.The FFP regulations, introduced in 2010-11, were aimed at dampening players’ wage inflation and encouraging European clubs not to make huge losses. Under FFP losses cannot be reduced by owners putting more millions in via excessive commercial partnerships with companies related to them.City were taken over by Sheikh Mansour of the Abu Dhabi ruling family in 2008 and he with his executives instantly transformed the club’s finances and ambitions.City faced a severe challenge to comply with the €45m loss limit when the club’s spending was escalating dramatically, with the multiple signings of star players City’s sponsorships with the Abu Dhabi entities were examined closely by the CFCB.In 2011 City’s sponsorship by the Abu Dhabi state airline Etihad was converted into a 10-year deal, to include the stadium, and by 2013, after City had won the Premier League for the first time, it is understood to have gone up to £67.5m a year. The deals with three other entities from Abu Dhabi are understood to have been £15m a year from the investment firm Aabar, £16.5m from the telecommunications giant Etisalat, and £19.75m from the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority.In 2014 Uefa’s consultants, reported to be PwC, are understood to have advised the CFCB that Aabar and Etisalat were “related parties” to City because Mansour was the chairman of the investment funds which owned them. After further research Uefa was also advised that Etihad should be considered a related sponsor because of relationships of Mansour’s with members of the extended ruling family involved in the airline.City have strenuously rejected the conclusion that Etihad or the other two companies are related to City under the rules, arguing Uefa needed to show Mansour had substantial influence over their management, not just that he was the chairman of the funds owning them.Uefa is understood to have asked specialist sponsorship consultants to consider whether the money being paid to City by the Abu Dhabi companies was “fair value”. The Etihad deal is thought not to have been considered too excessive.In the ultimate settlement agreed with Uefa City committed “not to seek to improve” the value of two of the secondary sponsorships, which were not named, and Uefa is thought to have agreed not to press the argument that the companies are related.In relation to transfer fees the consultants added £31m to City’s deficit after rejecting allowances City had claimed for the cost of players signed before June 2010. The rules allowed a club to take off the wages of players signed before FFP was introduced but not the transfer fees.City are understood to have argued fiercely that despite Uefa issuing guidance that such annual accounting for transfer fees, known as amortisation, was not an allowance for FFP, the rules did not exclude it.A further £28m was put on to the club’s deficit by Uefa’s consultants regarding the formation in January 2013 of two companies, City Football Services and City Football Marketing. The companies were to provide resources including scouting, analysis and marketing to the group of clubs worldwide which Sheikh Mansour was intending to buy. City submitted that the club had in effect sold the companies, receiving approximately £11m for each, and that the companies had taken around £6m of staff costs off the club’s payroll.City argued strongly that this was a legitimate way of accounting for the companies but the CFCB’s consultants are understood to have concluded that it should not be allowed.Under a settlement with Uefa City undertook to repay €20m from the 2013-14 Champions League revenues, have a European squad limit of 21, constrain transfer spending, not increase their wage bill until 2016 and make a maximum €30m loss for 2014 and 2015. City’s chairman, Khaldoon al-Mubarak, made clear publicly that he disagreed with Uefa and the settlement but argued that given the club’s success they would comply with the break-even rules after 2014.Etihad, Etisalat, Aabar and the Abu Dhabi Tourism and Culture Authority did not respond to emailed questions from the  about the sponsorship contracts. Etihad has previously stated that the City sponsorship is the airline’s “sole liability and responsibility,” and that it “continues to deliver important ongoing and accumulative returns on our investments”.Uefa declined to comment in response to any questions about the 2014 assessment and settlement, or the current proceedings.A spokesperson for City said: “The 2014 settlement agreement resolved all open matters between the parties and was based on comprehensive information disclosure. The settlement agreement contains confidentiality provisions that prevent Manchester City from commenting on both the agreement and the investigation that it settled.“It continues to be our position that we will not be providing any comment on out-of-context materials. The attempt to damage the club’s reputation is organised and clear.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dab10d1b583788a343c3b6bbadd42eabbf3713ca/0_88_3416_2050/master/3416.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1342645bc965d3166183969bf2c324ba","title":"manchester united burnley premier league match report","story":"Burnley have a famous first win at Manchester United since 1962 and Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side must again regroup somehow. This was a defeat that spoke of their deep callowness and their inability to turn possession into goals.Burnley were sharper at the business end of the pitch, leaving United to rue a chance to close the gap to fourth-placed Chelsea to three points. Instead the deficit is six and United’s one-step forward, one-step back form continues.During a torrid evening there were anti-Glazer and anti-Ed Woodward chants from a Stretford End seriously disgruntled at the owners and executive vice-chairman. There were songs in support of Solskjær but the bottom line is that this was a new nadir in a rocky season.Solskjær had spoken of bouncing back from Sunday’s defeat at Liverpool and a slick move involving Andreas Pereira, Anthony Martial and Juan Mata ended with a Fred shot during a bright start. But, really, this was the first sign of United’s lack of bite. Daniel James slipped in along the left and won a corner. Next Brandon Williams switched the ball to Aaron Wan-Bissaka from the same corridor, whose cross deserved better control from Pereira.As they did in last month’s reverse fixture United were controlling the ball and, apparently, the contest. Sean Dyche’s men seemed content to sit deep and back themselves to defend better than United could attack.When Solskjær’s side picked up the pace Burnley struggled but this only occurred sporadically. The only peril United were in at this juncture was of complacency but when Mata then Fred took aim at Nick Pope’s goal they seemed to be up to the task.Moments later they were warned, though, in what was a dress rehearsal for Burnley’s opener. Chris Wood was able to take aim following a free-kick punted into United’s area by Dwight McNeil which was headed on by Ben Mee. While the No 9 could not score, David de Gea was left furious at his defence, whose aerial vulnerability led to Liverpool’s first goal at Anfield at the weekend.There was an equal lack of focus when Mata hit a shot from close range against his other leg: a surprise from a technically accomplished footballer. Far better was when Wan-Bissaka once more crossed the ball in and James rose, but his header was tipped over by Pope. Then, Nemanja Matic’s diagonal ball was allowed to run past by Mata and suddenly Martial had the goal before him. But a heavy touch allowed Charlie Taylor to intervene and so the Frenchman spurned the game’s clearest chance.Burnley were about to strike with a route-one special. Ashley Westwood pinged in a free-kick from halfway, Mee beat Matic to the header and Wood finished first-time past De Gea. Having been on the ropes here was a classic one-two counter that had Burnley fans gleefully singing about “anti-football”.By the interval there had been the first angry chants from the home fans and the manager had serious work to do. Solskjær reacted by replacing the misfiring Pereira with the 18-year-old striker Mason Greenwood. He then saw Williams take out Mee who inadvertently felled De Gea. The latter two were able to recover but the question was whether United could find a spark that had so far been missing in front of goal.The answer would prove to be a resounding no. Burnley were confident: Taylor and Jack Cork exchanged passes near United’s right corner flag, hemming them in. The sense was that having gone ahead the Clarets would fight ever harder to keep their opponents out.James has not scored since August and has struggled to be a creative factor all season. The latest illustration came when he breached Burnley’s backline only to produce an aimless pass that ultimately led to an easy clearance.There was nothing simple about Burnley’s second goal from Jay Rodriguez. With Harry Maguire off the pace – not for the first time in a United shirt – the striker fashioned a one-two with Wood before firing in a finish that rifled past De Gea at his near-post and ricocheted in off the bar. Cut to Solskjær rooted to his seat and the sense that United were slipping into disarray.“Stand up if you hate Glazers” chanted the Stretford End. On the pitch a Greenwood turn drew a yellow card for Taylor before Solskjær introduced Luke Shaw and Jesse Lingard for Williams and James. Despite a few shots and a disallowed Shaw goal, United’s lack of ruthlessness told in the end.Next up for Solskjær is an FA Cup fourth-round tie against either Watford or Tranmere Rovers on Sunday afternoon. They dare not lose that match, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8206c336e3aa54a1bc8026f09495cc8885df023/305_244_4561_2737/master/4561.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=168bca339dc060581c4fec20feecae24","title":"spurs norwich premier league match report","story":"The best anyone can say of this Tottenham performance is that it was a winning one and had the effect of putting an unhappy run to bed. They had not scored a league goal in open play since Dele Alli’s winner against Brighton on Boxing Day so it was to some relief that the same player moved that conversation along.However, for long periods it looked like being the sole redeeming feature: they did not deserve to beat a Norwich side who belied their position at the bottom and merited at least a draw.That did not escape the attention of a home crowd that showed audible frustration at a largely insipid night’s work. Norwich had equalised through Teemu Pukki’s penalty and were threatening more when Giovani Lo Celso, Spurs’ best player, slipped in Alli on the right-hand side of the area. The resulting cross-shot ricocheted off Christoph Zimmermann and looped up towards the one place Norwich could ill afford. Son Heung-min, standing virtually on the goalline at the far post, nodded in the winner that will not make it into the end-of-career scrapbook and peace could break out from the brink of small-scale mutiny.“How can we change the game? With the family spirit, the family character and desire,” José Mourinho said, referencing a general fatigue among his players and a lack of attacking options on the bench. “The 1-1 was obviously a bit scary for everybody connected with us. We didn’t want to lose points but then the reaction was very good. I saw players really tired but going over their limits to try to give us the points.”Whatever earned Spurs the win, nobody could attribute it to superior technique or cohesion. After surviving two close efforts from Érik Lamela early on it was Norwich who imposed those qualities for much of the night. A typically slick interplay with Todd Cantwell offered Pukki the kind of opportunity he usually gobbles up but this time the striker sidefooted wide, ensuring Hugo Lloris was not extended after returning ahead of schedule from his elbow injury.Alli promptly delivered at a time when Spurs were toiling, although Norwich should never have offered the chance. They had cleared their lines after a dangerous burst from Serge Aurier only for Cantwell to be dispossessed, ultimately allowing Son to tee up Aurier for a cross Alli finished on the run.Cantwell had a fine game beyond that aberration but diced with danger shortly after half-time when he slid in zealously to win possession and, in the follow-through, felled Lamela. He survived two minutes of VAR investigation and a booking sufficed moments later he inadvertently caught Harry Winks after the midfielder had blocked his effort and the outcome will have consequences for Spurs. Winks had to be substituted after sustaining an ankle injury the good news was that he was able to depart the stadium in trainers and Mourinho said the problem was “not a crazy one, hopefully weeks and not months”.The tension increased when Pukki squeezed his 70th-minute penalty, whose award was confirmed by VAR after Ryan Sessegnon clipped Max Aarons, past Lloris.Christian Eriksen’s introduction had been met with a few boos and they grew louder when he knocked an attempted pass out of play. The manner of his long goodbye is helping no one. Those jeers were aimed more widely when Cantwell shot over after another slick Norwich attack but, almost in the next breath, they became roars when Son converted against the run of play.“We won’t give up, we will try until the last to work on this little miracle,” said Daniel Farke, whose team is arguably one of the best in recent memory to be six points adrift of safety.

From Assassin’s Creed to the Super Mario Bros movie, the result is usually a compromised monstrosity, ignorant of the source material and quickly disowned by the studios, directors and actors responsible for it. There have been exceptions – Detective Pikachu was weird but fine and the Resident Evil films have their fans. But films based on games are usually a mess. Have licensing managers been looking at the wrong screen the whole time?The show’s makers have said the TV series is based more closely on the original fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski than on the games, but let’s be honest: it wasn’t the books that got this series commissioned. The Witcher video game series has sold more than 40m copies worldwide, and Henry Cavill’s portrayal of lead character Geralt, who travels the mythical landscape slaughtering demonic beasts for cash, is highly influenced by the game’s depiction. There are clear nods, too, to the game’s fandom, most obviously in the bathing scene, whose game manifestation became a staple of The Witcher 3’s marketing and memes.Fans’ reactions to the series have been mixed, but they’re clearly watching, which raises the possibility of further video game to television adaptations in the future. In a lot of ways, now that channels such as Amazon and Netflix have the capacity and expertise to commission such projects, video games make much more sense in TV than in film. Narrative games are a long-form medium, with stories that  tens, or even hundreds of hours of play. They feature many characters and plotlines that weave and intersect, often across sequential titles – a tough call for a movie studio looking to put out a 90-minute adaptation.Certainly, movies have successfully translated long novels – The Godfather, Misery and Great Expectations spring to mind – but those books have usually been built in ways amenable to film translation, with clear three- or five-act structures and steady, focused character arcs. But game stories don’t work like that. They are very long and highly episodic, split into self-contained levels, quests or missions, the overriding story accompanied by dozens of side-quests and branchings. This is much more analogous to TV. The writing process behind epic narrative games also matches the TV system – with a team of writers working collaboratively on overarching plotlines, but also inidually on separate episodes or elements.So will The Witcher pave the way for other big video game TV adaptations? It has certainly demonstrated that the storytelling format of games can be replicated. Each episode advances the wider story of Geralt, the sorceress Yennefer and princess Ciri, but also involves its own side-plots, characters and locations. Scripts, structures and narrative models built for the games can be translated.Ubisoft has its history-ning drama Assassins Creed in the works for TV treatment and a Halo TV series, based on the Xbox sci-fi shooter, is in production. And there are persistent rumours that Netflix is considering a Resident Evil series. But there is plenty more material, now that video game stories are maturing and ersifying, and appealing to wider audiences. Blockbuster titles such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption and the forthcoming Cyberpunk 2077 are the names that get batted around, but the success of modest, character-based dramas such as Life is Strange, Her Story and Firewatch show that video game TV wouldn’t necessarily have to involve mega budgets and cutting-edge CGI effects.Television adaptation would also allow for a more interesting interplay between the interactive and linear versions of a narrative. In Japan, there has been a constant cross-pollination between anime and video games for more than 30 years, with prominent titles crossing between the two formats, interacting and influencing each other. The extended Marvel universe has shown how effective cross-platform storytelling can be, with films, comics and games all combining to explore plots, events and character developments.Hollywood will not stop making video game movies: we have Uncharted, Minecraft and Monster Hunter on the way, among many others, so don’t panic. But perhaps what The Witcher has shown is that as television evolves, as game players ersify, and as the games themselves tell more complex, long-arc human stories, these two media are much more comfortably aligned."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2fe863e1953943bc4f3ba43a1a0b3231ae136cce/0_182_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=adb0d49b19e1da0936bd1a62b6b545eb","title":"i was living a secret life the agonising rise of women gamblers","story":"The number of women who report a gambling problem has been rising at double the rate of men. It is used as an escape from stress and pain – but the debt can be catastrophicNancy gambled away the £3,000 her father had saved up for his own funeral. It’s the thing she feels most ashamed of having done during her four-year addiction to online gambling. At the time, however, she barely thought twice about what she had done.“Female gambling addicts are just as bad as men. We will get money wherever we can and gamble it all away immediately,” she says. “The extraordinary thing is that during my addiction, no one suspected a thing. I was gambling online for hours every day. I’d sit down on the settee with my phone in the early evening and the next thing I knew, it was 3am. I hadn’t moved except to press the same button again and again to work the slots. But my bank account would be empty.”Nancy would never have gone into a bookies or an arcade. “I would never have even begun betting if I hadn’t been able to do it secretly, on my phone,” she says. “I had hundreds of different online gambling accounts. When I ran out of credit on one, I’d just go to another site and open a new one. I had five credit cards, multiple loans and loads of high-interest payday loans. I was entirely enslaved by gambling.”By the time Nancy sought help she had spent £75,000 on gambling and was £25,000 in debt. She used up all her savings, wages and any other money she could lay her hands on. “It’s impossible for a rationally healthy person to understand, but I was in this bubble and couldn’t escape,” she says. “It was all I thought about: gambling and how to pay back my debts. I remember one Wednesday, getting home from work and crying and shaking in the kitchen because I knew I had to gamble. I was a slave to whatever game I was playing.”Despite her obsession, Nancy didn’t show a single outward sign of not being entirely in control. Even today, only her two best friends know what she has been through. She can’t bear to tell her new husband. “I’m a very intelligent, sensible, caring person so it’s hard to say why I did what I did. But the fact it can happen to me means it could happen to anyone.”Eventually, Nancy went to see a health worker about a different issue and broke down. “All it took was for the counsellor to ask: ‘What do you do for fun?’ and it was all bought home to me: where had I gone? Why was I doing these things?” She went to an NHS counsellor and GamCare and is now in recovery.Ian Semel leads Breakeven, a charity supporting gambling addicts in the UK. He believes that the latest figures hide the true number of female problem gamblers, because so few reach out for help. “There’s such a stigma for women gamblers,” he says. “Society has very clear gender roles for women and expectations that they’ll be the caregivers.” To breach this risks “judgment, exposure, shame and guilt”, he says.Liz Karter is a therapist specialising in gambling addiction in women. She says the way women gamble is very different to men. “At Gamblers Anonymous meetings, the men were telling women they weren’t proper gamblers because they weren’t doing it for the rush and the winnings,” she says. Instead, “women gamble to escape, soothe, reduce stress and distract themselves”.“For women, gambling soothes them and numbs pain,” says Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, founder and director of the National Problem Gambling Clinic. “Sometimes they begin gambling as a result of bereavement or because they’re a carer for someone they love, and it’s an overwhelming responsibility for them,” she says. “Many women won’t seek help because they’re afraid of having their children taken away. Many have embezzled or stolen money and fear prison if they’re discovered,” she adds.Typically, women begin gambling later in life than men, but their problems develop more quickly – which experts believe may be because they tend to choose quick, high-stakes games such as online slots and bingo.Kerri Nicholls, 37, had never gambled before she and her partner started making £1 online bets on the football games they loved to watch together. “It began as a way to make the games more interesting,” she says.Then the site they used gave her £200 of free bets (“Except, of course, those bets turned out not to be free they came with financial strings,” she says). “It was fun at first but then my partner went back to university and I was stuck, in a not-great job, in a not-great new flat. Because my partner was at uni, I felt I needed to earn more money for us and gambling seemed like a good way to do that,” she says.Within six months of making her first £1 bet, Kerri was gambling daily. “It had stopped being fun by then. I was chasing my losses. It had become an emotional thing. I was addicted,” she says. Kerri was betting increasing sums of money and suddenly found herself seriously in debt. “Having gone through counselling, I now know that I was using gambling to escape my other problems,” she says. “I felt neglected and gambling replaced what I was missing. I could invest my time in it and distract myself from my thoughts and difficulties.”The addiction lasted five years, cost her £50,000 and was, she says, “literally a 24-hour thing. I was setting my phone to wake me up at night with notifications of matches being played around the world that I’d bet on. My partner, sleeping right next to me, didn’t notice a thing.“I don’t know how I still had a job. I used to get up from my desk constantly to take my phone outside and gamble. I used to gamble on my phone while sitting opposite my dad in restaurants.“It made me feel very lonely. I was living a separate, secret life that completely obsessed me and it seemed no one cared enough to even notice. That made me feel even more alone,” she says. “I’m mostly ashamed of the lies I told everyone. I’m a very honest person and it was scary that I could lie so well. They just rolled off my tongue.”When Kerri first tried to stop gambling, she managed only six weeks. “I thought that once I admitted it, it would get better. My dad paid off my £25,000 debt, but because I hadn’t addressed the underlying issues, him clearing my debt just meant I could start again. In no time at all, I had doubled the debt he had cleared.”Kerri was close to killing herself after a row over gambling with her mother, her partner and her partner’s mother. “I felt my life was crumbling around me. I had had thoughts about different ways of ending things a few days before. That day, my feelings of hopelessness escalated. I was in a daze. I didn’t want to be here any more. I couldn’t see how things could be turned around.”She was sitting on the edge of a canal when an elderly lady stopped and talked to her. She asked if Kerri was OK and it made something “snap back to normal” in her head. Kerri contacted GamCare and the gambling-addiction charity Gordon Moody Association and arranged weekly, remote counselling by video link. She attended Gamblers Anonymous meetings every week.“I’ve never gambled since,” she says. “I’ve handed my credit cards to my mum, got a phone with no internet access and stopped watching sports. The most important thing was to start talking to people about it. I’ve become very open and reflective. I no longer bottle things up.”Kerri wants to urge other women gamblers to ask for help. “To any gamblers out there, I’d say they should talk to someone. Ask for help because help is available – and it really does work.”Some names have been changed.

That means that we don’t know whether they work, what’s in them, or even how they should be cleaned.Online, it seems that a buyer’s good intentions (in this case, a desire to be more environmentally friendly, thrifty and less wasteful) can be easily exploited, because Google is the place where people with a lack of information go to find things. It’s not just Google: anyone who doesn’t live under a rock will have also noticed the endless stream of vaginal eggs, candles and other nonsense coming out of Gwyneth Paltrow lately. So as a service to you, we are correcting the record on some of the worst vaginal products out there.Vaginal tightening sticks can be bought in online stores such as Amazon, where you can also buy fake hymens – so basically, don’t use Amazon.These sticks promise to give you the perfect “toned, narrow, tight vagina”. That’s right, in 2020, focusing on what’s inside means goodbye toned abs, hello slender vagina. Which is why vagina weight-training is also now a thing.Vaginas come in a variety of sizes and shapes, and the tightness of one’s vagina has nothing to do with how much pleasure can be derived from it. If you really want to tighten your vagina, kegel exercises are free.There is an array of weed products for the vagina that can be found on the internet, including but not limited to: weed tampons, weed lube and weed vibrators. People often say that smoking weed can help people to relax and eases pain, heck, it can even be fun, apparently.But in news that will shock the whole internet: just because something is nice doesn’t mean you have to put it in your vagina. While the compound CBD that is found in weed has been shown to help with some chronic pain, this does not automatically translate to working when put in the vagina. So please, stop.People order at-home creams, go into spas, and get laser treatment to lighten the skin around their vaginas. Needless to say, it’s bad for you: bleaching your vaginal area can result in irritation, inflammation and infections like thrush and bacterial vaginosis.In case you didn’t know, oak galls are a little ball of bark created when a wasp deposits its larvae into an oak tree. Which leads to the natural question: why shouldn’t I put that in my vagina? Some con artists online have taken to convincing women to boil up oak gall into a paste and insert it, causing it to dry and tighten.According to gynecologist Dr Jen Gunter, drying out the vagina increases your chance of getting abrasions during sex, destroys the protective mucous layer in your vagina, and can cause havoc with its good bacteria. In a blogpost on oak galls, she writes: “This is a dangerous practice with real potential to harm. Here’s a pro-tip, if something burns when you apply it to the vagina it is generally bad for the vagina.”Not just that, but the idea that a dry, tight vagina is desirable is a frankly depressing sexual idea, and misinformation of the worst, most misogynistic kind.Most experts will tell you to avoid washing your vagina with soap, and yet there are rows of shelves in stores stacked with vaginal douching products. The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, and soap often disturbs its natural balance. “Vaginal pH is maintained by lactobacilli. Soaps, cleansers and douches will only hurt this bacteria, so they are all bad pH-wise,” Gunter wrote in a recent New York Times piece.Not only that, this disruption can result in bacterial infections such as bacterial vaginosis. Among other things, bacterial vaginosis can result in an unpleasant smell – probably the last thing that someone buying a vaginal cleaning product is hoping for."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8bf1a3a3b842f56e5d495187fb32c3103bbdd40/0_191_1892_1134/master/1892.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7b8ce527504d93045afc067a6b7c046f","title":"bereaved parents entitled two weeks paid leave work uk jacks law","story":"Jack’s Law, for parents who lose a child under 18, will come into force in April, says governmentParents who suffer the loss of a child under the age of 18 will be entitled to two weeks of statutory paid leave from work, the government has announced.The new legal right, due to come into force from April, is the most generous offer on parental bereavement pay and leave in the world, said ministers.The regulations will be known as Jack’s Law, in memory of Jack Herd, whose mother, Lucy, has been campaigning on the issue since the 23-month-old drowned in a pond in 2010. She found out the law only allowed Jack’s father three days off work to grieve, one of which had to be for the funeral.The business secretary, Andrea Leadsom, said: “There can be few worse experiences in life than the loss of a child and I am proud that this government is delivering Jack’s Law, making us the first country in the world to do so. When it takes effect, Jack’s Law will be a fitting testament to the tireless efforts of Lucy Herd, alongside many charities, to give parents greater support.”Herd said: “In the immediate aftermath of a child dying, parents have to cope with their own loss, the grief of their wider family, including other children, as well as a vast amount of administrative paperwork and other arrangements. A sudden or accidental death may require a postmortem or inquest, there is a funeral to arrange and there are many other organisations to contact, from schools to benefit offices.“When I started this campaign 10 years ago after the death of my son Jack, I always hoped that a positive change would happen in his memory. Knowing that nearly 10 years of campaigning has helped create Jack’s Law is the most wonderful feeling, but it is bittersweet at the same time.”Parents will be able to take the leave as either a single block of two weeks, or as two separate blocks of one week each taken at different times across the first year after their child’s death.The shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, said: “Labour has supported the proposal for parental bereavement leave from its inception, and we welcome this announcement. As set out in our workers’ rights manifesto, Labour is calling for bereavement leave for those who have lost a close family member.”Matthew Percival of the business organisation CBI said: “The loss of any child is unimaginably difficult. Offering this flexibility to bereaved parents is something businesses absolutely welcome. Giving time for families to grieve without the worry of what’s going on at work is fundamental.”Mike Cherry, the chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: “We’ve engaged with the government to ensure Jack’s Law works for both employees and small businesses, making it a day one right as it absolutely should be. It would be fantastic to see this legislation improved even further with the creation of a parental bereavement allowance for the self-employed.”Susan Clews, the chief executive of the conciliation service Acas, said: “This new legal right will allow eligible working parents paid time off to help them grieve and will help employers who manage staff that are experiencing the distressing loss of a loved one.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/53667137ce9512e96784cfb040c18b23320f6d05/0_169_5067_3040/master/5067.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dc4ce4a7801cb3081511ee8908f63752","title":"marks spencer yule log best before use by","story":"Confusion over what the ‘best before’ label and the ‘use by’ label meanOn 28 December I bought a £15 Yule Log cake from M\u0026ampS.

Lord Dubs called the move “bitterly disappointing”.The amendment, passed in the Lords on Tuesday, was rejected in the Commons by 342 votes to 254. All those who voted against were Conservatives.“What could be more humane than asking that unaccompanied child refugees stranded in Europe be able to join relatives in this country?” Dubs said in a tweet.It was among five amendments to the EU withdrawal agreement bill passed by peers which have now been overturned. The bill puts the government’s Brexit deal into law. There were also amendments on EU workers legally residing in the UK getting physical proof of their right to remain a commitment to the UK parliament not legislating for devolved matters without the consent of the devolved legislature affected and two relating to the power of courts to depart from European court of justice rulings.Labour’s Diane Abbott, the shadow home secretary, said the government was “attempting to shirk its moral and legal obligation to child refugees and their families”.She said: “The Tory manifesto just a month ago claimed they would continue to support refugees, and even that they would increase that support. This is a shameful betrayal of those promises.”Stuart McDonald, the SNP’s immigration spokesperson, said: “Rather than stepping up and playing its role in addressing the refugee crisis, the toxic Tory government has instead lurched to the extremes and closed the door on some of the most vulnerable children in the world.”Dubs, who came to the UK as a Kindertransport child refugee after fleeing Prague in 1939, has urged the government to enshrine, after Brexit, the principle of family reunion for child refugees fleeing conflict .Responding later in the Lords, Dubs said he noted government promises to make a statement on the issue in the next couple of months, saying ministers should explain how they would make sure the system was ready for the start of 2021, when the Brexit transition period ends.While the measure was originally in the bill, it was removed after December’s election victory for Boris Johnson, with the government insisting it would stick to the commitment but did not see the need to put it into a Brexit bill.“The government’s policy is unchanged. Delivering on it will not require legislation,” the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, told MPs as he explained to the Commons why ministers opposed the amendment.“Primary legislation cannot deliver the best outcomes for these children as it cannot guarantee that we will reach an agreement. And that is why this is ultimately a matter which must be negotiated with the EU, and the government is committed to seeking the best possible outcome in these negotiations.”Barclay came under pressure from MPs to explain his reasoning. Yvette Cooper, the Labour former chair of the home affairs committee, said she did not understand the active decision to remove the measure from the bill.“There’s loads of things in legislation through the decades that the government says it agrees with and so it says it’s not needed, but it doesn’t remove it from the statute book,” she said. “And that is what makes us all suspicious.”Barclay replied: “The reason is the purpose of this legislation is to implement in domestic law the international agreement we’ve reached.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c04e278c9e78b2d7edf41ad6ba93d1281e5461ad/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32d3aa46cf04022679bd293875a9a2e8","title":"has a member of your family applied for a different eu nationality","story":"We would like to hear from you if someone in your family has applied for another EU nationality because of BrexitHas a member of your family applied for a different EU nationality because they are resident in another member state and want to guarantee their rights, or because they have a birth right they never bothered with before Brexit?If so, we want to hear from you.

The poll includes leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour constituencies, such as Rother Valley in South Yorkshire, where voters backed the Tories in December for the first time in the seat’s 101-year history.All but three of those surveyed said they were supporting Starmer or Nandy and the vast majority expressed strong reservations about Long-Bailey, a frontrunner who is backed by allies of Corbyn.The endorsement of dozens of Labour council leaders is a significant boost for Nandy, whose polling lags behind Starmer and Long-Bailey. Jess Phillips had been a second choice for several local leaders before she withdrew from the race on Tuesday. None of those surveyed backed Emily Thornberry.Long-Bailey’s campaign will not be surprised by her relative unpopularity with senior local figures, who were in many cases sceptical of Corbyn’s leadership from the beginning and some of whom have been in place since the Blair-Brown era.Starmer has emerged as the early frontrunner in the contest after securing the backing of two major trade unions and 12 constituency Labour parties (CLPs). The backing from senior figures in leave-voting areas may come as a surprise given his vocal support for a second referendum before the general election, when he described Labour as the party of remain.Graeme Miller, the leader of Sunderland city council, one of the most heavily leave-voting areas in the country, said his “gut instinct” was to back Starmer as the candidate that would appeal most to the public. “My focus has been looking at what we need, not what the membership wants. What the public will vote for has to be the focus,” he said.• The “red wall” was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east. The origin of the term is unclear but some believe it was first used in 2019.•\u0026nbsp Thirty-three Labour leaders spoke to the  and all but three supported Sir Keir Starmer or Lisa Nandy to become the party’s next leader. All of the 33 local authority areas voted for Brexit in 2016.• Of those who would disclose their least favourite candidate, all but two said Rebecca Long-Bailey. The other votes were for Jess Phillips and Emily Thornberry.• Labour leaders in six of the 10 longest-held Labour seats that fell to the Tories said they were backing Starmer or Nandy. They are the Labour leaders in Rotherham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Wigan, Bassetlaw, North East Lincolnshire and Bolsover. The other four leaders had not responded to requests for comment.Many leaders felt Starmer was the most credible and competent candidate and would appeal to a broad church of voters, praising his legal background and clear public speaking.Those who supported Nandy praised her ability to connect with voters outside the metropolitan bubble, particularly in post-industrial towns where people have felt left behind. Many said they were impressed by the Wigan MP’s forthright assessment of Labour’s future, which included warning fellow MPs that the party must change or “we will die and we will deserve to”.While Long-Bailey may be popular among a large section of Labour members, dozens of local party leaders expressed concern that she would simply continue the “Corbyn project”. The Salford and Eccles MP was felt by many to have failed to properly reflect on the reasons behind Labour’s worst election result since 1935.There was also concern among council leaders that the leadership contest had been too heavily focused on big cities instead of the provinces, where many Labour voters broke a decades-long tradition to back Boris Johnson’s party last month.Some said the candidates needed to “get out more” and reconnect with voters others complained that the main hustings debates were closed off from the public – with only party members eligible to attend – and hosted mainly in large cities such as Liverpool, Glasgow and Cardiff.“I’m disappointed that the Labour party still doesn’t seem to be learning from the fact that we need to be getting out into towns not just cities,” said Kyle Robinson, the Labour opposition leader on Newcastle-under-Lyme council, where the Tories won majority control in 2017.“The Labour heartlands are where we need to be going and not just inviting Labour members but inviting members of the public so they can ask questions of the people who want to be our next leader.”Fewer than 20 CLPs have so far declared their support in the leadership contest, the winner of which will be announced on 4 April.Starmer and Nandy have already made it through to the final ballot. Starmer won the backing of Unison, the UK’s largest trade union, and the environmental affiliate Sera, while Nandy secured the support of the NUM and GMB unions, and the Chinese for Labour affiliate. Under Labour’s leadership rules, candidates must have a certain amount of support from CLPs or affiliates (unions or socialist societies) to be sure of a place on the final ballot."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4a5a2503da23d7813c5b07a934405b7b9bee7b11/0_142_5299_3180/master/5299.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=915188379bb9f0785b4b16c9273de0de","title":"nandy takes on the trolls first piers then boris","story":"Could the Labour leadership hopeful rouse the PM to take the parliamentary process seriously?It’s been quite the 24 hours for Lisa Nandy. First her rival Jess Phillips pulled out of the Labour leadership contest and gave Nandy her backing. Then she picked up her third union nomination, ensuring she would make it through to the final ballot. But best of all she gave Piers Morgan a kicking on Good Morning Britain. If that doesn’t improve her poll ratings, nothing will. Most of the country has long been praying for a saviour to rise from these streets and knock him off his perch.Poor Piers. He just can’t get over the fact that Meghan Markle never followed him on Twitter, even when he was in full Megfest toady mode. Nor can he stand it that Laurence Fox has stolen his thunder as this week’s go-to bloke for making an arse of himself. So although only this week Morgan had promised not to bring up Meghan and Harry again, he couldn’t resist the opportunity for more self-harm. Any attention is better than none. Like Boris Johnson, his greatest fear is being forgotten.There was nothing at all racist about any of the royal media coverage, he said, reverting to rant auto-pilot. And he was fed up with professional PC wokes like Nandy saying it was. It was just that Meghan was a jumped-up, ungrateful LA princess who didn’t know her place and had disrespected Her Maj. Worse still, she had disrespected him. Which was unforgivable. And if she were ever to follow him on Twitter, he would make a point of blocking her. So what did Nandy have to say about that?Initially not much, as she had been under the impression she was on the show to discuss the Labour leadership. But recovering her poise, she first pointed out she had never said that all the coverage was racist, and then asked him “How on earth would you know?” about the prejudice people of colour experienced. Maybe it might be a good idea to keep quiet for once and listen to what they were saying. Piers turned puce and terminated the interview as soon as indecently possible.Over in the Commons, most Labour MPs were praying for Nandy – or someone like her – to take on Boris at prime minister’s questions. Anyone but Jeremy Corbyn would do, in fact, as he has already been airbrushed out of history. By himself just as much as by everyone else. Only his irrelevance is now visible. Even at its best, PMQs is a marginal spectator sport – a weekly rallying cry for the parliamentary troops: now it’s a near total irrelevance.There was a time when Boris might at least have spent 30 minutes preparing for PMQs. That’s as close as he ever gets to due diligence. Now though, he just swans in, straight out of bed, and wings it. He can’t even be bothered to hide his contempt for Corbyn and parliament. He’s in charge and can do what he likes.The Labour leader began by asking a perfectly reasonable question about the take-home pay of workers on universal credit. Boris clearly didn’t have a clue, but rather than go through the niceties of bullshitting, merely said that Corbyn should try asking different questions.It got worse as Boris all but started talking over the Labour leader. No, he wasn’t going to change universal credit because it had been very effective in streamlining some people into death, with Iain Duncan Smith as undertaker-in-chief. Labour just had to shut up and get used to its futility. It should save its breath instead of whining about poor people and child refugees. Nobody cared.“Answer the question,” Corbyn begged plaintively. Boris merely sneered. Why should he? Talk to the hand. He ended by just repeating a few lazy lies about 40 hospitals and 50,000 nurses that he doesn’t even believe himself.This was Johnson at his very worst. Both boorish and bored. As if he’s only happy when there’s some edge and he’s on the verge of self-destruction. After all, it’s not just Labour that’s supine. The Tory benches are stuffed with nonentities too.Boris occasionally tried to sound interested in something a backbencher had to say, but he’s a man who can’t conceal his insincerity. Not least when being served up a pathetic softball from someone like Alex Chalk. The voters of Cheltenham must already be regretting re-electing him. The only thing to vaguely disconcert Boris was Tory MP Caroline Nokes asking him “to pull out his plunger”.Just to underline the utter pointlessness of PMQs, Johnson left the chamber to troll the nation by tweeting that he would be having his own Facebook People’s PMQs later in the afternoon. Send in your questions, he said. And some people did. Several wanted to know where the Russia report was, and how many children he had. Strangely these questions didn’t come up. The only ones to make the cut were from a D Cummings of Chillingham Castle.Throughout the 15 minutes of narcissistic indulgence, Boris’s hands moved alarmingly. It looked suspiciously as if he was playing with himself. He was certainly playing with the country. Just a month after the election, he’s already taking us all for fools. Perhaps we are."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/047e03eb9d1385e223b99b550f11dcf871b2c176/0_0_3936_2362/master/3936.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6ef0735ec1677b56820749b44cfbcfe4","title":"labour leadership momentum survive","story":"As part of our Inside Labour series, we look at how the grassroots movement will fare after party’s disastrous election defeatThere are two stand-out memories of the winter general election for Charlie Macnamara. First, the 25-year-old Momentum member’s data sheets melting to illegible shreds in the rain while knocking on doors. Second, the moment the exit poll came through after a 14-hour campaigning shift in Stevenage.“Six of us were out all day. Then we walked through the door of candidate Jill Borcherd’s house and it was devastating. To find out the moment you walk through the door … we were shocked,” he said.“We didn’t want to bother her so we got back in the car and had a long drive back to London, looking on Twitter as the results came in.” As a grassroots group set up explicitly to support Jeremy Corbyn, Momentum would always be challenged by an election loss and the ushering in of a new leader. Momentum thrived on “Jezzmania”, Corbyn’s Glastonbury appearances and telegenic outdoor rallies that could be clipped by their savvy tech team to go viral. They have been hugely influential on policy, in effect fast-tracking the Green New Deal to the forefront of the manifesto.But with a new Labour leader in place in two months, the 40,000-strong organisation must decide what its future will be - if it is to survive at all. With its brand of leftwing politics rejected at the ballot box through Labour’s worst electoral defeat since 1935, the group is focusing on how to rebuild itself. So far, its attempt to stay relevant as the continuity Corbyn outfit has got off to a rocky start.A close ally of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, the Salford MP and shadow business secretary has been groomed as a potential leftwing contender for the top job.Pitch\u0026nbspPromising to champion “progressive patriotism”.The Wigan MP has built a reputation as a campaigner for her constituency and others like it, many of which have fallen to the Tories. A soft-left candidate, she resigned from the shadow cabinet in 2016 over Corbyn’s leadership and handling of the EU referendum.Pitch\u0026nbspWants to “bring Labour home” to voters that have abandoned the party in its traditional strongholds.Ambitious former director of public prosecutions has led the charge for remain in the shadow cabinet. He was instrumental in shifting Labour’s position towards backing a second referendumPitch\u0026nbspLaunched his campaign by highlighting how he has stood up for leftwing causes as a campaigning lawyer, and unveiled the slogan “Another Future is Possible”, arguing Labour can win again if we make the moral case for socialismThe shadow foreign secretary and MP in Islington South and Finsbury, she will have to fight allegations of being part of the “metropolitan elite”.Pitch\u0026nbspHas the political nous and strategic vision to reunite the party, gain the trust of the public, and can take on Johnson in parliament.Angry exchanges peppered Twitter this month when Momentum hastily organised a members’ ballot to decide who they should endorse for the leadership and deputy leadership. Just 5,000 members recommended the only choices on the ballot paper – the shadow business secretary, Rebecca Long-Bailey, and shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner.One furious member who has given hours of their time on the doorstep declared Momentum a “mess”.“Why wasn’t it an open ballot?” she said. “I’ll probably head back to the anti-war movement now. There’s other things I can do in politics. I’m not going to be as involved any more. People are worried about where it’s all going.”Writer and organiser Michael Chessum was among the high-profile Momentum activists who criticised the ballot.He tweeted: “Ludicrously, we only have one option for each position. This is a joke, and you should vote No on principle. (Even if, like me, you might end up voting for one of the chosen candidates).”While Momentum’s website reads “the fight goes on”, it is clear some members have justifiable fatigue, having spent the past two years as election foot soldiers. Even loyalists agree that the members, many of whom trudged through long winter nights in marginal seats, want to see change within the organisation.The fact founder Jon Lansman is part of Long-Bailey’s campaign team is not lost on activists. The centralisation of power around Lansman is nuanced and not always as the public see it, some activists say, but he remains an influential figure.A 62-year-old Labour veteran who joined the party in 1974 and worked for Labour icon Tony Benn during his deputy leadership campaign in the 1980s. Lansman served as director of operations for Corbyn’s leadership campaign. After Corbyn was elected as the leader of the Labour party in 2015, Lansman founded Momentum, a pro-Corbyn campaign group.Momentum, often described as a ‘party within a party’, has radically transformed the Labour party over the last four years. Local groups have challenged party orthodoxies and national membership rules, and fought to get their activists selected.“I don’t want the Labour party to become a faction fight,” Lansman said in a 2016 interview with the . “What I want is a level playing field. I want the Labour party to be able to have a democratic debate.” But in recent weeks, Lansman, and Momentum, are back in the news for being key figures behind another Labour party civil war.Lansman was behind the move to scrap Labour’s 40-year-old student wing last week, arguing the group needs reforming and had not paid its affiliation fees. Critics described the move as a cynical attempt to shut down a “moderate” wing of the party. Lansman also tabled a last-minute motion at the NEC on Friday night calling for Watson’s job to be scrapped. The motion was withdrawn after Corbyn intervened.The current structure, which has a National Coordinating Group at the top of the organisation that decides on major policy positions, has not always made members feel like it works for them. Activists complain about the “top-down” structure.Sophie Wilson, 24 – a councillor in Sheffield who stood as the Labour candidate for Rother Valley, which, at the election, went Tory for the first time since 1918 – said Momentum was invaluable in livening up the local Labour scene but it needed to change.She said: “A lot of the public think that Jon Lansman controls everything, but he’s not the person pulling the strings, it’s just that the structure is at fault.“It needs to consult with members more. Be more grassroots. It still is in some ways but it has morphed into this top-down thing which means that one or two people have a lot of power.”Setting up community centres in Labour heartlands could be one way of giving Momentum a sense of purpose in the five years of a majority government, she suggests.She likes the idea of taking over buildings earmarked for regeneration as part of the “meanwhile use” movement. In South Yorkshire the loss of the miners’ welfare clubs has been a huge blow and in coalfield communities Labour struggled to get the vote out. These centres could be a way of re-engaging with people long term.“There are a lot of lefties and left activism. There’s a strong history of trade unionism, but after the defeat we need to be looking at more community organising,” she said.• The “red wall” was a huge block of Labour-voting constituencies stretching from north Wales into Merseyside, through Greater Manchester along the Midlands and up to the north-east. The origin of the term is unclear but some believe it was first used in 2019.•\u0026nbsp Thirty-three Labour leaders spoke to the  and all but three supported Sir Keir Starmer or Lisa Nandy to become the party’s next leader.

They are the Labour leaders in Rotherham, Newcastle-under-Lyme, Wigan, Bassetlaw, North East Lincolnshire and Bolsover. The other four leaders had not responded to requests for comment.Charlie, a trade union campaigner who helped campaigning in Harrow East, Battersea and Putney in the general election, said Momentum’s strength was publishing a public-facing strategy in advance so members knew why they were knocking on doors – mirroring US Democrat Bernie Sanders’ transparency.“When we got to Putney, for example, people could explain why we were targeting this particular road and people had bothered to go through the data,” he said.He has no intention of turning away from the movement. “A lot of us went through a politicisation through the Corbyn period and I don’t think that’s going to go away.“One thing I’ve noticed is the Corbyn movement brought people together, different movements and campaigns. The Labour party was a pretty blunt tool coordinating that activity and Momentum hasn’t always done that as well as it could do, but you don’t want to go backwards.“But the National Coordinating Group isn’t working. There needs to be a place members can come together and plan at a variety of levels. New regional structures perhaps.”In a sign there is still enthusiasm, this past weekend dozens of Momentum activists met in Bradford to discuss mini-festivals planned under The World Transformed banner. Its main political, literary and arts festival held at the same time as the Labour party conference has been a huge success. The spin-off events are expected to attract 200-plus people in 20 locations.Momentum’s head office naturally remains optimistic about the future,with senior figures reluctant to signal a winding down. They are wedded to Long-Bailey and, like the activists, there is a feeling the organisation can do more to embed itself in local communities.Long-Bailey has likely returned the favour of winning Momentum’s endorsement with her announcement she would back open selections of MPs. The left see this as the best way of getting MPs in parliament who are most closely aligned with the membership’s view.A spokesman for the organisation said after the election result came through they were hugely disappointed, but “not for a minute” did they think about giving up.He said: “We always knew there would be no short cuts to socialism and the rise of the nationalist right as well as the huge crises of climate change and inequality only make our mission more urgent. Our movement has transformed Labour.”Immediate plans are pushing the Long-Bailey campaign and seeking more “member power” to help organisers, councillors and MPs in the future.Sophie, who quit her job the week before the election, thinks Momentum will keep going and successfully outlive Corbyn’s leadership.“There’s a place for it now more than ever in terms of where we need to be putting our efforts. Momentum is barking up the right tree. I’m sad to see Corbyn go, but now we can move on to the next thing and it will be even better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b80d9020e4bf71f517ef973b5f79339c7b5a0e22/468_400_3132_1879/master/3132.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4ac58ce5e42abb227bca4a7c0b8bc2a5","title":"have you encountered any precautionary measures for coronavirus","story":"If you’ve experienced additional measures while travelling or have any information, we’d like to hear from youPassengers who arrive at Heathrow from Wuhan in China will be asked to enter through a separate area as a precautionary measure to try and prevent the spread of coronavirus.

For Wordsworth it was shocks of passion that swiftly turned hair white.But while hair cannot lose its colour in an instant – at least not without help from a bottle of bleach – scientists at Harvard University have shown how stress can, over time, speed up the greying process.Ya-Chieh Hsu, a stem cell biologist, found that stress causes nerves involved in the fight-or-flight response to pump out a hormone which wipes out the stem cells used to make hair pigments.Because stress can be considered a form of accelerated ageing, the discovery has raised hopes for treatments that can slow down or even halt normal age-related greying. More importantly, it could shed light on how ageing depletes stem cells throughout the body, and perhaps point the way to general anti-ageing therapies.Prof Christopher Deppmann, a biologist at the University of Virginia who was not involved in the work, said he believed it had “profound implications” for how scientists think about stem cell biology, stress biology and potentially the ageing process.“Like any good study, it opens up at least as many questions as it answers, but it may represent an important stepping stone toward rationalising and developing pharmaceutical fountains of youth,” he said.The Harvard team made their discovery through a series of experiments that measured the effect of stress on the hair colour of mice. The animals were stressed over several days by being restrained for four hours a day, Monday to Friday, or through combinations of damp bedding, rapid changes to lighting and having their cages tilted.At first, the scientists suspected that stress triggered an immune attack on hair pigment-making cells, but ruled that out when they found that mice without immune cells still turned grey after episodes of stress. Next they considered cortisol, a hormone that rises in response to stress. This turned out to be another dead end: mice with no cortisol still developed grey hair.The researchers eventually found the culprit in a set of nerves that make up the sympathetic nervous system. The nerves, which prepare the body for action as part of the fight-or-flight response, reach into hair follicles in the skin, and it is here that they do their damage.Hair follicles contain a bulge that is home to a pool of stem cells. When a new hair is made, some of these stem cells turn into pigment-making ones called called melanocytes. A hair’s colour depends on the mix of light-absorbing melanin compounds that the melanocytes churn out.Tests showed that stress causes the sympathetic nervous system to pump a hormone called noradrenaline, or norepinephrine, into the hair follicle bulge. The sudden inrush of noradrenalin has an extraordinary effect. The hormone converts huge numbers of stem cells into melanocytes, but no sooner are they made than they begin to drift away from the follicle and break down. The next time the follicle tries to make a hair, there are few or no stem cells left to generate fresh pigment-producing cells.“Stress, through activation of the sympathetic nervous system, drives the loss of these melanocyte stem cells, the stem cells that are important in regenerating the pigment for the hair,” Hsusaid. “And once the reservoir has been depleted, that’s it.” The work is published in Nature.Hsu suspects that a similar mechanism is responsible for age-related greying. “There are definitely shared responses between how the melanocyte stem cells respond to stress and how they respond to ageing,” she said. “You essentially lose the stem cell pool in ageing as well.”It could take years of hard work to develop a safe and effective treatment to stop greying hair, Hsu said. What is more exciting, she believes, is that the work paves the way for understanding how the loss of stem cells throughout the body contribute to ageing.“This is certainly one implication that I’m particularly excited about,” said Deppmann. “There has already been evidence that stress and the fight-or-flight response depresses stem cells that are important for immunity. This may be the reason we often get sick after prolonged periods of stress.“I believe that we have only scratched the surface of whether and how stress and fight-or-flight mechanisms deplete other stem cell populations. Whether or not this is the cause of premature ageing remains to be determined, but I wouldn’t bet against it.”It is unclear whether stress-related greying came about by providing an evolutionary advantage to ancient beasts, among them human ancestors. “Because grey hair is most often linked to age, it could be associated with experience, leadership and trust,” Deppmann writes in an accompanying article in Nature. “Perhaps an animal that has endured enough stress to ‘earn’ grey hair has a higher place in the social order than would ordinarily be conferred by that inidual’s age.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/005e439eef5c09a284e848baafec17565019bbe1/0_6_5413_3249/master/5413.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9221b0648d9f82a6d131776be8a03a15","title":"saracens keen publication salary cap report rugby union","story":"• Nigel Wray accused in leaked findings over salary breaches• Mark McCall says top players can recharge in ChampionshipThe disciplinary report that led to Saracens being relegated from the Premiership found the club’s owner, Nigel Wray, broke the rules by entering into ventures totalling £1.3m with the England players Maro Itoje, Billy and Mako Vunipola and Chris Ashton.That is according to a copy of the 103-page report by Lord Dyson, which was leaked to Sky News on Wednesday. It also states Saracens breached the salary cap in three consecutive seasons – with more than £1.1m of overspend in the 2016-17 season, just over £98,000 in 2017-18 and £906,000 in 2018-19.The club was docked 35 points and fined £5.3m in November for breaking Premiership Rugby’s £7m salary cap. Earlier this month Wray stepped down as the chairman and the club subsequently agreed it would be relegated at the end of this season.It has now come to light that the disciplinary panel advised against the club’s relegation, believing it would be a disproportionate punishment.“We accept the breaches were not deliberate but in our view they were reckless,” the panel wrote in their report. “We consider that to impose a deduction of 70 points in one salary cap year is disproportionate and is not required to satisfy the underlying purpose of the relegations.”The Saracens chairman, Neil Golding, had called for the report to be made public after Premiership Rugby said the club had requested it be kept secret.Itoje was also paid a lump sum for three years of £30,000, £30,000 and £35,000 by a company involving the chairman’s daughter, Lucy Wray, that did all the hospitality at Allianz Park.According to Sky News, the report noted there was no evidence Itoje had attended any hospitality events and was not paid on a per-event basis, meaning it was a salary benefit and not a commercial arrangement.Nigel Wray also made a series of investments into companies run by Saracens players – including £250,000 into Itoje’s company and £220,000 into one owned by Richard Wigglesworth. Another £450,000 was given to Vuniprop, a company owned by the brothers Billy and Mako Vunipola, to enable them to buy a house. Renovation costs were also loaned, interest free by Wray.In his witness statement, Wray said these payments were “bona fide commercial transactions with a number of players based on the merit of those investments, not, as PRL (Premiership Rugby Limited) suggests, in order to provide an additional reward to players for playing their rugby at the club.”There is also no suggestion or evidence that any player was complicit in any of the club’s actions.Saracens’ international players have been given the all clear by Eddie Jones and Warren Gatland to take a “sabbatical” season in the Championship knowing they will still be selected for England and the Lions next year if they remain fit and in form.Mark McCall, the Saracens coach, said the plan could lead to players such as Owen Farrell and Itoje staying at the club while making only occasional appearances in the second tier. This would enable them to recharge their batteries for the autumn internationals, the Six Nations and the tour of South Africa.“A key driver for our established international players is whether they would be selected by Eddie for the autumn internationals and Six Nations while playing in the Championship,” McCall said.“Obviously there is a lot who also want to go on the Lions at the end of next year. However Eddie is on the whole happy to select players who are established, Warren the same.”McCall cited the cases of Richie McCaw and Dan Carter, who went on a sabbatical and then returned to guide New Zealand to World Cup glory in 2015, as showing the benefits of such an approach.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsHe added: “A lot of these players are at the stage where they have been on this treadmill for 10 years. I think they are seeing it as a positive where next year can be one where they freshen up, physically recover and get better, play enough rugby and go on a Lions tour at the end of it fresh, which is not normal.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/056c5714f2150189ec84db49e08389dd51613b3a/124_359_4779_2867/master/4779.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e3cfe27b064fc3b4e2e629fce4ef1c8c","title":"tom kohler cadmore england lions alex hepburn trial","story":"The Yorkshire batsman, 25, was among the England Lions white-ball squad that flew to Australia on Wednesday, his first outing for the second string since he and Nottinghamshire’s Joe Clarke were removed from a tour to India last January.It followed details of their involvement in a sexual conquest game on WhatsApp coming to light during Hepburn’s initial court case, with the former Worcestershire player later convicted on one count of oral rape after April’s retrial and sentenced to five years in prison.Both Kohler-Cadmore and Clarke were cleared of any criminal wrongdoing but still reprimanded for bringing the game into disrepute. The England and Wales Cricket Board retrospectively banned them for four of the Lions games they missed, fined them £2,000 each and ordered them to attend an educational course.With that punishment now served, Kohler-Cadmore has returned to the Lions set-up after another strong season at Headingley – the ECB insists Clarke’s continued absence is based solely on performance – and he appears keen to own his mistake.Kohler-Cadmore said: “One hundred per cent I was in the wrong. We all had our part to play in the group and it was meant as a bit of a joke. I know it’s not a joke now but it was never meant to be malicious.“They were my actions, I was part of it and I was the one that created the group. It was never meant to have any outcome like that, it was just us three being young, single lads. We were naive.”Kohler-Cadmore knows his proximity to the Hepburn case is “not something I am ever going to get away from” but insists he is a reformed character these days, having feared his career was “crashing down” when Andy Flower, the former Lions head coach, initially stood him down from the India tour 12 months ago.“The learning from it was that it was about you as a whole. You can’t allow yourself to be acting in that way, you have got to conduct yourself a lot better.“Since then my life has had a proper U-turn in how I conduct myself. I have actually taken myself out of every WhatsApp group I could possibly be in. I am more than happy to miss out on that because I don’t want the risk of being affiliated with something that I can’t control.The Professional Cricketers’ Association responded to the Hepburn case by rolling out a series of relevant courses to all 18 counties and the England men’s and women’s teams. Players have been taught about sexual consent and the law, as well as having attitudes challenged.Kohler-Cadmore has also volunteered to speak at the PCA rookie camp at Edgbaston on 25 February, where around 50 newly signed professional cricketers will hear his cautionary tale as part of their induction into the sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49c1c4b1254b155e344af606ee32969dfb77dfcf/0_387_3485_2091/master/3485.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e6f6e188841d69eb3356e0250f22bb4f","title":"the best of the winter youth olympic games in pictures","story":"All the colour, drama and skill of the competitors are captured here in the best photographs from Lausanne"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ae145e317b11a6ce56d3cc308de80a14de475e97/0_400_4959_2976/master/4959.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5ab1507ff41f73168e7ba028448a2244","title":"click i agree un rapporteur says prince tried to intimidate bezos with text","story":"Information suggests alleged targeting of Amazon chief was part of a wider campaign to pick off iniduals close to KhashoggiThe message, it seems, could not have been clearer.On 8 November 2018, just one month after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, Jeff Bezos, the world’s richest man, received an unsolicited text from Mohammed bin Salman’s WhatsApp account.According to the UN, the message from the crown prince of Saudi Arabia contained a single photograph that bore a striking similarity to the woman with whom the married billionaire was having a secret affair. It also contained what appeared to be a sardonic message.It read: “Arguing with a woman is like reading the Software Licence Agreement. In the end you have to ignore everything and click I agree.”For Agnes Callamard, the UN special rapporteur who is investigating the murder of Khashoggi, it seemed the message was evidence of an attempt by the future king, also known as MBS, to “intimidate” Bezos.She told the  it appeared intended to make him feel vulnerable, even as his own newspaper, the Washington Post, continued to publish hard-hitting stories about the murder of one of its own journalists.The new UN revelations, which follow the ’s report that Bezos’s phone was allegedly hacked by Saudi Arabia in the months before the Khashoggi killing, point to an orchestrated cyber campaign to target Bezos, and the close circle of iniduals around Khashoggi.Callamard said: “This shows that during this period, there is a concerted effort to hack into the system of people who are considered as a threat somehow to MBS or to the government system of Saudi Arabia. That does not mean it is aimed at picking up particular information. It is done to use that information in the future.”According to a timeline provided by the UN, the story began on 21 March 2018, when Bezos was invited to a small dinner party in honour of the crown prince.A fortnight later – on 4 April – the two men exchanged phone numbers at a dinner whose guest list included former basketball player Kobe Bryant and the Disney chief executive, Bob Iger.And a month after that, on 1 May, Bezos received “a message from the crown prince account … through WhatsApp,” the UN explained.“The message is an encrypted video file. It is later established, with reasonable certainty, that the video’s downloader infects Mr Bezos’ phone with malicious code.”This rapidly infected his phone – and a huge exfiltration of data began.That was the conclusion of a report undertaken for Bezos by FTI Consulting, an advisory firm, whose findings were passed to Callamard, and another UN special rapporteur, David Kaye. has seen this report.If the analysis is correct, the crown prince’s close circle had obtained the contents of the mobile phone of one of the world’s most powerful businesspeople.Bezos – like hundreds of other victims – would have had no reason to know he had been hacked.In the days and weeks that followed, Bezos – who was married at the time – sent private text messages to his girlfriend, describing his romantic feelings.Those texts would later be published in the National Enquirer, although the exact circumstances around their publication have yet to be determined.What is known is that the crown prince had twice met with the owner of the National Enquirer, David Pecker, who was known in Hollywood and Washington as a man who had ties to Donald Trump, and had a history of solving problems for the US president, including “killing” negative stories about Trump and his extramarital affairs.New information published by Callamard and Kaye, the UN special rapporteur on freedom of expression, suggest that the alleged targeting of Bezos was just the beginning of a broader campaign to pick off iniduals who were close to Khashoggi and in frequent contact with the journalist.The timeline published by the investigators on Wednesday refers to four other prominent Saudi critics who were targeted with malware in the weeks that followed: Yahya Assiri and Omar Abdulaziz, who were in frequent contact with Khashoggi, the London-based satirist Ghanem al-Dosari, and an Amnesty International official who was working in Saudi Arabia.On 2 October, Khashoggi entered the Saudi embassy in Istanbul and was killed. US intelligence agencies and Callamard’s own report would later allege that Bin Salman bore responsibility for the killing.Shortly thereafter, the investigators said there had been a “massive online campaign” against Bezos and Amazon in Saudi Arabia, principally targeting him as the owner of the Washington Post.Then, in January last year, the National Enquirer published an exposé of Bezos’s extramarital affair, including text messages that were sent after the billionaire’s phone was allegedly hacked by the Saudis.American Media Inc, owner of the National Enquirer, has denied that any “third party” was involved in it obtaining information about Bezos, and has insisted that it received its tip-off from the estranged brother of Bezos’s girlfriend. But the brother, Michael Sanchez, publicly stated last year that the Enquirer was already aware of the illicit relationship when he was first contacted by the tabloid in July 2018 and had already “seen” text messages between the couple.While experts contend that Bin Salman may have been seeking to silence Bezos, the Amazon CEO publicly accused AMI of trying to “extort and blackmail” him, after the company suggested that it would agree to not publish compromising photographs of the billionaire if he agreed to shutdown his investigation into the leaked texts. Bezos flatly denied the apparent deal.The FTI Consulting report says that Bezos obtained a detailed briefing about the extent of the Saudi campaign against him on 14 February. It was provided over two separate phone calls.UN investigators say the online campaign against Bezos ended on 1 April.At about that time, the  reported that Mike Pompeo, the US secretary of state, had privately urged the crown prince to cut his ties to a close adviser, Saud al-Qahtani, who had been known as a key architect of Saudi Arabia’s cyber warfare and Twitter campaigns.The Saudi embassy in Washington declined to respond to the ’s questions. But in a tweet, the Saudi government called allegations that the crown prince was involved in the hacking of Bezos “absurd”.“We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,” it said.AMI said it had no further comment.Saudi Arabia has insisted the crown prince had nothing to do with the murder of Khashoggi. It has also denied using surveillance technology against critics of the kingdom.But, on Wednesday night, as the story continued to grow, Bezos remembered the journalist in a tweet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9b5ce39d227d831c434210cdf35977916f8f876e/0_0_5124_3073/master/5124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7e00d6b308231638bc427a46750c8d36","title":"tell us about the websites your children visit","story":"We want to hear from parents and young adults about the non-mainstream sites they and their children accessWith new rules for technology companies to protect children online announced by the UK Information Commissioner’s Office, we want to hear about the non-mainstream sites children and young people access.Some of these principles include:We want to know about the surprising sites that children and young people visit.

Here, we speak to self-professed money ‘experts’ about their go-to strategies for smart spendingFor many of us, the big shop is a weekly trundle around the same supermarket, picking up the usual array of items and plonking them in the trolley without too much thought. But Lisa Garwood-Cross, 28, from Bury, has revolutionised her approach to it – by refusing to go more than twice a month and being mindful about what she picks off the shelves.“Shopping is one of those things you often do on autopilot,” says Garwood-Cross. “But simply switching on to what you need – taking 10 minutes to stocktake what’s in the cupboard before you leave the house – and then really thinking about what you put in the trolley, can save you a lot of money.”Mindset aside, Garwood-Cross has several tried and tested strategies for wiping off pounds at the checkout. “My number one tip is to check the price per 100g on what you’re buying,” she says. “We’re programmed to think that the biggest pack will be the best value but that’s not always the case. Look for the information on the shelf label and don’t assume bulk is best.”Garwood-Cross’s second tip is to be more flexible in your shopping and try some own brands. Often, we go for the market-leading brand through habit, but it may be that you won’t even taste the difference, she says.“I never thought I’d be able to ditch my favourite fizzy drink but actually, I really like a supermarket version – that’s 39p a bottle, compared with £1.50 for two litres. You don’t have to switch everything – my wife won’t ever change her ketchup brand – but just making some swaps will save money.”Finally, Garwood-Cross suggests filling your freezer with frozen vegetables and yellow sticker (reduced) meat and fish, and setting yourself a “pantry challenge” once a month to use up all the food in the house before heading out for another big shop.“I picked up a lot of this when I was young, as I was raised by a single mum on benefits,” says Garwood-Cross. Now studying for a PhD in digital health, Garwood-Cross’s savvy ways have enabled her to buy a two-bedroom house and enjoy two to three foreign holidays a year.For Kevin Egan, 49, from Chelmsford in Essex, being smart with his shopping takes barely any effort as he has an American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card. This means Egan earns money back on all his purchases just by using his card, and he estimates having earned more than £1,000 since he got it in 2009.Egan says he keeps track of his spending using the handy Amex App.Indeed, these days your smartphone is your best friend when it comes to budgeting, moving money around and making savings. Clair Byrne, 31, from Greater Manchester is evangelical about the benefits of cashback shopping apps.With so many fun and effective tricks of the trade, it’s not difficult to see why a growing number of people get such satisfaction from being savvy with their spending. “I get a kick out of knowing that I’ve saved some money that can be put towards the things that really matter to me – such as experiences and holidays,” says Garwood-Cross.

I’m in a relatively good situation and I’m not going to seize up my spending.’”So what have we been spending money on in 2019? This year, the Office for National Statistics added smart speakers, baking trays, dog treats and electric toothbrushes to the virtual shopping basket it uses to calculate the country’s annual inflation rate, making our changing shopping norms clear as day. And there are more consumer trends that refect our changing world …Vegan sausage rollsWhen vegan sausage rolls hit the high street in January, they caused something of a stir, with bakeries struggling to keep up with demand. Their success influenced supermarkets, many of whom expanded their vegan ranges. Shoppers say they’ve adopted this lifestyle in the past five years, primarily because of animal welfare concerns, health reasons and because they want to be more mindful about the environment.Hannah Elderfield, senior behavioural analyst at the consumer behavioural specialist Canvas8, says it’s part of an evolution of beauty as a sector that combines notions of self-care, wellness and health into one. “People are now looking for beauty products that boost their emotional state, rather than just buff out so-called imperfections – it’s about feeling happier, empowered and more confident,” she says. “Part of this shift is due to a rising desire for products that align more closely with people’s values. In 2019, environmental concerns and sustainability issues grew even higher on the agenda.”It’s part of a broader trend of shoppers who are investing more in their “off time” at home. Research from American Express found this extends to hobbies – 11 million adults having taken up a new one this year, with artistic interests such as painting, drawing and creative writing topping the list. The most common reason people gave for spending money on a new hobby (an average of £23.50 per month) was to find a better work-life balance. Experiences as a whole have remained a strong category in 2019 when it comes to consumer spending, whether that’s at home or elsewhere, says Duckett.“We’ve got so much stuff and no place to put it,” he says. “This has filtered down to us thinking: what else can I spend my money on that I can get more value out of. People will look for experiences in leisure, entertainment and holidays.”American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

None of us want to miss out on that party invite or weekend away. Now you won’t have toYou’ve heard it a million times: the secret to staying on budget is to plan ahead. But, for many of us, that’s easier said than done. We work so hard that we don’t have time to organise things far in advance, nor are we able to devote as much energy to our finances as we should. But, also, it’s simply a lot of fun to be spontaneous and make the most of opportunities that come up.For that reason, it isn’t always easy to stick rigidly to a budget. Last-minute expenses, invitations for weekends away, or celebrations with friends and family can often come up unexpectedly. But if you’re canny with it, you can be spontaneous without going overboard. So here are 10 smart ways to spend that even the busiest person can stick to.Eat out smartWhen a friend suggests lunch or an evening meal on the town that you hadn’t planned for, you don’t have to miss out. Using restaurant-booking websites, you can find restaurants near to you that have special offers such as free prosecco, two- or three-course meals, or afternoon tea at reduced rates.Get rewarded for spendingOne great way to earn back some of your spending money is to use a cashback credit card. If you choose one that doesn’t have a limit on the amount of cashback you could earn – such as the American Express Platinum Cashback Everyday Credit Card – you’ll be paid back a proportion of your spending as cashback. The more you spend, the greater the reward, meaning that if you use your credit card for everyday spending as well as big-ticket items, you can reap the rewards in cashback. (See Important information panel.)Set aside extra cash each month for last-minute social commitments If you know you’re liable to go big on going out, or you regularly need to find extra cash for last-minute social occasions, add a contingency to your budget so you don’t end up short at the end of the month. If you don’t use it one month, you can carry it forward towards a bigger item later. Make sure you’ve set aside enough to cover all your regular and necessary expenses such as rent or mortgage and utility bills before you calculate your spending money.Buy an annual passSome museum and gallery exhibitions charge a comparatively high fee for a one-off ticket, but offer annual passes for the cost of two or three visits. These memberships often also include free guest or child passes, so if it is somewhere you’ll visit regularly, you can save a lot of money over the course of a year. Ask whether they have an introductory rate for new members.Use an appThere are lots of money apps you can use to alert you if your spending is higher than you’d like. Different apps provide different services, from providing smart insights on your spending and showing an overview of your finances, to alerting you to where you could reduce unnecessary expenses. Be specific with your needs when you look for the app for you, and always read customer reviews to see how others have benefitted.Make the most of retailers’ loyalty cardsMany stores and supermarkets give points on shopping that can be used as part payment in-store or exchanged for vouchers and money off. Often, the deals available are more generous than the face value of the points if you decide to convert them into meal vouchers or money off on days out.Enjoy the big screenThere are plenty of ways to go to the cinema for less. Some have deals on certain days and secret blockbuster screenings at reduced rates. Afternoon showings and Sunday mornings are often cheaper, too.Get your culture on the cheapIf the theatre is more your thing, you can turn up at the box office a few hours before a performance and ask for reduced seats. Some websites list popular shows for £25 per person or less. Many theatres set aside a number of cheaper tickets for under-25s, over-60s and students of all ages, too. Be flexible about your thrillsWhile many theme parks and attractions offer the cheapest price for advance tickets, some online bookings are valid for three months to a year from the date of purchase. So if you fancy an adrenaline rush, or a fun day out for the kids, you can pre-book and then decide later when you want to go. It’s particularly useful if you want to combine your trip with a favourable weather forecast.Last-minute getawaysWhether it’s a holiday cottage by the sea, a winter sojourn in the sun, or a weekend city break, leaving it to the last minute to book can bag you a bargain. Lots of travel sites use dynamic pricing, which means that what you pay will change in response to supply and demand. If you are flexible enough to have your suitcase packed and ready to head off within 24 hours, you can snap up some incredible deals. Hotels would rather fill a room than leave it empty, and might even throw in dinner to encourage you to stay. Being spontaneous can be wonderful.American Express Services Europe Limited has its registered office at Belgrave House, 76 Buckingham Palace Road, London, SW1W 9AX, UK.

But in Latvia there’s no special term for it. “We don’t need one – this is just normal behaviour for Latvians,” said Sigita Klētniece, our walk leader in a crisp, cold Gauja national park in the country’s north-east.We stood and breathed deeply, as light dappled through the snow-speckled pines. “Let being in the forest relax you,” said Sigita. “Listen to the sounds and sense nature around you.”It felt like the forest was a spiritual place, where Latvians came to meditate.My own foray into these immense woodlands was a four-day tour of the Vidzeme region, which covers central and northern Latvia. Despite being home to the capital, Riga, Vidzeme is characterised by forest, rolling hills (including Mount Gaiziņš, Latvia’s highest point at 311 metres), morainal lakes, the cliff-lined Gauja River and historic towns with medieval castles. It is a proud region, known as the “cradle of Latvian culture” for its rich artistic heritage.I was on a short small group tour of the country with guide Amanda Kokoreviča of Experience Baltics. The forest was captivating: quiet trails among soaring trees and abundant wildlife. Equally fascinating were the people we met: the local pioneers using Latvia’s forest to create a new wave of green tourism and eco-friendly business.Latvia’s tourism board is fully behind this shift. It wants to encourage visitors away from Riga, which is popular with both rowdy British stag-dos and city breakers enticed by the medieval old town and art nouveau architecture. It wants tourists to use Riga as a launch pad for trips into Latvia’s green lands for bird-watching, forest hiking and bog walks.“It’s such a shame many tourists are in a mad rush, visiting Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania in just a few days,” said Amanda, as we arrived at Mālpils , a classical 19th-century manor with baroque-style grounds and now a design hotel and restaurant. “But things are changing – people are becoming more interested in Latvia’s nature.”The next day, after lunch at stylish Cafe Zeit, housed in a former Soviet factory, we arrived at the Woodcraft Museum in the riverside village of Līgatne. Ponytailed proprietor Rihards demonstrated how he makes bowls using locally harvested wood and traditional techniques. Even the peppermint leaves floating in my tea cup were from the local woods.Forest foraging is almost a national sport in Latvia, with mushrooms, berries, herbs, leaves for tea and birch sap juice on the menu. With half of the nation’s forests state-owned, and favourable public access laws, filling your basket is completely legal. Families are even permitted to take one Christmas tree from the forest every December. As we checked in that evening at HE Vanadziņš – a contemporary restaurant and hotel next to Cēsis’s old town – I wondered whether the owner had personally felled the tree decorating the reception.“My grandmother taught me how to forage,” said Sigita the following day, as we set off on foot past sandstone cliffs into Gauja national park – the oldest and largest of the four in Latvia. “And we pass on that knowledge and passion to our children.”Sadly we had missed the August-October mushroom season, but the forest still provided. While we picked wild cranberries, a family with a young daughter collected pine cones for a Christmas wreath and others filled large containers with spring water. This closeness to the forest is rooted in Latvia’s history: for centuries the forest has represented safety and security for Latvians, particularly in the 1600s and 1700s when people fled to the woods during conflicts between the Russian, German and Swedish empires.That afternoon, as we explored the towns of Cēsis and Valmiera, the Latvian love of nature was still clear. At Valmiermuiža brewery a “forest cola” – made with cranberries, pine blossom and heather – was lauded as a new children’s drink, while at Veikaliņš, a pop-up shop selling handcrafted produce from 35 creatives, the shelves were stocked with items such as biodegradable reed straws and textiles made from recycled linen.“Thanks to the younger generation, more and more Latvians are buying ethically sourced, eco-friendly goods,” said Lelde, the shop’s founder.Jānis, a moustachioed ice-cream maker from near Dunte, echoed this when we visited his farm. “Latvians love local produce,” he told us, as we tucked in to his Gogelmogels ice-cream. He gets milk from his neighbour’s cows, eggs from his own chickens, and flavourings such as sea buckthorn and bee pollen from his fields.Later I headed for the sauna at Lantus, a farmhouse where guests can experience a traditional Latvian bathing ritual. This turned out to be a part-aromatherapy part-massage treatment: the masseur covered my face with pungent eucalyptus leaves before pummeling my body with leafy twigs of birch and oak.Half an hour later I emerged from the sauna, covered in leaf fragments. “Your body and soul should feel cleansed,” said Amanda, glowing from her own treatment.

While they looked dead, they were actually just too cold to move. Iguanas start becoming sluggish when temperatures drop below 50F (10C) and are susceptible to freezing once temperatures drop to around 40F (4.5C). When frozen, they easily fall out of the trees they call home, appearing lifeless even though they aren’t dead.Floridians shared videos of the phenomenon, giving Twitter an up-close look at the green-scaled reptiles that are probably dreaming of warmer climates, or at least spring.One Twitter user happened to capture the resurrection of an iguana as it took in some warmth in the sunshine and slowly crawled back to life after being temporarily frozen.Iguanas are an invasive species in Florida and can be little nuisances when not frozen. They can damage infrastructure by digging small burrows into sidewalks or foundations and leave droppings on decks and inside swimming pools.Wildlife conservationists recommend people not touch frozen iguanas as they may come back to life and feel threatened if a person is close."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/561a8558839a031358d95c1179d0b4938a6253e1/0_67_2889_1733/master/2889.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ccaa471238bd56595fcc3ac37a9ff7c","title":"impeachment trial mcconnell sleep schiff","story":"Adam Schiff eloquently made the House’s case that the republic is in danger from Donald Trump but Republicans’ reaction was heavy-lidded He fought. Oh, how he fought. But Mitch McConnell’s battle with drowsy eyelids was a lost cause. The 77-year-old senator’s head bobbed and drooped. An alarmed aide sat at his side, powerless, as McConnell surrendered to the arms of Morpheus.It was 1.40pm on Wednesday and the House impeachment manager Adam Schiff was in full flow, prosecuting the case against Donald Trump. Over nearly two and a half hours, McConnell would not be the only Republican senator to nod off, yawn, rub their eyes or bolt the chamber.According to Schiff, the house was on fire, the republic was in jeopardy and democracy itself was threatened by “a president who would be king”. Yet the response on one side of the aisle was insouciance and somnolence. Was it mere fatigue, after Tuesday’s marathon that had run until nearly 2am? Or was it sheer boredom on the part of jurors who have already cleared the accused in their minds and are now just going through the motions?The session had begun with pointed comments by the Senate chaplain, Barry Black, in a prayer for the senators. “Help them remember that patriots reside on both sides of the aisle, that words have consequences and that how something is said can be as important as what is said,” said Black, sporting a bow tie. “Give them a civility built upon integrity that brings consistency in their beliefs and actions.”Then Schiff, chairman of the House of Representatives’ intelligence committee, stepped up to the podium to lead opening arguments. Reading from typed A4 sheets in a ring binder, he delivered a tour de force that was both epic and intimate, historically sweeping yet highly specific, offering a view from both 30,000 feet and the microscope.Schiff began by quoting from the founding father Alexander Hamilton in a 1792 letter to George Washington that refers to “a man unprincipled in private life” and “bold in his temper” who is “known to have scoffed in private at the principles of liberty” and is “seen to mount the hobby horse of popularity” with an intention to “ride the storm and direct the whirlwind”.History rhymes. The California congressman acknowledged the founders’ flaws but also their genius and prescience, though as the years passed, he noted, it became harder to imagine them as human beings. “This is no less true of Alexander Hamilton, notwithstanding his own return to celebrity.”It was a nod to Hamilton, the unlikely Broadway musical hit about the former treasury secretary. (The world now awaits Lin-Manuel Miranda’s sequel, a rap musical about Rudy Giuliani’s adventures in Ukraine.)Schiff set out a case painfully familiar to those who have been following the matter (which is by no means everyone). Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to publicly announce investigations into two discredited allegations that would benefit Trump’s 2020 presidential election campaign, he said.“When the Ukrainian president did not immediately agree, Trump withheld two official acts to induce the Ukrainian leader to comply – a head of state meeting and hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid to a strategic partner at war with Russia. It was a corrupt scheme to secure foreign help with his re-election – in other words, to cheat.”Carefully and cleverly, Schiff portrayed a web that has Vladimir Putin has at its centre. In his version, the infamous Ukraine phone call was not separate and distinct from the Trump-Russia investigation but all of a piece.“The military aid we provide Ukraine helps to protect and advance American national security interests in the region and beyond,” he said. “America has an abiding interest in stemming Russian expansionism.”The Senate was shown, on video screens, clips including Trump the candidate urging Russia to find Hillary Clinton’s hacked emails and the former White House expert Fiona Hill warning against the repetition of Russia propaganda talking points about a Ukrainian computer server – her accent from the English town of Bishop Auckland resounding in the chamber.Another clip was of Mick Mulvaney, acting White House chief of staff, declaring: “I have news for everybody. Get over it. There’s going to be political influence in foreign policy.”Schiff commented: “Should we just ‘get over it’? Is that what we’ve come to? I hope and pray the answer is no.” Unless Trump was held accountable and removed from office, he warned, the next president mighty simply say: “Just get over it. I’m just doing what Donald Trump did. Just get over it.”Above all, Schiff made a masterly plea for the soul of the nation. He entreated senators to put the constitution before party and warned that every generation had to fight anew for democracy and freedom. “If we don’t stand up to this peril today, we will write the history of our decline with our own hand.”Watching from afar, David Axelrod, former strategist for Barack Obama, tweeted: “Devastating, epic presentation by @RepAdamSchiff to open trial. Will it matter?”He might as well have asked if facts matter. Think of Schiff as Clarence Darrow, a legal maestro who, at the “Scopes monkey trial” in 1925, challenged a Tennessee state law that banned the teaching of evolution. He was opposed by a defender of biblical creationism. He lost.Nearly a century later, the Republican defence appears to be based on blind faith in Trump and the verdict on his conduct is preordained. As Schiff went on, McConnell, the Senate majority leader, nodded off a few times. The aide at his side wondered what to do while remaining tactful, eventually summoning a younger staffer to place a glass of water on McConnell’s desk, thereby making him stir.Fellow Republicans dozed, slumped, rubbed their eyes or stretched their legs.When Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached, his successor Gerald Ford declared “our long national nightmare is over”. This time, the party refuses to wake up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf3778b319b1b99638946b34cab3e86c7f780bcc/0_62_4017_2411/master/4017.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b345c3090b32aa38a80d7c2756f69bab","title":"mormons mexico cartels ambush massacre","story":"Cousins who lost nine close relatives in November ambush launch quixotic campaign for justice: ‘Who else is going to say something?’ After nine women and children were shot dead by cartel gunmen in the barren hills of Mexico’s Sierra Madre Occidental, 100 members of their fundamentalist Mormon community fled the country for the United States.Cousins Julián and Adrian LeBarón lost nine close relatives in the ambush, but they never considered leaving the country of their birth. Instead, they have launched a quixotic campaign for justice – not just for their slain kin, but for the many thousands of people murdered or vanished amid Mexico’s cartel violence.“We have to overcome our fears and do whatever we can to put a stop to this shit,” Julián told the .The two cousins – nut farmers from the high plains of Chihuahua state – make unlikely anti-crime activists. But they hope that they can help persuade others to rise up and pressure their public officials to put an end to the bloodletting.It is no small ambition in a country which last year saw its highest number of homicides since records began – and where mass killings fall quickly from the news cycle. Victims of the drug wars are often seen as complicit in their own deaths, and their families left to suffer in silence.But Julián LeBarón argues that Mexico has endured enough suffering – and has precious little left to lose. “People have to experience enough fear, enough pain, in order for them to say: what else can they do to me?” He added: “It’s happened to me.”In Mexico, victims’ relatives and anti-crime activists often end up being targeted themselves, but the LeBarón clan has stubbornly refused to keep quiet, speaking out against both organized crime – and the security policies of President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.LeBarón recognizes that such outspokenness is only possible because of his family’s binational status: their ancestors moved to Mexico in the late 1800s to avoid US polygamy laws, and almost of all of the clan retains US nationality.Partly because of that, the massacre dominated headlines around the world and prompted the US president to call on Twitter for “WAR” against Mexico’s cartels.“We have dual citizenship. We have the protection of the FBI and Donald Trump’s tweets that scare the bejesus out of some people. Who the hell else is going to say something?” he said, between sips of macchiato in a crowded Mexico City Starbucks.But the family’s relative privilege, also brings responsibility with it, he argued. “We’re the face and the voice of those women – and everyone that’s suffering in Mexico.”The LeBarón family first rose to national prominence in 2009, when they refused to pay a ransom after a 16-year-old from their community was kidnapped. The boy’s elder brother Benjamín LeBarón led a brief campaign to demand action by the authorities and encouraging others to resist extortion – before he and his brother were murdered.Two years later, Julián joined an anti-violence caravan led by the poet Javier Sicilia who hoped the cross-country convoy of victims would force Mexicans to face up to the devastating impact of the violence.On Thursday, LeBarón will march again with Sicilia who has called for new peace caravans across the country which will converge on the national palace this Sunday.The new campaign is itself a bleak indicator of the limited progress successive governments have made towards establishing rule of law. Crime statistics have continued to break new records every year: 35,588 people were murdered in 2019 and some 62,000 people have vanished since the current war on drugs was launched in 2006.Sicilia confessed that he had never planned to organize another national protest, but told the : “I just couldn’t take so many more deaths, especially what happened to the LeBaróns – women and children murdered in such a repugnant, outrageous way.”López Obrador, or Amlo, promised to end the militarized strategy of his predecessors in favor of a vaguely defined strategy of moral renovation and addressing what he considers the root causes of violence: poverty and corruption.But so far, his promise of “hugs not bullets” has proved ineffectual: the massacre of the Mormons came just days after gunmen from different groups massacred 13 policemen and besieged an entire city. Meanwhile a new national security force has focused more on stopping Central American migrants than catching drug traffickers.Mexico’s “war on drugs” began in late 2006 when the president at the time, Felipe Calderón, ordered thousands of troops onto the streets in response to an explosion of horrific violence in his native state of Michoacán.Calderón hoped to smash the drug cartels with his heavily militarized onslaught but the approach was counter-productive and exacted a catastrophic human toll. As Mexico’s military went on the offensive, the body count sky-rocketed to new heights and tens of thousands were forced from their homes, disappeared or killed.Simultaneously Calderón also began pursuing the so-called\u0026nbsp“kingpin strategy”\u0026nbspby which authorities sought to decapitate the cartels by targeting their leaders.That policy resulted in some high-profile scalps – notably Arturo Beltrán Leyva who was\u0026nbspgunned down by Mexican marines in 2009\u0026nbsp– but also did little to bring peace. In fact, many believe such tactics served only to pulverize the world of organized crime, creating even more violence as new, less predictable factions squabbled for their piece of the pie.Under Calderón’s successor, Enrique Peña Nieto, the government’s rhetoric on crime softened as Mexico sought to shed its reputation as the headquarters of some the world’s most murderous mafia groups.But Calderón’s policies largely survived, with authorities targeting prominent cartel leaders such as Sinaloa’s Joaquín “El Chapo” Guzmán.When “El Chapo” was arrested in early 2016, Mexico’s president bragged: “Mission accomplished”. But the violence went on. By the time Peña Nieto left office in 2018, Mexico had suffered another record year of murders, with nearly 36,000 people slain.The leftwing populist Andrés Manuel López Obrador took power in December, promising a dramatic change in tactics. López Obrador, or Amlo as most call him, vowed to attack the social roots of crime,\u0026nbspoffering vocational training\u0026nbspto more than 2.3 million disadvantaged young people at risk of being ensnared by the cartels.Amlo also pledged to chair daily 6am security meetings and create a 60,000 strong National Guard. But those measures have yet to pay off, with the new security force used mostly to hunt Central American migrants.Mexico now suffers an average of about 96 murders per day, with nearly 29,000 people killed since Amlo took office.“The president has every right to hug people who are attacking him, but he has a monopoly on the use of force and the tools of security,” said LeBarón. “He has absolutely no right whatsoever to ask any citizen to embrace people that are murdering his family.”He is at pains to stress that he is not an opponent of Amlo, who has twice met members of the LeBarón family since the massacre, and promised that the case will not languish in impunity.But the family’s activism – and speculation that Donald Trump might push some kind of intervention against Mexican cartels – has stoked a visceral reaction from the president’s most ardent supporters. Hashtags telling the LeBaróns to leave Mexico have surged on social media.Adrián LeBarón, whose daughter Rhonita Lebarón was killed in the Sierra Madre ambush, said he was long used to being labelled a vendepatria – or traitor.Both LeBaróns argue that any attempt to confront Mexico’s security crisis needs to start at the bottom, unpicking the networks of corruption which have contaminated government at all levels."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1926d78760d2d35a0c650f7780750ab10f1c9dce/0_97_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61ae18449da2a58b973531e2f7536e31","title":"thursday briefing panic in wuhan as city is locked down","story":"Food and petrol selling out in city at centre of coronavirus outbreak ... Saudis tried to ‘intimidate’ Bezos ... how Vesuvius turned a brain to glassMorning everyone. This is Martin Farrer bringing you a taste of the best stories and features from the  this Thursday morning.Residents of Wuhan have been thrown into panic after authorities placed the Chinese city at the centre of the coronavirus outbreak into lockdown, banning all outgoing modes of transport and advising people not to leave unless it was an emergency. People reported that supermarket shelves were being emptied and local markets sold out of produce as residents hoarded supplies and locked themselves at home amid an outbreak that has left at least 17 people dead and infected almost 600 more across China, Asia and the US. Petrol stations were also overwhelmed by demand as drivers stocked up on fuel and it was reported that pharmacies had sold out of face masks. Videos posted online showed highway routes out of the city had also been blocked and special police forces were seen patrolling railway stations. “I am a bit panicked because before the government said it wasn’t serious so no one thought it was a big deal,” said Wang Ying, 26, a government worker.In the US, doctors are using robots to treat a man in Washington state who contracted the virus after visiting China. Pacific nations that are just recovering from a deadly spate of measles are now ramping up biosecurity measures to cope with possible cases of coronavirus. Follow how the outbreak has developed and spread at our timeline here.‘Sardonic message’ – The United Nations has called for US authorities to investigate evidence that Jeff Bezos, the Amazon boss and owner of the Washington Post, had his phone hacked by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. The UN special rapporteurs – Agnès Callamard and David Kaye – were “gravely concerned” about the apparent targeting of Bezos and what appeared to be an “effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post’s reporting on Saudi Arabia”. The rapporteurs, who are investigating the death of Saudi dissident and Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul in October 2018, said a WhatsApp account in the prince’s name sent two messages to Bezos revealing confidential information about Bezos’s private life. A message sent in November 2018, shortly after Khashoggi’s murder, included a “sardonic message” along with a picture of a woman resembling a woman with whom Bezos was conducting an affair. The rapporteurs also warned world leaders in Davos who might be meeting Saudi delegates that their electronic security was “fragile”.‘Hopeful vision’ – Rebecca Long-Bailey says Labour has to appeal to aspirational voters with a more “hopeful vision” if it is to win another election as she steps up her leadership campaign. Speaking to the  for the second part of our series on the future of the party, the candidate identified as the heir to Jeremy Corbyn’s brand of leftwing politics says “the only way we ever win” is by appealing to a broad coalition of voters. She praised the policies in the party’s much-criticised manifesto but hinted that strategists failed to present them with one clear message and suggested she would shake up Labour’s organisation. We also look at what the election loss means for Momentum, the 40,000-strong organisation that rose to prominence in the party during the Corbyn era.Trump ‘cheat’ – The lead prosecutor at the impeachment trial of Donald Trump has described the case as a national crisis and said the president tried to “cheat” his way to re-election. But although Adam Schiff evoked constitutional history and the global promise of US democracy to outline his case against the US president on day two of the trial in Washington, Republicans remained unmoved about the need for any new evidence. Here are five key takeaways from the day. As he prepared to return from Davos, Trump stepped up his bid for another term by indicating he would increase the number of countries subject to a travel ban to the US, cut Medicare payments and attend an anti-abortion event.Judge ‘outdated’ – Family court judges could be forced to undergo training on the appropriate way to deal with sexual assault cases after a woman complained about a judge’s “outdated” views on what constituted rape. The woman has won an appeal after judge Robin Tolson said her allegations of domestic sexual violence were “untrue”, and that she was “not raped” because the woman “took no physical steps” to stop the man.Firefighters killed – Three Americans have been killed after an air tanker they were flying crashed while tackling bushfires in New South Wales. The plane went missing in the Snowy mountains area near the border with Victoria as fires flared again in Australia amid soaring temperatures. Many American and Canadian firefighters have been in Australia to help during the fire emergency.

Experts say the vitrified brains belonged to a man of about 25 who was found in the 1960s lying face-down on a wooden bed under a pile of volcanic ash. Brain tissue is rarely discovered intact but they believe that temperatures reached 520C during the eruption, igniting body fat and vaporising soft tissue.Marco Springmann, a public health expert, tells Anushka Asthana why cutting out animal products is the best route to a healthy diet – and why veganism is good for the planet.

I did the interview, it went very well, and for me it’s the best way to learn: it’s hands-on and you practise what you learn.”Property services is one of a raft of new “white collar” apprenticeships, with registrations jumping from just over 50 in 2018 to 90 this year.“There are people doing the course who have lots of experience, but don’t have the licences, so it’s also a route for them to do it,” adds Devery.While the basic salary is €20,000, he says there is also commission to be made from selling and renting, as well as expenses.“I could have ended up in a third-level degree course, studying for four years, working part-time to pay for it. But here I get paid to learn. I couldn’t recommend it enough.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148434.1579770081!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 amicable splits and potential bedfellows in first leaders debate","story":"For the past six years, a large cohort of people have retired at 65 to find that they cannot access their State pension until they turn 66.

Not so, he retorted, they had to stay together for the sake of Brexit.Questioned about the philosophical difference between the two parties, Varadkar pointed out that in the past, in all of Fine Gael’s relationships with other parties they “parted as friends” and that it “ended amicably” with the Labour Party whereas the opposition’s pairings “collapsed in scandal and acrimony.”Asked if it was time that they both “got together and reunited” likes days of old, Varadkar admitted that if pressed, he would prop up a Fianna Fáil minority Government or even form a coalition.Observers outside the studio, who had pulled up a couch under a TV to watch the debate, whistled gently.In an ante-room, three ministers watched on. Paschal Donohoe, Simon Harris and Regina Doherty had arrived shortly after 9pm in a show of support for the Taoiseach. Martin, in comparison, had arrived with his advisor.As was expected, the debate turned to the fortunes of the economy both past and present with the Fianna Fáil leader tackled on a claim that the economy has only just got back on track in the last two to three years partly thanks to the legacy of Fianna Fáil pre-2011.While Martin did reference the “global meltdown” and admit his party “made mistakes,” Varadkar was quick off the mark to claim that there had been no real change since then.The two were then asked about what the public’s perception is of them conservative with a small “c” for Martin, or “lacking empathy” for Varadkar?“I know people say that about me but I care deeply about the country and the problems that people face. I can’t put it into words as well as my opponent...but I do it in actions,” the Taoiseach faltered. It was a rare glimpse of emotion.There were skirmishes on housing and health with both leaders tearing apart each other’s election pledges resulting in Martin asking his opponent “have you any shame at all.”The retort was swift: “we are both former health ministers, (but) I am willing to accept we didn’t get everything right. You’d swear he was a brilliant health minister... it is unbelievable arrogance.” Kenny later mused that if either men had an unfortunate accident, both would get preferential access in an emergency ward.“In an emergency, if I have a heart attack or I have a stroke, or God forbid Micheál does...” at which a peel of laughter could be heard outside the studio. There was a more unusual moment later in the debate - which featured a silence that was around three seconds too long - when both were asked if they had ever taken illegal drugs. No, said, Micheál. The Fine Gael leader said he had answered that question in an interview with Hot Press many years ago. And that answer was? Yes. It was the most awkward moment of the debate, but mainly because of the prolonged delay in answering the question.After the break the two discussed Brexit and their problems with Sinn Féin. The Fianna Fáil leader took a hard line saying it was a moral issue.The debate ended the way it started, with musings and hand-wringing over who would do business with who after the election.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148097.1579712611!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 politicians playing catch up with social media","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe expert view is that ‘this is a short campaign and there is a big opportunity, because the reality is most candidates won’t get to knock on a lot of doors’. File photograph: GettyYounger voters live digital lives, have shorter attention s, and are interested in issues not political parties, say experts. Consequently, politicians are trying to talk to them in ways that will mean their messages strike home.Fine Gael has spent most in the last seven days, with €11,402 going on Facebook advertisements that promise to “revolutionise public transport” by building Link and expanding Dart in Dublin.People “are spending too much time stuck in traffic”, states one Fine Gael advertisement, as it pledges “more and quicker bus journeys”. Each of the adverts is short, between 14 and 18 seconds long.Given that climate change features on younger voters’ concerns, and mindful of the Greens’ recent success Fine Gael is also targeting the “scourge” of plastic waste, promising a ban by 2021 on single-use plastic cutlery.Equally, they are focusing on young families with lots of colourful images of babies and families opening boxes in new homes. But advertising habits can reveal what is not working just as much as much as the messaging that is. But the change in tack is interesting, nevertheless, coming after signals that Brexit and the economy are not dominating voters’ minds today. Now, the majority of Fine Gael’s “active” adverts are about childcare, health and transport.So far Fianna Fáil has spent just €2,340 on Facebook adverts, where party leader Micheál Martin talks on “health, affordable housing and climate change”. Their other online campaigns promote inidual candidates.In the last seven days, Sinn Féin has spent €1,141, focusing on a three-year rent freeze, scrapping the rise in the pension age and abolition of the Universal Social Charge on incomes below €30,000. Curiously, the Green Party has spent nothing on Facebook this week – at the time of writing.So far, according to Craig Dwyer, a digital campaigns consultant who was social media director for the marriage-equality campaign, the quality of the online campaigning has been “lacklustre”. Green Party candidate Rob O’Donnell in Tipperary has used Tinder to seek votes.“It is the small things that can get you noticed, and that can translate into wider media coverage. Some of the candidates are using crowd funding to drive their social media campaign, like the Greens’ Saoirse McHugh,” says Dwyer, who adds that social media can drive the national conversation “for good or for bad”. The subsequently deleted Fine Gael “spoof video” of Fianna Fáil frontbenchers searching for policies “drove the agenda for that day’s election coverage”, he argues, though others would see that as an overstatement. Meanwhile, the image of Cork East’s Fianna Fáil’s Kevin O’Keeffe standing next to a stretched limo complete with a rapidly attached O’Keeffe poster has left him explaining himself for days. Jokes backfire badly on social.Public affairs consultant Ken Curtin agrees with Dwyer, saying that no party or candidate has made outstanding use of digital platforms and social media.“It is much easier to see examples of the opposite,” he says. “I haven’t seen anything in the first week where I’ve thought that candidate gets it – that they are using the medium the way they should. That’s not to say that won’t change, but I haven’t seen any examples of it so far.“This is a short campaign and there is a big opportunity, because the reality is most candidates won’t get to knock on a lot of doors.” Trying to be too cleverBut it is a brief window that will close rapidly.Under pressure to succeed, political parties are “almost overthinking it”, he believes: “They are trying to be clever. That’s not how it works most of the time. It is about keeping it simple.”Negative campaigning may work elsewhere, but not here.“It just backfires. They should be talking about what their policies are and what they can do, not why the other crowd shouldn’t be left in control,” says Curtin. He says marketing and communications and social media professionals have been brought on board, “but they don’t necessarily understand politics, which is a very different kind of an animal”.Looking for successful examples, former blogger Suzy Byrne notes a short video by Labour’s Dublin South-West candidate Ciarán Ahern who has done a comic sketch where he makes clear that he is not ex-taoiseach Bertie Ahern. To date, it has been viewed 20,000 times on Twitter, helping to build name recognition in a place where he had “little or none”, says Byrne.“He’s just pointing out that he is not Bertie and not related to Bertie. People will get it.”Social media can quickly backfire, she cautions. Indeed, it is just as likely to damage as it is to help when “punters use it against politicians”, as happened to Catherine Noone after her van was parked on a Killester footpath.“That’s the sort of thing that will get you into more trouble than the message you post yourself,” says Byrne.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148407.1579730286!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"election 2020 record share of women running for d%C3%A1il seats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe deadline has passed for candidates to get on the ballot paper for the general election on February 8th.

The only constituency the party is not competing is in Cork North-West, home to Fine Gael Minister for Agriculture Michael Creed.The Labour Party has 31 candidates in the running in 31 constituencies.There are 160 seats in the next Dáil but Ceann Comhairle Seán Ó Fearghaíl is automatically returned, leaving 159 contested seats.The figures on candidate numbers are based on nominations received by returning officers after the noon deadline on Wednesday. Candidates have another 24 hours until noon on Thursday to withdraw their names.The returning officer in Waterford declined to release the names or disclose the number of candidates ahead of the deadline for the receipt of withdrawals.Local estimates suggest there will be 13 candidates running in the constituency.The overall figures take account of businessman Peter Casey, who is running in two constituencies, Donegal and Dublin West, and Cork-based Sean O’Leary, an Independent listed as a businessman who is running in several constituencies in Dublin and Cork.Female candidatesOf all the parties, the Social Democrats has the highest proportion of female candidates with 11 out of 20 contenders – or 55 per cent of their representation. They are followed by the Green Party with 23 of its 39 candidates – or 41 per cent – being women.Of the main parties, Sinn Féin has the highest proportion of women running for the Dáil with 14 of the party’s 42 candidates, or 33 per cent of the total contesting the election.They are followed closely by the Labour Party, which has 10 women out of its 31 candidates, a rate of just over 32 per cent.Fianna Fáil is the next highest with 26 of the party’s 84 candidates – or 30.9 per cent of the total.Fine Gael has 25 female candidates out of the 82 total running, a rate of 30.4 per cent.Renua Ireland, which has no TDs, is running 11 candidates: three women and eight men. The National Party has 10 candidates, six men and four women.The constituency with the largest number of candidates is the five-seater constituency of Wicklow – home to Fine Gael Minister for Health Simon Harris – which has 20 candidates running.The constituency with the fewest number of candidates is three-seater Cork North-West which has just nine people running.Wexford and the newly reformed Laois-Offaly have the largest number of candidates from a single party with Fianna Fáil fielding four contenders in both of the five-seaters.Kildare South stands out as the constituency with the highest proportion of women seeking a seat in the Dáil, with seven female candidates out of a field of 11. It is the only constituency with a majority of female candidates.The worst constituencies in terms of gender balance are Cork East and Donegal, which each have only one woman out of 13 candidates running.The youngest candidates are believed to be Louis O’Hara, Sinn Féin’s contender in Galway East, and Tate Donnelly, the Green candidate in Cavan-Monaghan, who are both 21, the minimum age to contest a general election.Among the oldest candidates are former Labour Kildare North TD Emmet Stagg who is 75, Fine Gael Kildare North TD Bernard Durkan who is 74 and former Fianna Fáil TD for Dublin South-West Charlie O’Connor who is 73.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148103.1579760786!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"five things to look out for in political party social media campaigns","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe launch of an online database of 70,000 people buried in Mount Saint Lawrence Cemetery is the first in a series of cemetery projects aimed at establishing a social history of Limerick. The holy grail for any digital campaign manager is to have ordinary people share their messageThis looks set to be a bad election for traditional Irish electioneering, and a good one for digital campaigns. A brief, rainy campaign, and greater security, is grim news for canvassers. Meanwhile, short, dark days limit the value of street posters. So here are five things to watch out for in political parties’ social media campaign.1 Manufacturing viralityThe holy grail for any digital campaign manager is to have ordinary people share their message. When it first emerged over a decade ago, social media allowed candidates to engage directly with people, but most importantly, to get those people to share their campaign’s content with their friends and family. Up until a few years ago, upstart campaigns could capture public attention with pithy, funny or emotive posts, reaching new audiences as content spread, virally, from person to person. However, changes to the design of platforms such as Facebook have led to a decline in the reach of organic, or unpaid, posts. Manufacturing “virality” is now a profession. Parties and candidates with enough cash can hire experts who claim they can game the system and get us sharing anyway. Some tactics are legitimate, involving the careful production and message testing of high-quality, eye-catching content. But tactics can also include using bots or fake accounts to make content appear popular, or the use of outrage or provocation to encourage “hate-sharing”. 2 Paying for reachWith virality harder to achieve, parties and candidates often have to buy social media advertising to get their videos and messages out. The misuse of political ads was big news after the 2016 US presidential election and Brexit vote, and to some extent our own 2018 referendum on the Eighth Amendment, with “fake news” and accusations of overseas interference and campaign finance violations causing headaches for Facebook, Google and Twitter. Facebook and Google have since cleaned up their act, building searchable ad archives, and requiring “authorisation” for political ads. Twitter went further, banning political ads outright. Issues still remain about the use of personal data in ads, in particular as parties can create custom audiences to deliver different messages to different communities. There have also been questions raised about their effectiveness. Research suggests that digital advertising might not change minds, but it can entrench people’s party affiliation or core beliefs, and affect their willingness to vote. Equally, however, there has been little or no research out looking into the effectiveness of social media campaigning in a single-transferable vote system that Ireland operates, but which few other countries do. Irish politicians are perhaps uniquely dependent on second-, third- and sometimes eighth-preference votes. Winning is about getting as wide a number of people in your constituency to know your name and face as possible. 3 Deception gets sophisticated Some online campaigns can involve deception, and these are harder to detect. “Fake news” or disinformation is now just as likely to circulate on closed WhatsApp groups, with screenshots forwarded from group to group.Another phenomenon to watch out for is “Astroturf” campaigns, where accounts, or indeed networks of profiles and websites, are set up to mimic local groups or support for a candidate or cause. Tactics deployed can include taking extreme positions on controversial issues to “bait” opponents into sharing the original messages. In some countries, campaigns have been run to discourage people from turning out to vote. 4 Disruption goes mainstreamDarker tactics are no longer just the practice of fringe groups. During the UK general election, the major parties posted large amounts of low-quality trollish, or ironic memes to capture attention. Such practices are crudely known as “s**tposting”.During the British election major parties posted distorted videos, the Conservatives chose to “reskin” their Twitter account so that it represented itself as a neutral fact-checker, while search results were “gamed” to drive voters to biased websites.5 Legally speaking, anything goes Irish electoral law has yet to catch up with digital campaigning, since we are still in the same legal landscape we were in May 2018 when Google temporarily withdrew their political advertising product from Ireland over concerns about election integrity. This election, we will again rely on good faith by candidates, the scrutiny of journalists and digital campaigners. It is not controversial to say that this is an untenable situation, and one the new Dáil will need to have high on its agenda.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148410.1579731475!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord the left woos mary lou as fg tries to keep ireland s nanas and granddads happy","story":"Speaking at the People Before Profit general election manifesto launch, Richard Boyd Barrett called for a break with historical  Fianna Fail  Fine Gael government to create a fairer, more inclusive society in Ireland.

Photograph: Alan BetsonThe Everyone is jumping on the old age pension bandwagon now.It has become a major issue in the general election. Bríd Smith of People Before Profit thinks it’s going to be huge. “It will electrify the year of 2020.”She could have said “I told you so” at the party’s manifesto launch in Dublin on Wednesday, but her colleague Richard Boyd Barrett had that angle well covered. Richard and his fellow socialists were dead set against raising the pension eligibility age when it was neither popular nor people-before-profitable.They never wanted this “scandalous move” to happen in the first place. “We would like to emphasise that we are not johnny-come-latelys on that policy,” he sniffed, sounding ever-so-slightly piqued. “Everybody now seems to be talking about it.”Perhaps he should take it as a compliment, but he knows the main political parties have only come on board because they live in mortal dread of upsetting the cherished nanas and granddads of Ireland. The plan to raise the pension age in stages up to 68 has been in the pipeline for years, largely ignored because the people it will effect were not yet old enough to start getting properly angry.Over the topBut the first wave is fully advancing now and going over the top with gusto every day on Joe Duffy’s Liveline. Not good for the outgoing team in the middle of a tight election campaign. The power of Joe with a fearsome cast of incandescent pensioners queuing up to give out yards about the Government over the national airwaves has terrified Fine Gael. The other parties are also scrambling to protect their flanks as the expectant pensioners gather in strength.But can this campaign get any sweeter for angelic Sinn Féin – happily not among the ranks of the implicated? Well, the normally standoffish Boyd Barrett and chums came a-wooing on Wednesday, with even Paul Murphy going down on metaphorical bended knee (despite being a member of Rise) to seek Mary Lou’s hand in what he romantically termed “radically breaking the cycle”.It remains to be seen where that goes. Post-election promiscuity is almost guaranteed from all sides once the votes are counted. This makes Boyd Barrett (very keen on political abstinence) sad. “We are not going to trade away our principles and policies just to get a ministerial seat” like other political tarts.The living daylightsBut back to the pensioners, who may yet take to the streets to scare whatever is left of the living daylights out of Leo’s administration.Bríd Smith (Dublin South-West) wants people to “really pile on the pressure”. She starts the ball rolling on Saturday morning in her constituency with a protest in Cork Street and urges all People Before Profit candidates (27 in all) “and beyond” to do the same. “Call the grey vote together, get to your local social welfare office and demand they end this measure now.”The establishment, said Bríd, “always feel the pressure of the grey vote, in which I now include myself”.It’s a scandal, cried the permanently scandalised Boyd Barrett. Thousands of euro “will be robbed out of the pockets” of pensioners who worked hard all their lives by a heartless Government.As for the four political parties in the frame, “they have, between them, loaded the gun and pulled the trigger on the pension age and therefore committed a vast robbery of pensioners’ meagre finances,” added his proudly grey comrade Bríd.She can’t get over the U-turn. After standing by the age change, “now they’re all crying: ‘Oh, we wouldn’t do that. We wouldn’t.’”Amazing political influencerFrom being on the right side of the argument to seeing himself as an amazing political influencer, RBB decided to claim the credit for the different results in the two national opinion polls last week. The first, on Sunday, gave Fianna Fáil a huge 12-point lead over Fine Gael. The second, published by The  on Tuesday, saw that gap shorn back to a bare two points.At its campaign launch last week, People Before Profit argued that “the cycle of Fianna Fáil domination can be broken”. And lo and behold, didn’t that domination highlighted on Sunday shrink dramatically when the second set of figures came out.“In just a week since we put that message out – and I want to stress that we put that message out before anybody else did – we rejected the idea that this was a two-horse race between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael . . . Within a short week, that has become a reality,” boasted Richard.With such power over the electorate and a bigger three-week window, he should have considered running more candidates, along with an overall majority. Or then again, maybe the stunning result was not so much to do with Richard’s rhetorical powers of persuasion and more to do with the not-unusual case of two different polling companies, using different methods, producing different results.The ’ results indicated less than half of the electorate want to vote for the two big parties. Great news for People Before Profit.“We could be facing a historic moment,” carolled Boyd Barrett, daring to dream. “An earthquake where we finally break from the shackles of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael politics and set off towards a different future.”Seismic activityGino Kenny (Dublin Mid-West) was also hopeful on the seismic activity front. “A bit of an earthquake for the establishment parties.”He’s getting very definite tremors from the doorsteps. People want a change. “I think this will be actually a good election for the left.” The result might even turn out to be a “big surprise” for “the progressive left”.The thing is, though, in order to make an impression they need the weight of numbers from left-orientated Independents and parties. Paul Murphy (Dublin South-West) put it up to Sinn Féin.People don’t only want change. A substantial minority want “radical change”. That figure could Rise to a majority given the right conditions.“If Mary Lou McDonald came out and said clearly” she will not be voting for Leo Varadkar or Michéal Martin and that Sinn Féin will not prop up their parties in government, “there is a chance here for us to radically break the cycle.”Mary Lou might be flattered, but her party appears only to have eyes for Fianna Fáil at the moment.They should present a more united front, suggested Richard, particularly when the parties and Independents from the left have voted together many times in the Dáil on issues such as health, housing and the tax system. “We have often campaigned together and often very, very effectively.”So who might make up this grand, alternative coalition?“Look, I’ll let them categorise themselves.”That’s the end of that, so.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4148248.1579722463!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"targeting a d%C3%A1il seat like a military campaign","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tCathal Berry is contesting the newly-enlarged Kildare South constituency. Photograph: Michael Donnelly. Dr Cathal Berry’s newly-opened campaign office in Newbridge has the air of a military command centre. In the middle of the room, a group are gathered around a table, discussing strategy. Smaller groups are dotted elsewhere, all engaged in deep conversation. One wall carries an Ordnance Service map with the newly-enlarged Kildare South constituency marked in purple. “I did that myself, by hand,” Berry says. There’s a reason for the somewhat martial atmosphere. Nearly everyone in the room is a former soldier, from sergeant to brigadier general. The few who are not are married, or related to soldiers.Until late last year, Berry was a Defence Forces commandant. Once, he was second-in-command of the elite Rangers. When he retired, Berry, who is also a medical doctor, led the Military Medical School. Now he is aiming to get one of the four seats up for grabs in Kildare South in next month’s general election. If successful, Berry will be the constituency’s first Independent TD.Political novicesAll of Berry’s some 30 volunteers are political novices, including his director of elections Brian Dowling, a retired colonel and the Army’s former director of ordnance.“I was volunteered for the role,” Dowling explains. It’s an army expression – you don’t volunteer, you are volunteered by someone else.” Like most people on “Team Berry”, Dowling had no political allegiances, until now.Berry and his team are driven by the Defence Forces’ “intolerable” pay and conditions, and a lack of respect, they believe, by the Government towards serving members and their families. This has driven the recruitment crisis, Berry says. Last year a record 850 personnel left the Permanent Defence Force, leaving it about 1,000 people below the establishment strength of 9,500.The third incumbent, Fianna Fáil’s Seán Ó Fearghaíl, is guaranteed one of the four seats due to his role as Ceann Comhairle in the last Dáil.Inexperience has led to one or two minor missteps. Sarah Walshe of the Wives and Partners of the Defence Forces campaign group had announced that she was running, ahead of Berry’s decision to contest.But she quickly withdrew, pledging to fight for a Seanad nomination. Equally, Berry avoided problems when a US-based former officer donated €4,000, an unwitting breach of election rules. The money was quickly returned.Despite inexperience, observers believe Berry has a good chance of picking up the last seat, not least because his online funding campaign has so far raised nearly €25,000. “And not all of it from military people,” says Berry.Equally, Kildare South has soldiers. About 3,000 serving soldiers, many based in the Curragh, live in the constituency. There are even more families, plus retired soldiers, living in and around Kildare.The question is whether they will vote. Traditionally soldiers do not, in large numbers, Berry concedes. “But they will turn out if you are motivated by someone.”If elected as an Independent Berry will support a minority government if Kildare South gets “our fair share”. Would he take a position as Minister for Defence? “Even if you look at Donald Trump’s original cabinet, there were four generals there who were the adults in the room,” Berry says. Trump soon got rid of all of them, he admits, but “who knows what they prevented?”If a ministerial post does not arise, Berry believes that having an ex-soldier in the Dáil would benefit everyone: “There’s a complete absence of information there right now,” he says.Defence policySuch experience is not just to argue for better conditions for former colleagues, it is also about shaping future defence policy, says Deirdre Carberry, who until last month was an infantry captain with 15 years’ service.She loved her time in the Defence Forces “and would recommend it anybody”, but she became frustrated by the lack of strategic thinking: “So it was time for me to try something else.” Today, she is Berry’s communications director. Berry was brave, she argues, to resign from the Defence Forces to campaign for better pay and conditions. “He’s someone who stands for something,” she says.Electing former soldiers is common elsewhere. Fifty-two Westminster MPs are veterans. Besides one or two former reservists, the Dáil has no veterans, “aside from maybe some of the Shinners”, jokes one of Berry’s team.This is maybe because Irish people “get a bit antsy” when they hear the subject of defence in a political context, Berry says. “It’s a bit of a taboo subject. It’s associated with wars, it’s associated with colonial domination.”However, Berry is not “a one-trick pony”, cautions retired Brigadier General Ger Aherne quickly. Indeed, Berry’s primary target is the health service, something he has seen first-hand as a front-line doctor.Irish patients could be treated in other European Union countries: “Ireland exports food because it has a surplus. Some countries have a surplus.

File photograph: Will OlivierEPAThe British government is facing fresh calls to issue EU citizens with a physical document to prove they have the right to stay in the country after Brexit.A report found nine out of 10 EU citizens in the UK would prefer a card over the digital evidence they have now to demonstrate their rights in future to employers, banks or landlords.Fears over discrimination, loss of identity and a continuing lack of trust in the government’s willingness to deliver guaranteed lifetime rights emerged as serious concerns in the research – the biggest survey of EU, European Economic Area (EEA) and Swiss citizens in the UK to date.Tanja Bueltmann, a professor at Northumbria University who designed and conducted the poll along with the campaign group the3million, said: “The survey documents, without question, we have an ‘unsettling status’.“This extends beyond the application process, revealing an erosion of trust an erosion of wellbeing and an erosion of the sense of belonging among survey respondents.“The government has a duty to finally give EUEEA and Swiss citizens certainty. Hollow words are not enough.”The findings came just days after the government gave the European parliament’s Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, reassurances that EU citizens would not be automatically deported if they failed to apply for the settled status scheme.The survey, published on Monday, found that nine in 10 of those polled were unhappy about the lack of a physical document to demonstrate their right to remain in the country after they had been granted settled status or pre-settled status.As many as 11 per cent said they had already been asked for settled status proof, even though this is not legally required.This echoes a warning by private landlords that tenants could face discrimination because of the lack of a physical document.On the plus side, many of those surveyed reported a positive experience of the settled status app, with a majority of respondents saying the application process worked well.As many as 97.1 per cent of the 3,171 valid responses to the survey said they had received the status decision they expected.However, the emotional response to having to apply and the consequences of being labelled as someone with “settled status” was largely adverse. The words most frequently used by respondents to describe their feelings were “angry”, “anxious” and “unwanted”.Even those who had already been granted settled status felt worse off, with 80 per cent either strongly agreeing or agreeing that they felt anxious.Eight out of 10 said the process made them stressed and many thought citizenship was far more secure.Maike Bohn, co-founder of the3million, said the report underlined the lack of trust after three years of mixed messages.“Are we the much-quoted ‘neighbours, colleagues, friends’ or are we the ‘queue jumpers, benefits scroungers, unwelcome guests, draining the NHS’?“The government needs to step up local outreach and support, both to EUEEA and Swiss citizens but also to employers, landlords and others who will be forced to check the immigration status of these citizens in order to avoid huge fines.”The British Home Office said the scheme was working and a digital solution was better than a physical document. “This digital status future-proofs their rights and is linked to their passport or ID card, replacing physical documents which can get lost, stolen, damaged, tampered with and expire,” it said.–Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

His celebrity crush is Lily James.Meanwhile, the show has been sponsored by fast fashion brands (Missguided and then I Saw it First) for the last three years, giving viewers the opportunity to shop the female Islanders’ looks directly. Personally, I’ve always thought that Love Island contestants dress terribly: it’s Benidorm beaches meets Kardashian kitsch. But with prices starting at £5, the clothes are devastatingly cheap. Far cheaper than the designer garb we see on most TV stars. So I can understand the appeal. But I also know that every time someone buys one of those bikinis, or sparkly bodycon dresses, they’re adding fuel to fast fashion’s ever-blazing fire.But perhaps the onus is not on the consumer, or even the Love Island star. Lauren Bravo, author of How to Break Up with Fast Fashion, explains that the brands are the ones who should really be shouldering responsibility here. “These days we’re so used to instant gratification, and the idea that anyone can aspire to celebrity, that it seems reasonable for TV stars to sell us clothes and vice versa,” she tells me. “And it’s really hard, because I know what it’s like to love fashion and crave the clothes you’re seeing on people you admire, not to mention the huge social pressures on young people to keep that endless parade of new looks rolling over on their Instagram grid, so telling people who can’t necessarily afford to spend any more that their shopping habits are destroying the planet can feel snobbish and unfair.”Why I\u0027m giving up fast fashion #20PledgesBut, Bravo adds, the fact remains that those clothes simply cannot be made as cheaply as they’re sold. Somewhere down the line, someone is paying the price, whether it’s a garment worker barely surviving on poverty wages or a community grappling with industrial pollution.That’s not to say you can’t “get the Islander look” in a sustainable and eco-friendly way. Bravo suggests heading to secondhand shopping apps, like Depop, where you’ll find plenty of pre-loved items not dissimilar from the ones you see on the show. Some of them will be from fast fashion brands, but if you’re buying it there, you’re keeping that item in circulation as opposed to letting it wind up in landfill.\u0026nbspOr, you could take a closer look at some of the trends championed by Love Islanders, both past and present, and see that many (cycling shorts, mesh, high-waisted jeans and leopard print) hark back to another era, like, say, the 1990s. And what better way to shop Nineties fashion than by heading to your local Beyond Retro or Rokit, which will be jam-packed with original clothing from the decade that is not only more sustainable, but a hell of a lot cooler, too.How to Break Up with Fast Fashion by Lauren Bravo (£12.99, Headline Home) is out nowOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After the initial 18-month period comes to an end – which for many people will be next month – those who have not brought down their balances could be put on to a payment plan or face more severe options.Akansha Nath, credit expert at Credit Karma, which commissioned the survey, said: “It’s daunting to think that we might be well into April before we’re consistently back in the black, but rather than using ‘quick fixes’ to free up some extra cash, there are lots of simple ways to get back in control of our finances, from creating a new budget to reviewing all outgoings or transferring debts to a 0 per cent balance transfer card.”Borrowers seeking a zero per cent credit card now have less choice available to them as banks have withdrawn some cards from the market and reduced the interest-free periods.This month, Bank of England research showed that the length of balance transfer deals reduced markedly and the availability of unsecured debt decreased towards the end of 2019 as lenders became more nervous about the UK economy.Financial website Moneyfacts says the number of cards that allow balance transfers has dropped by more than a third in the past three years to reach a record low.Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.135 35) Arctic Monkeys – Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not (2006)A new wave of British guitar bands was already being pioneered by the likes of The Libertines, Bloc Party and Franz Ferdinand when the Sheffield-formed Arctic Monkeys arrived on the scene. But their 2006 debut – the defiantly titled Whatever People Say I Am, That’s What I’m Not – is arguably the most generation-defining, by a band experiencing the kind of hype that hadn’t been seen since Oasis with Definitely Maybe. Alex Turner’s sardonic and keenly observational lyrics on songs like “Fake Tales of San Francisco” and “When the Sun Goes Down” had fans clamouring to get into their early shows. It was an early example of the power the internet would hold over the music industry – propelling them from an unknown indie band on MySpace to the top of the charts in the space of six months.Please Please Me has a rhythm to it like little else released by The Beatles. Songs like “Twist and Shout” and “I Saw Her Standing There” have an energy that reflects the youthful vim of the band themselves, who were raring to go following the number one single from which the album takes its name. Their harmonies are thrilling to hear, and this is arguably the best album for capturing the band’s raw power.335 33) Yeah Yeah Yeahs – Fever to Tell (2003)In 2003, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs stuck a middle finger up to the naysayers who scoffed that they were little more than a bunch of posers. Their debut album Fever to Tell is a bristling record loaded with New York snark supplied by Karen O’s impressive vocal turns. Nick Zinner keeps the urgency going with roaring guitar licks while Brian Chase offers earth-shaking percussion on the likes of “Date With the Night” and “Y Control”. More than trendsetters – the Yeah Yeah Yeahs were the brains behind the smartest album of that year.Kanye West called it “white crunk music”. The band themselves called it “music for girls to dance to”. And songs such as “This Fire” certainly livened things up their irresistible hooks and disco energy, as frontman Alex Kapranos turned the male gaze on its head with lyrics like “I can feel your lips undress my eyes”. Fifteeen years later and “Take Me Out” still makes you swing your hips.Blur versus Oasis is a battle music fans will be waging for decades to come, but when it comes to debut albums, Oasis emerge as top dogs. Definitely Maybe was exciting, aggressive and loaded with attitude: a 22-year-old Liam Gallagher spits and snarls over the reverb-soaked guitars of “Cigarettes \u0026amp Alcohol”, and soars on that falsetto for “Live Forever”. Among the “too cool for school” alt-rockers who spurned the glitz and glamour of fame, Oasis asserted themselves as the definitive rock and roll stars.Stefani Germanotta’s debut album The Fame brought maximalist pop back to the forefront of the late-Noughties music scene, in an industry that was desperately lacking in pop as. Lady Gaga already sounded famous and she acted famous – but that doesn’t mean her music couldn’t stand on its own. Songs like “Beautiful, Dirty, Rich” and “Just Dance” seemed to convey Gaga’s love of fame and hedonism while remaining supremely self-aware of its superficiality. To top it off, it was masterfully produced and resplendent with slick, catchy dancepop and Eurodisco influences.Kendrick Lamar subtitled his debut record “A Short Film by Kendrick Lamar”, and indeed it feels as though you’re watching the movie of his early life – such is the autobiographical nature of this record. He raps in low, furtive tones, interrupted by voicemails from his family (his mother asks him pleadingly to return her car) that reinforce the familial themes. It is family, and faith, that keep Lamar on the outskirts of a world of violence and sin. Even this early on his career you hear the virtuosity and acute understanding of rhythm – Good kid, m.A.A.d City now stands as a classic album from a rapper who chooses the power of storytelling over a cheap punchline.Not every great debut album is defined by whether the artist has landed on their “sound” by the first track. Led Zeppelin were still figuring things out when they released their self-titled debut, yet it is essential because it laid the groundwork for what they would go onto achieve the following decade. “We were learning what got us off most and what got people off most,” Robert Plant said. You had the blues and folk notes on “Babe I’m Gonna Leave You”, and the chugging rock of “Communication Breakdown” Plant’s yowling vocals and Jimmy Page’s guitar. It did the trick.935 27) The Jesus and Mary Chain – Psychocandy (1985)“It was the crap coming out of the radio that made us want to be in a band more than anything else,” Jim Reid told Rolling Stone for the 30th anniversary of the Scottish alt-rocker’s debut album Psychocandy. “Because it was like, ‘Why is everything we hear so f***ing awful?’ That was the main driving force: how bad things were.” Psychocandy was certainly like nothing anyone else released at that time. Inspired by the Velvet Underground and The Stooges, the Reid brothers loaded their debut with buzzy guitars and hair-raising levels of feedback on singles like “You Trip Me Up” and “Never Understand”. It paved the way for countless shoegaze and alt-rock bands in the decades that followed.Grace is a masterpiece, and the only album the perfectionist Jeff Buckley was satisfied with before he drowned, aged 30, in a freak accident in Memphis in 1997. Yet had Grace been the only material ever released under his name (live recordings, covers and demos were released posthumously), it would have been enough to prove he was a rare and exceptional talent. His exquisite rendering of Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah”, his melismatic singing on “Grace” and the church-like hush of “Lover, You Should Come Over” – all of this and more carved out a rich legacy that ensures Buckley’s music will never fade.The whipsmart, cynical, outrageous young man on Eminem’s major label debut was a breath of fresh air – or perhaps more of a slap in the face – after a spate of soulful, conscious hip hop records. Of course, the rampant misogyny and homophobia his so-called “character” Slim Shady spat out caused uproar, regardless of how surreal the scenarios to which they were applied were.  Arguably what stands out the most on The Slim Shady LP is the sheer technical skill and lyrical ability that few have been able to match since.Not only did it lay the groundwork for so many punk, rock and heavy metal bands that came after them – but the manic rhythms and raw intensity of their power-chord ballads featured on The Who\u0027s my Generation propelled rock and roll to new heights in 1965.“Saviours of rock and roll!” “The greatest rock band since the Rolling Stones!” You have to pity The Strokes, who released their debut album under the biggest wave of hype imaginable. Yet it’s hard to deny the impact Is This It had on rock music – critics have argued that the Arctic Monkeys and Franz Ferdinand wouldn’t have existed if not for this band. They eschewed pre-programmed beats and autotuned vocals in favour of a gritty post-punk approach, and the result was an album that reinvigorated a floundering music industry, and inspired an entire generation of bands.The idea of a rap album was virtually inconceivable until Run-DMC released their full-length, self-titled debut in 1984. When he inducted them into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Eminem called them “the first movie stars of rap… they are The Beatles”. Busta Rhymes proclaimed: “Run-DMC didn’t change music, they changed everything.” The trio’s aggressive yet stark tracks – like “Sucker MCS” and “Hard Times” – were a dramatic contrast against the R\u0026ampB-driven rap of the time, an approach emulated by the rappers themselves, who spurned outlandish costumes in favour of tracksuits and sneakers. As an anniversary piece in Billboard noted, “they were authentic before authenticity in hip hop was even a thing”.Brian Eno’s experimental synths met Bryan Ferry’s romantic, old-school charm on the debut album from Roxy Music\u0027s bizarre art-glam-rock outfit. There were odes to Humphrey Bogart (“2HB”) and cyber-rock jams (“Ladytron”), and songs decorated with spooky-sounding hooks that wouldn’t sound out of place in The Rocky Horror Show (the character Riff Raff even seemed to take his cues from a balding Brian Eno).Still regarded by many as his greatest album to date, Reasonable Doubt asserted Jay-Z as a master freestyle – perhaps the best of his generation – recorded in a studio he compared to a psychiatrist’s couch. At the heart of the record is a blistering duet with the Notorious BIG, “Brooklyn’s Finest”, which practically heralded the shift of focus back from West Coast hip hop to the East.Rolling Stone\u0027s Lester Bangs described the Black Sabbath as “just like Cream! But worse”, and their debut album as “a shuck – despite the murky song titles and some inane lyrics that sound like Vanilla Fudge paying doggerel tribute to Aleister Crowley, the album has nothing to do with spiritualism, the occult, or anything much except stiff recitations of Cream clichés”. The Village Voice weren’t keen either, with critic Robert Christgau condemning it as “bulls**t necromancy.” Yet this is the album that invented heavy metal. Black Sabbath arrived ready to lure fans over to the dark side with Ozzy Osbourne’s piercing, operatic cry: “My name is Lucifer, please take my hand.” Critics be damned.1835 18) Sex Pistols – Never Mind the Bollocks, Here\u0027s the Sex Pistols (1977)“The album will last. The sleeve may not,” said the adverts for the Sex Pistols’ first and only studio album in 1977. The Sex Pistols were already controversial before the release of Never Mind the Bollocks, having caused nationwide uproar for swearing on live TV, been fired from two record labels, and been banned from a number of live venues in England. Yet despite many major retailers refusing to sell it, the album debuted at number one on the UK album charts and is today regarded as one of the most important punk albums in music history.Joe Strummer was a ball of rage and ambition when he and the rest of The Clash laid down the tracks for their debut album. Most of the guitar on this record was provided by Mick Jones, because Strummer didn’t think technical ability was punk enough. Yet their vision burns through on the buzz-saw attack of “Career Opportunities” and “White Riot”, raising a fist against unemployment, racism and the fat cats of industry. 2035 16) Guns N Roses – Appetite for Destruction (1987)Guns N Roses\u0027 Appetite for Destruction was the biggest thing to happen to hard rock since Led Zeppelin IV. Slash’s guitar and Axl Rose’s wild, animal howls contribute to the raw energy on songs like “Paradise City” and marked a dramatic shift away from the commercialised heavy rock that was being played on MTV at the time – proudly championing a gritty form of hedonism instead. “A lot of rock bands are too f***ing wimpy to have any sentiment or emotion,” Rose said. Not this band.Daft Punk\u0027s Homework was originally intended as “just a load of singles”, until Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo realised they had enough quality tracks for a full-length release. Each one opens with a kind of motif upon which multiple textures build and sprawl outwards – sleazy guitar hooks, G-funk whines and glittering synths. It’s the album that alerted the rest of the world to the French house music scene.Sex and poetry go hand in hand, especially if you’re a Jim Morrison fan. While few bands manage to ide critical opinion as much as The Doors, their debut album’s organ-driven rock was as tight as their frontman’s famous leather trousers. They brought theatricality to the Sixties music scene and went onto inspire as broad a range of artists as The Stranglers to Skrillex. The baroque pop stylings and lustful lyrics on “Light My Fire” proved to be a breakthrough, and helped propel them to number two on the US Billboard 200.After making a name for himself on Jay-Z’s The Blueprint as well as by producing hits for Janet Jackson and Ludacris, Kanye West spent four years recording The College Dropout. His background as a producer was obviously beneficial to his own debut, at a time where hip hop sampling was being accused of being too safe. And he subverted many other hip hop clichés, skirting round the dominant “gangsta” persona and instead finding solace in family and the church.2435 12) Pink Floyd – The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967)Pink Floyd’s debut The Piper at the Gates of Dawn stands as a classic of psychedelic rock. Helmed by an unravelling Syd Barrett – ousted a year after the album’s release – it shows the band at their most playful, with several tracks going onto become staples of their live shows. Songs such as “Bike”, meanwhile, proved the band were not averse to a good pop hook along with the acid guitars and hazy production. 2535 11) Lauryn Hill – The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill (1998)Lauryn Hill raised the game for an entire genre with the immense and groundbreaking record, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill. Flipping between two tones – sharp and cold, and sensual and smoky – the former Fugees member stepped out from rap’s misogynist status quo and drew an audience outside of hip hop thanks to her melding of soul, reggae and R\u0026ampB, and the recruitment of the likes of Mary J Blige and D’Angelo. Its sonic appeal has a lot to do with the lo-fi production and warm instrumentation, often comprised of a low thrumming bass, tight snares and doo-wop harmonies. But Hill’s reggae influences are what drive the album’s spirit: preaching love and peace but also speaking out against unrighteous oppression. Even today, it’s one of the most uplifting and inspiring records around.2635 10) Dizzee Rascal – Boy in Da Corner (2003)It’s staggering to listen back to Boy in Da Corner and remember Dizzee Rascal was just 18-years-old when he released it. Rising through the UK garage scene as a member of east London’s Roll Deep crew, the MC born Dylan Mills allegedly honed his skills in production after being excluded from every one of his classes, apart from music. If you want any sense of how ahead of the game Dizzee was, just listen to the opening track “Sittin’ Here”. While 2018 has suffered a spate of half-hearted singles playing on the listener’s sense of nostalgia for simpler times, 15 years ago Dizzee longed for the innocence of childhood because of what he was seeing in the present day: teenage pregnancies, police brutality, his friends murdered on the streets or lost to a lifestyle of crime and cash. Boy in da Corner goes heavy on cold, uncomfortably disjointed beats, synths that emulate arcade games and police sirens, and Dizzee himself delivering bars in his trademark, high-pitched squawk.2735 9) Beastie Boys – Licensed to Ill (1986)Hip hop’s first number one album was an incendiary, all-guns-blazing record that would send shockwaves around the music industry for years to come. Few artists release something so assertive as this – a statement of intent to middle America that demanded they fight for their right to party. Beastie Boys\u0027 Mike D, Ad-Rock and MCA would move on from the frat boy humour and “good time” attitude of Licensed to Ill, but it is that record that delivered rap against a backdrop of Led Zeppelin and James Brown-inspired guitar licks.2835 8) The Notorious BIG – Ready to Die (1994)The rapper Notorious BIG, born Christopher Wallace, had been taking part in rap battles around Fulton Street, Brooklyn since he was 13 years old, but it was only at the urging of his friends that he quit a lucrative drugs operation and devoted himself to music. Living on a knife’s edge was all Biggie Smalls knew as a kid, when he was “waking up every morning, hustling, cutting school, looking out for my moms, the police, stickup kids just risking my life every day on the street selling drugs”, as he told Rolling Stone back in 1995. The things he witnessed and experienced were poured into Ready to Die – one of the best debut albums in hip hop – delivered in his signature throaty vocals with wit and humour.At less than 30 minutes, Ramones’ debut injects their rage, their disillusionment and their frustration directly into the listener’s veins. It’s a record that spurned the posturing of Seventies rock and stripped all of the artifice away to the bare bones beneath, with songs such as “Beat on the Brat” and “Now I Wanna Sniff Some Glue” proving to be as surly as the band themselves. “Our early songs came out of our real feelings of alienation, isolation, frustration – the feelings everybody feels between seventeen and seventy-five,” singer Joey Ramone said. The whole record cost just $6,000 to make.NWA unveiled their cold, menacing sound on debut record Straight Outta Compton that heralded the beginning of gangsta rap and also launched the careers of Dr Dre, Eazy-E and Ice Cube. The latter made it clear they weren’t positioning themselves as people to look up to: “Do I look like a mother***ing role mode?” he demands on “Gangsta Gangsta”. Their track “F*** tha Police” – a protest track against racism and police brutality – led to them receiving a threatening letter from the FBI, which only contributed to their growing fame.Dubbed the Banana Album for its famous Andy Warhol cover art, The Velvet Underground \u0026amp Nico is proof of what a band can do when they are completely fearless. With Nico – the beautiful German vocalist added to the band at Warhol’s request – you have this exquisite balance of cool femininity and fiery machismo. Sex and hedonism are everywhere on this record, from “Venus in Furs” to “Run Run Run”, but it’s not so much glamour as glam rock – gritty tales of drug addiction and raw desire. Speaking of its initially low sales figures, Brian Eno observed that, nonetheless, “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band”. David Bowie called it “the future of music”, and 52 years later, it still feels like it.A virtual unknown to rock fans just a year before – Jimi Hendrix used Are You Experienced  to assert himself as a guitar genius who could combine pop, blues, rock, R\u0026ampB, funk and psychedelia in a way no other artist had before. That’s even without the essential contributions of drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Noel Redding, who handed Are You Experienced the rhythmic bridge between jazz and rock. Few album openers are as exquisite as “Purple Haze”. Few tracks are as gratifying, as sexy, as the strut on “Foxy Lady”.  And few songs come close to the existential bliss caused by “The Wind Cries Mary”. Hendrix’s attack on the guitar contrasted against the more polished virtuosos in rock at the time – yet it is his raw ferocity that we find ourselves coming back to. Few debuts have changed the course of rock music as Hendrix did with his.“Jesus died for somebody’s sins, but not mine,” go the immortal opening words of Patti Smith’s debut album Horses. There’s a heady anticipation as she speaks the lyric in a low, seductive murmur, before switching to a cocky swagger as the electric guitar line kicks in. It was a bold move, to open her debut album with a reinvention of someone else’s song (in this case Van Morrison’s “Gloria”), but Smith was unlike anything the music world had ever seen. She was a poet, who wanted to capture the literary genius of her idol Arthur Rimbaud and channel it via the raw passion of an artist like Jimi Hendrix. “She was like a wildcat, walking out with this jacket slung over her shoulder,” Sonic Youth’s Thurston Moore once recalled of seeing her perform the album live in 1976. “It was life-changing.”How good can rap get? This good. There are albums where the myth can transcend the music not on Illmatic, where Nas vaulted himself into the ranks of the greatest MCs in 1994, with an album that countless artists since have tried – and failed – to emulate. Enlisting the hottest producers around – Pete Rock, DJ Premier, Q-Tip, L.E.S and Large Professor – was a move that Complex blamed for “ruining hip hop”, while still praising Nas’s record, because it had a lasting impact on the use of multiple producers on rap albums. Nas used the sounds of the densley-populated New York streets he grew up on. You hear the rattle of the steel train that opens the record, along with the cassette tape hissing the verse from a teenage Nasty Nas on Main Source’s 1991 track “Live at the BBQ”: ‘When I was 12, I went to Hell for snuffing Jesus.”Unknown Pleasures is unlike any album that had been created before it – or indeed any album since. It’s mysteriousness makes it as compelling as many great works of literature indeed, our critic Chris Harvey said the spiritual force emanating from the Joy Division\u0027s record\u0027s grooves make it feel “almost Dostoevskyan”. Peter Hook’s basslines veer and thrum wildly beneath Ian Curtis’s dark mutterings that are at once urgent, detached, and strangely sexless. On “She’s Lost Control” it as though you’re hearing the band play from the end of a dark tunnel – the echoes of Curtis\u0027s voice and the ominous rumblings of that bass build and build. By the time you reach those final, shivery notes on “I Remember Nothing”, it doesn’t feel like an overstatement to call this a life-changing record.The singersongwriter also added that the Brexit referendum nearly tore apart Madness.“Even in my band there were Brexiters and Remainers, like every family in the country,” he said. “We had punch-ups about all that.”Suggs voted to stay in the European Union, and also said in 2016 that the UK was on “a highway to hell” following the Leave victory.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I want to rebuild our country and the Labour Party.Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon is standing as a continuity candidate, flaunting his loyalty to Jeremy Corbyn and saying it is wrong to blame the current leader for the election defeatShe defended her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school and said she was opposed to the introduction of mandatory reselection votes for Labour MPs, which are supported by her rival Rebecca Long-Bailey.But she said she would not pick out any policy in Mr Corbyn’s manifesto for last month’s election as being “wrong”, criticising the package instead for being too ambitious and presenting a 15-year programme of change rather than a few priorities which would fit onto a Blair-style pledge card.I wish Jess Phillips was still in the race – she tells it like it isLeadership is hard- as the Labour candidates are suddenly finding outLisa Nandy’s attack on New Labour gives her a chance of victoryStarmer urged to ‘stand aside’ so party can have first woman leaderDespite Labour going down to its worst election defeat since 1935, Ms Thornberry said there was no need for an “existential crisis about who we are and what we stand for”.And, in a sign that the race’s outsider does not want to alienate Corbyn backers, she said she would pick a shadow cabinet of “all the talents” if she became leader.In a possible swipe at her rivals, all of whom entered parliament in 2010 or 2015, Ms Thornberry said she had not stood for leader before because she did not have the “proper experience”, but was now ready to try for the top job having been an MP for 15 years and held seven frontbench jobs.She said she would keep an “open mind” on future free movement for EU citizens after Brexit, arguing it should be decided on the basis of what would be best for jobs and the economy, which she said would involve being “close to the single market”.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But with utilities like water and energy, she said she would give companies a chance to show they can deal with problems like excessive profits if they wanted to avoid being taken back into public ownership.She said she would not scrap the HS2 high-speed rail link between London and the Midlands or the renewal of the Trident nuclear deterrent.But she refused to say whether she would press the nuclear button if the country came under attack, insisting that she would follow former prime ministers including Margaret Thatcher in keeping the UK’s enemies guessing about Britain’s strategy.After playing video footage of her smiling as Ms Butler said that “if anyone doesn’t hate Brexit, even if you voted for it, there’s something wrong with you”, Neil told Ms Thornberry that her expression showed she was sneering.She responded indignantly: “I was not sneering… I really object to this.“When they say that I sneer at people, they forget who I am and where I come from.”Ms Thornberry, who was brought up in a council house in Guildford by her mother after her parents’ orce and went on to become a barrister, has previously been forced to defend herself against allegations of sneering over a tweet apparently mocking a white van driver whose home was decked with England flags.She told Neil: “It is the prime minister who has said that blue-collar workers like my brother, who is a builder, are largely unemployed, have low self-esteem and are drunk.“He is talking about my brother. No-one says that Boris Johnson sneers at people.“Somebody like me who comes from a council estate and from a single parent background, I don’t sneer at people, I listen to them.”Ms Thornberry said she had been “laughing at Dawn saying the most extraordinary things”, adding: “I have never sneered and it’s not right to say so, and I do not accept that.”Challenged over her decision to send her son to a partially selective comprehensive school 14 miles away from their north London home, Ms Thornberry replied: “As a politician, what I want to do is make sure we have good schools up and down the country.“But as a mother, I will never apologise for doing the best for my kids. Any mother watching this will agree with me.“As the victim of selective education who failed her 11-plus and went to a secondary modern, I feel very strongly about this.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The varied landscapes and lives of residents wedged in these borderlands speak of two different systems that have coexisted on one another’s doorstep.Far from the marches and salvos of tear gas and petrol bombs over the past half-year of anti-government protests that have convulsed Hong Kong, the residents in this border realm have borne witness to both rapid urbanisation, as China booms, and the preservation of a slower pace of life.About 20 miles\u0026nbsplong, this boundary meanders between fish ponds, farmland, sleepy traditional villages and grassy hills on the Hong Kong side, with the gleaming skyscrapers of China’s high-tech city of Shenzhen on the other. Shenzhen, once itself the bucolic backwater, has risen into China’s giddy vision of a digital, high-tech future.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHong Kong is world’s most visited city in 2019We may have won the elections battle, but the war is ongoingHong Kong police ‘hack into more than 3,700 mobile phones’Mr\u0026nbspLam, now in his eighties, lives in a house without mobile phone reception, where he farms and catches crabs. A narrow sliver of water separates him from mainland China. He recalls living in a wooden cabin along the Shenzhen River\u0026nbspwith his family 70 years ago. There were only “old and broken” sheds on the far shore back then, he says, gazing into the distance. “Of course, the mainland is much more advanced than before. Everything is good, even the streets are beautiful.”Over past decades of political upheaval in communist China, waves of mainlanders flooded across the border into Hong Kong, seeking peace and a better life. Lam still remembers the flashlights of the British-run police piercing the dark as they chased illegal immigrants making a dash for freedom.Andrew Kwok, an old fish farmer living in the area, recalls those who drowned making the perilous crossing. “There were a lot of them, hundreds of dead bodies in the river,” he says.The flickering, lonely torches have now been replaced by a vibrant mega-city with a million flashing lights. The living quality for people on both sides may have converged, but a gulf remains. For these two peoples, it remains a struggle to reconcile shifting eras, values and dreams.Merrin Ke, 23, grew up in Shenzhen but got her masters degree from Hong Kong’s Polytechnic University. She had flitted easily between both sides, up until recently, when she moved to Shanghai. “I think the situation in Hong Kong is quite sensitive now, which is easy for people to have conflicts due to different political stands,” she says. “That’s why I’ve decided to leave Hong Kong to work and get away from the intense environment.”Even though the protests in Hong Kong show no sign of abating, Ke remains optimistic unity will overcome ision. She says: “Hong Kong people used to come to have fun in Shenzhen and people from mainland China also liked to visit Hong Kong. But now such things are becoming less and less. I still hope everyone can put differences aside, and it’s not enough for just one side to do this. It requires the joint efforts of both sides.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

She should have asked herselfshe was willing and able to behave in accordance with the expectations.Her Majesty’s words show great diplomacy but Meghan’s behaviour has so far not been diplomatic. A diplomat wouldn’t fall out with her own family.Her friends leaked negative comments about the “toxic” Royal Family. She also allowed damage to be done against our family via friends and PR advisers.She watched the media taunt and torture my dad, never springing to his defence like a true humanitarian would.Thomas was an incredible dad. He paid every penny of her education and cared greatly for her.He is now frail, with a heart condition. He doesn’t have a PR team to spin him a good story.The Queen, at , shouldn’t have had to face the stress of seeing her family torn apart.Meghan hasn’t stepped forward to minimise the damage.She knows how Harry leaving has affected them, but she hasn’t spoken up in their defence.Yet in her statement, the Queen says she is “particularly proud of how Meghan has so quickly become one of the family”.Her Majesty is building bridges there. It would be goodMeghan could do the same.She could have expressed her thanks for the kindness of the Queen and Prince Charles.She could have expressed gratitude to her own father or her first husband, Trevor, who gave her career opportunities.My sister has become a totally dferent person, choosing wealth and fortune over family.Her decision to leave is nothing to do with the behaviour of the royals, or race.Her marriage to Prince Harry was so symbolic of ethnic unity.The preacher and choir were all of African heritage. It was a lovely joining together.The royals embraced that. They welcomed Meghan into their lives, into the culture, and allowed her to promote people of all races. I have never heard anything racist coming out of the Windsors about my sister.Supporters who claim a racist element forced Meghan out are frustrated their hoped-for fairytale princess didn’t work out.These social equality-obsessed people had pinned their hopes on Meghan. They hoped for an equality of race right at the higher echelons of society.At least Harry and Meghan were right to decide tothe £.million they received to renovate Frogmore Cottage and not take any more public funds.In the Queen’s statement, she hopes Meghan and Harry can “start building a happy and peaceful le”. We have to hope for the sake of my sister and for the Royal Family that this agreement achieves that aim.My fear is Meghan’s decision isn’t about moving to Canada for a quiet le as a young mother.Nothing about their actions so far suggest they truly desire a private le out the limelight.They have paraded themselves on the red carpet, tried to make deals with Disney, and become pals with the Clooneys and other A-list stars.Smooching up to Vogue magazine, to fashion and to the film industry is not consistent with taking a step back.Their objective is fame and fortune — to be Hollywood.Meghan’s goals are not consistent with those of the Royal Family. Personally, I don’t believe she ever expected to fit in with the strict structures and traditions of the Windsor household.Even after marrying she kept her lawyer and publicity adviser, suggesting she wasn’t willing to sever her ties with her old le.Perhaps she always had the idea toto her le as an actress and lestyle influencer.In the statement from Buckingham Palace, it says “the Sussexes have made clear everything they do will continue to uphold the values of Her Majesty”.My concern is that this is a face-saving statement, which won’t work in reality. The Royal Family has always been opposed to merchandising and corporate endeavours outside of them.If Meghan and Harry want to honour the Queen, they will consult her before doing deals.She thinks she can be at the top of the world, but using the royals to get that international notoriety is tacky.Meghan was a cable TV actress before marrying Harry and would not be on the front of every newspaper and magazine without him.In the US, the Press is still positive, praising her attempts to modernise the British monarchy and saying how cool she is.The media in Calornia and New York are likely to remain in her corner but I don’t think Meghan and Harry will ever be able to overshadow Prince William and his we Catherine.They are exemplary they are iconic. There is no comparison.It is clear Meghan cares for Archie, but I do worry about his future. There doesn’t seem to have been a lot of consideration given to his cousins George, Charlotte and Louis and how often he will see them. Harry has put Meghan above his brother, father and grandmother. A house ided cannot stand.I am worried that Meghan and Harry will never find true ­happiness. They could not find contentment with the Royal Family, will they be able to find it away from them Maybe they will meet up with counsellors who can help them to heal the wounds.Perhaps they will make amends by apologising.We need sincerity and dignity from Meghan in order to find peace. Then, perhaps, she will have the peace she needs to go forward.I loved my sister, but I do not like the person she has become.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He warned the Left’s obsession is providing a cloak for crime.The Sussexes’ decision to quit was “not racism”, he told a cheering crowd. “We’re the most tolerant, lovely country in Europe.”Signicantly, the applause came not from the far Right but from right-on BBC Question Time — an audience carefully chosen, stressed presenter Fiona Bruce, to reflect Britain by age, sex and politics.Fox — famous as DS James Hathaway in TV’s Lewis — was instantly denounced as a “privileged white male” and therefore with no right to an opinion.“Oh, God!” he cried. “I can’t help what I am, I was born like this. It’s an immutable characteristic, so to call me a white privileged male is to be racist.”His landmark moment went viral.Ricky Gervais spoke for the silent majority when he told the Golden Globes nominees “who know nothing about the real world” to tear up their political speeches.But it took the furore over Megxit — and Fox’s unanswerable case for the defence — to trigger Britain’s own fightback.Fox has given a voice to ordinary, decent citizens who are incensed by finger-wagging know-alls smearing them as racists, Nazis and fascists.These ugly insults were hurled at millions who backed Brexit and the overwhelming majority who voted for Boris Johnson.Until now we’ve been too polite to fight back, gagged by Thought Police who bark: “You can’t say that.”So we put up with politically correct sniping from such “identity” obsessives as rapper Stormzy, MP Clive Lewis and the entire Labour Party, who smell racism under every rock.Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan sparked uproar when he challenged black and Asian commentators to produce a “shred of evidence” of Press racism. They failed.Fox’s one-man mission is more than a poke at the PC brigade. It is about free speech — and hypocrisy.Scattergun charges of racism offer an alibi to serious crime, he says, citing the Pakistani sex gangs who systematically raped and trafficked white victims across Britain — with police blessing.“It’s one of the dangerous things about throwing racism around,” the actor told Question Time.“People become so conscious of it that things like the Manchester grooming scandal get ignored.”He spoke as police finally confessed to deliberately turning a blind eye to decades-long vile abuse of vulnerable, underage white girls.A police report confirms a -year reign of sex abuse went unchecked after an unnamed chief inspector ruled: “With it being Asians, we can’t afford for this to be coming out.”Fear of the race card also partly explains why police failed to halt the slaughter of mostly black victims by mostly black kne gangs.The same “cultural cringe” stops prison staff tackling dangerous Islamist gangs who have seized control in Britain’s terror jails.It’s why forced marriage and honour killings go unchecked.Now, at last, black and Asian voices are bravely confronting the race zealots.Leading commentator and ex-Equality Commissioner Trevor Phillips, son of poor immigrants, condemns “feel- good” racism detectorists.“It might make ‘right-on’ white liberals feel better,” he says. “But the price of their smugness is an ongoing bloody massacre of black children.”Home Secretary Priti Patel, daughter of Uganda-Indian migrants, has declared war on the race industry.The BBC strenuously denies “institutional bias”, despite abundant evidence from within the Beeb itself – including from former Director-General Mark Thompson.Now Boris Johnson is in power and the bloated corporation’s £BILLION subsidy is at risk.Perhaps that’s why Question Time is now apparently balanced, Andrew Marr is being polite to Tory guests and on Radio ’s Today, Nick Robinson has gone almost silent.“We live in a great country, a land of opportunity for all,” she said. “Institutionalised, corrosive behaviour that disregards victims has to end.“Tackling this abuse is a priority for the Home Office. There will be no no-go areas.”At last, perhaps, we have a senior politician of colour who is prepared to follow Laurence Fox’s advice and “speak truth to nonsense”.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the contrary, it is an abdication that has sadly plunged him into turmoil.He is a man pulled in opposite directions, torn between patriotic duty and his deep love for his we, between his loyalty to the monarchy and his desire for a new, less constrained role.That explains why, throughout the recent crisis that he and Meghan inflicted on the House of Windsor, his stance has been so confused and contradictory.He speaks of his devotion to Britain but seeks a fresh start in Canada.He expresses his desire to serve but gives up the commitments that go with his position.He trumpets his yearning for privacy, yet he and his we appear keen to set themselves up as a millionaire celebrity couple - hardly the way to avoid attention.He continually wails about media intrusion, yet he resigns as Captain-General of the Royal Marines so he can spend more time on his social media accounts.He and the Duchess endlessly talk about their need for emotional support, yet they have shown little concern for the needs of their own families.Those inconsistencies were graphically exposed in the speech he made on Sunday night at a charity dinner in London to try and justy his recent conduct.His address was given in the immediate aftermath of the deal reached at Sandringham, where he and Meghan agreed to the loss of public funding and the use of their titles infor their independence.It was clear that the saga had exacted a heavy toll on him. In a voice often cracking with emotion, he told his audience that they would “hear the truth from me”.But what they actually heard was a catalogue of embittered anguish.As often, he moaned about the press, which he painted as a sinister, powerful force which needs to be curtailed.Unfortunately, despite all his professed love of Britain, Harry appears to have no understanding that a free, open media is essential to our democracy.He has proved unable to handle any criticism at all – even when it is justied, as in the hypocrisy of his green campaigning while indulging in the use of private jets.It is ashe thinks the media should be filled with fawning sycophants who never scrutinise but just lavish him with praise.That is the kind of regime that belongs to a totalitarian dictatorship, not traditionally liberal Britain.Much of Harry’s hostility to journalists stems from their relationship with his mother. But, however understandable, this is another myth.Princess Diana was not naïve when it came to the press. She was a shrewd, sometimes ruthless operator, who was quite willing to exploit the newspapers when it suited her.With some indignation, he complained that the Sandringham deal was not what he wanted. But it was foolish of him to believe that he and Meghan could have semi-detached Royal status, enjoying its privileges without its obligations.The Queen could never have tolerated that, especially because any commercial deals reached by the Sussexes could have badly compromised her family, just as their cherished fashionable causes could have undermined the Crown.Royalty cannot be a vehicle for self-enrichment or political posturing.The Duke’s inner agony was at its most obvious when he spoke of his regrets for the le he is leaving.Having revealed that he and Meghan were excited to “fly the flag and carry out our roles for this country with pride”, he referred to his “great sadness” at the step they have taken.Yet he claimed that they had “really no other option”. It was another moment of self-deceit, for there were certainly other courses open to them.They could have either stuck to their Royal positions without creating such a psycho drama about themselves, or,they really wanted freedom without scrutiny, they could have retired to live quietly as ordinary citizens, as some other members of the Royal family have done in the past.But such modesty would not have fulfilled their ambitions to be globe-trotting celebrities.It is this craving for fame that highlights the emptiness of Harry’s language about his devotion to service. “I will continue to be the same man who holds his country dear and dedicates his le to supporting the causes, charities and military communities so important to me,” he declared at the charity dinner.Yet this is the same man who was revealed to have touted his we’s voiceover skills to Disney bosses at the London premiere of the Lion King last summer.In the eyes of their critics, the real dedication that Harry and Meghan will probably soon show is to TV deals, book advances, and brand partnerships.In a further attempt to justy their actions, Harry implied that they had been suffering for a long time through the crushing restrictions of Royal le.The final move had been made, he explained, “after so many months of talks and so many years of challenges.”He and Meghan have only been married for  months. A true model of stoical determination, the Queen has been on the throne for almost  years without any public complaint.That just illustrates Harry’s lack of perspective. Insulated by privilege, he has little understanding of the lives of ordinary British citizens, many of whom have endured far greater struggles than anything he has ever experienced.After the Queen had been so publicly generous about him and Meghan in her statement from Sandringham at the weekend, saying that “they will always be much loved members of my family,” it was bad manners of Harry to complain about the deal he had just accepted.He should have responded to his grandmother’s generosity in the same spirit.But what’s done is done. Our monarchy has survived its latest crisis. The moment for recriminations has passed now that a new chapter is about to begin.As he settles in Canada, Prince Harry is bound to miss aspects of his old le in Britain, which even now he describes as “my home and the place I love.And the British public will miss him. At his best, he brought a lovable humour, spontaneity and lack of convention to the Royal Family.We can only hope that now, after taking this drastic decision, he finds the peace that he and Meghan crave.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Which makes Hall’s defence of the licence fee even more ridiculous.In an era of multiple-choice subscription TV it is absurd for one broadcaster to be funded by a tax enforceable by criminal penalty.It is even more laughable to claim it “ensures independence­ . . . obliges us to serve everyone and reflect every part of the UK”.Hall’s BBC spent his entire tenure turning a deaf ear to half the UK. Hence its shock at last month’s Tory triumph.Hall’s decision to rob over-s of the free licences he agreed to in  was equally outrageous.The idea that the £million cost will harm vital BBC services, when so much of its content amounts to needless competition with commercial rivals, is fatally flawed.His successor must run a smaller Beeb, more in touch with the public, less in the grip of suffocating “wokeness”, focused not on gratuitous expansion but the high-quality shows it does best.This new chief should accept that non-payment of the licence must be decriminalised and the levy finally replaced with a voluntary subscription.Only then will the BBC join the st Century.THE problem with Harry saying he and Meghan had no option but to move abroad to avoid our “powerful media” is that not a word of it is true.It is sheer paranoia to say the Press has done anything but legitimately scrutinise a publicly-funded couple.And the reality is they do not want to avoid media.

She left the body in the back bedroom.Rachel knew she killed the one-year-old female when she stopped kicking, a Phoenix police investigator wrote.Henry then chased her three-year-old into a back bedroom before smothering him.Rachel described singing to the three-year-old as he scratched her chest and pinched her, the report detailed.She next fed the seven-month-old female a bottle in her bedroom until she fell asleep.A court document said she sang her a song while killing her.The childrens little bodies were then placed on the living room couch as though they were taking a nap, the report says.A relative who lives at the house called police late Monday, and officers found the kids in a living room with no obvious trauma.Officers performed CPR on the little children but they were pronounced dead by paramedics.Detectives havent determined a motive for the childrens tragic deaths.The Maricopa County Medical Examiners Office will determine how they died.Theyre now trying to figure out what prompted Henry to commit such a senseless act.Court documents also say had the youngsters taken away from her - only to have them ed prior to the killings.A representative from the Maricopa County Attorneys Office said that Henry apparently admitted to having a history of addiction to methamphetamine and that her children were previously removed from her care.However, its likely this happened in Oklahoma before Henry moved to Arizona last year - as the Arizona Department of Child Safety told The Arizona Republic it had no previous contacts with the young mum.But court documents say she was not under the influence of drugs at the time of her kids deaths.Henry, who recently moved to Arizona from Oklahoma, was arrested Tuesday and charged with first-degree murder.Her next court appearance is Jan.  and shes being held on a million bond.Do you have a story for The US Sun team Email us at exclusive@the-sun or call   .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You have to be creative and aggressive and think two steps ahead of the celebrity.”And therein lies the rub. Largely stripped of his royal status, Harry is now a common-or-garden celebrity who has to take his chances with the rest of them in the jungle of hustling for work amid bustling premiere crowds.Then there’s news website TMZ and its myriad wannabe imitations. They’ll be dogging his every move with a video camera, hoping to catch a magical clickbait moment.Its website — together with a frenzied voiceover — is already jokingthat Meghan might sign up for The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills.As a former actress on cable show Suits,Meghan was of little interest to the Hollywood glitterati and the parasites that feed off them.But now  She’s gold-dust — particularly as her inner circle includes A-listers such as the Clooneys, Serena Williams, Oprah and the Obamas. And therein lies yet another rub. If you attend premieres of movies you’re not in, holiday on rich people’s jets and yachts and hang out at members-only clubs where the hoi polloi are only allowed in to clean up after you . . . then you are wilfully choosing a “celebrity le” and, with that, comes media attention, particularly from the Wild West of online.They need you for clickbait, and you need them to maintain the “popularity” upon which you trade and, without which, you are nothing .Unless, of course, you have a God- given talent like Meryl Streep, Judi Dench, Gary Oldman, Benedict Cumberbatch etc, etc — all of whom put on a suit frock when they have a film to promote but otherwise live a perfectly normal, unremarkable and, therefore, largely “peaceful le” unbothered by the media.Or a member of the British Royal Family who can retreat to one of their many estates for a spot of fishing and contemplation.So . . . “a more peaceful le” outside the protective environs of the monarchy  Dream on.But then, deep down, one suspects that Harry and Meghan both know that and are simply using it as a smokescreen for the real story.His we was homesick, found royal duties restrictive and dull and wanted toto her old le with royal knobs on.And because Harry loves her: “What Meghan wants, Meghan gets.”Good luck to them. Genuinely. But let’s not pretend they had no other option because of something this country did or didn’t do.HARRY and Meghan might be forced to ditch their proposed Sussex Royal brandThe Queen sees it as cashing in on their former royal status.As they’ve already registered it for everything from magazines to mugs, dropping it altogether could prove expensive.So perhaps a little tweak — to  Sussex Royle — might be an easy and appropriate compromise As the incomparable Jim Royle, aka Ricky Tomlinson, might say: “Have their cake and eat it  . .

I was not screened leaving Wahun, or in the UK. I didnt see anybody get screened. It would have made sense.Officials say they have no plans to introduce blanket temperature screening of all passengers – as the measure has failed in the past.Public Health England has upgraded the coronavirus risk to the UK from very low to low. The infection, linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, has spread to Thailand, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea and the United States.Prof Ferguson, from Imperial College London, is now forecasting up to , could become infected.He claimed up two people in every  infected could die, which is comparable to the Spanish flu outbreak of .That was the deadliest pandemic in recent history, wiping out million people worldwide.Prof Ferguson said the authorities are overwhelmed with suspect cases and are facing an extremely demanding situation in which numbers of those infected will continue to rise.It’s possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.“Two percent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish flu pandemic in , so it is a signicant concern globally.”Prof Ferguson warned the virus, which has an incubation period of seven days, may already have reached Britain.“We can’t rule out that possibility. Border screening, and in this case, in the UK, alerting the health system is not  per cent fool proof - there could be a mild case, he said.Its understandable countries want to try and reduce the threat by ious measures at the border. But the border will still be porous.There are three direct flights from the Chinese city of Wuhan - which has a larger population than London at  million - to Heathrow every week.The Department of Health and Social Care said that from today enhanced monitoring will be in place from all direct flights from Wuhan to the UK.The once buzzing city of Wuhan show it has been reduced to a ghost town as the authorities there ban all travel on public transport.Images from the Central Hospital of Wuhan show doctors in the intensive care unit wearing hazmat suits.At least  medics in the country have also been infected with the highly contagious bug while treating patients, officials said.Residents have been told not to travel, to avoid crowds and minimise public gatherings despite Chinese New Year being only three days away.Blue and white police tape flutters in the fog-heavy breeze beyond the shuttered gates of Huanan Haixian Shichang, a once-thriving market at the epicentre of the outbreak.The Chinese government initially tried to conceal the severity of that epidemic but its cover-up was exposed by a high-ranking physician.The virus attacks the respiratory system, causing lung lesions.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.It is incredibly contagious and is spread through contact with anything the virus is on as well as infected breath, coughs or sneezes.Symptoms include a runny nose, headache, cough and fever, shortness of breath, chills and body aches.In most cases, you wont know whether you have a coronavirus or a dferent cold-causing virus, such as rhinovirus.Buta coronavirus infection spreads to the lower respiratory tract , it can cause pneumonia, especially in older people, people with heart disease or people with weakened immune systems.There is no vaccine for coronavirus.In  an outbreak of a similar virus, SARS, infected more than , people in  countries before it was brought under control, killing  of those worldwide.The first case of the mystery illness in the US is set to be announced later today, federal sources said.A patient was hospitalised for pneumonia in America last week and had recently travelled to Wuhan, China where the respiratory disease was first spotted.The virus could be declared a global health crisis after cases of the mystery bug previously quadrupled in just four days.There are also reported cases in Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan and Thailand.And an expert warned the deadly new virus is one of the biggest global health threats. Scientists are frantically working on a vaccine to stop the spread of Wuhan coronavirus - but say it could be more than a year before its available.Dr Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, said a team of scientists in Texas, New York and China, are also working on a vaccine and are optimistic of success.He told the broadcaster: The lesson weve learned is coronavirus infections are serious and one of the newest and biggest global health threats.Every virus has its challenges, but coronaviruses can be a relatively straightforward vaccine target.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They also expose non-smokers to nicotine and other harmful chemicals.They are particularly risky when used by adolescents. Nicotine is highly addictive and young people’s brains develop up to their mid-twenties.Exposure to nicotine can have long-lasting, damaging effects.When askedvapes were less dangerous than regular cigarettes, the organisation would not give a definitive answer.They said: This depends on a range of factors, including the amount of nicotine and other toxicants in the heated liquids, but we know that e-cigarettes pose clear health risks and are by no means safe.Despite this, top doctors have hit back at the World Health Organisations comments, instead claiming that e-cigarettes are substantially safer.Dr Nick Hopkinson, Reader in Respiratory Medicine at the National Heart and Lung Institute Imperial College London, said: We know that e-cigarettes are substantially safer than smoking, because the toxic substances present in cigarette smoke are either completely absent, or present at much lower levels.Similarly, Prof Peter Hajek, Director of the Tobacco Dependence Research Unit at Queen Mary University of London slammed the World Health Organisation.He added: The WHO has a history of anti-vaping activism that is damaging their reputation. This document is particularly malign. Practically all the factual statements in it are wrong.Since  Public Health Englandhas encouraged smokers to switch to vaping, claiming it is  per cent safer than smoking tobacco.However it has since emerged that a study used by PHE to advise that vaping was safe was funded by the e-cigarette industry.And some experts have now questioned the  per cent figure and called for PHE to stop recommending e-cigarettes.Latest figures from the Department of Healthshow that one in  adults now vapes, and nearly one in five current smokers also uses e-cigarettes alongside normal cigarettes.Theyre not completely risk free, but they carry a small fraction of the risk of cigarettes.E-cigarettes do not produce tar or carbon monoxide, two of the most harmful elements in tobacco smoke.The liquid and vapour contain some potentially harmful chemicals also found in cigarette smoke, but at much lower levels.While nicotine is the addictive substance in cigarettes, its relatively harmless.Almost all of the harm from smoking comes from the thousands of other chemicals in tobacco smoke, many of which are toxic.Nicotine replacement therapy has been widely used for many years to help people stop smoking and is a safe treatment.Theres no evidence so far that vaping causes harm to other people around you.This is in contrast to secondhand smoke from smoking, which is known to be very harmful to health.Source: NHSThe proportion of youngsters who haven’t smoked but have tried vaping is increasing, the DoH said in its last report.Commenting on the new warnings, Prof John Newton, Director for Health Improvement at PHE told The : We continue to keep the evidence on e-cigarettes under review.However smoking kills half of le long smokers and accounts for almost  deaths in England every day.“If you don’t smoke don’t vape. Butyou smoke there is no situation where it would be better for your health to continue smoking rather than switching completely to vaping.The World Health Organisation, said there is ‘no doubt’ that e-cigarettes are harmful, but said it was too early to tell the long-term impact.They also warned that e-cigarettes can burn skin and rapidly cause nicotine poisoningswallowed or absorbed through the skin.They said there was a risk of the devices leaking, or of children swallowing the liquid, and have been known to cause serious injuries through fires and explosions.The experts said that for tobacco users looking to quit, there were other proven, safer and licensed products, such as nicotine replacement patches and gums and dependence treatments.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I dont want to move from this house.He now fears waking up with the sea in my bed each time he hears waves crashing against the clf - and is calling on the authorities to install a sea barrier.Other locals are appalled that some other coastal areas have been given defence schemes to protect against erosion.A £.million scheme, which has received £million funding from the European Regional Development Fund, is due to start in Withernsea this year.Councillor David Elvidge, who will chair Wednesdays meeting, said: With the amount of funding available, we can only really defend the large areas of population. Its a devastating thing.While fellow councillor Jane Evison is now calling on the Government to provide funding to help cover costs of relocating for residents, which she said can be as much as £,.She said: The council is in a position where theyre not allowed to defend a coastline and neither are the private householders, clearly theres erosion taking place, one or two homes are at very high risk, yet theres no funding.I dont think its a fair situation when were not allowed to provide any protection but were picking up the bill to keep people safe. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I wish that I could have been there with her. I was certainly appreciative Charles was there.Thomas added: I admit I cried a bit about that. To this day I cant forget that moment, she was beautul. It was a nice wedding.In the bombshell interview, filmed over a number of days at his home in Rosarito, Mexico, the American blasted his daughter and Harry for not supporting him.He said: To them I don’t exist.Harry is part of my family - we should be talking.Meghan was my most important relationship and my pride and joy.I miss Meghan. I miss who she was. I don’t know she is now. That’s the problem.When asked about taking money for interviews, the furious father-of-three blasted the royals treatment of him, saying: The royals owe me. Harry owes me. Meghan owes me.What Ive been through, I should be rewarded for.I’m in my senior years now. It’s time to look after daddy.”In the doc, Thomas reveals never-before-seen home movie footage featuring Meghan from the ages of  and .The video clips were filmed during a period when the Duchess of Sussex lived with her father - a period Thomas calls my happiest years.During footage of the Suits actress performing in a school play, Thomas says: I knew from the day she was born that she was going to be doing that. It didn’t become a surprise or a shock to me.The -year-old claims he took an active role in his daughters pursuit of acting, helping create better lighting for the plays.Speaking about his influence on his Meg during these years, he said: I gave her a sense of pride. I gave her a sense of duty and work.He slammed her picky claims that she supported him while insisting that he is comfortable living off a ,-per-month retirement fund in Mexico.Thomas does admit that Meghan, who he says became a multi-millionaire while working on Suits earning , per episode, once gave him , as a Christmas present.He continues: Ive only ever asked her for a couple of grand. I paid for her college. I paid for her credit cards. I paid for her apartments...The twice-married retiree also criticised the couple for not supporting him in the run-up to their high profile weddingHe said: Meghan and Harry said ‘we’ll protect you from this’.But their protection was to tell me ‘don’t talk to anyone’.The royal family never sent anyone here to give me advice. They never sent anyone for me.No one gave me any attention. Not that I need the attention but I might need the help.The -year-old spoke about the infamous paparazzi which he posed for and sold worldwide.He claims he was approached by a man claiming to be a PR expert who pitched the scheme to improve Thomas’ image.Megs dad said he had a feeling that the pictures would be hokey but the man assured him he knew what he was doing.He said: “He told me ‘they are going to love it and they are going to love you.“I didn’t do it for money. I did it to change my image.”He admits he is still making money off the images, adding: “The reality is that those images will sell forever.”Thomas confessed that he lied to Harry on the phone about posing for the pictures. “I’m not proud of that, but I did, he said.And when speaking about his grandson Archie, the -year-old hopes the child has his famous Markle nose.He said: I hope he has my nose because every time they look at Archie they’ll see me.The American-born retiree says the last time he spoke to Harry was on his hospital bed after he suffered a heart attack days before the royal wedding.He claims he told the prince: “It’s a shame I didn’t die because you both could pretend that you’re sad and then I hung up.I haven’t heard from them or spoken to them since.”Defending his decision not to travel to the wedding, he later added: If I didn’t treat the heart attack I wouldn’t be here now, according to the doctor.This comes as Harry was reunited with Meghan and son Archie in Canada after their bombshell decision to step back from royal duties.On Saturday the Queen confirmed that from the spring they will relinquish their HRH titles as they seek a more independent le in North America.Following that Thomas, , accused the couple of cheapening the institution of royalty, saying: They are turning it into Walmart with a crown on.He added: Every young girl wants to become a princess. She got that and now shes tossing it away.It looks like shes tossing that away for money.He has never met Prince Harry or his grandson, Archie.He told the broadcaster: I want everyone to know that Im not all the trashy things that are being said about me.I want Harry and Meghan to see this and know that this is not fair.Discussing the first time he heard his daughter was dating the sixth in line to the throne, he said: She calls me on the phone and she said Ive got a new boyfriend and I said Great and she says Hes British. I said OK, she said Hes a prince I said Alright she said Hes Prince Harry.I said Oh, OK. I didnt know what it meant. She could have been dating a Hollywood star and it would have been just as important to me, because you know either way they are both high numbers.He later found out his daughter was pregnant - when he heard the news on the radio.Thomas recalled: I was sitting in my car waiting to cross the border and I heard the good news from the royals is that Meghan is pregnant. Which is almost a joke when you tell people, well you heard it on the radio.This is my daughter, talking about my grandchild. Shes going to have a grandchild thats mine. Im not hearing about it on the phone, Im hearing about it on the radio.Thomas was then unable to attend his daughters wedding ceremony due to ill health. Prince Charles agreed to walk his future daughter-in-law down the aisle in his place.In a direct message to Meghan and Harry, he said: I apologise to you. I want to apologise to the queen and to the royal family. I want to do that and I was told by them, dont. And I was scheduled to go to the airport and go fly to England because they still wanted me to come to the wedding and be at the wedding.And at that time I got a massive heart attack and was then taken to the Sharp hospital, across the border.Buckingham Palace confirmed on Saturday that Harry and Meghan would no longer be working members of the royal family.Responding to that, Thomas accused the couple of destroying one of the greatest long-living institutions ever and cheapening it.He said: They couldnt have done anything worse to harm the Queen - probably the most loved and respected woman in the world.He added: I cant see her reaching out to me, especially now - or Harry for that matter.But I think both of them are turning into lost souls at this point. I dont know what theyre looking for.

Most seasonal flu viruses have a case fatality rate of less than one in , people.“Here we’re talking about a virus where we don’t understand fully the severity spectrum, but it’s ­possible the case fatality rate could be as high as two per cent.Two per cent case fatality rate is comparable to the Spanish flu pandemic in , so it is a signicant concern globally.”Prof Ferguson warned the virus, which has an incubation period of seven days, may already have reached Britain on the three flights a week from Wuhan.He said: “We can’t rule out that possibility. Border screening, and in this case in the UK alerting the health system, is not foolproof.”Ministers have ordered a clampdown on flights arriving from Wuhan to London, with a team of medics there to meet them.Planes will now land in an isolated area of Heathrow Terminal  to limit the potential spread.Officials have no plans to introduce blanket temperature screening of all passengers – but checks could be expanded to other flights.Passengers arriving from Wuhan were today given a leaflet ­advising them to seek treatmentfeeling ill.But one said: “I thought there would have been more screening.”Chinese authorities have told people to stop travel in and out of Wuhan and are tomorrow due to shut down the city’s airport.The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is now advising against all but essential travel to Wuhan.A spokesman said: “We advise British nationals travelling to China to remain vigilant.”Scientists from China’s Peking University last night said the latest genetic analysis suggested the virus passed from bats to snakes and then on to humans.Snakes were sold at the Wuhan seafood market where the virus is thought to have originated.Public Health England have upgraded the risk to the UK population from “very low” to “low”.Dr Nick Phin, of PHE’s National Infection Service, warned travellers to Wuhan: “You should maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene and should avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people with respiratory symptoms.“Iniduals should seek medical attentionthey develop respiratory symptoms within  days of visiting Wuhan, either in China or on theirto the UK.”A health source said a “handful” of samples have been sent in but have all so far ed negative.The virus causes a type of pneumonia and can pass from person to person via coughing and sneezing.Initial symptoms include fever, cough, tightness of the chest and shortness of breath.There are no specic treatments for the virus and experts say thousands may already be infected.Scientists are currently working to develop a vaccine and a bedside diagnostic test.People across China have been avoiding public places, such as ­cinemas and shopping centres.One patient was seen being wheeled into a hospital in a sealed-off tube in Huizhou.Dr Andrew Freedman, from ­Cardf University, said: “It is likely that further cases will be seen in other countries around the world, including the UK and Europe, in the days and weeks to come.”BILLIONS could be wiped off the world economy this yearthe virus spreads, City experts warned yesterday.Stocks in airlines and tourism companies are likely to be sold off firstthe bug takes hold.Russ Mould, of City stockbroker AJ Bell, said luxury goods big in Hong Kong and China, such as fashion firm Burberry, could also

Once they’re gone, you can’t regenerate pigment any more. The damage is permanent.”It was said Queen Marie Antoinette’s hair turned white the night before she was beheaded in the French Revolution.Former US presidential candidate John McCain, went white from severe injuries as a prisoner during the Vietnam War.And Prime Ministers Tony Blair and David Cameron went grey early with the strain of the job.The latest findings come from researchers at Hard University.They had thought hair went grey because of an immune system response or a reaction to stress hormone cortisol.But mice lacking immune cells or the gland which produces cortisol still turned grey.Instead, the researchers realised the sympathetic nervous system was probably to blame.Lead study author Dr Bing Zhang said: “Acute stress, particularly the fight-or-flight response, has been traditionally viewed to be beneficial for an animal’s survival.“But in this case, acute stress causes permanent depletion of stem cells.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Doug McCallum and Charlotte Middleton, both , got the keys to the three-bedroom property in July , but say they have been in dispute with developers Persimmon Home ever since. They claim the upstairs toilet didnapost flush properly and, after repeated attempts to fix this, an eight-inch metal rod was found stuck in the plumbing, according to Chronicle Live. Since then, a hole in the ceiling and a leak at the home in Wallsend, North Tyneside, have angered the couple. Charlotte, who is due to give birth on February , and Doug have now told of their frustration at Persimmon Homeaposs service. Doug said: The new plumber cut a hole in my ceiling and took out the pipes and found an eight inch metal rod stuck in the bend of the pipe. I was shocked and outraged. Safe to say this definitely wasnapost our fault. They have just been unbelievable. This is not what we thought we would be buying. The aftercare team are awful. It took five visits from plumbers to discover the rod in the pipes, he claims. A plasterer recently filled in the hole in the ceiling with Polyfilla but, due to it still being wet, he was unable to paint.  Doug has had to take several days off as annual leave for the appointments to get completed. And in December, after forking out £, for a shower and shower screen to be installed in their new build home, Doug noticed there was a leak coming from the bath. But when he contacted Persimmon he claims they told him they would not fix the problem after their two-year warranty expired. He said: I took the side  off and there was quite a lot of water stains, so this had obviously been happening for a while.  The leak was persistent. I explained to them about how it was obviously an incompetent plumber who was working on my house that day. I said I had purchased the shower for over a grand, and all of the issues we have had with that room but they werenapost interested. The bathroom is over our living room and we were worriedit went through the ceiling downstairs. Persimmon acted by sending out plumbers and a labourer to reseal the bath before fitting a new shower screen. Despite the work now being carried out, the couple have said they will never use Persimmon Homes again. Doug added: Theyaposd be lucky to get a one out of  from me for what they have put us through. We will definitely be moving house. We used to Help to Buy to purchase our home so after our first five years of interest free is up weaposll be going where. A spokesman for Persimmon Homes said: “We are sorry the customers are unhappy with the service they have received from Persimmon Homes. While we understand it is an inconvenience to have works carried out within a home we have acted swtly to attend their concerns and to make good in a timely fashion.

Murderers, torturers, hardened criminals… but, to their mother, Violet, twins Ronnie and Reggie Kray were her “lovely boys”. It was a sentiment shared by the identical twins themselves. “They were classic narcissists... image was important to them,” says world renowned criminologist David Wilson, who took a fresh look at their le and crimes. Wilson, a professor of criminology at Birmingham University, adds: “The Krays were very able manipulators. “There is still a fascination with them and the organised crime associated with them from the s.” They were arguably the most notorious criminals of the decade, heading a criminal empire, built on intimidation and brutality. When they moved to Bethnal Green from nearby Hoxton as children, Ronnie and Reggie quickly became involved in juvenile crime. Both were promising amateur boxers. Yet this and National Service in the Army did little to instil discipline or control the violence that would become their trademark. In the s they first moved into “protection” – demanding money with menaces from businesses who would face brutal reprisals for not paying up. And it paid off handsomely for the twins. By the following decade, their Firm had spread its operations west, open gambling club Esmeralda’s Barn in wealthy Knightsbridge. There they wined and dined celebrities, including Judy Garland and Barbara Windsor flocked to the club.It is said Reggie, the charming one, could have been a straight businessman, but his brother’s psychotic tendencies made that impossible. Ronnie loved the gangster image, insisting the pair had identical suits and slicked-back hairstyles. Unlike most villains the pair revelled in the spotlight. “They came managed to create an image for themselves in a way that nobody  had done,” says criminology lecturer Dr Ruth Penfold-Mounce of York University. “Most criminals become famous when they get go to jail. They achieved it while they were still active.”  When rumours about homosexual Ronnie’s friendship with Lord Boothby surfaced in  he became front page news on the Sunday Mirror. A portrait of the twins taken by David Bailey cemented the twins’ position in the public consciousness. Despite their growing fame, they continued their reign of terror, seemingly beyond the reach of police. But the law finally caught up with them as their ruthlessness reached new heights.  First, Ronnie shot George Cornell in Whitechapel’s Blind Beggar pub in . “He was a drunkard and a bully and I done him,” Ronnie would later say. “Me – not my brother.” In December that year, the Krays, helped Frank Mitchell escape from Dartmoor Prison. Once out, they put him in a friend’s flat in East Ham. But Mitchell, known as the “Mad Axeman”, became hard to control. He disappeared without a trace. Then, in , Reggie murdered Jack “The Hat” McVitie, a minor member of the Firm who had failed to fulfil a contract to kill Leslie Payne."},{"url":null,"title":"i saved 1300 thomas cook","story":"NewsI saved £, for a Thomas Cook honeymoon - and Ill never get my money backEXCLUSIVE: Newlywed Sophie Fleetwood and her husband, Luke, were saving to go on a honeymoon to Mexico with Thomas Cook, but their online account was wiped out when the firm went bustShareCommentsByChris Kitching:,  JAN Updated:,  JAN Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news uk-news video emotional-flight-announcement-thomas-cook-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:,],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror News , options :,prebidWithConsentFix:,bundledCss:,consentCookies:DUMMY_COOKIE,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,monitizer:true,bypassGigyaFacebook:true,irisTvEnabled:true,readMoreWithImage:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,newsletterSiteName:Mirror,webPushNotications.vapidKey:BIMdLGTRxWItGNgYH-IevvvPAfSGnSGMbEogpRLhlaxavxCsahFjMSLo-p-rpFEEXeJaicdhYfVcs,webPushNotications.serviceName:airship,hidePreviewImage:,readNextRecommendation:https:recommendations.data.tm-awx fallback,webPushNotications.token:MTpnTjceHdLcJpTZkMkDNnZBYXRROmdsYkVYxRFIXgSWmTVRYlAtXJvVXVuZDZZZJtXJRMmpTE,videoHeaderBiddingEnabled:,irisAutoplayVideosMax:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,webPushNotications.appKey:gNxwKsRiOVdMCvAatQ,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,changeWhatsHotTitle:Most Read,monitizerScriptUrl:https:link.monetizer widget code mirror.js,GDPRConsentEnabled:,mvtTests.enable:,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,spotxVideoPrebidEnabled:true,externalBrandCSS:true,groupmDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,displayPrebidEnabled:true,ixVideoPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,manualReconsent:,ozoneDisplayPrebidEnabled:true,nativeAppBanner:true,video.imaVersion:,videoPrebidEnabled:true,prebidWithoutConsentFix:true,video.suppressDates:true,parentUrl:https:www.mirror news uk-news i-saved--thomas-cook-\"\" to FREE daily email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWe will use your email address only for sending you newsletters. Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee ourprivacy noticeInvalid Email A pair of newlyweds who saved £, for a dream honeymoon with Thomas Cook will likely never get their money back.Sophie and Luke Fleetwood had set up a honeymoon fund on the travel firmaposs website and were accumulating gt cards with help from generous family and friends. They had managed to collect £,, which was sitting in a Gt of Travel account on Thomas Cookaposs website, but the funds were lost when the firm went bust last September. The Fleetwoods, who have three children, were planning a two-week trip to Mexico to give them some much-needed alone time - and now they might not go on a honeymoon at all. For months they had been contacting firms involved in Thomas Cookaposs insolvency and waiting to find outthey would get their money back. But it appears they will not get any money back because gt card holders are unsecured creditors. Sophie, , told : We are thinking of wiping a honeymoon out of our heads as we just can’t afford to pay the total cost, hence the honeymoon fund to help towards it.  We had set up the honeymoon fund via their website. So our wedding guests, friends and family paid into this account. And we’ve supposedly lost all the money. No-one is getting back to us about it all. The stay-at-home mum, whose children are aged one, three and four, added: We felt absolutely devastated [when Thomas Cook ceased trading].  We are parents to three children aged under five, so knowing we had lost all of that money, which would have helped us go on our honeymoon, was quite upsetting. She said she has followed the refund advice listed on Thomas Cook and Government websites, adding: We don’t know what  to do now really.  Sadly, it appears the money put into the Gt of Travel scheme will never be ed because gt card holders are unsecured creditors in the insolvency process. Sophie and gas engineer Luke, , who tied the knot at Silchester House in Reading in May last year, were accumulating gt cards, including those donated by family and friends, to put towards a trip.  Unlike the hundreds of thousands who have already been refunded because they were ATOL protected, the Fleetwoods hadnapost yet purchased a holiday and their savings were in the form of gt cards. After the firm collapsed, customers who had Thomas Cook gt cards were told they were likely worthless, but to register as a creditor in a bid to claim the money back. They were warned they might not get anything back.  If they do, it could be just a fraction of the value. For gt cards purchased using a credit or debit card, people might be able to make a claim to their credit or debit card provider. The Fleetwoods have registered as a creditor, but they were recently told in an email: At this stage, there is no further update available in respect of s to unsecured creditors. On its website, Money Saving Expert wrote: If you have a Thomas Cook gt card, you will have to register as a creditor in a bid to try and claim some money back from Thomas Cook – but bear in mind that youaposll join a long list of creditors, many of whom will be owed a lot of money by the business.You may well not get anything back via this route, andyou do, expect it to be a fraction of the value of the gt card. Earlier this month, the Civil Aviation Authority said it had settled more than  per cent of all the claims it had received from people who had booked holidays that were ATOL protected.

Kate spoke candidly about her experience as a first-time mum living in Anglesey with a tiny, tiny baby during a visit to a childrenaposs centre in Cardf on Wednesday. After arriving at the centre, Kate said it was nice to be back in Wales before telling her hosts: “I will have to remember my Welsh!” The Ely and Caerau Children’s Centre is located in an economically deprived area of the city and offers a welcoming environment for parents and kids. Kate said: “If only I had had a centre like this. It was the first year and I’d just had George – William was still working with Search and Rescue and we came up here and I had a tiny tiny baby in the middle of Anglesey it was so isolated, so cut off. I didn’t have any family around and he was doing night shts. During the visit, Kate also mentioned Charlotte and Louis, adding: “We will be taking a trip down to Anglesey at some point.” Kate spoke to several parents about the centre and the facilities it offers to locals.  Speaking to mum Rhi, , who uses the centre with her -month-old daughter Eleanor Logue, Kate said: So many families now are so spread out. “It’s much harder to rely on other generations for support.” Rhi told her: “You can come here and tell people, ‘I haven’t slept’. “And everyone  is like, ‘I haven’t either!’” laughed Kate.  “It normalises it. No one is going to judge you for it. And it’s a social thing for you.” Afterwards Rhi said: “We talked about post-natal depression and how hard it is to have a kid and how important centres like this are. I would have been in such a dark place without it. “It’s lovely to see her in a place like Ely. It’s such a deprived area and there have been so many funding cuts. Sometimes you are scared to walk the streets, but coming here you feel safe. You don’t feel like you are going to get mugged.” In another room, Kate was charmed by -month-old Indie Corten-Maynard and one of her two mums Estelle Corten.  Estelle said: “She was asking me what it was like coming here as a same-sex couple and I told her how welcoming the centre has been. “It was amazing to have the future Queen here in Ely!” In the English language part of the centre’s bilingual nursery, Kate sat down with older children who were playing with dough and joined them in making doughballs as she was told how the children spend lots of time outdoors. One little girl told her: “We are talking about your nursery! It’s so cool I would love to come here. What’s your favourite thing about it  Do you like playing outside ”  She then took the little girl by the hand and asked her to show her the outdoor area, stopping to meet the resident guinea pigs Willow and Bella in a wooden hut, appropriately bearing the sign “Cath’s Cottage” She crouched down to stroke the black-and-white pet, Willow, telling the children: “I had guinea pigs when I was little. I think your nursery is the best. She’s so soft, isn’t she ” Watching as the children fed them carrots and sprouts, she joked: “I did not know that guinea pigs liked Brussels Sprouts!” Introducing herself to another group of youngsters who were drawing, Kate said: “Nice to meet you, I’m Catherine.  These guinea pigs are a lot quieter than the ones I had at home!” She told Carolyn Asante, head of the centre: “They are so happy in there! It’s like their own little world.” In the centre’s Welsh medium nursery, Kate was presented with flowers and a drawing of herself by four-year-old Erin Jones, who briefly hesitated when prompted to hand them over. “Are you shy ” asked Naomi Asante Chambers, a senior teaching assistant.  “Don’t worry, I am too,” the Duchess told the little girl. “Is this my dress ” she asked, pointing at the drawing. “I love your hair, I should have done mine like that today. I love the drawing too, thank you! Thank you so much, what a special morning I have had.” She also joined three-year-old River Roson, who was playing with pretend food.

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are now spending time in Canada after stepping away from royal le. They reached an agreement with the Queen and senior royals and in a statement issued on Saturday it was revealed they would no longer use their HRH titles.Harry and Meghan will also repay the £.million of taxpayersapos money they used to refurbish Frogmore Cottage in Windsor.It remains unclear thoughHarry and Meghan will be required to strip the word aposRoyalapos from their SussexRoyal website, and who will pick up the hefty bill for their continuing security requirements. In a statement earlier this month, the couple had said they wanted to become financially independent after aposstepping backapos as senior royals. From the spring they will no longer be working members of the royal family and will not perform any official duties on behalf of the Queen. Harry, Meghan and Archie are also planning to spend most of their time in North America and are expected to make a fortune in their new roles. But the couple are far from the first royals to earn their own living - although some have managed it with more success than others. Hereaposs how the other members of The Firm have fared. The Earl and Countess of Wessex Before becoming full-time royals, Edward and Sophie tried to carve out dual roles, combining working in business with royal duties - but it ended in disaster. Sophie, who co-ran a public relations firm, R-JH, was tricked by a fake sheikh undercover reporter offering a lucrative contract. She hinted he would get greater publicity because of her royal role. Edward had his own television production firm called Ardent. Many of its films dealt with the royal family and its history but it made substantial losses. The earl sparked a bitter feud with his brother the Prince of Wales when one of his crews were found filming at St Andrews University shortly after Prince William began studying there. It was in direct defiance of a request for the media to leave the young prince alone. Stricter guidelines on royal business activities were introduced after a palace review following the Sophiegate scandal. In the end the Wessexes gave up their businesses to become full-time royals in . The Duke of York Prince Andrew has been accused of exploiting his previous role as Britainaposs trade envoy to further his financial interests. A Mail on Sunday investigation claimed the duke had conflicts of interest between multi-millionaire property developer David Rowland and his role as the UKaposs special representative for international trade and investment. But Buckingham Palace insisted the duke was promoting British interests and not the interests of iniduals while in the post. The duke earned himself the nickname Air Miles Andy for his lavish use of helicopters and other aircraft at public expense. In , he sold his Sunninghill Park mansion - a wedding present from the Queen - for £ million more than its £ million asking price to the son-in-law of the president of Kazakhstan. Andrew stepped down from public royal duties amid the Jeffrey Epstein scandal, but it is not known what his future working plans will be,any. The Queen uses an unknown amount of her £. million a year Duchy of Lancaster income to partly fund her second son. The Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton gave up working for her parents party paraphernalia firm when she married Prince William in . She was previously a part-time accessories buyer for the fashion chain Jigsaw, owned by friends of her family Belle and John Robinson. Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie Andrewaposs daughters Beatrice and Eugenie are not full-time working royals and both have their own jobs. Beatrice is vice president of partnerships and strategy at Afiniti, an articial intelligence software firm, while Eugenie is a director at the contemporary art gallery Hauser  Wirth in London. They do have some charity patronages and sometimes appear at royal events such as palace garden parties and Trooping the Colour. Eugenie accompanied the Queen to a Royal Maundy service last year. It is likely that as HRHs, they may have to consult the Lord Chamberlain before taking on new business activities - a rule which forms part of the guidelines for working royals. Peter Phillips The Queenaposs eldest grandson runs the UK arm of events and sponsorship agency Sports and Entertainment Ltd , after a previous career working for RBS and in Hong Kong on a Williams Formula One sponsorship deal. Mr Phillips, who is not an HRH and does not carry out royal duties, has also appeared in an advert for milk in China, the Daily Mail revealed. Questions were raised in  when Mr Phillipsaposs agency staged the Patronaposs Lunch street party for the Queenaposs th birthday. It was Mr Phillipsaposs idea, but the event was not put out to tender. SEL Ltd was paid £, for organising the celebration, but the Patronaposs Fund charity defended the payment, saying there were running costs and Mr Phillipsaposs company had made no profit. He was criticised in  for selling photos of his wedding to Canadian bride Autumn Kelly to Hello! for a reported £,. Zara Tindall The Queenaposs granddaughter Zara Tindall has forged her own career as a champion equestrian. She has won an Olympic medal and secured numerous brand ambassador deals, including with Land Rover, Rolex, iCandy prams and clothing brand Musto. Zara has her own range of equestrian-inspired jewellery with Calleija, including saddle-shaped cufflinks and coronet rings. But she has no royal title and is much further down the line of succession than her cousin Harry. Mike Tindall Not a royal as such, but an in-law of the royals, Zaraaposs husband, former England rugby player Mike Tindall, has been able to pursue his own work in the limelight. He appeared as a contestant on the Channel  show The Jump, and on Bear Grylls: Mission Survive, shown on ITV. Tindall revealed he does not have to ask permission from the monarchy before taking on a public role but does think about possible consequences for the royals. He said: That would always come up, yes, of course, but ultimately itaposs what we want to do first. Princess Michael of Kent Married to the Queenaposs cousin Prince Michael of Kent, the controversial Princess Michael of Kent does not carry out royal duties. She is the author of a number of books, including The Cheetahaposs Tale and the Serpent And The Moon. The princessaposs own website describes her as a writer, historian, lecturer, interior designer and art consultant.  The Kents sparked a scandal in  when it emerged they paid a peppercorn rent of £ a week for their grand apartment in Kensington Palace. Dubbed the Rent-a-Kents, the couple were criticised for being subsidised by the taxpayer when they did not carry out official royal duties. The Queen later paid the full £, rent on their behalf for the next few years, but the deal did not last forever and they eventually had to take over the cost in .

Robyn Emma, , met Dlair Mahmood at a nightclub in Nantwich and agreed to a nightcap at his house as it was just a few streets away from a friendaposs where she was staying. But Robyn, who was studying criminology and criminal justice at Bangor university, was so tired that she fell asleep fully-clothed on Mahmoodaposs bed and only stirred when he began undressing her. Mahmood - who told her he was a -year-old widower called Alan - began undoing her bra then flipped her onto her back. Terried Robyn realised there was a lock on his bedroom door and didnapost know how to escape. Robyn, who bravely waived her anonymity to tell her story, said: I was scared he would kill meI stirred. I came round and realised what he was doing but I thought he would panicI opened my eyes. There was a laptop right next to us and I was convinced heaposd hit me over the head with it or strangle me. When Robyn thought the ordeal was coming to an end, she acted as she was awaking. There was no kissing, no touching, although he undid my bra, and it hurt. I was crying inside but I forced myself to act asI was asleep and not react because I thought Iaposd never see my mum againI did, she added. When I thought it was almost over, I began to act like I was waking up. I made a noise and he jumped off me, and by the time I slowly woke and eventually opened my eyes he was dressed and sitting down. I was petried he was going to strangle me so I had to act asnothing had happened.  Forcing herself not to panic or to look flustered, Robyn told Mahmood she was tired and said she would like to go home. Mahmood unbolted the door and insisted heaposd drive her home - just three streets from where she was staying. She added: He had a lock on the door and as soon as he opened it I wanted to bolt out, but I couldnapost as he would suspect I knew, so I forced myself to walk slowly. She didnapost want him to know the house where she was staying, so told him to drop her a few houses away. When she was safely in her friendaposs house, she saw a chilling text message from Mahmood saying aposDonapost forget you let me do itapos. Robyn immediately told her friend sheaposd been raped then called the police who asked her to show them the house where sheaposd been attacked in Crewe, Cheshire. She was also examined at a rape specialist in Manchester.  It wasnapost long before Robynaposs fears were confirmed about Mahmood, as he carried out an attack on a man where he cut him aposlike a pigapos. Mahmood, who was  at the time he attacked Robyn, had become defensive after a man confronted him about an offensive text message. He stabbed the victim through the lung and gashed his arm so deep it revealed muscles and tendons. The victim was so certain heaposd die, he said goodbye to his girlfriend. Luckily, he survived but called Mahmood aposa devil.apos Warrington Crown Court sentenced Mahmood to five years for raping Robyn and  years for the stabbing. He has also been added to the sex offendersapos register and has an indefinite restraining order against her.  During the trial at Warrington Crown Court, Robyn had to re-live the nightmare twice after the jury failed to come to a unanimous decision. Robyn cried when she heard the verdict, but was determined to try again.  She added: Yes Iaposd been drinking at the club but drinking isnapost a crime - rape is. She then chose to waive her anonymity in a bid to get justice at a re-trial at Liverpool Crown Court. She was on the stand for  minutes during the two-day trial and the jury unanimously found Mahmood guilty of rape. Robyn, who believes Mahmood should have got longer for the crime as it left her le in tatters, said she couldnapost hug her dad for a year and gave up her dream of working in criminology because of the rape. I didnapost trust anyone and had severe anxiety and depression, she said.

The grotty weather continues throughout the UK with driving conditions continuing to be perilous despite the cold snap having lted. New weather fronts are moving in, the most striking of which could see snowfall after the weekend, but not before an almighty downpour and an awkward blanket of fog. After a cold night, Thursday will see a lot of low cloud, mist and fog in places, according to Met Office forecaster Luke Miall. It will be quite grey, quite gloomy, he added. BBC meteorologist Stav Danaos said high pressure remains pushing into the northwest of Scotland to bring more substantial rain, while much of the country will have to contend with mist and murk, and the odd shower. And while there are no weather warnings in place for the foreseeable future, the rains are bringing with them  flood alerts across England, as per the Environment Agency. Pretty dense through the morning and it will tend to lt into low cloud, he said of the thick band of fog expected. A lot of cloud around but the best of any breaks again, northeast Scotland and northeast England where it will turn quite mild into the afternoon. And this front is set to bring substantial rain to parts of Scotland as well as the odd spot of drizzle across much of the rest of the country. Temperatures for most in Britain will be around  or C and tonight is unlikely to see frost, just days after the cold snap saw the UK drop to -C - lower than Iceland, Russia and Finland. Mr Danaos said into the weekend there will be more rather leaden skies - while the Met Office is warning of snowfall early next week.  The long range forecast, beginning on Monday, includes heavy rain, most likely focused over western parts with snow possible across some northern hills. It will be windy throughout with a chance of gales at times, which will reduce the risk of overnight frost and fog. added the Met Office report. UK  day weather forecast Today: Mostly cloudy but largely dry. Early mist and fog across England and Wales slow to clear and lingering all day in some parts, especially Wales, the Midlands and eastern England. Brighter in the north and rain developing northwest Scotland. Tonight: Mostly cloudy with mist and fog likely over parts of England and Wales.

Experts believe fruit bats could be playing host to the virus as researchers have underestimated the condition, which is similar to pneumonia and SARS, according to a paper published in the Chinese Science Bulletin. Wuhan, where the virus originated, has been quarantined, as the virus continues to spread. Wuhanaposs local government said it would shut down all urban transport networks and suspend outgoing flights from the city as of am on Thursday, state media reported. The government is urging citizens to not leave the city in the absence of special circumstances. China confirmed  cases of the virus so far and  deaths. Scientists believe an unknown intermediate may be spreading the disease.Now there are suggestions the bat soup could be to blame after footage of the unusual cuisine emerged online, reports the Daily Star .A grotesque image of a grinning bat with its cooked insides floating amongst broth in a bowl before it is consumed by a woman is turning stomaches across the globe. A clip showing a girl putting one of the creatures in her mouth with chopsticks while eating with friends has had a similar reaction. The Wuhan coronavirus’ natural host could be bats … but between bats and humans there may be an unknown intermediate, said a statement from scientists published in the South China Morning Post.  News of the bat soup comes as the Foreign Office warned Brits not to travel to Wuhan amid fears of a global outbreak. Last night China confirmed  total cases of the new coronvirus outbreak. As of Wednesday evening,  deaths have been reported, all in Hubei province. Around  medical workers have also been infected.

The number of deaths in China jumped to  on Thursday as the outbreak - which began in the central city of Wuhan - spread to other countries and the epicentre was locked down amid fears it could become a global pandemic. Have you been affected by coronavirus  Email webnews@mirror. China has reported more than  cases of the virus, which is believed to have originated at a market that sold live animals and seafood. It is suspected that it emerged from illegally traded wildle and one study by medical experts suggests it may have originated in snakes, with a link to bats. Government medical adviser Zhong Nanshan had also identied badgers and rats as possible sources. Heathrow and airports around the world have introduced screening measures for passengers arriving from the affected region.Wuhan, a city of million, was put on lockdown and residents were told to stay inside the city to prevent the virus from spreading even further. Flights were suspended, bus, train and ferry services were cancelled and roadblocks were set up on the outskirts of the city. Some flights were still operating after a am deadline, however.  The Hankou railway station looked like a ghost town and toll booths had shut down, effectively cutting off road access. Guards were patrolling major highways, one resident told Reuters. There was panic as shoppers stormed a store that sells masks, cleared out supermarket shelves, queued for petrol and thronged into hospitals for checks.

It was a bit end-to-end, as they always are.“We expected that, though, with the quality of the opposition we were facing on Sunday and I think we showed we matched them for most of it.“The first goal came at a good time, just before half-time, to get us level but we probably conceded at the worst time just into the second half.“However, I thought we reacted well and kept ourselves in the game then big Louis came on and produced a bit of magic.”Shankland continued by heaping praise on young attacker Appere for his tie-saving impact after replacing Peter Pawlett from the bench.He added: “It was great for him, it was a terric finish. He did really well when he came on and gave us a bit of a danger off the left-hand side.“Pete had done really well up until then, considering he’s just back from injury, but I thought Louis gave us a wee spark and took his goal well.”Scotland star Shanks was also pleased with his own display as he notched his th domestic goal of the season by getting the better of Hibs defender Lewis Stevenson and slotting home.It was an impressive piece of play against such an experience defender and, although he enjoyed the goal, Shankland hopes they keep on coming however and whoever they are against.“He did quite well to get goal-side of me but I managed to get my first touch in and just managed to nudge him.“Thankfully enough he went down and I was able to roll it past him and the goalie so I was just delighted to see it go in.“I’m delighted to score all the time and to get one in the Scottish Cup is great so it’s another positive from Sunday to take in our stride. All I’ve got in my mind is to keep scoring and see what I can get.“I hope I do but it’s not as easy as going out there and scoring every week but I’m just happy to see them going in now and hope to continue that form.”Morton call in to Tannadice in the league on Saturday before United and Hibs’ cup replay at Easter Road next Tuesday.It will be tough but Shankland believes they can fight on both fronts.“I think it has to be a target. It’s the Scottish Cup and everybody wants to be in it. We’re still in it just now and it will be a tough tie down at Easter Road but it’s one we’re looking forward to, taking confidence from Saturday.”"},{"url":null,"title":"britbox-streaming-service-pricing-announced","story":"UK streaming subscription service BritBoxwill launch later this yearat pound. a month, the BBC and ITV have said."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"food-rationing-glasgow---80th-anniversary","story":"JANUARY is traditionally a lean month. as families recover from the excesses of the festive season by choosing to diet, drink less and live more economically."},{"url":null,"title":"recall-glasgows-great-food-hotspots","story":"GLASWEGIANS love their scran ndash and in recent decades, thanks in part to flourishing Finnieston and the magnicent Merchant City, the city is finally gaining a reputation as a fantastic foodie haven."},{"url":null,"title":"memories-marlene-glasgow-messages-mum","story":"WHEN he was a wee boy, growing up in Townhead, Bill Henderson loved a visit to Lewisrsquos department store."},{"url":null,"title":"influence-friars-glasgow-bishop-wisharts-arrival","story":"As we have begun to see, it is impossible to understate the importance of the Christian Church to the development of Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"sad-day-city-favourite-closed-doors","story":"WHEN Dinorsquos Italian restaurant closed its doors, it was a sad day for many Glasgow Times readers."},{"url":null,"title":"cat-stevens-primal-scream-jesus-mary-chain-play-kelvingrove-summer-nights-festival","story":"MUSIC legends Cat Stevens and Suzanne Vega will form part of the eclectic line-up at this yearrsquos Summer Nights at the Bandstand festival, which is being billed as ldquoPrimal Scream and friends."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-insurance-firm-gives-1000-employees-funds-support-local-good-causes","story":"AROUND  employees of a Glasgow insurance firm are to be given cash to pass on to good causes close to their hearts."},{"url":null,"title":"revealed-new-2-8m-plans-scotstoun-pool","story":"A pound.

Three events all within a stones throw of Mid Argyll.Jamie Miller was the only local to enter this event, starting his Scottish Tarmac Rally Championshipcampaign for the year in the rapid  Citroen CR. Paul Hunter, swapping his pacenotes for spanners, was on hand to assist Jamie throughout the season. Conditions were said to have been tricky as Knockhill has its own micro-climate, which consists purely of rain, wind, snow, ice, wind and wind. Sadly it wasn#t to be at Knockhill for the team with mechanical failure ending their day after stage two.The first closed road event to take place in England, after the approval of closed road rallying for the UK, was the first event for the famousGTi. Unfortunately for Kirsty Mochrie her licence can only be upgraded to stage events from single venue use when she turns , so it was theof the pairing of Innes Mochrie and Paul Hunter to represent Mid Argyll south of the border. The pair, finding the conditions tricky in the narrow lanes after the top seed cars had been pulling mud from verges and ditches, managed to bounce the wee metro over the first loop of four stages until the gearbox had enough on the fth test.Following the cancelling of Inverness# Snowman Rally earlier in the year, this was now first round of the Scottish Rally Championshipfor Dougie Watt and Ian Parker, and it was interesting to say the least. A glance outside in the morning to see about four inches of snow lying on the roof of the MK Escort was a surprise for a start. A very wet and muddy day saw the pair make it to the finish in one piece which is more than can be said for the clutch cable that snapped about one mile into the final stage, however clinching their first class win of the season was the best start to the championship.With Kirsty #Wee Mo# Mochrie in the co-drivers seat in the rapid Corsa of Steven Hay , a fair pace was set by the pair throughout the day sitting as high as th until they unfortunately had to take a split early to save damaging the car. Back out the next stage and still setting a blistering top  pace in the Corsa, including some hang time on both the jumps.Jamie, back out in the fit C, had bad luck once again. This time an overshoot on a square right and a struggle to get the car started again after a stall sadly earned him a stage max on stage two. Still setting top  times on the day he ended nd which was a fair effort when you include a stage maximum time.Ian was out this time with Fraser #Flat oot Fraz# Smithafter winning an entry to the rally at the STRC Awards in January. Flying out the gates and onto their second lap on the first stage then pop, driveshaft burst. Towed in and sorted, both covered in CV Grease, they made it back out for a skid around and on a mission to tear up some old tarmac tyres.The Granite Stages, now held at RAF Leuchars would see Eoghan Anderson make ato the passenger seat for a hurl in the immaculate MK Escort of Martin Murray. Smiling ear to ear all day, with Bill eagerly awaiting histo the service area for the stage report, they finished th overall.Ian was out with Greg Inglisin his fluorescent Orange Lotus Exige and it was eyes on the prize for STRC points for Greg. A clean day saw Greg really getting to grips with the car on some surprisingly fast stages including a tickle of the limiter in fth saw the pair finish third overall.Back together and with the small repairs from the Speyside done it was time for the Furnace MK toto the woods.

From seeing their overall position they knew they had to get back into it on the next stage, however on the road section to start stage three there was issues selecting gear and the pair decided to call it a day # damage limitation was the right call, as the input shaft was on its last legs.Jamie was back on the pace for this one, setting a th fastest stage time on the opening test. Sitting th overall heading into stage five was impressive given the competition on the day. Bad luck unfortunately, however, was to .Eoghan was again out with Martin in the MK for a blast. Sadly it was an early bath, retired after stage two but again, as always, enjoying every minute while it lasted.The Argyll rally had been known to have rough and challenging stages the previous two years. Not this time. Ian and Dougie couldn#t believe how good the stages were in comparison to previous years, an absolute joy of an event with the Escort not missing a beat all day on its #shakedown# for the big one. Valuable class points added to the scorecard too, with them ending the event nd overall. The rally had struggled with entries this year and will now run in  as a closed road rally, run by Mull Car Club.Team Mochrie were back together for this one in the Mightyagain and Innes was cutting some questionable shapes in the garage, performing his annual Mach rain dance. Taking chunks of time from his first passes of the stages would see them ring the #s neck and clinch th.Jamie#s luck had finally turned, the C singing all weekend and netting him a topper of th overall and th fastest over the final stage too.Duncan Maclean was back in the driving seat with Ian alongside, giving himself and the car a shakedown before Mull. The freshly rebuilt #blue bullet# was looking superb and managed to finish looking just as sweet. A couple of small teething problems were sorted on the day and the new main focus was to have power steering fitted before Mull # poor Dochy lost about a stone over two days with the effort needed to swing the wee pug around the #s and chicanes.In August Dougie and Ian competed on the Vetomies Rally. A national grade event run alongside the WRC Rally Finland event. Three other crews from Scotland also headed over to sample #the fastest rally in the world#. The stages were unbelievable. Fast, cresty, wide, flowing with a brilliantly smooth surface. The whole event was just surreal. The duo finished the event th overall and more importantly the fastest Scottish crew.Once the car had ed from Finland it was quickly jacked up, checked and loaded onto the trailer the same day for the journey north. Due to two DNFson the Speyside and Scottish, Dougie and Ian had to make the trip to be in with any chance of regaining their class lead in the SRC. Ending the day first in the class meant they were heading into the final round with the lead.Jamie was back out for another counting round of the STRC. Enjoying his day and pushing the wee C on in the blistering heat netted Jamie and co-driver Ian Mccullochrd overall. He must have been relaxed in the heat as in between stages he was off with the overalls and on with the baby lotion, topping up the tan.Ian was back out with Greg in the Lotus. Another fantastic drive from Greg, finishing ninth with the championship title race firmly the primary goal.The final round for the MK and an important one # a DNF here could see Dougie and Ian losing the class lead in the championship. A battle with their rival who they had been chasing all season, Paddy Munro, would come down to the last stage, as the pair were six seconds down on Paddy heading into the final test. Probably one of the duo#s best stages all year, the final push to claim the class honours came down to the finish of the last stage on the last rally of the year. One second! They had taken the class win and the championship.The first event this year for Craig Callander and son Ross would see them prepare Craig#s gravel spec Subaru Impreza at the last minute to take on their favourite event. The #Japanese Tractor# was a fair handful, a light steering alignment issue and a boost problem gave the pair some trouble although finishing th overall made up for the hassle. A fair result given Craig#s absence from tarmac for four years.Returning from the shed with his freshly painted Sunbeam was Alister Macarthur, this time with Claire Tilleyalongside. The freshly fettled #beam was looking and sounding good # crossing the finish th overall after two years out of the seat.Dochy and Ian were back out in the #blue bullet.# All was going well until they had a spin coming over a crest into a square left, losing the bumper and damaging the gear linkage. They managed to get the car back to the end of the Saturday afternoon leg to repair the gear linkage and almost stole the yellow bumper from the recce car until some legends appeared with the duo#s bumper in the back of their Land Rover. Back out onto the  mile #long one# on Saturday night and they had an issue # after a heavy landing over a crest the rear shocker bolt broke, making the car a handful to keep in a straight line. They had to finish another two stages before they could make it back to service, so a finish was all they wanted at this point # th overall and Dochys fourth finish in a row on Mull.Without doubt the driver to watch was Innes and his newly acquired co-driver Lewis Grfiths . The Mightywas spotted airborne at any chance, with the hydro can suspension screaming for a break at each service halt. It was almost all over as the nearside cv joint sheared and the car took a wild turn to the left # both Innes and Lewis thought they would end up IN the Belachroy pub. They managed to make it over the Lochs to the end of the final stage, claiming st overall.Eoghan was back out with Martin to settle the score from the DNF at the summer stages. Sadly a stage maximum time on stage two scuppered their chances of the overall result they were hoping for, however they did set some impressive times, clocking a th fastest time on the final stage.Jamie, back out for the final round of the STRC, was looking to continue his good run from the Pendragon and set a seventh fastest time on stage three in the extremely wet and tricky conditions. Trying to get his money#s worth from his entry fee Jamie, however, decided to take an extra couple of miles on the penultimate stage. Still, the C ran well all day and the conditions suited the car perfectly.Ian was back out with Greg and this time he was aiming to become the Scottish Tarmac Rally Champion for . They set off with five cars in the same class and they had to win the class to get Greg the honours. Setting the pace early they were leading throughout the event. Finishing the event first in their class and third overall meant the job was done # Greg claimed the championship win.The last event of the year saw Kirsty back in the co-drivers seat, gaining even more experience on her path to upgrading her licence. Some typical Knockhill weather was in store as Kirsty had her first taste of RWD rallying in the Mazda MX of Paul Sheard. Kirsty guided Paul around the very wet stages to claim th overall and some valuable points on the board for Paul#s Motorsport News Championship campaign.Special thanks to Alasdair MacConnell who has travelled many miles to don an orange bib and stand in the rain, wind and heat, all to show his support and play a vital part in any event.

All have end-stage organ failure, be it kidney, liver, lung or heart, and require a le-saving transplant.Organs for transplant usually come from bodies of people who agreed to donate before death. But as this does not produce enough organs, both Scotland and England plan to bring in an #opt out# system, meaning that on death a person#s agreement to organ donation is assumed unless they had actively opted out.Live donation is an alternative to awaiting a cadaveric organ. As people can live happily with one kidney or half a liver, family members or altruistic iniduals sometimes offer to donate these organs. Since matching donor and recipient tissue-type, however, is generally required these donations are not always acceptable.Now groups of tissue-type incompatible donor recipient pairs are getting together to mix and match, producing duos who are tissue-type-compatible. So let#s say Annie is rejected as a kidney donor for her sister Jean for incompatibility reasons, and similarly, Arthur is rejected as kidney donor for Jim. But pairing donor Annie with recipient Jim and Arthur with Jean could lead to two successful transplants. A recent report from the US describes the first ever bi-organ exchange involving a liver-kidney swap * .In this specic case a daughter wished to donate a kidney to her mother with renal failure but was rejected because she might later develop the same kidney problem. So she offered half of her liver in exchange for a kidney for her mother. Another donor was eventually identied who wanted to donate half her liver to her sister with liver failure but was rejected because her liver was too small. But she was cleared for kidney donation. So on the day of the swap four operations took place and two needy people received le-giving new organs.Although not presently being considered in the UK, with the ethical issues sorted, this multi-swap procedure opens the way for extended chains of donors and many more lives saved.*Torres et al Am J transplant. :-."},{"url":null,"title":"tarbert club on target for 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe first competition of the new year at Tarbert Gun Club also served as the January leg of the club#s winter league.A full house of  teams turned out on Sunday January , and the early shooters had to put up eith windy conditions which made the clays dance.

Nearly three years later I fear the dream is still a long way from that reality.Mid Argyll Youth Development Servicescertainly seems to have ambitious plans for an indoor skate park and this is to be lauded, however a quick look online will show an apparent apathy with regard to moving forward with the project. A young man created the #Lochgilphead Skate Park Association# on Facebook in , yet a final post in  indicated how little the proposal had moved forward. If the project needs more money to actually get it built we need to know how much, so that appropriate funding can be sought.What is causing the project to take years to come to fruition The potential for help by the £ million Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund in  was dashed when councillors instead decided that improvements to road junctions, streets, a cycle track and indoor bowling were more important, and allocated a staggering £, to feasibility studies for these projects alone, this is before any work is actually done, you understand.That is a great deal of money for feasibility studies and design works.Let us be realistic # in nine long years the community has gone from the initial excited buzz about a skate park to finally managing to purchase a plot of land upon which to build it in early . From there it seems the project has not been able to move.In the meantime the youngsters who worked so hard to give momentum to the project appear to have given up hope and are now probably giving thought to employment prospects rather than having fun.It is a sad state of affairs.But rather than giving up hope, let us reignite this campaign for our children to have the dream of a skate park in Lochgilphead whilst they are still young enough to enjoy it.Nick MacIneskar, TayvallichSir,With regard to your story in last week#s Argyllshire Advertiser #Inveraray seawall in need of attention#, would it be possible to contact BEAR Scotland and ask themthey could also create an access point to the shore Possibly at the bus stop at Barn Brae. Thanks very much.Marion McIntosh, InveraraySir,I should like to make an appeal to all MPs, MSPs, councillors and all lawmakers that in  they make no new laws.At the beginning of this new decade they should improve the laws they already passed. I would even like for them to go further and reduce the number of laws that are in existence.Now please don’t get me wrong, I am not against all laws. What I fear is that instead of addressing the issues which are negative to iniduals and society, legislators believing that by extending what are regarded as crimes changes society for the better. Their belief is wrong.We know that parking on pavements is wrong #upskirting# is horrying smoking in a car in which they are children is unacceptable dropping litter is shameful driving through a red light is dangerous.What we need is the range of social and cultural influences that help us feel that we should behave in a positive way. In the s, s and s the majority of people regularly attended churches and religious organisations. In these environments people developed feelings of what was right and wrong. Positive behaviour was also developed by participating in the extensions of these organisations through activities in young mother groups women#s guilds, choirs, and religious celebrations. These helped develop positive moral compass in people.Equally, most children and young people went to youth organisations such as the Girl Guides, Scouts, the BBs, army and naval cadets. Even into the s local authorities ran youth clubs and had excellent people called #youth leaders#. No more. #We cannot afford them# is the call of the day. Without them the honourable behaviour of society will continue to deteriorate.So my plea to politicians is simple # stop making us all criminals by passing more and more laws and start supporting and encouraging agencies, groups and people who indirectly and directly instil in iniduals behaviour of which all can be proud.Finlay CraigCoveSir,There is all the hoo-ha at the moment over the lesser royals deciding its going to be a better le that beckons from opting out from royal duties # perhaps wanting a less stressful, more normal, le for themselves and their family as ordinary people away from the media hype and national newspapers.It was lovely, however, to see in the same week front page on the local paper a real regional award for a less well-known commoner.An MBE given for services to the local youth community, making this two great awards for Lochgilphead in recent years and showing that local strong ladies in Mid Argyll do have what it takes.Hard work and true Scottish grit and determination in their hearts for the area and community. More of the same meritorious awards for the ordinary people of Scotland please.Credit to all editors and staff for their outstanding journalism given over the years in all of Scotlands progressive, thriving local papers.Stephen Jones, Oban"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures january 3 2020 2","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThis week#s photograph whas been submitted by Tom Cullen of Ardfern.The serene scene was taken overlooking the Crinan estuary at about .am on Friday January ."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead bowls into 2020","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowLochgilphead Bowling Club launched into the new year with the first of its indoor singles competitions.Some  members played for the Argyll Arms Ardrishaig trophy on Saturday January  and after some great matches throughout the afternoon it was Alan Guy and Neil Ward that progressed to the final.In a closely fought final, Neil Ward edged the victory in the last end, winning -."},{"url":null,"title":"tarberts senior citizens party the night away","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowWet and windy weather failed to dampen the spirits of Tarbert’s seniors as they gathered in the village hall for the senior citizens# Christmas dinner.A large number of willing volunteers had organised a sumptuous meal and decked the hall with multi-coloured fairy lights and balloons to provide a warm welcome for their guests.The familiar venue quickly came alive with smiles, hugs and the happy chatter of friends gathering for this much-loved annual event which has been going for more than  years.Elma McGougan and Jean Johnston, who had served on the original organising committee, reminisced about their experiences, explaining they ran fund-raising events and that many in the village donated money and goods so the dinner could be provided free of charge.The event, held this year on Friday January , is still organised by a committee and continues to be generously supported by businesses and iniduals in the village and surrounding area.Elma said: #In the s, the women on the committee made soup and brought it along.

fire that destroyed a large part of the building last year.The replacement secondary, though, will take at least three years to build.But according to Scottish Borders Councilrsquos Chief Executive Tracey Logan, it is the only way forward for Peebles High.Although it is yet to be officially endorsed by the local authority, Ms Logan says her view is that apart from the Sports Complex and Millennium Wing, the entire school will be demolished and rebuilt.And that Peebles High will jump to the head of the queue in the rebuilding programme of schools - ahead of Galashiels, Hawick and Selkirk.But the Chief Executive told the towns Community Council she thinks Peebles should now be first on the priority list for a new school.Ms Logan explained: ldquoAt the moment my view is, and this is only my view, this has not even endorsed by the Council as yet, is that given the constraints that we have around what will be available financially, the Scottish Government have been really helpful in that they are offering their full support and we will make a bid late spring for funding through the schools programme.ldquoThere will obviously be a financial settlement from the insurance.\"But we need to find the best way forward, so my expectation is that we will retain the Sports Complex because it is undamaged and pretty new, we will also retain the Millennium Wing because again itrsquos not that old and is entirely usable.ldquoI would imagine that we will probably end up taking away everything  and replace it with something new.\"What that will look like, I have no idea. But what it will be is something that is modular that we can add ontowe need to for capacity and we will want to talk to the community about what  we might want to put into that site.A consultation will take place asking for local feedback on community space and the possible provision of health and social care.She added: ldquoSome people have said to me that they want to knock all of the school down including the fairly new bits, realistically that wonrsquot happen and itrsquos not the right thing to do. I think itrsquos important that we make sure people understand the parameters within which we are working so we can have some sensible conversations and that we try and accommodate as much as we can in there.Meanwhile, a major operation is underway to get the students back to their classrooms at the beginning of February.The Chief Executive said: ldquoWe put in arrangements for  plus pupils to be accommodated at locations in Peebles, Galashiels Academy and the Langlee complex.ldquoThat has been generally very successfully and the feedback from that has been positive. I absolutely acknowledge that itrsquos not perfect but it has done the job we needed it do to.Senior students are currently sitting prelim exams in the Sports Complex and this will continue until the end of January.Temporary classroom units are being erected within the school grounds and pupils are to be accommodated in unaffected areas of the building.ldquoThere are still huge amounts of work going on and we will go right up to the wire but Irsquom confident we will achieve it, added Ms Logan.The Council has decided on a phased approach with S to S students starting on Monday, February  and S to S working from home and ing the following day.Ms Logan said that there has been ldquocompromises in the education offer over the last few weeks but is assuring parents that from the beginning of February it will be ldquobusiness as usual.Demolition work on the damaged building has been completed and restricted access has been implemented.The council boss has assured parents that children will only be able to access safe routes throughout the school building.Ms Logan added: ldquoOne of the things we did lose in the fire was the vast majority of pupil toilets so what wersquove now got on site is the long term temporary arrangements supplemented over the course of January.To ensure pupil safety, traffic will enter the site from a new access via Craigerne Road located at the back of the school.Ms Logan is meeting with insurers this week to discuss a settlement figure which will help form the direction of the future of Peebles High School.She added: ldquoAll of what we are doing is going to be sustainable for whatever we do in terms of the proper rebuild.\"What Irsquom trying to reassure you is that wersquore not doing things that are very temporary, whatever we do, we will be looking to the future.Community councillor Graham Mackie commended the local authority on doing a ldquoremarkable job and said any criticism of the Council during this trying time was unnecessary.He said: ldquoIt has been thought for several years that we needed a completely new high school but possibly therersquos a silver lining here in that we can end up with a high school that will meet the needs of the current population.\"But the council chief told members that ldquoessentially this is the replacement.She explained: ldquoWhen it comes to looking at high schools and replacement we would always look to retain what is still workable.\"In the case of the bits we are talking about in terms of Peebles High site they are really not that old.

He had established his force at Dunglass Castle, an obvious strategic location, to defend the armyrsquos rear.On that fateful day, August , , he was said to be in conversation with some fellow nobles when a huge explosion erupted from the vaults, instantly demolishing the central part of the castle which became little more than a pile of debris.Thomas and many others were killed, their bodies pulled from the rubble. They had been crushed by the collapse of the walls in the explosion.History has repeatedly recorded the names of the nobles killed on that day, but there were many others, as the castle was busy and full of people. Fty-four unnamed lsquocommon servantsrsquo were killed, and more than  other people badly injured, some later dying of their injuries.Edward Paris was Thomasrsquos servant and he has been blamed for this tragedy. The th-century writer Andrew Stevenson claimed Edward had the keys to the vault in which huge amounts of gunpowder had been stored, and he had been ldquoseduced by the enemies of the covenant to commit this act. He was an Englishman and another account says he was incensed at derogatory remarks made by Thomas about his countrymen.Irsquove always thought this explanation never really had the ring of truth. It was initially deemed an accident, and the story of Edwardrsquos role emerged later, instigated by a writer called William Lithgow, a man who had certain axes to grind. In one account, Edward is said to have thrust a hot poker into the gunpowder or set fire to it. The detail of this is suspect in itself, for who survived as a witness to this act  I suspect that a dreadful accident, possibly caused by incompetence and carelessness, was turned into a deliberate act of vengeance as it made a more useful explanation.Of course, it is very possible that Edward was offended or annoyed at things said by his master, and perhaps he mentioned this at some stage, later to be used as evidence of his guilt. But in truth, most servants will have seen or heard things which will have offended them, it was a part of their job.Imagineservants had been able to write and publish the things they had overheard and seen, what dferent historical narratives we would have!Motives for wanting to interpret the cause of the explosion in this way can be guessed at. It was a time of atrocity and massacre, with religious, political and national hatreds. Who was responsible for the dangerous stockpiling of the gunpowder in such a manner  It seems just too easy to blame a disgruntled servant. Even later, when writing up this period, religious and political loyalties influenced interpretation.If Edward Paris really did venture down to the vaults of Dunglass Castle on that fateful day, with the intention of committing suicide in order to kill his master, along with dozens of others, then he must have been infected with a deep hatred, as well as a total disregard for the lives of his fellow servants and his own.The truth is we will never know what really happened. But Edward Paris is a servant whose name we know. Countless numbers of so-called lsquocommon servantsrsquo whose lives and fates are deemed unimportant by history remain unrecorded just as the things they witnessed remain absent from our history books.Irsquove often thought it would be fascinating to meet Edwardrsquos ghost and ask him what really happened on that day.Silly idea, of course, but you never know."},{"url":null,"title":"public-exhibition-held-plans-revive-dunbars-east-beach","story":"Dunbarrsquos East Beach, which hosts the townrsquos annual Loony Dook, was once a magnet for tourists but the disappearance of its golden sands over the years due to coastal erosion has led to fewer visitors.East Lothian Council has already been given permission for the first phase of work on the beach, which it is hoped will help sandwhile also protecting the shore.A public exhibition detailing plans for a second phase of work ndash and the project overall ndash takes place in Dunbarrsquos Bleachingfield Centre on Monday afternoon.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the townrsquos community council, explained the desire to see the beach restored to how it was previously.She said: ldquoIt has been a long-held ambition.ldquoPeople reminisce about how wonderful the beach was and there has been a lot of disappointment that it has been so rocky for so long.Dave Northcott, East Lothian Council structural engineer and project leader, visited the community council shortly before Christmas to outline the plans.Consent is already in place for the construction of a breakwater at the southern end of East Beach.Refurbishment of the existing groyne at the same end of the beach has also been approved, alongside the placement of rock armour at the toe of the seawall. A marine licence is in place until the end of May, with work to be complete before then.At the same time, plans are being drawn up for a second phase of work, which would see the creation of a breakwater at the northern end of the beach.A marine licence will be needed for that piece of work, with the hope that could be in place before the end of May to allow work to simply continue from the first phase.If that is not possible, the contractor will leave the site andat a later date to construct the northern breakwater.Mrs Swan, who is also chairwoman of Dunbar Shore and Harbour Neighbourhood Group, encouraged people to head along to the public exhibition, which takes place between pm and pm.Those in attendance can speak to the consultants and East Lothian Council about the plans.Mrs Swan added: ldquoI think it is really, really important for people to come to the exhibition for two reasons.ldquoOne is to understand the thinking that has gone into the regeneration project and the other one is to become aware of the impact it might have on them during the construction weeks because it is going to be at least six weeks and it could run into months.ldquoThe nature of the breakwater is they are built of huge rocks, between three and six tonnes, and they are all coming from the quarry at Markle.

He was said to have been martyred at sea with an anchor round his neck and was therefore regarded as the patron saint of sailors. The cult of Clement spread to Scandinavia in about the th century and then to Britain.ldquoSt Clements Wells were probably named by Scandinavians living in the Tranent area.ldquoWe know they were here because of the presence of a powerful landholder of likely Scandinavian descent, Thor of Tranent, son of Swain, who is mentioned in many th-century charters. He held extensive lands in the area and granted the church of Tranent to Holyrood Abbey.Mr Hadden said: ldquoI am sure the new stone sculptures will add another piece of culture to our area when in place to the east and west sides of Wallyford alongside those we have already.ldquoThese include the mining memorial stone and coal hutches located at St Clements Housing estate just off Salters Road, the  mining stones at the Wallyford Bing, a community woodland depicting dferent mining scenes, and also the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh memorial at the west side of Wallyford.The shapes and patterns proposed relate to the themes of the wells, water, ripples, distilling, agriculture and the sense of space and open skies of the site as it is now. The overall idea is that the artwork reflects past, present and future heritages of the area.There will also be two St Clements Wells name  per entrance in stone, either hand carved or sandblasted.The idea for a stone village sign for Wallyford is also being explored in a design reflecting the ideas of crossing a river or burn by a ford.A spokesman for East Lothian Developments said: ldquoEast Lothian Developments are delighted to be working with Susheila and James to deliver ious artworks at St Clements Wells.ldquoThey have shown real enthusiasm and creativity with the ideas they have brought forward to capture something of the history of St Clements Wells and design pieces which we hope will do justice to the entrances of the development, and spark interest from all those who will pass them.ldquoWe were very grateful to the community council for their comments and input to the designs.Elaine Di Troia was appointed vice-chairman at the AGM, Sharon Jamieson secretary and Beryl Stevenson treasurer.

She didnrsquot say anything and just looked at the ground. This was a seat that overlooked the sea, where her gran had often taken her. They would sit together and look out to the Firth, spotting boats and looking for whales, while eating sweeties.Her dad had realised that Jessica hadnrsquot been there since the death of her grandmother.ldquoOnlyyou want to, he said.Jessica was silent and looked at the ground. Inside, her emotions were spinning. Then she looked up.ldquoI donrsquot want to, it will just make me sad, she said to her dad. So they didnrsquot go.But later that day, Jessica began to talk about Nanarsquos seat. ldquoShe always gave me sweeties and wersquod look for whales and pirates. She told me a story about how a pirate once landed here at Prestonpans, but he didnrsquot leave treasure, he just built the town.ldquoGreat story, said her dad.The next day, Jessica agreed to go to her nanarsquos seat. When they arrived, she hesitated to sit and had a wave of emotion.ldquoI miss Nana, she saidldquoSo do I. Shall we sit on her seat and miss her together.ldquoBut we have to eat sweeties.ldquoJust so happens Irsquove got some in my pocket, said the dad with a smile. His daughter smiled back and sat on the seat. Her dad joined her.ldquoNo, dad, that was Nanarsquos place, you sit this side instead.And so they sat, missing Nana together, being sad together, but also remembering her together.ldquoCan you tell me the story about the pirate  asked the dad.ldquoDonrsquot want to.ldquoOK, maybe next time.The next day, they ed to Nanarsquos seat. This time, Jessica told a bit of the pirate story. The dad remembered it from his childhood and realised that his own grief in losing his mother had closed him down to talking about her. It had felt too painful.He began to sit on lsquoNanarsquos seatrsquo by himself when Jessica was at school, even though he had never done it with his mother when she was alive he had always been lsquotoo busy to watch the sea with her. But his daughterrsquos anecdotes and stories about the seat made it feel like a place of remembrance for him too.The power of stories, to rekindle memory and ease the sense of loss, became very real for both Jessica and her dad. At home, they made a special box with drawings and photos of memories, and things that reminded Jessica of her gran. Theyrsquod take them out and tell stories and share memories. Her dad even began to tell funny stories about his mum from when before Jessica was born, when he was a boy.lsquoNanarsquos boxrsquo was put in a safe place, but where Jessica could take itshe wanted to. As time passed, she opened it less, but it was always in her room. Sometimes she would put things in it, such as shells from the beach, because her granny had loved beautul shells.The loss of a loved one can never be completely moved on from, so there were always going to be times of sadness. But the seat, the box and most of all the stories, stopped Jessicarsquos nana from melting."},{"url":null,"title":"bypass-old-craighall-sheriffhall-shuts-two-nights","story":"Maintenance workwill take place on the A eastbound carriageway from Wednesday until Friday next week , betweenpm and ameach night.To allow the workto take place, there will be a full closure of the A eastbound carriageway between Sherfhall and Old Craighall.

And, when the women speakers pointed out the irony and injustice of this set-up  Calm down dear, yoursquore getting hysterical.Question Time provided perhaps the most eye-watering example of this when actor Lawrence Fox - who had been invited to sit in the ldquovoice of the people chair - unleashed a shocking but very revealing attack on a mixed-race member of the audience who suggested Meghan Marklersquos treatment by the media and others had been racist.:The curse of the House of Windsor: how love has torn apart the royal familyMr Fox, a Harrow-educated member of an established acting dynasty known for his role in the detective series Lewis, tore into the woman - who it turns out is an academic researcher in race and ethnicity - talking over her, aggressively calling the suggestion of racism ldquoboring, adding imperiously: ldquoWersquore the mostly tolerant, lovely country in the world.\" The actor compounded matters by using the tired and predictable ldquoyoursquore the racist defence when quite reasonably questioned on how a spfing white chap like him could be so sure about what racism is and is not.:Netflix chief confirms interest in deal with Harry and MeghanI donrsquot doubt that from Mr Foxrsquos privileged perch, Britain is indeed tolerant and lovely.

Itrsquos communication. Canrsquot we be friendly :Alison Rowat: I spy with my little eye, an excitable Tennant gushing about the jungleThen there was another comment, this time to the Huffington Post, about gay marriage. Could a father not marry his son to dodge inheritance tax, Irons mused to the interviewer.The quotes unearthed, commentators rush to criticise the appointment, saying it sent the wrong message at a moment when the film festival, like the industry as a whole, was trying to reinvent itself.One observer said: ldquoIf [the festival] really cared about the necessary change in the film industry, they would not have chosen a jury chairman who has played down sexual harassment in the past, but a person who fights with determination for a non-violent and equal industry and world.Should Irons find himself promptly uninvitedhe could be a candidate for the ldquoold white man with reactionary views gallery.In recent months the place has been filling up fast. Before Irons, there was a push to have director Terry Gilliamrsquos head stuffed and stuck on the wall for telling The Independent that he was tired, ldquoas a white male of being blamed for everything that is wrong with the world. ldquoI didnrsquot do it! he pleaded.Another frequent resident of the trophy room is John Cleese, who has not said anything controversial for at least two minutes.Then there is Boris Johnson, the first among equals of oldwhite men with reactionary views. He has several claims to a space on the wall.Now, it is a tough gig trying to defend old white men with reactionary views. Poor souls. They have had things all their own way for thousands of years, and suddenly they are out in the cold, unloved, unwanted, called to account.In the case of Irons and Gilliam, it is dficult to understand why anyone would take the thoughts of actors and others in the entertainment industries seriously enough to be upset by them. These are people who play dress up for a living, and they get paid rather a lot for it .In the case of Irons, though, the plea in mitigation is not that hard to frame. The comments he has been slated for were made nine and seven years ago respectively.So what, you might think, they are still offensive. But the crucial dference here is that Irons has acknowledged he was a pillock , at least in the case of his comments on gay marriage, and moved on. As the row over the Berlin Festival shows, not everyone is prepared to do the same.Irons finds himself scolded because of our inability or unwillingness to leave a persons past behind, and our suspicion of those who change.:Alison Rowat: Chris has no easy answers about our crowded worldActors are particularly at risk of being lashed with old quotes because every time they are in something they have to publicise it. That means singing for their supper with interviews. If they are not to be insufferably boring or po-faced, which does not work either, they relax and go with the conversational flow.The industryrsquos classiest interview acts, the Helen Mirrens and Julie Walters and Roger Allams of the world, know this. They are perfectly capable, just like most non-actors, of chatting for  minutes without causing offence.Previously, only those who found themselves in the public eye had cuttings files. Now anyone who uses social media has a digital folder to lug around. Comments, photos, your past and present self is out there, and accessible at the click of a mouse.

Some sentiments are stone cold wrong whenever they are expressed. See several of Boris Johnsonrsquos comments.He has dismissed these as just one of those things that happen when you write columns. They are not. Crucially, he has never said that he was wrong, which is reason enough to keep his head on the wall.By not having a statute of limitations on being a pillock we are saying that people are incapable of changing.

From a safety and operational perspective, we welcome the developments.But he added:The key questions to be addressed are around the economic impact of the removal of jobs from the island communities and how it will be ensured that the transition can be achieved given that the current ATC units will need to be fully manned right up to the day of transition to the new systems.ldquoIn a world where air traffic controllers are amongst many groups facing skills shortages, this is a signicant challenge that should not be underestimated.Hial said the change, which would be phased in, would modernise air traffic control.But the union Prospect said the plan puts  jobs at risk and described it as ldquopoorly thought through.Unmanned towers would feed information to a new combined surveillance centre at New Century House in Inverness.The building near the Kessock Bridge at Inverness is currently the offices of Highland News and Media, publishers of the Inverness Courier newspaper.The change would be phased in over the next few years, but Prospect understands it could be  before it takes effect at Dundee due to the complexity of the air space there.Comhairle nan Eilean Siarsaid that the project would see Benbecula downgraded to an Aerodrome Flight Information Serviceresulting in a loss of jobs and an inability to grow air services in Benbecula.ldquoTogether with a loss of jobs at Stornoway as a result of centralizing air control services in Inverness, there could be a loss of up to  jobs in the Islands, a signicant number of skilled jobs in an Island location, said the council.Uisdean Robertson, Chair of Transportation and Infrastructure, added: ldquoIt seems to me that Hial are looking at Stornoway and Benbecula Airports as burdens rather than assets. They are intent on running them down with the resultant loss of employment.ldquoThis displays an incredible lack of ambition for the future of air services to and from the Islands. We should be looking at how these assets can be grown and developed to best serve the communities of the Islands.ldquoI will be calling upon Ministers to ensure that agencies like Hial grow their staff headcount in our islands not remove valuable jobs and families from our communities.Councillor Robertson also highlighted that safety and resilience were at risk of being comprised under the proposed measures for centralization.ldquoOur communities have extreme transport challenges ahead. Our ferry services have deteriorated because of ill thought through decision making made by mainland based management. It is sad that Hial is making the same mistake, he added.ldquoHial are putting their own priorities and dogma way above the needs of their customers and partners. Taxpayers money is being spent on a needless vanity project. It is utterly unacceptable in this day and age for a publicly funded body to behave in this high handed way.But Hial managing director Inglis Lyon described the new centre as a ldquosignicant step.He added: ldquoIt will allow us to move forward with planning and procurement of the relevant systems to safely deliver a state of the art air traffic control management system and give additional clarity to colleagues and stakeholders as we deliver this complex and challenging programme.ldquoOur focus continues to be on aviation service delivery and providing a safe, modern and efficient means of handling aircraft for the regions and the islands in the future.Transport Scotland aid the move was part of a wider programme to ensure remote and rural communities ldquocontinue to benefit from sustainable air services in the future."},{"url":null,"title":"scotrail-stop-skipping-rise-according-new-figures","story":"In response to a written question from John Finnie, Transport Secretary Michael Matheson revealed , services failed to stop at all the designated stations on their route last year.Mr Matheson said . per centof all trains booked to run in  were affected by the problem.:ScotRail fined more than pound.m over service failuresIt compares to , trains being reported to Transport Scotland for missing some stations between January   and January  .Mr Finnie, the Greensrsquo transport spokesman, said: ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that instances of stop skipping have increased by almost a fth in a year.ldquoFolk rely on our rail services for work, education and so much more and it is simply unacceptable that this level of inconvenience occurs.ldquoIt is not unreasonable to expect that your train calls at all the stations advertised.While current ScotRail operators Abellio will cease running services in March  after Mr Matheson decided not to run their contract for the full  years, Mr Finnie said the issue of stop skipping must be considered when the franchise changes.He added: ldquoGiven that stop skipping is only treated as a lsquopartial cancellationrsquo in the franchise agreement, there are times when deliberately bypassing stations could be financially advantageous for the operator.ldquoIt is vital that the Transport Secretary ensures this arrangement does not continue when the next franchise agreement is drawn up.He also urged ministers to invest more cash in rail travel, saying: ldquoIt is particularly important in light of the climate emergency that we encourage more people out of their cars and onto public transport.ldquoIncreased inconvenience and higher fares are not a combination that would appeal to many, itrsquos therefore vital that the Scottish Government urgently prioritise investment in improving rail travel in Scotland.A ScotRail spokesman said: ldquoMissing out stations is never done to meet targets or for financial gain.ldquoIf a train fails to stop at a scheduled station then it automatically fails to meet our very challenging targets.:ScotRail franchise cut short as SNP ministers strip Abellio of contractldquoItrsquos a very rare occurrence for a train to miss a stop and is only done as a last resort measure to limit knock-on disruption to customers across the wider network.ldquoCompensation is available for customers who are delayed by  minutes or more as a result of a missed stop or cancellation."},{"url":null,"title":"new-calmac-ferries-long-way-off-completion-construction-stand-off","story":"There was not enough room on the slipway to construct the vessels side-by-side, and not enough space to get a mobile crane between them for vital work, it was claimed.When workers warned managers about the problem they were criticised for ldquonegativity. The jaw-dropping claims were made on the opening day of a Holyrood inquiry into the fiasco at the recently nationalised Ferguson Marine yard in Port Glasgow.MSPs also heard the ferries were ldquosignicantly less than half-built and that  per cent of the design had yet to be agreed five years after a deal was signed to build them. A paralysing financial dispute between the yard and the public body buying the vessels was likened to a ldquostand-off at the OK Corral.:Itrsquos time for islanders to make decisions on leline servicesThe boats ndash one destined for the Arran route, the second for the Skye, Harris and North Uist triangle ndash are currently running four years late and at double their original budget. The last commercial yard on the Clyde, Ferguson Marine was bought by engineering tycoon Jim McCollrsquos Clyde Blowers empire in .The next year it won a high-profile poundm contract to build two dual-fuel ferries for Caledonian Asset Management Limited , the state-owned body behind CalMac. However bitter disagreements over design changes led to a breakdown in relations until the two sides could not ldquosit in the same building.With work at a standstill, and CMAL refusing to pay extra for the changes, Ferguson Marinersquos finances deteriorated and it went into administration last August. Unable to find a commercial buyer, the Scottish Government nationalised the yard in December to ensure the completion of the boats and to safeguard  jobs.Finance Secretary Derek Mackay who blamed the ldquodisastrous previous management for the problems, also installed ldquo turnaround director Tim Hair to get the project back on track. Mr Hair calculated that finishing the ferries would cost another poundm, on top of poundm already paid to Fergusonrsquos.The Scottish Government has also written off poundm in loans to the yard. Mr Hair said there had been a lack of project management on the contract, with no single person understanding it all, work down out of sequence, inadequate stock-taking and storage, and poor upkeep of the partly-built hulls. Mr McColl has refuted the criticism, and blamed CMAL for the problems. Holyroodrsquos rural economy and connectivity committee yesterday began its inquiry into what went wrong.Alex Logan, GMB convener at Fergusonrsquos, said the yard, which is constrained on one side by historic Newark Castle, was not big enough to build the ferries side-by-side. He said: ldquoYoursquove got a concrete slipyard. It can take one big vessel and possibly a small vessel.:Ferguson bosses lsquofairly and squarely to blame for ship debaclersquoldquoBut in my opinion, we could not facilitate to build two vessels that size so close together because the ground wasnrsquot sufficient enough.He said there was a plan, which he called ldquofine in concept, to build one hull on the slipway then launch it to make way for the completion of a second partlybuilt hull, but it didnrsquot work. The hulls were called  and .Mr Logan went on: ldquoWe started the  hull and it was moved to the side towards the castle side, and it was all kind of soft ground. ldquoIf you started putting hundreds of tons of units on that then itrsquos going to sink. It wasnrsquot sustainable to do that. ldquoFor the build schedule we had, we couldnrsquot have done it because it would come to a complete standstill on  while  was prepared for launch. He claimed said staff concerns had been dismissed by managers.He said: ldquoItrsquos plain to see - the size of the vessels that they were building, and the breadth of them on the berth, that the two vessels werenrsquot going to [fit]. ldquoWe needed a mobile crane to go down in between them, and the space as you started building the two together, there wasnrsquot enough space.Askedthe workforce had warned managers about the looming problem, Mr Logan said: ldquoThe management team said they didnrsquot like our negativity.He also said managers caused problems by hiring agency workers to cope with the contract who arrived earlier on site than full-time staff and commandeered vital machinery.He said that left skilled welders with little work bar sweeping up. Mr Logan said design changes had been made ldquoconstantly and there was still not a finalised design for the boats. Without it, the work was ldquolike building a jigsaw when yoursquove got missing parts. Yoursquore never going to complete it.Mr Logan said CMAL and Ferguson managers ldquocame to loggerheads. He said: ldquoThey wouldnrsquot agree on the design so we couldnrsquot move forward, so it just came to a standstill.

They are sometimes described as timid and shy, standing between two and four feet tall, or may be depicted as tall and lithe.Their oldest known appearance in print was the poem The Asrai by the Scottish poet, novelist and dramatist.

They also raised concerns about chemicals used in the salmon farming industry.\"Fishermen lose more and more grounds to fish farms,\" the group say.

It represents something quite unsettling in society: the desire by adults to retreat into a world of childish preoccupations. The show began in South Korea in  and has swept the world with TV franchises across the globe.Adults have always enjoyed some flicker of childhood remaining in their lives. Whether itrsquos grown men playing with train sets, or families in the s watching Itrsquos a Knockout, or women dressing up like pink princesses on a hen night, or Generation Xers like me still playing computer games, the adult world has always contained a memory of childhood. Thatrsquos fine and good. We need to retain a little childhood silliness to stave off the calcication of the soul that accompanies being an adult.But over the last few decades, itrsquos sometimes seemed asthe adult world is more childlike than fully grown. It may have started with JK Rowling. Now donrsquot get me wrong, therersquos much to admire about Rowling. I adored reading her books to my children. She turned an entire generation into bookworms. God bless her for that, and I applaud her literary success.But in the late s, when I started to look up from my train seat and see grown men and women reading Harry Potter books, I despaired. I wasnrsquot expecting them all to be reading Crime and Punishment, but a book for an adult might have been nice. What were they doing retreating into a world of boy wizards and spells  If they wanted fantasy, therersquos plenty of adult fantasy out there.But it was cosiness they were craving. That was the key. They wanted comfort and safety ndash culture, art, literature, which did not challenge or threaten. They wanted childhoodrsquos comfort blanket.Then came the superhero movies ndash the endless, repetitive superhero movies. I should like these films. I grew up reading comics. But I hate the sight of superhero films today. Superheroes were for my childhood. I have no more need for superheroes and comics, than I have for a BMX and bunny hops in the park.Thatrsquos not to say there are no decent superhero movies ndash there are, though many also share the day-glo genetics of The Masked Singer, and are one endless round of jumping, punching, screeching, and bedazzling. I felt  percentage points of my IQ drop when I watched Thor.What Irsquom going to say next will get me burned as a heretic, but to hell with it, Irsquove gone this far. The same goes for Doctor Who. I loved it as a child, but I see no point in it for me as an adult.Itrsquos not that consuming any of these shows is ldquowrong as an adult. If you like to tune into The Masked Singer, or a superhero film, or the Doctor, thatrsquos fine with me. I watch crappy reality shows to switch off and unwind. Itrsquos the proleration and domination of these infantilising programmes which worries me. Childhood obsessions have moved from the fringes of the adult world to centre stage.:Neil Mackay: Why Iranian assassination crisis spells the end of American empireStrangely, or maybe not so strangely, this sht has accompanied a great easing in what it means to be an adult.

After a quarter of a century, the man behind Monty Python and The Holy Grail and The Le of Brian has pulled off the film challenge of his le.Gilliam has finally managed to complete his movie The Man Who Killed Don Quixote, in which Jonathan Pryce plays a Spanish cobbler who becomes convinced he is a medieval knight, supported by a television director, played by Adam Driver, who becomes his Sancho Panza wing man.Gilliam explains why he didnrsquot give up on his magic realism project, despite a quarter of a century of Sisyphean boulder- pushing that saw lead actors die, huge legal battles commence, and financiers pull out.Gilliam, like Don Quixote, mounted his horse, put on his armour ndash then stumbled and fell from what he thought was a stallion but turned out to be a tired old nag.: Terry Gilliamrsquos The Man Who Killed Don Quixote to screen at Cannes after court battleBut the American director continued to remount. Why  ldquoBecause I was surrounded by nice, intelligent, reasonable people who said lsquoLet it gorsquo, he says, grinning. ldquoI donrsquot want to listen to reasonable people. They may be right, but I think you have to continually push the boundaries to see whatrsquos out there, to stop all these reasonable people limiting you.Orson Welles failed to make a Quixote movie. Gilliam was more determined. Or perhaps slightly off his head. Finally he raised the last of the money, not from the market place, but from an elderly fairy godmother who said: ldquoBing! Terry, yoursquore going to the ball.rsquoWhat Gilliamrsquos fortitude does underline, however, is most of us need a reason to get out of bed in the morning, especially as the older years weigh down like a crushing blanket. We need that sense of purpose. We need to challenge ourselves, in whatever form.Itrsquos no real surprise to discover that playwright Tom Stoppard has, at , written a new play, Leopoldstadt, which has opened in London. Stoppardrsquos play, a partly autobiographical tale, set in the vibrant European city of Vienna nearly three decades before the Third Reich, took over a year to write but was many, many years in gestation.He had to write it, he explained: ldquoItrsquos a belief in a metaphysical dimension which operates really almost on every side of my le and I believe in it and depend upon it. Irsquom furtively competitive, which is one of the things which made me want to keep writing.Novelist Philip Roth says he always felt immortal when he needed a novel to finish. It was only when he stepped back from writing that he seemed to slow down rapidly.The website Positive-Psychology says we need goals. ldquoSetting goals helps trigger new behaviours, helps guides your focus and helps you sustain that momentum in le, it says. ldquoGoals also help align your focus and promote a sense of self-mastery.We often need to re-align our sense of focus. We often need to re-evaluate our positions in le, make a project happen we feel decidedly incomplete without. Itrsquos perfectly understandable that my chum Dorothy Paul, in her early s, is looking for her next writing challenge.: Terry Gilliams sign lights up after Pythonesque mix-upItrsquos even understandable to see why Gwyneth Paltrow has decided to capitalise on her world acting fame and throw herself in the world of commercial project with her Goop website.Paltrowrsquos acting career looked to be on the slow down, with a short Iron Man cameo. Then she decided to release a new scent that contained a whf of her lady garden. It may be a lot of old nonsense, but shersquos found a way to maintain a high profile, unconsciously coupling from acting, that is worth more than a quarter of a million dollars. Sadly however, Terry Gilliamrsquos muse has now left him. During his career, hersquod finish a film, always knowing hersquod then turn back to trying to make Don Quixote happen. Hersquos now lost, he says. The Python legend, without his dream to fulfil is now facing a void.

While the Government continues to dither, local people will feel the impact as we move from being rule makers to rule takers.“Last week I spoke in the house about the risks that new tarfs and trade barriers could have for businesses in the Northern Isles. Food and drink production are a staple part of the isles economy. The impact that continued and intensied tarfs could have on rural communities is signicant and organisations such as the SWA are understandably concerned.“This could be just a taste of what is to come as we leave the EU and our economic clout is reduced. If there were any doubt about the limits of our leverage in future trade negotiations with the US, this is a reminder of the precarious position that the Government is putting us in.“I will be writing to the Secretary of State for International Trade to explain what efforts they are making on these tarfs as a matter of urgency. With the UK losing our seat at the table in these trade talks at the end of this month, the next two weeks are crucial.

While HIAL has gone through the motions of consulting, having clearly failed to take on board any of the concerns raised, it is dficult to see what purpose this has served.“Since the announcement last week, I have been in discussions with local ATC staff who feel badly let down by HIAL.  Nobody disputes the need for modernisation, but even HIAL’s own consultants concluded that the remote tower model was the most costly and risky option. Alternatives were identied that could have delivered the improvements needed at a fraction of the cost.“While I welcome that HIAL is to carry out an island impact assessment, given its approach to consultation so far, there have to be questions over how robust or independent this assessment will be.#In the meantime, ministers must wake up to the scale of opposition and dissatisfaction amongst HIAL’s ATC staff. They should also recognise the clear threat this poses to delivery of leline air services in Orkney and across the Highlands  Islandsstaff choose to vote with their feet.

The most dramatic step taken by the Scottish Government to date has been the introduction of minimum unit pricing for alcohol, a controversial measure but one which was credited with a . per cent fall in shop sales, according to a study published in the BMJ journal.However, while a minimum price is a way of using market forces to improve our nation’s health, it was never going to be the solution all by itself. What is also required is a broad change in attitudes towards alcohol within society. Too many young people still appear to think that getting drunk is a good idea and underage drinking is a serious problem.: Scottish tourist town calls for ‘boozed up teenagers’ to be banned from celebrating Hogmanay: Minimum unit pricing has cut Scots alcohol spendingEven in the Borders town of Melrose, there are no calls for teenagers to be banned from celebrating Hogmanay because their “intimidating” drunken behaviour is so bad that it is putting off tourists.A new study, based on interviews with  youths aged  to  who drink alcohol, found that there had been no impact of minimum pricing on their consumption. While this is a small number of people on which to draw conclusions about behaviour on a national scale, the research, as Alcohol Focus Scotland said, should be “concerning”. “The apparent ease with which these young people are able to acquire alcohol raises serious questions about enforcement of existing licensing legislation and age-verication arrangements which are there to protect young people,” said the group’s Alison Douglas.There are some who will regard any government interference with our drinking habits as an infringement on civil liberties by a ‘nanny state’. As ever, the trick is to find the balance between helping people do what they would probably accept is the right thing and allowing them to make their own decisions. While further state intervention may be required before Scotland learns to drink in a reasonably responsible way, there is a limit to how much politicians can do using legislation and the level of such interference the public will tolerate.However, politicians and other leading figures in society can and should try to bring about a cultural change in how people in Scotland, particularly the young generation, view alcohol.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish council becomes first to teach every pupil in gaelic","story":"Parents in one Scottish council area will have to #opt out# to have lessons in English instead of Gaelic under new plans.All primary one pupils in the Western Isles are to be automatically enrolled in Gaelic medium educationfrom next year. The move is the first time Gaelic has been given the “default” status of being the main language for teaching in some of Scotland’s schools.Comhairle nan Eilean Siar – the council for the Western Isles – have adopted a policy of ‘Gaelic first’ to increase the rate of growth for Gaelic in the islands.The  census showed  per cent of the population of the Western Isles, aged three and over, spoke Gaelic.Supporters welcomed the move, saying it is a reversal of the previous situation where English was the main language, unless parents asked for their children to be taught in Gaelic.Primary and secondary headteachers and parent councils were informed of the policy in a letter last week from Bernard Chisholm, the council’s director of education.Under the new policy, pupils will be taught in Gaelic and will start learning English from P onwards.Parents have the option of opting out and having their children taught in English from P.Launching the new policy, Mr Chisholm said the “Outer Hebrides is a Gaelic speaking community with a rich Gaelic heritage and culture” and the “majority of our children in nursery and those enrolling in primary, want to speak our language”.He said being bilingual was beneficial to children’s academic development and would improve job opportunities.“A signicant number of families, who move to the area without Gaelic, enrol their children in GME for the additional benefits of bilingual education,” he said. “I believe that we all want our children to access the undoubted benefits that GME provides, in both English and Gaelic, in terms of reading, thinking skills, problem solving, maths and in many other areas.“It is truly a free gt and in this increasingly mobile world, it also enables them to acquire other languages much easier.“Not only do we want to make this offer available to children in our schools, we want to support as many children and adults as possible to learn the language anywhere they want, through our online e-Sgoil provision.”Mr Chisholm added: “We seek to give every child every advantage we can to ensure when they are in school, and when they leave, they have the widest opportunities possible in the world of work, leisure and learning.” A tweet by Comhairle nan Eilean Siar of Mr Chisholm’s letter was the most liked tweet since the council started the page.Mr Chisholm was cheered by the audience when he shared the announcement of the new Gaelic policy at a Celtic Connections concert in Glasgow last Friday where pupils from Castlebay Community School on Barra, Sir E Scott School on Tarbert, Isle of Harris and the Nicolson Institute in Stornoway, were performing.Scottish education secretary John Swinney was a guest at the concert.The council held a  discussion on education and bilingualism on Tuesday that was also live streamed.The change has been broadly welcomed on TwitterHowever, one tweet questioned the council’s ‘Gaelic First’ terminology. \u2028Sinatra Surveyor@EuKnowIt tweeted: “Look, I’m all for this, but “Gaelic First”  This is too close to the far right groups “America First” and “Britain First”. Needs to be more inclusive.”Shona MacLennan, chief executive of Bòrdna Gàidhlig, the principal public body promoting Gaelic, said: “Comhairle nan Eilean Siar’s policy to have GME as the default choice for pupils entering primary one is a signicant and welcome contribution.“They, like many public bodies, have a Gaelic language programme.“In its most recent plan there is a commitment to increase the number of pupils entering P Gaelic-medium education to  per cent by  and the change to GME as the default choice will support this.”Rob Dunbar, chair of Celtic languages, literature, history and antiquities at the University of Edinburgh, said: “Wherever you have Gaelic-medium, there are parents who have wanted it for their children.“But it is weaker than in the west of Ireland and in Gwynedd, the strongest Welsh-speaking part of Wales. Exclusive Irish-medium education and exclusive Welsh-medium education have been standard practice for a long time.”A Scottish Government spokesman said: “We have seen steady growth in those entering GME – an increase of over  per cent across Scotland in the last year, which shows our policies are working.“We are delighted many primary schools across the Western Isles more than  per cent of children are enrolled in GME at P.”©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"administration accounts manager with garriocks ","story":"Garriock Bros.

No film-maker has documented UK society as forensically as Ken Loach. The desperation that comes from poverty, the bad choices that often seem like the only choices available, are his stock-in-trade. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another compelling exemplar of what the man is all about.Marriedparents Ricky and Abbie did all the right things. They followed the rules andworked hard and were on the brink of becoming homeowners when the Northern Rockbuilding society collapsed, taking their dreams with it. Now mired in debt, theyare shunted from one shabby rental to another along with surly son Seb andsmart daughter Liza Jane.Ricky’sskills are no longer in demand. Even though he is a “grafter” who has doneevery job under the sun, proper jobs – with set hours, agreeable conditions, anda decent wage – are like hen’s teeth. So he takes a punt, persuades his we tosell her car, and buys a nearly-new van. them. He doesn’t get a wage – he chargesfees. He is a self-employed knight of the road, free to make as much money ashis speed around Newcastle will allow.Theillusion is soon shattered. His boss at the depot is a bullet-headed bruiserwith all the empathy of a shark. That’s because he himself is trapped in jungleof competition with other depots. He may be an apex predator, but he’s only asubstandard quarter away from losing his crown.Thegig economy is sold with promises of self-empowerment and personal agency thereality for Ricky is -hour days, a black box all-seeing eye that has timingsdown to the second, and financial penaltiesa sht is missed # for whateverreason, whether family emergency or personal injury. The god of just-in-timedelivery doesn’t care about any of that. Neither does Ricky’s boss, theself-appointed “patron saint of nasty bastards.”Thereisn’t even enough time to go to the toilet. On his first day with PDF, Ricky ishanded an empty plastic bottle by a co-worker. For male drivers in a hurry, itis an essential piece of equipment.Ricky’smachine-tooled existence is mirrored by his we’s. She is a care worker on azero-hours contract who has only minutes to attend to the basic needs of herelderly charges. One of them, Rosie, used to cook for striking miners in thes. When Abbie tells her that her own working day is from .am to pm,Rosie counters with: “What happened to the eight-hour day ”It is a pivotal scene. Losing what we once took for granted has been a Loach mot for decades. ‘Sorry We Missed You’ is another powerful chapter in his social history of post-war Britain."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/001WH1701NCA.jpg","title":"west highland free press audio files friday 17th","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineEvery week, Skye  Lochalsh Council for Voluntary Organisations http:www.slcvo.org.uk  produces an abridged audio version of the West Highland Free Press.

It is understood that several councils have already received registrations.While the Mid and East Antrim council meeting was held in private, the News Letter understands that some members were strongly opposed to accepting a policy which would compel staff to carry out same sex marriages against their wishes.Alderman Paul Reid, pictured, who is also a church minister in Larne, said: “I can’t go into the specics of the meeting or the discussions that took place in closed council.“However, speaking generally this is an issue affecting the whole of Northern Ireland and each of our  council areas. This has everything to do with same-sex marriage, and at the same time nothing to do with same-sex marriage.“This is an issue of conscience. Just because legal advice says something is ok, doesn’t mean it is right for councils to enforce on staff. Religious beliefs don’t come into it.“While the General Registrars’ Office believes there to be no issue legally, it is absolutely wrong to force people to carry out duties which are at odds with their conscience.”Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry  days before doing so, the first same sex weddings are expected to be held next month.Last year MPs backed amendments which required the government to extend same-sex marriage here.Paisley sees vote dip but he keeps vice-like grip on North Antrim Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":null,"title":"traffic returning to normal after ballyclare collision","story":"Road users are advised that an earlier road traffic collision in the Tildarg area has now been cleared.A Department for Infrastructure spokesperson said: “An earlier road traffic collision on the B Collin Road in the Tildarg area of Ballyclare has now been cleared and traffic is getting back to normal.”Police are at the scene.Drugs and cash seized after three vehicle collision - PSNI also raid drivers home Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BALL | Article Teaser\"try catch "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_2691691.jpg--.jpg?1579168441000\n","title":"good health matters and christmas cheer at glarryford wi","story":"PRESIDENT Vera McBurney welcomed speaker Robert Dick to the November meeting in Glarryford Farmers’ Hall.

He is in thehot seat this week, speaking to us about his love of music and choosing his top ten tracks - not an easy task by any means.Vincent enjoys a busy family le AND has five children and five grandchildren.He is a finance and property expert, and in his spare time helps out as a quiz master, which keeps him sharp!However music has always been a big part of his le, and he has had an interest in it since he was only a boy.“Music is a passion and something that has followed me since childhood,” explained Vincent.He confesses that his top  favourite songs are constantly changing, so when revealing his list, he decided to focus on a top  that brings back the strongest memories for him throughout his le.At number one is the Beach Boys with ‘God Only knows’.“This was released in  off the incredible Pet Sounds album. “Although I didn’t discover it until my teens, this is an enduring song of beauty.” Number two on his list is ‘The Long and Winding Road’ from The Beatles.He said: “It’s impossible not to have a Beatles track in here. This is just before my time but this song from the  ‘Let it Be’ album is my pick from many contenders.Number three is Love Affair – Everlasting Love. “This is my earliest memory from the  pop classic. “The remake of a ‘ hit for Robert Knight sung by the wonderful Steve Ellis.” The number four spot is reserved for ‘Bridge Over Troubled Water’.“Coming up to its th anniversary, my constant favourite song of all time by Simon and Garfunkelis Bridge Over Troubled Waters.” Number five goes to Sam Cooke with ‘Bring it On Home to Me’“What top  couldn’t contain this amazing singer and composer who contributed to the success of Aretha, Marvin Gaye, Stevie Wonder and Al Green.” Number six belongs to a Pink Floyd classic.“Probably in the mid ’s my favourite group was Pink Floyd. It was during this period that I began to collect albums.“Dark Side Of The Moon being my first Floyd purchase, however my pick is ‘Wish You Were Here’ off their ‘ album of the same name.”Seventh spot goes to The Eagles. “Sticking my mid ’s periodof music and my infatuation with The Eagles.“I rather quickly acquired their early albums ‘Desperado On The Border One Of These Nights’, however my selection is ‘The Last Resort’ off their th studio album Hotel Calornia.” For eighth spot, Vincent stays with The Eagles.“I’m still in my teenage years and sticking with the Eagles theme, although I’ve moved sideways to select an album I listened to nightly for a couple of years from Jackson Browne.“It was his fourth album and I’ve picked the title track, which is the wonderful ‘The Pretender’. As the list draws to a close, Vincent says: “Running out of room as I juggle with The Four Tops, The Jam, Steely Dan, Stevie, Wonder, Elvis Costello, Al Green, Spencer Davis, The Rolling Stones, George Harrison and OMD.“But I have to stick with my memory theme and at number nine I’ve gone with ‘Supertramp’ which I overplayed at university.“Mainly Crime Of The Century and Breakfast In America and Crisis What Crisis.“My selection is from the latter album and I’ve gone for A Soap Box Opera, it’s orchestral feel just does it to me.”For the last place on his top ten list, Vincent has included a track from the legendary Bruce Springsteen.“I needed Bruce Springsteen in here.“Although how do I pick just one track  Born To Run, The River Nebraska, Born In The USA, The Rising “Again sticking with nostalgia and being a romantic I’ve picked the  ‘Dancing In The Dark’ because it was the year I married Catherine and she’s had to put up with my music ever since!”It’s often hard to think of your favourite  tracks! Vincent admits these “are not necessarily my favourite ever songs as the list changes constantly, but they certainly contain my strongest and fondest memories from down through the years.

I want to make sure the Assembly reflects the new opportunity we have and have said to members both publicly and privately that I have to try and set a standard here of respecting everybody no matter who is in that chamber, they are all equal. The people who vote for them are equal. It’s about respect at the end of the day and I have to earn that as well.”The West Belfast MLA said that his take on the dynamics of the new ing Assembly going forward is that “it’s very important that it rises to occasion”. Having met with British Prime Minister Boris Johnston, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Tánaiste Simon Coveney, Mr Maskey said that both governments need to “respect that as well”. “We’ve got to respect political dference and we have to manage those,” he said. “I had very constructive engagements with them on Monday, obviously the substance of their visits was dealt with by the Executive.”Impartiality in his role as Speaker is a core element of the post, he said.“I had been pushing very hard on securing the funding that was announcement by the Department for Education for West Belfast schools. When it was announced about St John the Baptist I couldn’t even comment on it as I was in the ‘chair’ and that is the type of thing that your constituency needs to see a result on. There are little restrictions in this role but I will try to manage them."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"andytown ahead of schedule","story":"THE new Andersonstown Leisure Centre is set to open to the public in April, it has been revealed.Speaking at the official opening of the Brook Leisure Centre in Twinbrook, Cllr Brian Kingston, Chair of Belfast City Council’s Strategic, Policy and Resources Committee, said the redevelopment project was “ahead of schedule”.He said: “West Belfast has more to look forward to later this year with the opening of the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, scheduled to open in April.“Herron Brotherstold me they are ahead of schedule.“Both Brook and Andersonstown Leisure Centres will completely transform leisure opportunities and active living access in West Belfast.”The new £ million state-of-the-art facility on the Andersonstown Road will focus largely on water-based family fun, with the newly installed water slides having been visible for months.The centre will also offer a range of dry facilities including a -station fitness suite, exercise and spin studio, café, multi-purpose room and two outdoor G five-a-side pitches."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"best of traditional irish music for belfast","story":"THE Waterfront Hall is set to host the  Gradam Ceoil TG music awards, with globally renowned quintet Beoga playing live at the internationally acclaimed event.Trad sensation Beoga, who collaborated with Ed Sheeran for his  chart topping hit ‘Galway Girl’ will take to the stage, for what is set to be the biggest Gradam Ceoil to date.Gradam Ceoil is the premier annual traditional music awards, with this year’s event set to be televised live on TG and available to stream on BBC iPlayer live from Belfast on Sunday February  thanks to support from Northern Ireland Screen’s Irish Language Broadcast Fund.The band are looking forward to their upcoming performance in Belfast.“We are delighted to be involved in the rdannual Gradam Ceoil TG traditional music awards celebration.

The Reds battled back from Leroy Millar’s early opener in the second half to stage a smash-and-grab - win and McLaughlin felt his side emptied everything into their search for a route back into the game. “I’m delighted,” reflected McLaughlin. “You saw how much effort that players put into the second half and you’ve got to give Ballymena credit – they were good on the break, got their lead with a soft goal we gave away and they defended their lead really well. But you saw how much our boys put into the second half, they emptied their heart on to the pitch and gave us everything.“To get the equaliser, we were happy with that and to go into extra time because I thought the momentum was with us. But to go and win it a minute later was an incredible finish to the game. It’s a sore one for Ballymenayou’re a Ballymena fan or player tonight. I’m sure they’re going back absolutely devastated at losing the game in the th minute. Unfortunately someone had to lose and you don’t want to see young players going off with their heads down but you can’t take it away from our boys. They gave it everything and they probably slightly deserved it in the end.” McLaughlin refused to take any credit for substitutes Thomas Maguire and Ryan Curran popping up with the late goals, but he praised the duo for putting their personal disappointment to one side for the good of the team. “The players on the pitch did the business,” he added. “The players on the pitch worked Ballymena really hard, they tried their best to work opportunities, Ballymena defended brilliantly well, you can’t deny them that, but when the seven minutes went up we looked like we had a goal in us. I was just hoping it wasn’t going to be one of those days where it would be a sad story – could we have done this and should we have done that “I felt we would get one chance in that seven minutes and take it to extra time, I felt we were finishing the game the stronger. For Thomas [Maguire] and Ryan [Curran] to pop up, fair play to them because I’m sure they were disappointed not to be starting the game. They put their own personal disappointment to one side to go and do a job for the team.”Such was the intensity of that seven minutes of madness, McLaughlin was unable to remember his feelings during the late drama but acknowledged the backing of the Red Army and paid tribute to their “incredible” support. “I pulled two hamstrings running on to the pitch celebrating and anything after that, I don’t know what happened,” admits McLaughlin. “Your emotions take over you because you can see what it means to the players and what it means to the supporters. You can’t go through any interview and not talk about the supporters tonight. “That was incredible support that Cltonville brought tonight in the County Antrim Shield on a Tuesday night. I think there is only one team in the ision that has that support and it’s Cltonville. You saw what it meant to the players and supporters from the goals went in. My mind went blank straight away and only now am I settling down.”Tuesday’s victory ends a four-year wait for silverware and McLaughlin hopes it will give his players a taste for future success. “Sometimes the first trophy is the hardest one to get. “I didn’t come here to make up the numbers, I came here to try and establish Cltonville back as a contender for the ision and as a team who should be challenging to win trophies. “If I didn’t see that potential in them, I wouldn’t have come up,” said the Derry man. “When I see the quality within the playing squad and the support they get when things are going well, when I see how hard they work, I know they’ve got potential to win trophies. All that hard work’s been justied tonight. “It’s one trophy but we’re not going to rest on that, we want more. It’s such a young squad and for a lot of them it’s their first senior medals. Hopefully now they’ll get that appetite for success and to challenge for trophies even more and you never know where this team might go.” "},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"nicole starts new year at home","story":"NEWTOWNABBEY woman Nicole Adams has finally been allowed tohome after six weeks in hospital.We’ve been following the journey of cystic fibrosis suferrer Nicolewho last year won her battle for access to le-changing drugs.But Nicole was admitted to hospital at the end of November where her condition deteriorated after she caught a flu.Despite her sickness, she was still keen to start the drugs Symkevi and Orkambi after the Department of Health agreed a deal with US pharmaceutical company Vertex to make them available in the north.Unexpectedly, Nicole’s body reacted badly to Symkevi and she was taken into intensive care on December  as she fought for her le.Brave Nicole battled through and has now been given a more powerful drug – Trikafta – as she continues on the road to recovery.This week, Nicole completed a remarkable turnaround as she ed home with one month’s supply of the new drug.“I have one month’s worth of Trikafta in my grasp and it is so surreal,” explained Nicole.“What it has done for me so far is amazing.

bpanews_bc-f-d-f-ccfdab_EmailChancellor Sajid Javid has kicked off the hunt to replace long-standing Office for Budget Responsibility chairman Robert Chote when his term at the fiscal watchdog comes to an end in October..pushMr Chote has headed up the independent economic forecaster since it was launched in , having served the maximum two five-year terms.The Chancellor said Mr Chote has led the Office for Budget Responsibilitywith “intelligence, independence and integrity”.\" width\"\" \"\" rel\"nofollow\"  Chancellor Sajid Javid said the OBR is a ‘world class leader in fiscal transparency’ He added: “Finding the right candidate to lead the OBR and build on the signicant progress of the last  years is vital for maintaining the credibility of the UK’s fiscal framework and our status as a world leader in fiscal transparency.“I look forward to working with Robert Chote to deliver my Budget on March  before he finishes his second term as chair.”The Treasury said the recruitment process will look at the “broadest possible pool of applicants” and is open to applications until February .It is set to make an appointment in early spring.The role – which is supported by a -strong team at the OBR – comes with a £, annual salary and can be taken on a full-time or part-time basis.According to the job advert, candidates “must command broad respect for their objectivity in dealing with issues of political sensitivity”, and have “outstanding communication skills and integrity”.But the relationship between the OBR and the Treasury has not always been smooth, with the watchdog earlier this year ordered to cancel its updated outlook on the public finances.The Government’s move to scrap the Budget on November  ahead of the snap General Election meant the OBR was not able to provide a full economic and fiscal outlook.It had planned instead to publish an updated view of public finances due to major changes since March to the way student loans and pension schemes are accounted for in the figures.But it was forced to scrap these plans as the Government deemed it would break election rules, prompting accusations of political interference.The move has also put the OBR at risk of breaking its legal commitment to publish two forecasts each financial year, given that it is yet to produce even one so far in -.With the next forecasts due alongside the Budget on March , it has little time either side to produce a second set.A Treasury spokesman said they were “still working with the OBR and other governmental departments” to find a solution.Mr Chote said on presenting the annual welfare trends and forecast evaluation reports last month, the OBR and Treasury were considering “whether there could be a legislative solution to this legislative problem or whether there is a way we could tick the legal box without wasting your and a lot of other people’s time”."},{"url":null,"title":"emu startles staff at australia airport","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER

However he has not been emotionally and physically able to perform with the band, by his own admission, for the last  months,” the statement read.“We have missed him and have encouraged him to rejoin us to play many times but apparently he has not felt ready to do so.“Joey has now waited until the last moment to accept our invitation, when we unfortunately have no time for necessary rehearsals during Grammys week.”Kramer said after Wednesday’s decision he appreciates the band’s offer, which he said amounts to “red carpet photo ops.” But he said it’s still “extremely hurtful” to know someone  will be playing in his place."},{"url":null,"title":"putins constitutional proposals given backing in first duma reading","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthsundayleEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

According to the Russian Constitution, he will have to step down in , having served two consecutive terms.The bill submitted to parliament empowers the State Council to “determine the main directions of home and foreign policy”, its specic authority yet to be spelled in a separate law.It gives the parliament more say over Cabinet ministers’ appointment, but emphasises that the president should retain the power to dismiss the prime minister and Cabinet ministers and remain in charge of the Russian military and law enforcement agencies.Commentators see these proposals as a strategy for Mr Putin to stay in charge by becoming the head of the State Council.The draft also modies the constitution to limit a president to two terms altogether, unlike the current version containing a limit of two consecutive terms.The second reading of the bill is scheduled for February . Politicians and the working group created by Mr Putin have already come up with a iety of proposals in addition to what the draft law outlines.Mr Putin said that the constitutional changes need to be approved by the entire nation, but it remains unclear how such a vote would be organised.Russian opposition members condemned the reform as a “constitutional coup” and called for a rally against it on February ."},{"url":null,"title":"510981","story":"The Shantallow Community Centre is to be demolished tomorrow to make way for a new pound. million facility, but before the doors close for the last time we spoke to the man who was instrumental in getting it built.Erected in , the pound, building was supposed to last a decade, but it has served the area for  years.When Derek McCauley moved to Moyola Walk with his we and three children in  there was only a shop and a chemist.Shantallow was just a field, said Mr McCauley, who worked in Coolkeeragh Power Station.The only amenity was Patsy Owens shop and the chemist.I was coming from a place where we had dance halls and picture houses, Shantallow didnt even have a bus service.The bus stopped at Belmont and we didnt have a chapel. We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We had to go to Pennyburn. googletag.cmd.push  Derek McCauley, founder member of Shantallow Community Centre. Photo - Deirdre Heaney, nwpresspics  The move was a big culture shock.I saw a very urgent need to get an organisation together to improve the situation.I felt what was needed was a tenants association.The seeds of the Shantallow Tenants Association were sown when the residents began organising bus runs to Moville and Malin.It was a great opportunity for neighbours to get to know each other and there was a general consensus that more should be done for the young families in the area.In , just before the outbreak of the Troubles, Mr McCauley wrote  to the Belfastasking for help as he knew there were a lot of tenants associations in the Greater Belfast area.Groups from across the North advised him how to go about setting up a tenants association.The Highfield Tenants, Association, Amalgamated Corporation Tenants Asso- ciation, Tullycarnet Tenants Association, Lyne Social Club in Larne, North Belfast Tenants Association and the National Federation of Tenants Associations all wrote to me.I received lots of replies and they supplied me very useful advice.Most of these associations were political and non sectarian and I still have those letters.The main theme of these letters was use your politicians, but dont let them use you.The first meeting was held in a small gun club in the area by founder members, Danny Cooley, Tom Doherty, Sally Fleming and Mr McCauley.Mr McCauley was elected as chairman and Mr Cooley was elected as treasurer and it quickly became clear a community centre was needed.We put a questionnaire around the estate asking would they like a centre and what they would like to see in it and we got a great response.The association met with the Housing Trust  and made their case.We met with a lady called Miss MCCullough. She was a great help to us and I think we struck a chord with her, said Mr McCauley.The reason we were successful was because we were non political and non sectarian.When we went to ask for anything we asked politely and we didnt demand it.The Shantallow Community Centre was the first of its type to be built in the city and cost pound,.Its was only supposed to last  years, said Mr McCauley.The centre was soon a hive of activity and people came from across the city to use it.We had a childrens play group, handicraft classes, Irish dancing classes, piano lessons, a childrens disco and a youth disco on a Saturday night.It was the only disco of its kind in the city at that time we had young people coming from Newbuildings and the foot of Bishop Street for that.You would find them standing outside after and they had no way of getting home, so I would have given them a lt in my big yellow Zephyr.Everyone remembers the Zephyr. If I go to a wake in Shantallow people say to me do you still have that big yellow car The list of activities at the centre continued to grow with gymnastics, rollerskating, indoor bowls and bingo.In  they held a cross community festival for all the churches in the area.It was a good time, said Mr McCauley.It was all young families living in the area and on the summer days you would have thought there was a swarm of bees out on the back square but it would just have been all the children.That was before phones and Playstations.The work of the centre stretched far outside its doors with bus runs, dinner dances, outdoor festivals, sports competitions and luncheon clubs.Mr McCauley dedicated countless hours to it, but he said none of it would have been possible without the support of his we, Rita, who sadly passed away two years ago.She was the most important person, he said.We had six children and she had to rear them all.Mr McCauley eventually retired from the Tenants Association in , but not before he shared his knowledge with community groups across the city. A long list of people gave many volunteer hours to the Shantallow Tenants Association and Community Centre.I would like to wish all future communities the success we had and give a special thanks to all those people who made it so successful. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lyndon Stephens died that morning after battling stoically against illness. His record label, Quiet Arch, was already planning to go into hiatus due to his illness and had planned a farewell gig in the Belfast Empire for that very evening. As fate would have it, it became his wake. I am a firm believer in the human spirit being how people remember you and I prefer to gather other people’s memories for things like this. Ryan Vail: “The man that gave me a career in music, toured me around the world, put me on tv, put me on radio, made me a headline festival artist, got me sound tracking, got me remixing, got me producing, got me talking on some of the most important industry , got me the most prestigious funding awards my manager, friend, label partnerLyndon Stephens.“I was his very first signing nine years ago and stayed with him the whole time. We released together, toured together started labels together, found acts together and had hours of phone calls together daily. “To be honest it’s been so so dficult to comprehend. Im really grateful for the memories we shared together.“RIP Lyndon, thank you for changing my le”Ciaran Lavery: “I first met Lyndon Stephens at Output, Belfast. He didn’t know me or owe me anything but kept putting me forward to talk to the local press that were at the event. “After the show, he askedI’d like to chat to him about working together. “Over the course of the next five years we broke down so many walls and glass ceilings. We spoke on the phone three for four times a day every day. I could call him at ungodly hours and he always answered, he was always there, Lyndon loved to talk. He was an incredible human being with a wonderful family and friends circle. “I know that when any friend musician needed advice of funding I pointed them towards Lyndon andhe had the time, he gave it willingly. I have an incredible amount of memories. I will miss my old friend so dearly, but in truth, I am truly blessed to have met Lyndon Stephens”.Francesca O’Connor, from Quiet Arch ,said “Lyndon Stephens, a man who wanted to make a genuine dference to this world, give the underdogs a  to shine and to show the world the incredible talent coming out of Northern Ireland. “He set up an artist management company, Champion Sound Music and record label, Quiet Arch, to put Northern Ireland artists on the international stage. I will forever be grateful to him for hiring me as a trainee artist manager . years ago. “As a young female with little experience but an eagerness to learn, he gave me a chance. I can only take inspiration from his creativity, decisiveness, determination and unwavering passion to succeed to carry on what he started. “Not long ago, he sent me the poem Go All The Way by Charles Bukowski and I cant think of a better way to describe his tenacious spirit.” She concluded: A loving husband, father, sister and friend, Lyndon is undoubtedly one in a million and will never be forgotten”.Ben Magee, also of Quiet Arch said “Lyndon’s biggest strength, and of those he had many, was when he believed in you, you knew about it. He was never one to shower you with praise, butyou had Lyndon in your corner, he made you feel like you could conquer the world. “A profound, hilarious inidual who was always one step ahead of everyone  in the room, Lyndon never spent a second of his le saying goodbye. “He always had his eyes fixed squarely on the horizon, eyebrows raised, a mad cackle dancing on the corner of his mouth. He was a mentor, a confidant, an always open ear and a friend. And I will miss him dearly.”My memories of Lyndon are very similar to Ciaran’s and probably most other people’s. he was always willing to help and preferred to talk over the other means of communication. If I ever went off the deep end with one of my rants at the music scene here Lyndon would message me quickly to calmly explain how things worked and how I might be right but mostly how I was wrong. It always began with a text message but was always swtly abandoned in favour of a chat. Always knowledgeable and always reasonable I will truly miss the advice and am forever grateful for the counsel. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

But with our lives being so busy we often forget the simple activities bring the happiest times and memories. As parents, and childminders too, we can also feel under pressure to always be teaching our children, so this week I’ve combined these two themes, baking and learning. The curriculum for our young children talks about three prime areas of learningand these are Personal, Social andEmotional Development - this is all about learning to share, to wait, taking an interest and participating in activities, being responsible for tasks, having opportunity to feel valued and able to contribute, talking about what you are doing together, asking questions and having a special bond etc. googletag.cmd.push Communication and Language - this is about listening, paying attention, being able to focus and concentrate, being able to follow instructions, naming dferent items and actions, speaking in sentences, asking and answering questions, having a two way conversation etc Physical Development - is about small finger movements and large movements too, it’s about being able to use and control items, objects and tools etc and also self care, personal hygiene, having own likes and dislikes, being safe and using equipment safely etc. If we consider these and look at all that baking involves we can see all the learning that is going on from collecting all ingredients, selecting and organising bowls, spoons, whisks etc, washing hands, putting on an apron, then reading instructions, following a receipe, talking about what next, weighing, counting, pouring, breaking, mixing, adding, stirring, smelling, washing implements, waiting for cakes to cook then cool before sharing and tasting! googletag.cmd.push  Recipes For You To Make Together Scones - g oz self raising flour, g oz butter, g oz caster sugar, ml fl oz milk, pinch of salt . Method Heat the oven to C F Gas . Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix together the flour and salt and rub in the butter. Stir in the sugar and then the milk to make a dough. Put onto a lightly floured work topand knead. Roll out the dough to about cm thick and shape into scones. Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk. Bake for - minutes until well risen and golden. Then leave to cool on a wire rack and add whatever you like! If you want to add sultanas or choc chips before you bake then why not! Cheese Pancakes -   cup flour,  frac tsp baking powder,  frac tsp sugar,   tsp salt,  egg,  cupof grated cheddar cheese - too much cheese will make them too sloppy,  cup milk ,  tbsp melted butter. Method Mix together the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt. Stir the grated cheddar cheese into the flour mixture until everything is evenly combined. Beat together in a separate bowl the egg, milk and melted butter. Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just to moisten. Heat a lightly oiled frying pan over medium high heat. Spoon the batter onto the pan, using approximately   cup for each pancake. Cook till brown on both sides and enjoy! Cupcakes - g butter , it’s a good idea to get the butter out of the fridge much earlier so it is soft!,  large eggs, g caster sugar,g self raising flour . Method heat oven to C   F  Gas . Fill a cup cake tray with  cake cases. Whisk together butter, sugar then add beaten eggs bit at a time, whisking in between. Add vanilla extract and sieved flour then pop the mixture into the cake cases and into the oven for about  minutes. If you’d like to decorate with buttercream after they have cooled , then to make the butter cream mix together g butterand g icing sugarthen add  tbsp milk and food colouringyou like.

In addition their anger has grown on foot of the announcement yesterday that our MLAs will receive pound, increase in their pay with a further increase in April . “NIPSA has no issue with the fact that MLAs, as workers, are receiving a pay increase – however all workers – including civil servants deserve to be treated equally and receive at least an inflationary increase in their pay plus some recognition for the loss of pay over the past  years. This benchmark has now been set. NIPSA is meeting with the Finance Minister later today when we will be pressing him to ensure that civil servants, who it has been acknowledged, have been working in very dficult circumstances in the absence of the NI Assembly, receive an above inflationary pay increase in recognition of the work they have carried out over the last  years without political direction.”Ms Millar went on to say: “We are looking forward to the meeting later today with the Minister and we hope for a positive engagement and a positive outcome in which civil servants can be appropriately rewarded.”People Before Profit Councillor Shaun Harkin said he will be joining workers on the picket line.“Hard working civil servants get no automatic pay increases every year. Theyve had year on year cuts from Stormont. Theyve been lied to and treated with contempt.“The new Stormont deal talks about workers rights but civil servants are still being forced to take strike action for very modest demands.“Let the Stormont Executive parties know they need to start treating workers with respect.”Concluding Coucnillor Harkin said:Solidarity with the strikers and all workers demanding justice, dignity and respect.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have had a range of concerns over time around recommendations emerging from the Independent Financial Review Panel.We are jointly asking the Assembly Commission that any pay proposal is immediately deferred until the work of the Financial Review Panel has been comprehensively reviewed, and a new  has the opportunity to consider this matter again and produce a fresh determination. We recognise that a number of MLAs and parties have indicatedthe proposed pay increase cannot be halted, they will donate any additional sum to local causes and charities.”Derrys MLAs had al- ready declared they would be donating the money to charityit could not bestopped or ed.The SDLPsMark H Durkan said he understood the public anger after the raise was announced.When I heard about the rise I thought it was ludicrous.I dontfeel I deserve it or am entitled to it.Mr Durkan said he would be donating the money to a charity in the Foyle constituency.His party colleague, Sinead McLaughlin, said she too would give the money to charity.Im only in this job  days so I really dont think I qualy for a raise at all, shecommented.If I get it I will choose a charity to donate it to. googletag.cmd.push UnjustiableSinn Feacutein MLA Raymond McCartney said his partyopposed the increase.“Given that the Assembly has just been restored this increase is unjustiable, he said.“Sinn Feacutein will not accept it.“We are actively exploring options for stopping this pay rise.“If that’s not possible then we will seethis money can be ed to public funds or donated to charity.”The view was echoed by Mr McCartneys party colleague, MLA Karen Mullan, who retweeted joint leader of the Assembly Michelle ONeills statement “given that the Assembly has just been restored this is unjustiable and should not be paid.”DUP MLA Gary Middleton said: As many will know, Assembly member salaries are set by an independent body and are not under the control of MLAs.However, I believe the automatic pay increase which is due to be implemented this year is not acceptable.The announcement will have done nothing for confidence in the Northern Ireland Assembly.I will be looking at mechanisms by which it can be ed andit cant I will be donating it to a charity in the Foyle area. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

We have had a range of concerns over time around recommendations emerging from the Independent Financial Review Panel.We are jointly asking the Assembly Commission that any pay proposal is immediately deferred until the work of the Financial Review Panel has been comprehensively reviewed, and a new  has the opportunity to consider this matter again and produce a fresh determination. We recognise that a number of MLAs and parties have indicatedthe proposed pay increase cannot be halted, they will donate any additional sum to local causes and charities.”Derrys MLAs had al- ready declared they would be donating the money to charityit could not bestopped or ed.The SDLPsMark H Durkan said he understood the public anger after the raise was announced.When I heard about the rise I thought it was ludicrous.I dontfeel I deserve it or am entitled to it.Mr Durkan said he would be donating the money to a charity in the Foyle constituency.His party colleague, Sinead McLaughlin, said she too would give the money to charity.Im only in this job  days so I really dont think I qualy for a raise at all, shecommented.If I get it I will choose a charity to donate it to. googletag.cmd.push UnjustiableSinn Feacutein MLA Raymond McCartney said his partyopposed the increase.“Given that the Assembly has just been restored this increase is unjustiable, he said.“Sinn Feacutein will not accept it.“We are actively exploring options for stopping this pay rise.“If that’s not possible then we will seethis money can be ed to public funds or donated to charity.”The view was echoed by Mr McCartneys party colleague, MLA Karen Mullan, who retweeted joint leader of the Assembly Michelle ONeills statement “given that the Assembly has just been restored this is unjustiable and should not be paid.”DUP MLA Gary Middleton said: As many will know, Assembly member salaries are set by an independent body and are not under the control of MLAs.However, I believe the automatic pay increase which is due to be implemented this year is not acceptable.The announcement will have done nothing for confidence in the Northern Ireland Assembly.I will be looking at mechanisms by which it can be ed andit cant I will be donating it to a charity in the Foyle area. googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Im happy. Its just about getting through games now and playing every week for me. “I dont think Ive missed many games, maybe one or two at most with injury, which is brilliant for me with my track record. Thats something that hasnt been happening for a couple of years so its good to get games under my belt. Im back to where I was a few years ago to be honest.

Its not the biggest win but to be fair in the County Antrim youre beating all the top teams youre beating the likes of Linfield, Glentoran and Crues, so its still important to us and its one on the board now, and we cam focus on the league against Coleraine now on Monday. To get that win is important to lt the group going forward.”McDermotts renaissance in Belfast continues, with the -year old loving his football once again. “Its brilliant,” he said. “Im back playing football with a smile on my face. Im happy. Its just about getting through games now and playing every week for me. “I dont think Ive missed many games, maybe one or two at most with injury, which is brilliant for me with my track record. Thats something that hasnt been happening for a couple of years so its good to get games under my belt. Im back to where I was a few years ago to be honest. I feel really fit and healthy and the football is taking care of itself now which is great. The main thing for me is keeping that going and being happy.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

If we hadnt won it, it would have been a real disappointment and a real setback for us so all the emotion of the  minutes got to me a wee bit at the end and thats the first time thats kind of happened. It was nice to get the four points dont get me wrong, but hopefully with other games left now in the season we can get through more comfortably.Derry are one of four teams on  points and it as yet hard to predict which way the remainder of the season will go. The bare minimum is staying in the ision, but a play-off place is still very much in sight.Its a really weird table because we are five points off the bottom but only three points off top four,” McCarter agreed.“It is a game where you get away with not playing your best but it was so important to get the four points and thats the way its going to be for the rest of the season. You can try and get perfection every game, but its pretty unlikely thats going to happen, but at the end of the day it is about just getting over the line and winning whatever way you can and that starts again this weekend down in Enniscorthy.” googletag.cmd.push PRESSUREThe league leaders are under severe pressure from Skerries at the top of the table, and having won  from  league games so far, they will remain big favourites against an opponent that has struggled for consistency. Nothing is certain in Division C however, and with Bangor showing that Enniscorthy are beatable, Derry have plenty of reason to be optimistic. McCarter in particular feels that his side can exploit their opponents and be more clinical than they were during a - defeat at Judges Road in December.“Any team is beatable in our league and it really is about playing well on the day,” he added. “I have watched the video of us playing against Enniscorthy at home and my gut feeling at the time and when I watched it the first time was that we were really poor that day. But, when I watched it again last week, the amount of chances we created wads frightening in the first half. “We could have had three or four tries but we just lacked a real clinical cutting edge and thats what you need against there real top teams. “If you dont take your chances youll pay for it butwe can create the same chances again, I would like to think that we wiould take some of them. Its just about putting them under pressure and making them feel uncomfortable in the game andwe do that then you never know. They are definitely going to be big favourites so that maybe takes a bit of pressure off us but I do think we can get a bit of joy down there.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The Bangor attacker played in Kurtis Bell, who slotted the ball into the inside side-netting after Saintfield were dispossessed at the edge of their own box.Saintfield raised it a few gears and struck three times in the  minutes before half-time.The first came from Andrew Clarke after James Sofley was played down the line. After beating two defenders, James played in Andrew, who passed the ball into the bottom right-hand corner past the lsquokeeper.It took less than five minutes for left back Oliver Duff to score Saintfieldrsquos third. A long ball found Adam Childs on the left wing.He played it back to the edge of the box for Duff. He took one touch to set himself before striking a powerful left-footed shot into the bottom right corner.The Saints scored one more goal before the break with Andrew Clarke playing the ball across the face of goal for Tony Liken to finish at the back post. Saintfield went into half-time in the driving seat and - up.The second half started much like the first ended with Saintfield scoring an early goal.Ryan Sofley was the supplier of an own goal after bombing into the box and fizzing a cross into the near post which ricocheted off the Bangor defender into the net.At - up, the Saints took their foot off the gas and conceded just over five minutes after scoring.Bangor gained possession from a loose ball in midfield and played it into Matty Hall, who turned well to beat the Saintfield defender before striking the ball low and hard into the bottom corner.The Saints were again quick to respond with Andrew Clarke getting his hat-trick with half an hour still to go.Clarke started the move in midfield and finished it expertly after James Sofleyrsquos effort was parried by the lsquokeeper.Saintfield had a penalty and rebound saved less than two minutes later after James Sofley was brought down in the box.However, the Saints werenrsquot finished yet and Clarke had one more goal left in them with  minutes left to go. Possibly the best goal of the game, as he showed real determination and skill to score his fourth. Another counter-attacking goal from the Saints as they broke fast from a Bangor corner.Clarke received the ball just inside the Bangor half and stood tall after several attempts to bring him down. He beat three defenders before slotting home a cool finish into the bottom corner.This goal also signalled the end of the goalkeeperrsquos game after he strongly disagreed with the refereersquos decision to allow the goal to stand. Bangor had one more chance before the end of the game when they were also awarded a penalty, but David Harper kept the Saintsrsquo five-goal lead intact and made it a penalty saved for both teams.A great performance for Saintfield who progress to the next round of the cup and a fantastic performance from  year-old Andrew Clarke who relished his role as an attacking midfielder.Saintfield United Bangor Young Men CLARENCE CUP ND ROUND.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Call.jpg","title":"Call to begin work on Ballynahinch bypass  ","story":"THE re-establishment of the Stormont Executive has led to fresh calls for work to start on Ballynahinchrsquos proposed multi-million pound bypass.Newly appointed Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon is being urged to signal the start of construction work on the scheme which is estimated to cost in excess of poundm.South Down MP Chris Hazzard mdash a former roads minister in a previous Executive who signed off the eagerly-awaited bypass in December  mdash has written to Ms Mallon seeking an assurance that the Ballynahinch scheme remains a priority for her department and that construction work will start as soon as possible.In addition, Rowallane councillor Billy Walker is tabling a notice of motion at the February meeting of Newry, Mourne and Down Council seeking across-the-board political support to seek an urgent meeting with Ms Mallon discuss the next step in the construction of the bypass.He also confirmed that Strangford MP, Jim Shannon, has written to Ms Mallon on the issue and is seeking a meeting with her to discuss the issue.There has been major progress on work on the near two-mile scheme to link the Newcastle and Saintfield roads, with work already completed on a major archaeological investigation along parts of the route.Work was due to complete on the schemersquos economic appraisal before the end of last year, with roads engineers confirming recently that in order to advance the bypass schemersquos state of readiness, preparatory work on contract documents was ongoing to ldquominimise the time required to initiate a procurement competition, should funding become available for construction.The by-pass, which would be the single biggest road scheme ever constructed in the district, is expected to take in excess of  months to build, with roads officials insisting that it will greatly benefit both strategic and local road users by reducing journey times and improving road safety.They are also confident that the schemersquos economic assessment demonstrates the by-pass would provide a good economic .The scheme is designed to alleviate chronic town centre congestion in Ballynahinch and along the main approach roads to the town.Major new roundabouts are proposed at the Belfast Road junction with the Saintfield Road and at the Newcastle Road junction with the Downpatrick Road, with a new bridge constructed over the Moss Road.It is also proposed that a section of the bypass will pass under part of the Crossgar Road with a  metre long bridge constructed to take traffic over Ballynahinch River.Overtaking lanes stretching almost  metres are proposed at either end of the bypass where major new roundabouts are to be constructed, with the scheme also including a shared footpath and cycle lane.Mr Hazzard said that following his decision to formally sign off the scheme at the end of , the government department had been working through ious legal stages to ensure the scheme could commence as soon as possible.ldquoA programme of geotechnical investigation works on lands along theof the scheme was completed in  with advanced archeological investigation works completed last year, he confirmed.ldquoThis allowed the Department to move ahead with the final stage of preparing contract documentation in readiness of funding becoming available to construct the scheme.Mr Hazzard added: ldquoWith an Infrastructure Minister now in place following the restoration of Stormont this week, funding should now be signed off and construction allowed to commence as soon as possible.Cllr Walker said it was the view of many, including senior roads engineers, that the multi-million pound scheme was vital to the survival of Ballynahinch town centre and will play a signicant role in helping boost the wider South Down economy.He said given that the project is shovel ready, it is essential that the cash is earmarked to allow construction work to start this year is forthcoming.ldquoMoving forward what is now required is the finance to build this scheme, continued Cllr Walker.ldquoIt is clear to me that when you look at other parts of Northern Ireland that Down District has consistently missed out on major roads funding. That must change and the cash needed to build Ballynahinchrsquos new bypass must be made available.The Rowallane councillor said that the bypass can help kick-start the economic regeneration of Ballynahinch town centre and act as a catalyst to encourage new investment.Cllr Walker added: ldquoThe eagerly-awaited scheme can address town centre gridlock and along the main approach roads.

Lidl, which currently employs  staff, claims its proposal will create  new jobs.In late November, the local council confirmed that outline permission granted in March for the multi-million pound development was to be quashed as a result of a judicial review brought by developer Don Holdings Ltd.However, days later, the agenda for the December meeting of the Planning Committee included a plannersrsquo recommendation to approve the new store proposal. The recommendation was subsequently withdrawn, but features on the agenda for todayrsquos meeting with a recommendation to approve.The Newcastle development proposal includes plans for almost  parking spaces, eight of which are reserved for mountain rescue team members.A new pedestrian crossing at the Bryansford Road junction with Shimna Road forms part of the proposal, with planners receiving  objections. Five five letters in support of the new rescue team base proposal have also been lodged.Lidl has consistently argued that its current base at Railway Street in Newcastle is too small to allow the store to carry the companyrsquos full range of goods, highlighting issues with narrow aisles and inadequate parking provision.It says the Railway Street base was only supposed to be a temporary home until a larger unit could be found.Lidl says it has been looking for an alternative town centre site for over decade without success until the Shanslieve Drive site became available, with the planned mountain rescue team centre providing the volunteers with a permanent base.Objectors to the new store proposal claim that there are ldquoserious errors in the transport assessment submitted in conjunction with the planning application, inaccurate land ownership information, unachievable visibility spays and out-of-season traffic surveys.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokeswoman confirmed yesterday that the Lidl planning application was deferred to allow further consideration of a number of submissions received by the local authority.She added: ldquoThe Council is endeavouring to bring this application back to the Planning Committee in Februarypossible..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C January 15%2C 1980  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH mdash Police believe that a professional gang were behind the drugs raid on a Ballynahinch chemist shop at the weekend.The thieves smashed their way into Hannawinrsquos Medical Hall in Main Street through a skylight and forced open a door to get to the shop. They used a crowbar to prise the steel cabinet containing a store of dangerous drugs out of the wall. The cabinet was later found along the side of the Carrickmannon Road, near Ballygowan.The drugs taken included heroin and cocaine, both of which are dangerous even in small doses. They are types of hard drug in big demand on the black market. Additives like glucose are used by drug pushers to multiply the volume and increase profits. Other drugs, including morphine and strychnine, were also taken.The raid was the latest in a spate across the province and police fear that the addiction problem could be more serious than previously realised.Police chiefs have backed chemists pressing for an urgent review of the Home Office regulations about the keeping of prescribed drugs in steel cabinets.The present procedure is making things too easy for the thieves. It has meant that the hard drugs are all kept in the same place and the professional thief knows that.Before  regulations, chemists had better safeguards, evenit meant hiding the hard drugs on the general drugs shelves. It meant that thieves could not go straight to the security cabinet and other break it open or take it with them.The head of the RUCrsquos drugs squad, Chief Inspective George McBride, said he agreed that there was an urgent need to re-examine safety procedures for storage of dangerous drugs.DOWNPATRICK mdash Compensation for the destruction of St Patrickrsquos Hall in Downpatrick has been agreed mdash almost six years after it was destroyed by fire.The trustees of St Patrickrsquos Parish were awarded pound, at Downpatrick Crown Court last Friday after a two-hour hearing.The award was made in four parts, the bulkbeing attributable to physical damage and the remainder split between loss of profits , contentsand site value pound,.The claim had been before the court for over a year and was held up after the Northern Ireland Office disputed the amount of the parishrsquos claim for loss of profits.On Friday counsel for the Northern Ireland Office argued that the hall trustees had not made a big enough effort to reduce lost profits. But this was strongly refuted by counsel for the hall trustees.In a -minute summing up, the judge looked at the ious points of the case. He said he felt the church had not acted unreasonably and that the trustees had done everything required of them under law.STRANGFORD mdash A Strangford schoolboy will pack his bags later this year to take up a scholarship at a new college at Cambridge mdash with the long term prospects of becoming a Cambridge don.He is  year-old Andrew McDowell, who is an A Level student at Down High School, and he learned this week that he was won an open exhibition to the famed university.In academic terms he has won the equivalent of a junior scholarship and he will be among the first major intake at the new Robinson College.Andrew already has nine O Levels and he sat the examination in November along with several thousand others.In October he will pack his bags to concentrate on Mathematics at the college, with the scholarship being renewable after two years.

The Ballynahinch venture was unique in having a large amount of surviving documentation.Mr Reid says it is clear from these papers that the scheme organised by the First Presbyterian Church was sophisticated, comprehensive, self-funded, and cradle-to-grave in scope. It included widowsrsquo and old age pensions, end of le and burial grants, and support for orphans.Finance allocated to the project was known as lsquoThe Poorrsquos Moneyrsquo. The scheme operated late in the reign of William III and was continued into the time of Queen Anne, George I and George II.Nowadays benefit claimants unable to work through illness or injury, are paid Employment Support Allowance, .In  a similar scheme was obviously operating in Ballynahinch. The church carpenter at that time was John Gough, and that year he suffered a signicant injury, perhaps a broken arm or leg. He was unable to work or to earn a living for over a year.John had been married six years earlier in , in his home congregation by Rev James McAlpine. His we was Elizabeth, neacutee Ferguson. Their children soon followed mdash Christine, who was five in  Rebecca, who was four, and their twin boys, George and James, who were just one year and one month.With four young children and no income, John and Elizabeth were soon struggling financially. But in April the church stepped in immediately, with payments for an initial three-month period, at six shillings per instalment. In August John tried to resume work, but couldnrsquot. The church continued payments, but now at a reduced rate of d. Another attempt at work in October  failed again, and again payments resumed.John eventually recovered and ed to work permanently in August , having received a total of  support payments from First Presbyterian. He resumed his valuable role in maintenance of the fabric, receiving church contracts in ,  and .The problem of unwed mothers and absent fathers is one that troubles every age and every generation. Back in the early s, the Ballynahinch Session took a stern approach to fire-and-forget fatherhood.Their starting point was an interview with the expectant mother to ascertain the identity of her co-responsible male partner. If she proved uncompliant, exclusion from church attendance was then threatened. Faced with resultant near-total social ostracism, the mother-to-be soon cooperated.The next stage involved the errant couple appearing some Sunday morning before the entire congregation, kneeling on the Stool of Repentance and confessing their extramarital transgression. After that they were received back into the congregation. Their child was baptised and recognised as a church member.In a -year period the Ballynahinch Session dealt with  such cases. In six, they identied both parents. In six other cases only the mother was identied in seven, only the father. In one case the origins and surname of a lsquofoundlingrsquo child were known, but neither parent actually came forward.By st century standards, these church procedures sound draconian. But they had the purpose of protecting the rights of the child and of offering an opportunity to the parents for their reputations to be salvaged,possible.The alternatives were a lot worse. It was common in the s for the sexton at Magheradroll Parish Church to discover live newborns abandoned overnight on his church doorstep, ordead through neglect or infanticide, to find their bodies surreptitiously concealed in adjacent graves.In Ireland such surviving infants were sent in large numbers to the Foundling Hospital in Dublin, which who received between ,-, orphans annually. The hospitalrsquos mortality rate was some %.In Ballynahinch, under Presbyterian auspices, some such infants were spared this grisly fate. The lives of a number of potential orphans were actively protected by the church in their home town.Under the Welfare Reform Act of , Disabled Living Allowance was controversially replaced with Personal Independence Payment. DLA payments were made to claimants who often had long term medical conditions. The amount of the award ied according to the degree of disability.Interestingly, in Ballynahinch in the early s, First Presbyterian made a number of long-term DLA-type awards to some lsquosupplicantsrsquo.Ms Grissel Foreman was on such a benefit from -. Some financial records of the Poorrsquos Money still exist. But all its other documentation is lost, so we donrsquot know what Grisselrsquos ailment actually was. It was obviously slow and progressive, perhaps something like tuberculosis, or multiple sclerosis, or Parkinsonrsquos.As her condition deteriorated, the church increased its amount of financial support. In  she received seven payments totalling s d. By  this had escalated to  payments totalling pound s d.She died in  and was buried at church expense. Over  years, amounts paid to her totalled pound s d. This was an enormous sum, considering the church ministerrsquos annual stipend at the time was pound.These and many other such stories will be outlined on Monday night at Down Museum.

We must go out there and grab them by selling what the district has to offer.Cllr Curran said given that the Newry, Mourne and Down area is the third largest of the provincersquos  district councils, it should be an ldquoattractive proposition for potential investors.ldquoThe focus moving forward must be on new job creation in both the public and private sector. It is important that we sell what the area has to offer.In relation to public sector job opportunities, Cllr Curran said available space at the Downshire Civic Centre could be utilised by a number of government departments keen to decentralise their operations from the greater Belfast area.He continued: ldquoNew investment will not happen out of the blue. We all have a duty to work together to secure it. I believe we need new hotels and there is a need for such a facility in the Downpatrick area and hope see progress on this issue in the near future.Cllr Curran is particularly keen to see the proposed commercial development at the site of the former Irish Street police station in Downpatrick and a number of adjacent derelict buildings progressed this year.ldquoThis exciting proposal has the potential to restore Downpatrickrsquos economic heart, create jobs and, most importantly, provide a boost for existing businesses via increased footfall, he said.Cllr Curran also warned that while attracting new investment is crucial, cracking Downpatrickrsquos traffic congestion problem is also essential.ldquoGridlock continues to stle town centre investment and we need to act quickly. While expensive schemes have been proposed in the past, nothing has happened. We must see progress in  and ensure roads officials deliver.ldquoWork was completed recently on a major upgrade of the Collinsrsquo Corner junction and while welcome, I and others remain to be convinced that it will address congestion problems in the heart of the town.Cllr Curran said roads officials also deserve praise for the improvement scheme in Fountain Street and hopes that in  efforts will be made by the Department for Infrastructure to improve Edward Street.He added: ldquoThis is a real problem area which has not been addressed. The presence of a busy primary school should ensure that roads officials redouble their efforts to improve driver and pedestrian safety.

Rail chiefs, who had been hoping for investment after the railways had proved so crucial to the war effort a few years earlier and that the buses would be barred from competing with the trains and instead provide a feeder service to stations, were devastated at the outcome.ldquoThe recommendation, accepted by Stormont, was that the entire Belfast and County Down Railway main line from Belfast to Newcastle, including the branches to Donaghadee, Ballynahinch and Ardglass, should be closed.The only route to be saved was the Belfast to Bangor connection, which continues operating successfully to this day.Mr Gardiner continued: ldquoThe attitude of Stormont was that it would be cheaper to move everything to the roads than to invest in railways that had been run down during the Second World War. People would use the buses instead. They developed huge road building schemes mdash most were never completed mdash but closed the railways first before these were even started. It seems incredible today.ldquoThe most puzzling element of the decision was the axing of the Belfast to Newtownards line, which served the east of the city mdash Dundonald, Knock and Comber areas in which the suburbs were developing and likely to provide increased commuter traffic had they been spared.ldquoIndeed, there were more than enough new diesel trains ordered to operate both the Bangor and Newtownards lines mdash and evidence suggests that the Transport Tribunal expected Stormont to spare the Comber line as a compromise option and as late as , before the tracks were lted, they were calling on the minister responsible to reverse the decision and trial these new diesel trains on this section of track mdash a call that fell on deaf ears.The  closures were the first steps in a plan which was to see the reduction of the Northern Irelandrsquos railway network from  miles to  miles mdash a decrease of  per cent.A decade later, the Great Northern Railway was ided between the UTA and its counterpart in the Republic, CIE, and further closures to lines to Armagh, Dungannon, Omagh and Strabane occurred.Willie Watterson and James Magill, who were porters and ticket clerks at Newcastle and Tullymurry stations, recalled their memories of the last train in an interview recorded for the BBC documentary lsquoRaising Steamrsquo in ldquoThe last train was a Sunday night. It was a cold winter night, January , , said Willie. There was twelve coaches, and two engines and two guards. She was packed. Packed to the doors. So I lit all the lamps, and put detonators on the line to give her a send-off.James added: ldquoI think every station did the same thing, so when the train came in there was a salute of bangs. I felt terrible about it, terribly terribly sad. I still felt it couldnrsquot happen. Still felt theyrsquoll come back, theyrsquoll run again. I couldnrsquot believe therersquod be no more railways, after working on them so hard.Adam Hamilton, who was a fireman mdash the person who stoked the fire on the steam locomotives mdash said: ldquoIt broke my heart, because the railways were in my blood. I still hear the sound of the steam still running on a clear night puffing away.Today, the Downpatrick and County Down Railway keeps the memory alive through its reconstruction of two miles of the former main line, as well as restored carriages rescued from their fate as hen houses.As part of its commemorations of the BCDRrsquos demise, it is keen to make contact with anyone who had any connection with the network, including former employees or their families, or people in possession of railway memorabilia such as photographs, tickets, timetables or even carriages.Mr Gardiner added: ldquoOne thing we would love for the museum is a BCDR unorm or tunic. So far we have been unable to track one down. Perhaps you have something in your loft And what of the future of the line  In November  the section of the BCDRrsquos former main line from Holywood Arches to Comber was opened as the Comber Greenway, whilst other sections have been used for roads as well as the section around Downpatrick being used by the DCDR.In the early s Northern Ireland Railways prepared a feasibility study into reopening the line to Newtownards, but this was not taken further by the Direct Rule administration.In May , the Department for Regional Development published its Railway Investment Prioritisation Strategy, which promised feasibility studies into the reopening of closed railway routes to Armagh, Dungannon and Castledawson by , but not including the Comber Newtownards route.However, maybe  years after the first railway closure in Northern Ireland, the new Minister for Infrastructure in the restored Stormont Government might see the first of those historic mistakes rectied.The Downpatrick Railway Museum can be contacted via email at info@downrail or message at www.facebook downrail..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Mickey.jpg","title":"Mickey ‘magic’ to help Magpies lift cup  ","story":"KILCOOrsquoS tearaways may hold the key to success in Sundayrsquos All-Ireland Club SFC final at Croke Park.The ability of their six forwards to win dirty ball and turnovers could dismantle the perceived invincibility of Corofinrsquos much-vaunted defensive system.Corofin, described in many quarters as the best club team ever, have an enviable set of defenders who squeeze the le out of the opposition.However, they have never encountered a team like Kilcoo before that has  attackers and  defenders.Conor Laverty, the three Johnston brothers mdash Ryan, Jerome and Shealan mdash Paul Devlin and Ryan McEvoy fight tooth and nail for every ball.They are the clubrsquos first line of defence and are not afraid to go where angels fear to tread, but can then turn into a snatch squad with the blink of an eye.Kilcoo will have to be at their bestthey are to cause an upset as the Galway and Connacht champions are sizzling hot favourites at   to win the Andy Merrigan Cup for an unprecedented third year in a row and the fourth time in six years.Certainly, Kilcoo have it all to do, but they fear no side.Manager Mickey Moran has twice taken Slaughtneil to All-Ireland finals day and few would begrudge the Derry man a first title with Kilcoo.He has transformed the Magpies into a ruthless, disciplined machine in a quiet, unobtrusive way and has won many admirers for his style of play.He started out in management in  when he took over the reins at Derry, the first of three separate spells in charge of the county team.

While pay parity and safe services are key issues for us, the key thing is that there are enough recurrent resources in place to deliver this now and in the future.Irene said the RCN is about putting patients first, describing the scale of the hospital waiting list issue as ldquounacceptable.She added: ldquoEmploying more nurses can help bring waiting lists down. This is not a new phenomena. It is tough to work as a nurse and it is not an easy job. But we currently have a situation where some nurses are taking on extra shts to earn more money, but that is just an unacceptable way to live.Alison Megarry said patients are nursesrsquo primary concern and at the heart of what they do, highlighting the need to keep staff working in Northern Ireland to ensure they donrsquot go across the water and donrsquot come back.She revealed that she was talking to a nursing sister last week who was working on international recruitment for nurses in Mumbai to work in Northern Ireland.ldquoThe nurses in India said why would they come here when the pay is less than it is in England, Scotland and Wales. I believe thatwe can keep our nurses here, it will help to tackle the waiting list issue, she said. ldquoThe big issue we have is that the population is ageing and people are living longer which therefore impacts on waiting lists.Nurse Sonia McCoubrey said that while pay parity is one issue, additional nurses are also required. She said many newly qualied nurses are choosing to go to England, Scotland or Wales because the money is better.She also said she worries about the safety of newly qualied nurses managing dficult situations and the patients they are caring for.ldquoYou have trolley waits and people lying in corridors. There is no privacy, no dignity and the situation is appalling. You go home at night after a sht burnt out and worried about what you have seen, the nurse added.Nurse Donna Boyd also expressed concern about waiting lists and said she fears that the situation is going to get worse, forcing many people to go private.ldquoIf more money is put into the system nurses are quite happy to do even more to help reduce waiting lists. All nurses go and above what is required of them when they are working, often staying after their scheduled quitting time which is unpaid work, she said.ldquoWith more people going private because of y waiting lists, a lot of the doctors and consultants are taking on private lists which then impacts on the NHS list. I have friends who were nurses who have left the profession to work in supermarkets because they have burnt themselves out.

Across the resort,  street lights are not working.The figures are available on the NI Direct website under the reporting fault problems menu with other districthot-spots including Ballynahinch where  street lights are currently out of order.Elsewhere,  faults have been reported in Killyleagh, with  brought to the government departmentrsquos attention in Castlewellan and Crossgar. In Saintfield,  faults have been reported.In Ballygowan,  street lights are currently out of order with  and  faults reported in Ardglass and Killough respectively.Sixteen street lights are out of order in Dundrum with  faults reported in Drumaness. The figures for the Spa and Clough are  and nine respectively.Last month, the Department for Infrastructure confirmed that its current budget for street lighting repairs was approximately poundm, explaining that the figure was much lower than the pound.m needed to provide a full street lighting repair service.It also revealed that repairs are now generally limited to those that can be carried out by the departmentrsquos internal street lighting workforce which only consists of five full and three part time electricians.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran described the number of reported street light faults across large parts of East Down as ldquoalarming and hopes that the money to expedite much-needed repairs will be earmarked by the new Stormont Executive.He said broken street lights in many areas represent a health and safety issue, explaining that an examination of every town and village across the district will reveal a signicant number of faults.Cllr Curran described faulty street lights as a ldquohot topic with politicians being contacted about the issue on all almost daily basis. He said the legacy of underfunding the roads department has experienced is now clear for all to see.The politician said many will be concerned that the Department for Infrastructure does not have the money it requires to carry out much-needed repairs.ldquoWhile I understand the decision to prioritise emergency repairs, there is no doubt that the alarming figure of almost  faulty street lights across East Down is simply going to increase. Clearly the issue is going to get a lot worse before it gets better, he said.ldquoStreet lights which are not working in areas where elderly people and indeed young families live poses a major problem. A fully working street lighting system provides residents with a sense of security and helps deter would-be criminals.Cllr Curran said that while the new Stormont Executive will inevitably face calls for investment in many key areas including health and education, the Department of Infrastructure also required an injection of funding.He added: ldquoWhile the focus for some will be on major new roads schemes which is understandable, it is clear that the creaking infrastructure the government department is responsible for, including street lighting, requires major cash injection.ldquoThe street lighting issues requires immediate attention. We are still in the grip of winter and several months away from the clearer evenings. Now that we have a local minister in place, I hope to meet her on this issue and other matters of local importance.A spokeswoman for the Department for Infrastructure said that in common with many other parts of the public service, the Department continued to face budget challenges and resources were currently not available to provide for a full street lighting repair service.She added: ldquoDue to this restricted service, outages are taking longer than usual to be repaired. However, priority will be given to hazardous electrical defects and group outages..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/15th January 2020 Tributes.jpg","title":"Tributes to lawyer who was ‘a real gentleman’  ","story":"TRIBUTES have been paid to a lawyer who died last week.Mr Paul McAlinden, who was a barrister, died peacefully in Belfast City Hospital last Wednesday.

For that reason, it would be churlish not to feel relief that Sinn Fein#s tantrum is over and the devolved institutions are running again.For the time being, the NHS pay dispute is resolved and the threat of more cancelled operations and outpatients’ appointments is receding. An injection of cash could start to shorten waiting lists and maybe even ease a chronic shortage of staff. Headteachers hope they’ll receive similar funding to address long-neglected problems in schools. The writer, commentator and public policy consultant Owen PolleyPreviously, civil servants and the Secretary of State were reluctant to intervene in these issues. But now, ministers are in place to patch up and mend the most glaring and immediate crises in public services. Can we expect more than an improvement in this sort of day-to-day management  After all, there are underlying reasons that our services are in such a poor state. Successive sets of ministers failed to implement reforms they knew were necessary, preferring to make crowd-pleasing announcements instead..ev-modals .modal.in .modal-dialog .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget .photo-article-notier-default .photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p @media.photo-article-notier-default .ev-widget p #jp .main-content .ev-widget#sticky-footer .sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner .photo-article-sticky-footer-banner p @media@media#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_text,#sticky-footer .desktop-sticky-footer_button #sticky-footer .fluid-container #sticky-footer .mobile-sticky-footer_button It would be great to be optimistic, but, regrettably, the deal that restored Stormont doesn’t inspire much hope.As Ben Lowry explained in his column Unionism has sent out a signal of defeatism and weakness, January , New Decade, New Approach was published in a way that flouted Strand  of the Belfast Agreement. It left key issues cloaked in ambiguity and it failed to address structural frailties that have caused our institutions to crash repeatedly. We’ve got the same parties, the same MLAs and many of the same ministers that struggled so abjectly in the past and there’s every sign that they’ve fallen seamlessly back into the same habits.The Assembly was not back a day before the SDLP’s Colum Eastwood accused the DUP and Sinn Fein of ‘vying up’ the speaker’s role to Alex Maskey, when he believed there was a prior agreement that Patsy McGlone would get the job. Then, both Arlene Foster and Michelle O’Neill shot down Edwin Poots’ tentative suggestion that water charges might be needed to fund improvements to crumbling water infrastructure.These disagreements are important because they speak to two of the biggest criticisms of how the previous executive carried out its business. Firstly, the assertion power-sharing was ‘carved up’ by the DUP and Sinn Fein in a way that excluded smaller parties and evaded scrutiny of decisions Sir Reg Empey described it memorably as a ‘huckster’s shop’. And secondly, the claim that the executive refused to take the potentially unpopular but necessary decisions that are the responsibility of every effective government. Dficult issues, like deciding which hospitals to close, reforming the welfare system or tackling the problem of empty school desks were either delayed endlessly or resolved through another set of crisis talks.Water and sewerage is a classic example. The new finance minister, Conor Murphy, was in charge of regional development when the system was overwhelmed during a period of bad weather in December . The ensuing scandal highlighted years of underinvestment and bad management that resulted in inadequate infrastructure and regular fines for pollution.Ten years later, Northern Ireland remains the only part of the UK without separate water-charges, we’ve still got the worst water infrastructure as a consequence and Northern Ireland Water has not been privatised or mutualised. Would anybody stake their le-savings on Stormont changing things substantially during the next  years, unless it’s simply handed the money to upgrade the system by Westminster Indeed,the revived executive has any plan at all for delivering better government, it’s based on the principle that it should get vast quantities of extra cash from the Treasury. Murphy described the government’s offer of £ billion of additional spending in Northern Ireland as “woefully inadequate”. Isn’t the phrase ‘gay Christian’ an oxymoron  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"A sense of entitlement oozes out of an executive that, in its last incarnation, was accused of wasting up to £ million of taxpayers’ cash through the RHI scandal. From Sam McBride’s book, Burned, we learned that some ministers and officials regarded direct funding from the Treasury as ‘free money’ injected into the Northern Ireland economy.Worryingly, the latest devolved government will be subject to even less scrutiny than its predecessor, domestically at least, because the former ‘opposition’ parties of the SDLP and the UUP have decided to take their seats in the executive.This decision is particularly baffling from the Ulster Unionists whose high-profile MLA Doug Beattie accused the secretary of state of back-tracking on commitments that legacy would not form part of the deal and whose leader, Steve Aiken, said Stormont was already “sinking back into New Decade, Same Approach”. To be fair, that’s what most of us expected, but the UUP is in a position to do something about it.try catch  TrendingNI snow due to arrive earlier than originally thought - temperatures to plummet to -degCPSNI confirm route slow moving ambulance will take - motorists urged to remain patientNI Snow Alert: Experts predict snowfall for next week - subzero temperatures expected across NIWill it snow in February   Northern Ireland weather forecast as Atlantic fronts set to sweep the UKPassengers were sobbing and making calls to loved ones - Aer Lingus pilot hailed miraculous after landing plane during Storm Brendan        v.. -  applyImgSrcs\" i sb  for   sb* sb u  o.dataset.srcu  u.replaceo.setAttributeo.setAttributedocumentwindowapplyImgSrcs JP  JP  JP  \"NA-BELFNEWS-\"JP  \"Opinion\"      Follow Us On       Explore News Sport Irish League Football Whats On Lestyle   Farming Le   More from the Belfast News Letter  Announcements Buy a Photo  Directory Jobs Homes Cars Local Guide  Public Notices  Reader Shop Must Read Read This Events   Useful Links Contact Us   Place your Ad Advertise a Job Subscribe  Readers Charter        ©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings  Terms and Conditions  Privacy policy    d.onerror  d.onload  d.src  [\"secure-uk.imrworldwide cgi-bin m ciuk-hcgccsi\", escape, \"rp\", escape, \"tscompactrnd\", .getTime].join"},{"url":null,"title":"people","story":" getRequiredClientIdforjpiconsole.log requiredClientIdcatch]EV.Core.updateUserProfile]EV.Core.updateUserProfile....... , , , , Would you like to receive the latest news, news features and service updates from Belfast News Letter via email \"Newsletters\"Would you like to receive more information from JPIMedia, publisher of Belfast News Letter, via occasional emails keeping you informed about new features, relevant offers, promotions, events and services that might be of interest to you \"By clicking on register, you will be creating an account with Belfast News Letter and agreeing to JPIMedia Publishing Ltd#s standard Terms and Conditions.

It is events like this in the very heart of Penarth which demonstrate how lucky we are to have such a ying and vibrant collection of businesses, which are so accessible.It was great to witness how the streets opened up to more traditional businesses of selling hand-crafted Christmas gts and roasted chestnuts, adding to the selection of businesses we already have on offer.Many of you will be aware of Small Business Saturday, which this year falls on December . The campaign aims to encourage people to ldquoshop local and to support small businesses in their communities.For me, one of the highlights of living in Penarth is access to a vibrant High Street. The street, and town as a whole, provides such a iety there really isnrsquot any need to go anywhere .I regularly make use of shops on the High Street, particularly the greengrocers and butchers, while my we, Michelle, makes use of others. Shopping locally you are almost always guaranteed to receive a first-class service with a smile, and it is that welcome, as well as the quality of the product or service, that keeps customers coming back ndash these are the reasons I always make thattrip.Thatrsquos why Irsquove got behind our local shops for this yearrsquos Small Business Saturday. In the run up to Small Business Saturday I have been visiting businesses across the constituency to talk to local business owners about them, their staff, what they enjoy about running their own business and the challenges that they face.On Friday December  I will be visiting businesses across Penarth. If you would like me to visit your business then please get in touch with my office on    or by emailing vaughan.gething@assembly.wales.Irsquod like to take this opportunity to thank the town council, as well as all its partners in organising the lights switch-on this year.

While policy decisions have yet to be made, heat pumps are the indicated preference.ldquoOver % of oil heated homes in Great Britain fall into EPC bands D to G ndash meaning they are poorly insulated and so unsuited for heat pumps without costly insulation work.ldquoFinancial support to help the poorest families switch heating systems would most likely be made available but many households will be expected to fund the work themselves. The vast majority just wonrsquot be able to do this.ldquoIntroducing policy which isnrsquot fit for purpose could have severe consequences.

This year, she will celebrate her ninety second birthday and she discusses a letime of activism across Europe.Veganuary is an annual event which encourages people to go vegan for a month. In last yearrsquos campaign, a quarter of a million people pledged to try a vegan diet.More NewsVale school pals brave the shave for animal charityPenarth father of four is recognised in New Year Honour list for services to cricketHouse prices increased in the Vale of Glamorgan, latest figures showOnce a fringe movement, veganism is quickly gaining a vast appeal, especially amongst the young, as the environmental benefits of a plant-based diet become clearer.According to a study by the Vegan Society, , people in the UK were vegan in  ndash  and a half times higher than in . Almost half of these were people aged below .Veganism has brought with it a lucrative trade in plant-based produce as businesses move to accommodate the concerns of their customers and promote ethical alternatives to meat.Long before veganism became a dietary and commercial trendsetter, however, June Holder, a -year-old woman from Penarth, had her eyes opened to the costly effects of meat consumption. After eating a vegan breakfast at a local cafeacute, she settled down to tell me her story.ldquoIrsquove been vegan for  years, she said. ldquoMy daughter had a stall at Camden Market, and she used to collect masses of money for animal rights there. It was her who first introduced me to the cause.ldquoLater on, I organized a charity coffee morning and sent the money I raised to Compassion in World Farming. In , they sent me a magazine which showed what happened to the animals. Well, I sat down that morning and read what theyrsquod sent me ndash and I was vegan!Whilst the public has become more receptive to veganism, June still encounters hostility: ldquoPeoplersquos reactions y when I tell them Irsquom vegan. They become hostile because theyrsquore guilty, I suppose.ldquoI remember that a vegan group had a stall in the market a few years ago. They were advertising parts of Alsatians to eat. People were horried. So, when they were angry, I had a chance to talk to them. lsquoYou accept that any animal can be treated like this except when it comes to your dogsrsquo, I told them. Well, they had to accept it. How could they not Originally from Penarth, June moved to Dinas Powys from Barry after her husband, Derrick, passed away  years ago.Derrick was the owner of Holders Menswear, a menrsquos fashion store which was once renowned throughout the Vale of Glamorgan and beyond.Junersquos decision to become vegan sparked  years of dedication to activism. She joined the Animal Welfare Party, and, in her sixties and seventies, she travelled across the UK and Europe to campaign for animal rights.ldquoI demonstrated in many places. I went to Brussels twice to protest against the exportation of live animals. The International Fund for Animal Welfare took us in a coach.ldquoI was in the front row of the crowd, up against these spikes and razor wire. If they had started to push from the back, I dread to think what would have happened.ldquoThe night before the protest I had this thought: lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo. I wrote it on a little board.ldquoPeople kept tapping me on the shoulder and passing the board around the crowd and eventually it made its way back to me.What does the message mean ldquoIt means that it is more dangerous not to protest against these injustices that are happening.June still has a copy of the placard. Later, at her home, she retrieved it from a trove of scattered paraphernalia accumulated after years of protest.She has written prolically throughout her le about events which have provoked and enthused her. One poem describes the day of protest in Brussels. It reflects Junersquos unceasing dedication to animal welfare but also her frustration at the pace of change:ldquoThe writer of these verses was, quite some time ago, in Brussels with a poster which now rings yet more true. lsquoThe danger is not to protestrsquo is what the message said.ldquoThen round it went to young and old for everyone to read. From countries all round Europe, but the farmers paid no heed. Live transport, a huge issue then, continues just the same.Another poem read:ldquoChristmas is a time to spend, but why not save instead  In sheds around the country to sate the publicrsquos lust for something huge to set their feast. The turkeys just exist.ldquoTen million in this country at Christmas time alone. Is this the way to talk of peace and teach our children love Veganuary runs throughout January.

For me, that vision needs to be a realistic reflection of our last decade out of government in Westminster, but also a strategy for reconnecting with our voters and securing a Labour government which can deliver for those who need us most.Finally, I want to thank the staff across the NHS and wider public services for their hard work under increasing pressures, particularly during the winter period.Our public services work hard all year round and many take the sacrice of working over the Christmas and New Year period for which I, and many others, are extremely grateful.As everyou would like to speak with me, you can call my office on    or write to me at Vaughan.Gething@assembly.wales or Office of Vaughan Gething AM, Room C, National Assembly for Wales, CF NA. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

They each received weekly book vouchers, provided by Egmont, to spend at Grfin Books, and coffee shop vouchers donated by local businesses.In , the families committed to reading with their children for  minutes per day.The bookshoprsquos owner, Mel Grfin, said:\"We were delighted to be selected to participate in this exciting project. The idea was to encourage children to experience the joy of reading for pleasure, rather than seeing it as just something they have to do for school\"Research shows that being able to choose their own books, as well as sitting down regularly to read with a parent, makes a real dference to childrens enjoyment of reading. This in turn benefits their schoolwork across the whole curriculum, not just in literacy.\"We are also grateful to the local businesses who generously donated the coffee shop vouchers to help make this happen.ldquoThe contributions of local businesses show once again what great community spirit we have here in Penarth!\"In total,  local businesses donated coffee shop vouchers. This included The Bottle Shop and Loursquos for Men, who each sponsored one family for the six-week duration of the scheme. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

His second vegan recipe book, Dirty Vegan: Another Bite, was released last month alongside a tie-in BBC cookery programme.Last Friday, Matt Pritchard visited the Penarth Pier Pavilion to discuss his latest culinary enterprise and prepare a vegan dish with Mel Grfin of Grfin Books.Pritchard has not lost his mad-dash style and performative vigour. He relished his new role as he prepared for the talk: ldquoI enjoy it, man. Itrsquos better than shoving a drumstick up your arse on stage, he said.Originally from Cardf, Pritchard studied cooking at college but dedicated himself to professional skating when he was sponsored at .ldquoDirty Sanchez was great. It was just  years of mayhem.ldquoWe were getting paid to travel around the world. Getting drunk and off your head with your mates ndash thatrsquos like winning the lottery when yoursquore that age.ldquoI loved it. But then it took its toll on my mental health. Especially the drugs part of it.ldquoI needed to do something about it and thatrsquos when I started my fitness journey.ldquoWith my addictive personality, when I do something, Irsquove got to do it ndash not just dip my toes in.ldquoI started looking into veganism because a lot of endurance athletes were vegan. The more I researched it the more it started making sense to me.ldquoI love animals. Irsquove got a dog and I wouldnrsquot eat him. Whatrsquos the dference between a dog and a pig  All these things started making sense to me.ldquoAs soon as I became vegan, I felt healthier. So many people were trying to put me off it.ldquoBut on a vegan diet, I did The Decker, which is  full Iron Men in  days.ldquoNow Irsquom looking at doing the Double Decker which is  in  days. On my th birthday Irsquoll be doing  of something for  years.ldquoItrsquos another way of proving to people that veganism helps me, and that age is but a number.Pritchard became vegan in  and began to film his own cooking show on YouTube. In , the BBC aired the first series of Dirty Vegan.ldquoIf yoursquod told me  years ago that Irsquod be sitting here with you now and talking about vegan cooking books, I would I have laughed in your face, he said.Pritchard said that he was forced to leave Twitter last year because of abuse from online trolls and members of the Welsh farming community.Why were people so hostile ldquoBecause of guilt. Anger does it. Cognitive dissonance. Theyrsquore too lazy to change or they donrsquot want to believe it.ldquoBut the evidence is there. What I care about is the evidence and the animals.\"I donrsquot want to kill something that doesnrsquot want to be killed. If you eat steak, how can you say you care for all animals In his characteristic salt-of-the earth way, Pritchard hopes to entertain audiences with his new series whilst gently educating them about the benefits of vegan cooking.ldquoYou know, therersquos   arguing about Brexit. Therersquos   arguing about meat and veganism.ldquoWersquore all arguing amongst ourselves like lunatics. This show is just there for people to enjoy. ldquoTherersquos a bit of fun in it. Therersquos a lot of education.ldquoWhen it goes out on TV, I get a lot of positive messages from people saying theyrsquove cut down on meat.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Diverging substantiallywill bring in the requirement for inspections at the border for customs. “That hasn’t been agreed formally. That is quite a lot for UK and NI operators to deal with – haulage and freight movers, to get to grips with that. There are major operational challenges.“Northern Ireland also leave the customs union with GB, but there will be a customs border will between GB and NI to continue to essentially allow freight and good to travel.”Since Boris Johnson’s deal was floated, it’s understood the shipping industry is now drawing up plans for EU border checks in Britain for trade bound for Northern Ireland.According to the BBC, freight could be erted through ports with space for inspections at areas such as Liverpool and Stranraer.Richard says checks are likely to be carried out at the ports. The issue  He says backlogs, queues and congestion. “ to queueing back on to ferries and ships, which may miss or mess up timetables,” he says. He says while “many wouldn’t welcome new formalities”, a lot of cargo – such as dry bulk, fuel, aggregates and containerised products –  will find it reasonably easy to deal with. The main concern is around ‘roll on, roll off’, where the containers or lorries are driven on board a ship.“Those modes are where it could be the most problematic, as it’s based on a fluid process,” he says.“I think there is a definite concern from ports and shipping industries that businesses may be impacted negatively, and may reassess business operations.“I wouldn’t say it’s a doomsday scenario but it’s a real challenge for the sector to overcome. Politicians will have to make sure that with any kind of arrangements, there will be a good solution. This is a new proposal, so we are unsure what the details will be.”Brexit aside, Richard says the industry as a whole is that while the largely commercial and independent ports aren’t in need of ‘hand outs’ from the public sector, areas such as connectivity, roads and planning are key to their success.“It’s about making sure the planning system works, and is swt, and responsive,” he said. “They can be agile, for example, building a new shed, terminal or quay, or new developments in the water.“Where there are environmental sensitivities it can sometimes slow down the planning regimes so we are keen to see them not slow down. We welcome environmental policies but we want a scheme that will work and doesn’t have unintended consequences.“Shipping, although not perfect, is one of the most clean and efficient methods of transport. It’s a balance between environmental protection, but enabling ports and regions to grow.“If there are schemes, ports can find there are investors willing to come in, but they do rely on government – local or national – to finance road and rail connectivity.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/year1.jpg","title":"yearbook a look back at ","story":"Posted on Thursday January  by Ulster Business It was another year shaped by political turmoil and the loss of some giants of industry, but it was also a period which saw great opportunity and growth.

In the last few years Pulse PR has worked with clients include Applegreen, during the roll-out of its first stores in Northern Ireland, jewellery retailer Argento that has over  high street stores in Ireland and one of Ireland’s most iconic gt wear brands, Belleek. And with a business spirit which has helped take root due to her father’s own entrepreneurial background, Grainne’s developed her own firm over the last  years – growing with the changing media landscape, creating communications and marketing strategies, working with tech start-ups from the ground up and building on strong media relationships. “For seven years I had worked with PR agencies and businesses such as Barclays, Tayto and Tesco. I was approaching  and I decided it was now or never,” she told Ulster Business. Networking at Down Royal Racecourse with a pocket full of business cards saw her leave with three clients, and from that, the business was born. Although Pulse PR was initially centred around work with public relations and press, Grainne now works with a lot of start-ups, particularly those within tech – her business is also based at Catalyst, formerly the Northern Ireland Science Park, which is the largest technology park here. One of those she’s now working closely with is IRP Commerce – a £m turnover software development company which made it on to Deloitte’s Technology Fast  list of high growth technology companies seven times. “That relationship started eight years ago with a press release, and now I work with them to target retailers, manufacturers and distributors across the UK, promoting its e-commerce  at national conferences and building strategic relationships with key players in the e-commerce industry. When I started it was very traditional PR, and dealing with newspapers and magazines. Now, it’s also grown further into the digital sphere with online PR, blogging and video testimonials. “I’ve seen a big sht in how my time is spent from when I started  years ago. Although clients still value print coverage, there is definitely a demand to create engaging campaigns for social media. “Because of how the world is changing, I have had to ersy as well. It’s about being flexible and realising the developing trends, and trying to adapt. I’ve always been comfortable in front of the camera or with a microphone in my hand so turned this into a business opportunity to host events, commentate on radio or host  at tech conferences – there is an under-representation of women in this sector so it’s a gap I believe I fill.” As a self-employed businesswoman, Grainne extends her reach with clients by collaborating with freelance photographers, designers and videographers. “You have to get results for your clients. I purposely keep my client list manageable so I’m not competing against myself and I can broaden the scope of activity I do for them,” she says. Grainne also works with Catalyst on its Springboard programme as a marketing domain expert, giving start-up companies assistance when they are bringing their product to market. She says most of her clients come through referrals from other companies she’s been involved with. “Referrals are great as it means I’ve done a good job for the person referring me. I also find a lot of work comes from people I have previously worked with or went to school with. Northern Ireland is known for having two degrees of separation – this also applies in the business world.” She’s also been working with the Ulster Farmers’ Union this year to help promote the organisation’s Open Farm Weekend. It’s an initiative, sponsored by Bank of Ireland UK, to allow members of the public to pay a visit to a farm for the first time. “This is a new sector for me, but the principles are the same – find out the end user and then apply the right marketing tools to engage with them. “It’s about fitting in with a company and how that business thinks – being adaptable and working out what they want, and trying to help them grow. It’s about presenting a strong and clear message, developing strong media contacts and also working across digital and print media to boost reach.” In  years, the media and PR landscape has evolved, including how information is consumed. “But I’m still a firm believer in knowing the basics,” she says. “It’s about having the experience and the education to be able to do it. After my degree and Master’s, I studied to gain additional post-graduate qualications from the Chartered Institute of Marketing. I’m a firm believer in le-long learning. Too many people starting in the industry think all the need is a smartphone and an Instagram account. “It’s competitive, but there’s always enough business for everyone out there. You really just need a few clients and then you turn your focus to them, as well as working with others as and when they come. A few projects naturally ended last year so I’ll be expanding my client list in the coming months. It’s always exciting to start with a new company or entrepreneur. “It’s about being flexible and being aware of what is going on with your clients, and being proactive. Being a sole-trader means you are flexible and can work closely with companies, either in their office or remotely as an extended member of their marketing team. I have often thought about employing more staff, but I believe clients want to see me working on their account, rather than meeting me at the pitch and then being passed over to a junior member of staff. “There’s a great satisfaction in helping an innovative small business, which is set for bigger things, and working alongside them in getting their message out there, building, growing and creating jobs. You really want to work with them and help build their business. “It’s about building the relationships and contacts, and that’s something you can’t teach. People buy from people and I believe one of the reasons I have kept many of the same clients for  years is because I always go the extra mile and am true to my word.” Grainne’s desire  years ago to go it alone with Pulse PR is something she says is very much part of the family story. “My father Malachy is an entrepreneur, a mechanic by trade, but he’s always been able to turn his hand to everything,” she says. My sister Orla was also self-employed as a pharmacist. I’ve been brought up in that environment and we’ve always had support and a ‘can do’ attitude from our mother Geraldine. I had a baby, Gabriel, four months ago but didn’t get the option to take maternity leave. This is the downside of being self-employed, but the flipside means I can work from home when I need to.” As for the next  years, Grainne says it’s about trying to give something back, using her skills to help those who have little or no experience in knowing how to bring their message and products to the fore. “I’m still as passionate about business as I was  years ago. I’m excited to see how I can continue to use my skills to add value to clients to ensure their message and their voice is heard.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/234234343334.jpg","title":"stormont deal business back new assembly","story":"Posted on Friday  January  by John Mulgrew Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Julian Smith and Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Pic Kelvin Boyes Northern Ireland’s business community has given its support for a deal which has seen the Assembly up-and-running after a three year stasis. The Northern Ireland Assembly couldon Fridaypolitical parties back a deal tabled by the UK and Irish Governments. DUP leader Arlene Foster has indicated that her party will back the deal, while Sinn Fein said its leadership will meet to discuss it on Friday. The UUP has said they will consider the deal, but are willing to attend the Assemblyit sits. In a joint statement urging politicians to accept the ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal, NI Chamber president John Healy, vice president Ian Henry, and chief executive Ann McGregor, said: “After three years of paralysis, we now have a workable deal that will allow an Executive to start addressing the problems within our health service and education system. They will also be able to take action to grow our economy and support the community and voluntary sector. “We therefore encourage the five main political parties to progress it urgently. Business, health and education cannot wait any longer - failure is not an option. “Now is the time for our politicians to show mature leadership and help navigate a path to the future by accepting this deal.” Secretary of State Julian Smith and Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney published the New Decade, New Approach deal on Thursday evening and urged parties to back it andto Stormont on Friday. Reacting to the news, Trade NI – the alliance of Retail NI, Manufacturing NI and Hospitality Ulster – said: “We welcome the draft deal published by the British and Irish Governments in the final round of talks to restore devolution. We strongly encourage all the main parties of Northern Ireland to sign the deal today and get the Assembly back up and running.” “As our three organisations represent the majority of the businesses that make up private sector jobs in Northern Ireland, we are cautiously hopeful that the deal and aof the Assembly will see the development of policies and legislation at devolved level and the kick start that our economy desperately needs. The clear prioritisation of the Northern Ireland economy highlights the many challenges that businesses have faced over the past three years and our message to the parties is that we support you in your endeavours to secure this deal.” “While this is a good start, improvements are still needed to drive the economy forward and support the growth of business across Northern Ireland. As stated in our Vision  document, Northern Ireland’s potential is signicant but reform and growth is needed to create the modern economy we are capable of and deserve.” FSB NI policy chair, Tina McKenzie, said: “Businesses will welcome the agreement published last night as a step forward towards restoring devolved government, something for which FSB has been calling since the collapse of the institutions three years ago. “The draft agreement contains some positive commitments to bolster the local economy, on issues like skills, infrastructure and Brexit. However, theof devolution is by no means a panacea it just means that at long last we have elected representatives in place to tackle a very dficult task. “The next Executive must move quickly to deliver on the myriad issues which have been left unaddressed for far too long. While the health service will be high on the agenda, we must not lose sight of the need to bolster our SME economy, which is the absolute bedrock on which the first-class public services to which we all aspire are built. “Ministers must move swtly to support our economy at one of the most turbulent times for many decades, starting by lowering the rates burden on small businesses, whilst also moving forward rapidly with key infrastructure projects which have stalled and ensuring that our schools, colleges, and universities are providing students with the skills they need for the jobs of the future. “In order to begin to address these issues, the parties must put pragmatism first and get back round the Executive table.” Colin Neill, chief executive, Hospitality Ulster, said: “We encourage all parties to seize this opportunity and sign up to the deal published late last night to get the Assembly and Executive back as quickly as possible.” “This is the best chance to bring the devolved government back to le. Our message to the party leaders is clear, we support you in your endeavours and encourage you to get the New Decade, New Approach agreement over the line today. Redmond McFadden, president of the Londonderry Chamber of Commerce said: “The Londonderry Chamber as well as other representatives of business, education, health, trade unions and civic organisations, held a meeting with the five main political parties at Stormont last night. “At that meeting we pressed the urgent need for the parties to agree the draft deal which was published by the British and Irish Governments. Three years without Ministers making local decisions has had an enormous impact on our economy and wider society. A lack of effective and meaningful representation here is curtailing investment in our region, stling job creation and driving our young people away. Simon Hamilton, chief executive of Belfast Chamber, said: “Belfast Chamber welcomes progress towards the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive and encourages the local political parties to reach agreement. For the last three years, our members have seen how an absence of decision making has stunted growth and stled investment. The proposed priorities for the Executive contain some issues which Belfast Chamber has been supportive of for some time. “Other policies which could boost our economy are noticeably missing but we look forward to joining with our colleagues across the business community to ensure that the new Executive pursues an agenda that grows jobs and boosts our economy.” Northern Ireland Local Government Association chief executive, Derek McCallan said: “I am very pleased that the British and Irish governments have tabled a draft deal on restoring the NI Executive. I hope that an agreement can be reached quickly to get the Stormont institutions back up and running immediately. For three years, our eleven local councils have been the only ing form of democratically elected government in Northern Ireland. Local government has been a vital democratic anchor during this period and ensured the provision of crucial public services for local citizens. “It’s time to bridge the democratic deficit and unlock the potential of local government in Northern Ireland by investing in our local councils. An Executive commitment to a devolution bill and greater financial powers and resources will drive a transformation in Northern Ireland’s democratic governance and help create a more sustainable democracy, environment and economy for Northern Ireland.” Kirsty McManus, national director, IoD NI, said: “The ‘New Decade, New Approach’ deal is to be welcomed, filled with ambition that,fulfilled, can deliver real improvements for the people and businesses of Northern Ireland. “We would therefore urge all parties to get behind the deal to enable the speedy restoration of the Executive. “Commitments from the British and Irish governments for some crucial pieces of infrastructure such as the York Street Interchange, upgrades to the A and A road and Northern Ireland’s wastewater network are particularly pleasing. “The expansion of university provision at the Magee campus in Derry meanwhile will go some way to rebalancing the regional economy. “Plans for multi-year budgets and increased civic engagement will also improve overall governance. “From a business perspective however, we would have liked to have seen more around a new skills agenda, which urgently require focus alongside a renewed look at the Apprenticeship Levy which is not included in this deal. “On behalf of our members, we will also monitor closely commitments to bring forward legislation that will allow unfettered access to the Great Britain market for local business following Brexit.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail_Abacus-Grand-Central-1--1-.jpg","title":"belfastforlife expo bringing together ni diaspora","story":"Posted on Monday  January  by Ulster Business A new event will bring together the Northern Ireland diaspora and business community in a bid to promote and develop the region.

The firm is marking two decades leading the way in the industry, and according to founder Terry Moore, the firm is well on its way to doubling its size and embracing the latest technology for its clients Outsource Solutions is a firm which is ahead of the curve when it comes to emerging technologies and a company which embeds itself in a client’s business to ensure total integration – ultimately helping to boost it and help it grow.“Our approach is to embed ourselves into the customer’s business, and take IT out of the boardroom,” Terry says. “What we do is try to get ahead of some of the problems, understand the business and recognise that the technology is there to benefit the company.“We are there to make sure that business is possible – enriching lives, making things easier and safer. An important part of this is the relationships that we have.”Terry formed Outsource Solutions  years ago, around the time of the so-called ‘millennium bug’ when he says some firms were using scare tactics to get businesses to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds, often unnecessarily. “For me, one of the things I felt was missing was understanding a business and factoring that refresh into it over a few years – letting them get on with what they do.”The company – which now has five locations, including Belfast – is a full service IT firm which manages every element of a business’s infrastructure, including security, enterprise wi-fi, telecoms and networking.“We now have just over  staff and are we are on a five-year plan to double in size again. There has been considerable growth in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and telecoms,” Terry says.Client retention is also something which Terry and the business prides itself on. “Every customer that we signed up with in , we still work with,” he says. “We will give a recommendation as to how we think a network should be built. If they accept that, then we take it on as a risk.“Technology is just a toolbox for us to allow us to deliver IT – technology to allow them to really access and control their data.”Outsource is a business which has been at the forefront of emerging developments in technology, including cyber-security. Terry says, even just a few years ago, it wasn’t being taken seriously by many businesses. That has now changed signicantly.“In the last couple of years, cyber has completely exploded – but we were ahead of our time,” he says. “My experience of last  years and the last five in particular is that there has been a massive job to do in educating businesses and their users about the cyber threat.“We have reached the tipping point and the human firewall is becoming much stronger – people and users are more sensitive to what it means, making it all a far better place. But there are still businesses which are happy to cut fast and loose, and take risks.”While the company’s client base started off in professional services businesses – such as law and accounting – it’s grown into a host of sectors, including transport, logistics, manufacturing and engineering.“We have carved out a niche in hospitality as well – particularly in areas such as enterprise wi-fi, converged networks and communication, generally.”Terry says Outsource is seeing business growth among many of Northern Ireland’s medium-sized businesses, with more than  staff.“Our job is to enhance, improve and optimise the performance for as many users as we can. Our aim over the next four years is to be able to deliver those services outside Northern Ireland, across the rest of the UK and into the Republic of Ireland.“For us, the constant is that we are always there at that point of where technology is consumed. The role we play is being integrated and a trusted advisor. That’s how we will continue to be successful.”As for the next  years, with a rise in automation and articial intelligence – something Terry says has to become a little more intelligent and a little less articial – the next major leap will be the advent of quantum computing. It’s something which remains in its infancy.“While it’s still early, we are on the verge of the most aggressive technological change that any of us have ever seen,” he says.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
