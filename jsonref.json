Where most of us were watching this and seeing a tragedy unfolding in front of our eyes. Instead of seeing a tragedy Boris Johnson saw an opportunity and he went on the offensive.\u0027He saw an opportunity to score some points in the election - he immediately said \u0027oh this is Labour\u0027s fault, they allowed this to happen, they had this early release policy\u0027 and so on. At that point... well I had to say something.\u0027Mr Merritt said there was \u0027no attempt\u0027 to contact the family from Downing Street or the Prime Minister.          Mr Merritt criticised the PM for trying to score political points instead of seeing a tragedy\u0027The only contact we had was that the police liaison officer said to us \u0027I\u0027ve been asked if you would like to meet Priti Patel for her to express her condolences\u0027. We just said no thank you.\u0027Mr Merritt also described what happened on the day of the attack, saying he was just coming from work for a \u0027normal\u0027 Friday night.He said: \u0027My wife was driving my car into the drive, which seemed a bit odd, and she was just beside herself, saying \u0027we\u0027ve got to go to London, we\u0027ve got to go to London.\u0027\u0027And I said \u0027Why have we got to go to London.\u0027 She said \u0027Because Jack has been involved in this incident at London Bridge, we think he\u0027s been stabbed\u0027.\u0027Mr Merritt said the hardest part of it all, was telling Jack\u0027s brother, who was out with friends in Cambridge, the devastating news.\u0027We didn\u0027t want to tell him over the phone and we didn\u0027t want anybody else to tell him,\u0027 he said.\u0027So we went and got him. And we had to tell him that his brother died.\u0027Which was probably the hardest thing I\u0027ve had to do so far.\u0027Jack and Saskia Jones, 23, were attacked and killed by convicted terrorist Usman Khan, 28, at a prisoner rehabilitation event at Fishmongers\u0027 Hall on November 29.Armed with two knives and wearing a fake suicide vest, Khan was tackled by members of the public, including ex-offenders from the conference, before he was shot dead by police. Mr Merritt said: \u0027The only person responsible for what he did is him (Usman Khan), so I\u0027m not going to start lashing out and saying \u0027somebody should have stopped this, somebody must be responsible for this\u0027.\u0027I don\u0027t feel angry about what happened, I feel bereft and very, very sad.\u0027Mr Merritt was asked how he felt about his son\u0027s picture being used alongside headlines about changing sentencing and an article written by the Prime Minister.              Mr Merritt (left) and Saskia Jones were killed in the attack on London Bridge on November 29He told Sky News: \u0027Pretty much as you would expect. It just reinforced my views and my feelings about the way in which this situation was being exploited.\u0027It just struck me as being crass and insensitive and as we\u0027ve already said Jack would have been extremely upset at the way in which things were developing.\u0027It was put to Mr Merritt that some people may say that he himself has politicised his son\u0027s death due to not liking Boris Johnson.He replied: \u0027I would say that if anybody has a right to say something about this situation then it\u0027s me and his family.\u0027We have lost Jack. Jack can\u0027t speak for himself anymore. Had there been no comment in the way that it was made, then I wouldn\u0027t have said anything.\u0027I would have just carried on grieving and helping to support my family.         Usman Khan, strapped in a fake suicide vest, went on a stabbing rampage last month\u0027I think the way that it happened and the fact that it was used in such a political way, and I could see the good work that Jack did and that his colleagues did starting to perhaps unravel, it was important that somebody said something.\u0027And that just happened to be me. And obviously my son\u0027s been killed, people are going to listen to me.\u0027A statement on the GoFundMe page to raise funds for Jack\u0027s funeral said: \u0027Jack was proud. Jack was absorbingly intelligent. Jack was fiercely loyal. \u0027Jack loved music, art, eating good food with his family, and having more than one pint with his mates.\u0027And on that point we, his friends and family, are going to throw one hell of a celebration for him. Because my god, did that boy know how to party.\u0027We are raising money for a celebration of Jack\u0027s life. All the things he loved - for his closest friends and family. We will keep costs to a minimum.\u0027Services will be provided free or discounted where possible. All additional money will be donated to Jack\u0027s legacy.

The life of the party and super handsome. He will never been forgotten.\u0027Vicki Harrison added: \u0027We live near Cambridge and were out as a family at a local coffee shop when two ladies on the table next to us, first heard the devastating news when it broke, that Jack was one of the victims.\u0027They knew Jack well and it was heartbreaking to see them come to terms with the news.

The Rectory served a small village which had very prominent links with the mining industry. Although any urban exploration involves a level of danger, FreakyD believes that his hobby allows people to see into a world that would otherwise be forgotten.          The mansion still has most of its lights on in the unsettling images. Urban explorer FreakyD said he \u0027can\u0027t imagine\u0027 why the house was left and why there has been \u0027no effort\u0027 to maintain it         The dark kitchen has the blind pulled down and cooking utensils still hanging on the walls. The kitchen is decorated with wooden cupboards and square tiles, with what appears to be a black bin bag left aside          The exterior of the mysterious home in Lincolnshire. The photographer did not give away the home\u0027s exact location or name for fear of vandals or thieves breaking in and further defacing the property FreakyD said: \u0027Urban explorers often get a bad name being mistaken as vandals or thieves. We have no interest in damaging the properties we explore or taking things, we actually care more than most that they remain untouched for others to enjoy. \u0027Most buildings I explore are large industrial buildings where the business has closed the doors for good or gutted homes which have been left to rot but this building is different. \u0027There are little personal items that haven\u0027t been taken, clothes still lie folded in the drawers, even the electric toothbrush had battery life left. I can\u0027t imagine why this house was left and why there has been no effort to maintain it, mothballed and forgotten about. It\u0027s bizarre.          A white, wooden cradle filled with stuff animals has also been left behind in the nursery, indicating a child lived in the house         Clothes are still neatly folded away and hanging from the furniture in one of the rooms, with a sink and mirror in the background alongside a small mirror on top of the chest of drawers         A stately piano is one of the musical instruments left behind, with a drum kit also sitting in another corner of the house          An ornate wooden staircase and a black and white tiled floor are situated towards the entrance of the property. A red bicycle can be seen left leaning against the side of the staircase\u0027Despite a small area of water damage the house is in very good condition, especially to say it has been left for over a decade.\u0027The one downside to buildings that still have power is you need to be wary of exposed live cables.\u0027Although the house itself was peculiar - with an ornate spiral staircase circling into the games room and an array of musical instruments dotted around - it was the familial touches which left the daredevil photographer \u0027emotional\u0027.         A portrait of two children was found in one of the bedrooms of the household on top of a grey-stoned mantelpiece          The bathroom of the 150-years-old mansion features a long tub and blue tiles, with a deckchair propped up in the corner next to the shower. A bath mat can be seen still hanging over the tub         The dining room of the old rectory has wooden polished chairs and a table, with a chandelier hanging from above and a dated radiator below one of the closed curtains          A candle has drooped over time as the heat of the conservatory takes its toll. Most of the side windows are boarded up with 5 chairs surrounding a table in the corner of the room\u0027The house is filled with letters between family members and friends, photographs from celebrations, crafts made by the children and countless other items that make it a very typical family home,\u0027 said FreakyD.\u0027Notes left out from small children in scrawled handwriting with heartfelt love letters to their parents really give this abandoned home character - and a lot of emotion.\u0027With so much left untouched for so long this house is like exploring a time capsule, one that only a handful of people have seen. \u0027I really hope this property remains hidden from people who wish to disrupt this amazing building and hopefully will be content in seeing my pictures.\u0027 "},{"url":null,"title":"Finnish parliament picks world s youngest sitting prime minister","story":"Share this article Marin worked in a bakery as a teenager and earned money handing out magazines while she was at Pirkkala High School, before becoming the first member of her family to go to university.  The new PM has a 22-month-old daughter, Emma Amalia Marin, with husband Markus Räikköne and shared pregnancy and breastfeeding pictures on her Instagram account. Defending her frequent use of social media, she said: \u0027I present a younger generation but of course, when it comes to social media or Instagram, I think that I\u0027m an inidual, a person, a real person even though I\u0027m a prime minister.\u0027 She was elected to a city council in 2012, at the age of 27 and became a member of the Finnish parliament for the district of Pirkanmaa in 2015. Earlier this year she became transport and communications minister under Antti Rinne, who resigned earlier this month after losing the support of a coalition partner.          Finland\u0027s new Prime Minister Sanna Marin holding a press conference at Parliament House in Helsinki, today         Ms Marin pictured (above) chairing her first government meeting in Helsinki, Finland, today\u0027I come from a poor family and would not have been able to succeed and move forward were it not for the strong welfare state and the Finnish education system,\u0027 she told Helsingin Sanomat.The Social Democrats took office in June after defeating the far-right, anti-immigration Finns Party by the narrowest of margins in April\u0027s general election.The victory was seen by some commentators as a triumph for Finland\u0027s liberal, equal society over a party that ran on a ticket of cutting asylum levels almost to zero and halting anti-climate change measures.Speaking after Tuesday\u0027s parliamentary vote, Marin pledged to rebuild trust in her party.\u0027We have promised the Finnish people change and now we must deliver on that promise.

As well as taking away about half of the surviving sculptures before eventually selling them to the British Museum, Elgin also employed specialist craftsmen to create detailed plaster casts of many of the artworks that he left behind on the great Athens monument.Now analysis of those casts has revealed details that have since been lost on the original sculptures, casting fresh light on an almost forgotten technique that could reveal further insights about some of the most celebrated monuments in classical art.Research by Dr Emma Payne, a specialist in classics and archaeological conservation based at King’s College London, shows that in 1802, when Elgin’s men made their casts, the sculptures of the west frieze of the Parthenon were in markedly better condition than they are today.“Elgin’s casts could be important records of the state of the sculptures in the very early 19th century before modern pollution would hasten their deterioration,” said Payne.By comparing the casts with present-day 3D scans of the west frieze – which was removed from the monument in 1993 and is now in the Acropolis Museum in Athens – she revealed features that are now lost, including the faces of some of the sculptures, and chisel marks showing they had intentionally been chipped away by Victorian-era vandals.While it has long been known that the casts preserve some lost sections, Payne’s research showed that the copies were more accurate than expected, with most of the casts deviating by barely a millimetre from the originals.As a result, she showed that Elgin’s copies are the best-preserved 3D record of what Dr Ian Jenkins, a senior curator of ancient Greece at the British Museum, says came to be considered “the most beautiful manmade sculptures on earth”.Payne also analysed a second set of casts, commissioned by the British Museum in 1872. She was able to show that more damage was caused in the intervening seven decades than in the 120 years that followed, meaning that a century of traffic pollution did less harm than Victorian vandals. Her research is published in Antiquity magazine.Payne’s scans also confirm that in some cases, the people who created the Elgin moulds had attempted to recreate pieces that were already missing by that time, resulting in some crude additions.Payne told the  she had been surprised by how accurate her computer-aided analysis had shown the copies to be. “Certainly the results very much emphasise the skill of the casters, and it shows that there is still information that we can potentially learn about the Parthenon sculptures from these 19th-century studies that haven’t really been looked at in detail.”Notably, she said, other large excavations of the period, including at Delphi and Olympia, had also made moulds of the artworks they uncovered – which could potentially yield their own secrets.Payne said: “This work helps us to understand the important role that such casts can still play as 3D time capsules, but we need to study them very closely to understand exactly what it is they preserve.”Asked if a fresh recognition of the casts’ value might lessen the controversy around Elgin’s involvement, Jenkins said: “In my view Lord Elgin rescued the sculptures, and I do think that this recording of the west frieze is all part of his great sense of reverence for the ancient past.”Unusually, he said, the names of the cast-makers had been recorded where those of other skilled craftsmen were not “because they were seen to be producing something which was essentially art”.The temple had already suffered significant damage by the time Elgin made his casts. It was damaged by fire in the 3rd century AD, and some sculptures were deliberately damaged when it was converted to a church in the early Christian era, around AD600. By the 15th century it had been converted to a mosque by the Ottomans, and in 1687 was being used as a gunpowder store when an explosion caused significant damage to parts of the building.

Today, his energy upstart is valued at a billion pounds and will soon be one of the largest energy suppliers in Britain – second only to British Gas.The Northern Irishman’s stellar ascent is put down to a canny mix of business acumen, good political timing and carefully choreographed showmanship. His company’s appeal is simpler: energy which is cheap, green and easy to buy.Fitzpatrick, a former City trader, founded Ovo a decade ago with £350,000 with the belief that “trying to do things differently could make a real impact”. He turned to the energy industry with an antidote to the major suppliers, as mistrust in its biggest players deepened and bills were on the rise.But it was his star-turn before numerous MP select committee inquiries into the troubled energy market around five years ago which secured his lead-role as a new breed of energy boss. His commitment to simplicity, transparency, and fairness, combined with outspoken attacks on rival energy bosses – often sitting beside him before MPs – quickly garnered headlines and a growing customer base.The energy industry’s new posterboy is not without controversy of his own. The former JP Morgan broker’s multimillion-pound spending on property and a Formula One team raised eyebrows after his attacks on energy fat cats.Ovo itself was accused of a cash grab. Its rivals criticised the company’s decision to charge customers for energy before they have used it, warning it put customers’ cash at risk.In Ovo’s early days Fitzpatrick claimed a salary of £120,000 a year but withdrew over £2m from the company to buy a family home in the country in 2013, when it had barely begun making a profit.Fitzpatrick, 41, went on to pump a reported £30m into Anglo-Russia F1 racing team Marussia through Imagination Industries, his private holding company. The team lost its place in the Constructors’ Championship in 2016, putting the brakes on Fitzpatrick’s F1 dreams.-The former owner of the failed Manor Formula 1 team reportedly held a lavish party earlier this year to celebrate the company’s anniversary. It was held in a venue beneath Tate Modern, compered by the broadcaster Lauren Laverne, who described Ovo as “a company that is hoping to redefine the limits of human progress”.The Belfast-born entrepreneur made a name for the energy startup by criticising the big six providers for poor service and “rip-off” energy tariffs.Fitzpatrick was also one of the Conservative party’s largest donors in the first months of this year, handing over a total of almost £200,000.He made a personal donation of £12,000 to the Conservative party in February 2019. An investment vehicle registered at the same address as Ovo’s South Kensington headquarters, Imagination Industries Incubator, made a second donation of £173,000 at the beginning of March.The deal with SSE could put Fitzpatrick on a collision course with the Labour party, which has vowed to renationalise the big six energy companies if it forms a government following this week’s general election.Fitzpatrick said he looks forward to “bringing SSE into the Ovo family” when the deal closes next month.“There is a lot of work to be done, but we’re excited about the challenge ahead and the opportunity to help even more customers on the journey to zero carbon,” Fitzpatrick said.SSE revealed plans to exit the energy market over two years ago as the government prepared to bring in its energy price cap for 11 million households using standard variable energy tariffs.SSE initially planned to spin off its supply business to create a separate listed energy company by merging with npower. The plans were scrapped a year later amid “challenging conditions” in the energy market."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/19cd3be66b8a0c07655d458323355606a0979848/0_349_5698_3420/master/5698.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa2cd04e522ae966df56d344c3d3f560","title":"mark starrs family thought he was thriving in a new city the truth was far darker","story":"Mark Starr 1965-2019 It took five weeks for the news to reach the Starrs: rather than being stable and happy, Mark had died sleeping rough in a Glasgow park. Why?by  Daniel Lavelle and  Simon HattenstoneOn 8 July, Police Scotland issued a statement: “Police are appealing for the assistance of the public in tracing relatives of 53-year-old Mark David James Starr, who was found dead within the Glasgow Green area of Glasgow on 28 June 2019.” Starr was homeless and had been sleeping rough in Glasgow’s oldest city park. Police said there were no suspicious circumstances, although the cause of death has not yet been determined.Three weeks later, another appeal was issued. “Officers believe Mr Starr may have relatives in the Kent area, but have been unable to track down any family members despite a previous appeal on 8 July.” It seemed like one of those horribly familiar stories – homeless man dies alone, with no one to miss or mourn him.“We didn’t find out till five weeks after Mark died. And then it was on social media,” says Mark’s mother, Sue. She looks at her daughter, Karen. “One of your friends saw it on Facebook didn’t she, and texted you.”“Yeah, she said: ‘This isn’t your Mark, is it?’” Karen says. “I couldn’t believe it.”“I still can’t believe it,” Sue says. “Well, you don’t ever imagine one of your children is going to end up in that situation, do you? He always told me he was doing fine in Glasgow.” Silence.They sound numb. Both are still in shock. It’s September, barely a month since they heard the news, and only a week since Mark Starr’s funeral in his home town, Ashford, Kent. Sue and Karen tell us about the service. Four old friends carried the coffin, and they played some of Mark’s favourite songs: Bitter Sweet Symphony, Like a Rolling Stone, He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother – all of them painfully apt.We meet at a cafe in Ashford town centre. Karen is shy and withdrawn Sue is open and talkative, and even in her grief she wheezes with laughter at some of the things Humpy got up to. Humpy is Mark. That’s the nickname his older brother, Tony, gave him when he was a little boy because he always got the hump. Somebody would take his ball or he would go fishing and catch nothing, and Mark would strop off for a couple of hours. But he always came back. He loved his nickname, and had it tattooed on his arm. It was his only tattoo.726 homeless people died in England and Wales in 2018, according to the latest ONS figures. Over the next few months, G2 and  Cities\u0026nbspwill look behind this statistic to tell the stories of some of those who have died on Britain’s streets. We will tell not just the story of their death, but the story of their life – what they were like as kids, what their dreams were, their hobbies, what people loved about them, what was infuriating. We will also examine what went wrong with their lives, how it impacted on their loved ones, and if anything could have been done differently to prevent their deaths.\u0026nbspAs the series develops, we will invite politicians, charities and homelessness organisations to respond to the issues raised. We will also ask readers to offer their own stories and reflections on homelessness. We want the stories we tell to become the fulcrum of a debate about homelessness to make a difference to a scourge that shames us all.\u0026nbspIt is time to stop just passing by.Mark was born two months premature, weighing just three and a half pounds. “We didn’t think he’d survive,” Sue says. “I was going to call him Jason. I just liked the name. But the priest came to see me and said: ‘I think we better get the baby christened straight away,’ and I couldn’t think straight. He suggested Mark, ’cos he was a saint.” After a month, Mark began to thrive and Sue was allowed to leave hospital.The Starrs were a close family, but nobody was closer to Mark than Tony. He isn’t here today because he has taken his brother’s death so badly. “We used to get the school bus together and the driver called us the Three Musketeers because we always looked out for each other,” Karen says. Sue and Karen have brought photos with them. There are pictures of Mark eating a toffee apple in Hastings, holding a tiny monkey, camping with friends in Wales.“I don’t think they washed all week!” Sue says. Her laughter sets off her hacking smoker’s cough. Like all the family, Sue sounds cockney even though she was born and bred in Kent. She tells us about the rosettes Mark won for showjumping. “There was a time we thought he would be a jockey. He was really good.” But as with so much, he lost interest.There are so many stories about Mark – most of them involving the outdoors, and things going hopelessly wrong. There was the time he went camping and the tent blew away in the middle of the night because they hadn’t secured it properly the school trip when he got lost the visit to Luton to watch George Best when he and Tony got on the corrugated iron roof and fell through it. He was a happy, fearless boy, they say.Mark left school at 15 without qualifications. “He was never going to be a scholar,” Sue says. “His reports always said: ‘Could do well, but lacks concentration.’” He got a job assisting a gamekeeper. The problem was he didn’t bother turning up to work. “He did come clean in the end,” Sue says. “He was just hanging out with his mates. You always thought he was listening to you, but he wasn’t really.” Nothing appeared to worry him, she says. And that’s what stopped her worrying about him – for a while.A few weeks later we meet Tony Starr with Sue in Ashford. With red hair stretching down his back and a lived-in face, Tony looks like an ageing rock star. His early memories of Mark are idyllic – fishing with their father every Sunday, floating down the river on homemade rafts, crabbing on the beach, listening to nightingales in the woods, hanging off cliffs to collect birds’ eggs. “Not a care in the world, mate,” he says. “We’d take a few jam sandwiches when we were thirsty we drank river water! Humpy was a good fisher. You made your own entertainment in them days. We weren’t stuck in front of a screen eight hours a day.”But the more he talks about his brother, the more complex the character that emerges. As a young boy, Mark had terrible nightmares. “He’d wake up in the night, proper screaming. We never understood why. I’d just pick a slipper up and throw it at him. ‘Shut up Humpy.’ One night we were hanging out in the back garden, in a tent, camping out, and Humpy was screaming in his sleep. The neighbour jumped over the fence. He thought we were being attacked. Humpy always sucked his thumb. Even into his late 30s, he sucked his thumb.”Rather than being carefree, it sounds more like Mark simply didn’t care, so he would steal packets of Chewits as a kid and not worry about being chased by the shop owner, and years later would drive without having passed his test. Sue talks about the time his grandmother needed a lift and Mark called for her in a little white van. When Mark’s grandmother complained that it was cold and asked him if the windows were open, he replied there were no windows. “I said to Mark: ‘You’ve not got a licence, you can’t keep doing this.’ ‘I don’t need a licence,’ he said.” That was always his attitude – he didn’t need the paperwork, didn’t need to follow rules, didn’t need money or a job – he would get by.And, for a time, he did. His family still say he never seemed unhappy. He had plenty of friends, and was popular with women. In his early 20s, he moved in with his girlfriend, Rebecca. “She was stunning,” Tony says. “Honest to God, she’d make Page 3 girls look ordinary. I thought: you’re punching above your weight there, Hump. But Rebecca only had eyes for him. They’d been friends as kids – she was a bit of a wild child.”Tony says Mark and Rebecca started to take cannabis, and progressed from there. Before long they were injecting heroin. Then one day Mark woke up, and Rebecca was dead in bed next to him. She was 24. “He never recovered from that,” Tony says. “A part of him never came back.”Even then his parents didn’t know he was addicted to heroin. Mark returned to the family home, and one day his father found a syringe in his bedroom. Mark told his father, a concrete finisher on building sites, that it wasn’t his syringe. “And his dad said: ‘Well, it’s not mine or Mum’s or Tony’s or Karen’s. Don’t treat me like a fool, it’s got to be yours,’” Sue says. Tony remembers how distraught their father was that day. “We had a few chickens back then. I went down to see my dad and he was in tears, looking at the chickens. Blank face. I’d never seen my dad like that. He was just so sad about it.”After Rebecca’s death, Mark lost three more people he loved: his aunt Elsie, who used to take the Starr children on holiday every summer and was known in the family for making the best chips in Kent his best friend, Martin (another drug addict) and his father, who died suddenly 20 years ago, when he was still working on building sites. “Humpy took it bad. Dad adored all of us, but Humpy was his favourite. And Humpy loved Dad.”As time went on, Mark became less and less functional. He served a few short prison sentences for shoplifting and then three years of a five-year term for attempting to import 60g of heroin in his pants. Even when he was in jail he told his family that he was doing just fine. Sue reads a letter Mark sent from Elmley prison on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent, soon after arriving there. “The food’s OK. Send my love to everyone. Tell Aunt Elsie I’m OK and not to worry … see you both in a couple of months. Lots of love, Mark.”He came out of prison, tried to beat his addiction and failed. But still his family insist he didn’t seem to have a care in the world. He had a council flat in Ashford and would pop round every day to Karen’s for a cooked breakfast. Tony says he never forgot a birthday, would always trim his grandmother’s hedge, and that he was a wonderful uncle to Tony’s son, Jude. “Humpy thought the world of my boy. He’d come round for Sunday dinner and straight afterwards he’d say: ‘Come on, Jude, let’s go out and have a game of football.’ When Eminem came over he got a photo signed by him. God knows where he got it from.”Despite the acts of generosity, Mark’s life became more and more chaotic. He would disappear for long periods of time without telling the family. Tony went round to his flat one day and was shocked to see drug paraphernalia everywhere. “It was like needle city. I went mad. I said: ‘You silly bugger. Leave that stuff alone, it’s a one-way ticket to misery.’ But it was like talking to a brick wall. I said: ‘Humpy mate, they are going to get rid of you’, and they did. They evicted him.”It was about eight years ago that Mark was evicted from his flat in Ashford. There were times he stayed with Tony and Sue, and times he lived on the streets. Tony says some local people treated Mark with contempt. “Kids used to throw water over him. He got no help in Ashford. He was frowned upon.” He would stay with Tony, but after a few days he would find it claustrophobic. “Then he’d just go. He couldn’t stay in one place.” Over the years Mark became delusional. Neither Tony nor Sue believe he got the support he needed. “There ain’t no mental health these days,” Tony says. “It’s all shot to pieces.”Four years ago, Mark upped and left Ashford. Again, he didn’t give his family warning. “Eventually he phoned me up and I said: ‘Where are you, Mark?’ And he said: ‘I’m in Scotland,’” Sue recalls. “I said: ‘What are you doing up there?’ He said: ‘It’s lovely here, and the people here are lovely.’ He said he was staying in a hostel. I was looking after my mum who had dementia and couldn’t be left, and he phoned up and said: ‘You and nan will have to come up for a holiday when I’ve got my own place. It’s really good up here. I’m happy.’ I said: ‘Thank goodness for that.’” Then he told them he did have his own place. And Sue says she really was convinced he was thriving.However, on his occasional returns to Ashford, Mark seemed to be anything but thriving. His mental health had deteriorated and his delusions had got worse. “One time he said: ‘I’ve got to go, I’m meeting Jay-Z and Beyoncé tonight,’” Tony says. “I said: ‘Have a nice time, Hump.’ Then he’d tell us that Roman Abramovich had lent him his yacht.”Did he say things like this when he lived in Ashford? “Yeah, but it just got worse,” Sue says. “One of the last times he came down, he said: ‘I met Rebecca and Dad up town and they’re coming back.’” She doesn’t know whether to laugh or cry, so she does a bit of both. “That’s when I knew how ill he was. He really believed it.”Occasionally he told Tony the truth. “We’d be up till six or seven in the morning just chatting about old times and chewing the fat, and he’d say: ‘You don’t know what it’s like to go in bins and search for food.’ That really kicked the stomach out of me to think he had to do that.” Sue shakes her head. “He never said anything like that to me. He always made out he was all right up there.” “He weren’t,” Tony tells her gently. “He weren’t, Mum.” Sue says she still doesn’t understand why Mark went to Scotland. Tony tells her Mark said that people like him were better supported in Glasgow than Ashford.As with the rest of Britain, there is a homelessness crisis in Scotland. Shelter Scotland figures show that in 2018-19, 36,465 homeless applications were made and 29,894 households were assessed as homeless by their local authority. In Glasgow, 5,679 homeless applications were made in 2018-19, from a population of 608,000. But Scotland is also making a serious attempt to address its crisis. The country is piloting Housing First in five of its biggest cities, based on models that have been used successfully in places as erse as Finland and New York. Housing First is founded on the principle that people with complex needs are provided with a home and wraparound services at the same time. It is, though, a slow and expensive process. In Glasgow, the hope is that, over five years, 600 people will be taken off the streets or out of emergency accommodation and provided with homes.In March, it was revealed that 139 people had died in Scotland on the streets or in temporary or supported homeless accommodation over the past 18 months. One thing that devastates the Starr family is how long it took them to find out that Mark was dead. Tony says Police Scotland was efficient and supportive. It contacted Kent police immediately to inform them about Mark. And that’s when things went awry. Kent police turned up at the doorstep of Sue’s house, but by then she was living with a friend. The person now living in Sue’s house has since told her that he passed her new address to the police. But the police never got in touch with her. When she heard that Kent police were looking for her, she phoned them, but was told by an officer that he knew nothing about the matter.It is early September, more than two months since Mark died, and Kent police has still not spoken to the family, let alone apologised (though it does a couple of months later). Tony says this has made the grieving process much more painful. He feels he never got the chance to say a proper goodbye to his brother.Tony decides to come to Scotland with us to find out more about Mark’s final months. He hopes it might provide the family with some kind of closure. Sue says she would find it too upsetting, but is glad he is doing it on the family’s behalf. What is she hoping he will find out? “It’s a silly question, really, but was he happy up there?” She smiles. “It’s a strange thing to say isn’t it? Happy on the street. But I know he was happy there sometimes.”It is early morning in mid-October, and we’re on the train to Glasgow. Tony has already cracked open a few cans of heavy-duty lager. It’s hard to know whether it’s dutch courage or habit. Sometimes, he says, he will only drink a couple of cans in a day sometimes many more. He likes to smoke cannabis, too, but has never used class A drugs. He’s terrified of them – he saw what they did to Mark.Tony has also had a tough life. He has anxiety and depression, and says that, in his 20s, there was a year after a relationship ended when he could barely set foot outside his house. When he and Jude’s mother split up, he looked after Jude. In December 2003, two people turned up at his house demanding that he hand over Jude. Tony refused and was stabbed in the face. One of the assailants was subsequently jailed, and the incident left Tony with post-traumatic stress disorder. Soon after the attack, Tony won custody of Jude.Tony has not worked since then, and has struggled financially. There have been times, he says, when it could easily have been him homeless as well as Mark. “I’ve had letters saying: ‘We’re going to evict you.’ It can happen to anybody. It’s really scary. Two years ago, there was a mix-up with the council, I fell briefly behind with rent and they went straight to eviction proceedings.”Tony is feeling emotional. He says he had to make this trip because Mark would have done the same for him. He takes out a photo – the last picture taken of the two brothers. Tony is topless, and they both look a little the worse for wear. “He was a bit bony by then. You know my last memory of Humpy is him walking down the path and me saying: ‘I love you, Hump.’ He said: ‘I love you too, bruv.’ That’s the last words I said to Humpy. I had a sixth sense something was going to happen. I told a few friends, I’m going to get a phone call soon.”He is also thinking about the good times, not all of them from childhood. Six years ago, they saw the Rolling Stones play in Hyde Park – one of the best days of their life, he says. “We were stood in a posh pub in our shorts smoking a joint. I think we got away with it ’cos the Stones were playing. We went to some blinding concerts, but that was the best. Unbelievable. It was the last concert we went to. I’ll cherish that memory.” He opens another can. “There’s only one Humpy Starr, believe me. He was unique.”“Excuse me, love, you don’t recognise this fella, do you? It’s my brother.” Tony kneels down to talk to a young homeless woman on the street – a girl really. He shows her the picture. She doesn’t recognise him, but they chat for a couple of minutes. It’s almost midnight, and the street homeless people of Glasgow are bedding down for the night.Tony approaches a skinny man with a red pointy beard. Barry, who is in his late 30s, has been living on the streets for the best part of 20 years and looks like a cross between Billy Connolly and Worzel Gummidge. He doesn’t recognise Mark either, but he forms an instant bond with Tony. Barry says he would rather be on the streets than in the hostels because they are loud, dirty and violent.“How d’you cope? Blimey, you must be battle hardened by now, Barry?” Tony says.“Aye, I’m used to it. There have been a lot of deaths when it’s been cold, but cold doesnae bother me. Some of the public can be all right, but you’ve also got the ones that walk past and spit on you. You need to find somewhere safe at night in case a crowd come and set on you.”Semra says she has been turned away from a hostel for being abusive, but insists she was just bantering with a friend. She has been homeless for some time, but this is her first night on the street and she’s terrified. “They told me to sleep under a camera so I can’t be murdered. What fucking chance have I got?” She pauses, and looks at Tony. “You can see the sadness in your eyes. You can see the hurt. I’m so sorry for your loss.”Tony says her account of Mark rings true. “He didn’t really drink, but he did like his crack.” Most important to Tony, she said Mark was a good man.Soon after getting to Glasgow, we receive a call from the council press office – just guidance, they say. They tell us that Mark did have accommodation, but he was evicted twice – once after uncapped needles were found in his temporary home, and another time for being aggressive. Tony is upset when I tell him the news. He says he has never known Mark to be aggressive. Yes, he says, he would fight back if provoked, but that’s all.Shelter Scotland call us to say it has information that may be of interest to Tony. We rush over to its offices, where we meet the community hub manager Davy MacIver and the senior development worker Stephen Wishart. They make for a good double act – MacIver small and quietly spoken, Wishart big and combative.“For about a week he was sleeping rough and couldn’t get accommodated again,” says MacIver. “That’s when we come in. We would have assisted him with his legal requirement to accommodation.” On another occasion he was gatekept after giving up a temporary furnished flat when he had started hearing voices. Again, the council failed to provide him with emergency accommodation. Shelter says the last time it saw him, it helped him find accommodation, but it didn’t see him in the final month of his life, and doesn’t know how he ended up back on the streets. He was due to meet Shelter on 28 June for help with his personal independence payment claim. He didn’t turn up. That was the day he died, a day before his 54th birthday.Tony asks whether there is any reference to violent behaviour in the case notes. “No,” Wishart says. “He doesn’t seem to be one of the clients who have been asked to leave places for violence … it was never an issue. But I’ve seen people asked to leave these places for cheek rather than aggression, and we’re told it’s aggression. But then when you look at it, it’s someone telling them to F-off.”Tony tells them his mother wants to know whether Mark was happy in Glasgow. He knows the answer, but he still feels he has to ask on behalf of Sue. “I wouldn’t say he seemed unhappy, if that makes sense,” Wishart says. “Given his circumstances, he was engaging. We get a lot of angry people in here, but Mark wasn’t like that. He was never up, never down, always even. Mark was a nice guy.”Tony mentions that the council said he had been evicted for leaving uncapped needles on the floor of his flat. MacIver gives a despairing look. “Private accommodation providers aren’t set up to cope with the situations they’re having to deal with,” he says. “Their response is to have a zero-tolerance policy because that’s the only thing they can effectively manage. You need properly resourced providers with specialist provision. Private landlords are not going to do the trick.”They talk about the Housing First model being rolled out gradually across Glasgow, and say it’s wonderful – in principle. “Housing First is actually designed for people like Mark,” Wishart says. “Yet I sit in meetings and hear about people being too complex for Housing First. So what are they not too complex for? Or are they just never to have a house? Is that it? OK, well, let’s just throw the towel in because we’re in the wrong game. Anyway, don’t get me started.” But it’s too late. Wishart is fuming.What would victory look like in the battle against the council? “That’s easy to answer,” says Wishart. “That people like Mark who approach the local authority and make a homeless application and ask for emergency accommodation, they get it.”Tony is impressed by their passion – and the fact that Mark may be one of the test cases in the legal action. As we leave, he makes an impromptu speech in praise of Scotland. “I’m thankful for what you’ve told me. Humpy was born in England, but died a son of Scotland. He loved the Glasgow people. I’ve only been here a day, but I can see why. I’ll be coming back.”Wherever we go we bump into Barry on the streets, and he’s brimming with ideas about where Tony might find people who knew Mark. He suggests we visit the City Mission day centre. At night its building serves as emergency accommodation for homeless people. The main hall is packed with people chatting at tables, eating and playing pool. Margaret, a middle-aged woman with a kindly, prematurely aged face, smiles affectionately when she sees the photo of Mark. “He was lonesome,” she tells Tony. “Me and my pals would sit next to him and talk to him. I talked to him all the time. He’d say: ‘I’m down.’ It was sad.”Tony asks her if Mark was a drinker? Tony seems to use the answer as a gauge of reliability. “No,” Margaret says. “He just liked the one can.” He asks what it’s like to sleep rough. “It’s horrible. People sleep under bridges by Central station and people spit on them and kick them. A guy got stabbed last week on the other side of the bridge. It’s dangerous, aye. Dangerous.” Tony hugs her as we leave.The next day we meet SNP councillor Mhairi Hunter, Glasgow city council’s convener for health and social care. Hunter says she is proud of the homelessness work the council is doing with Housing First, and explains how radical it is because homeless people no longer need to prove themselves “tenancy ready” when they move in. However admirable the model, it means little to Tony, and he can no longer hold back.“We found out by law my brother should have been housed,” Tony says.“Three times he had to find somewhere to live and he was on the streets.”“I can’t talk in detail about your brother’s case, but there can be circumstances where people get asked to leave accommodation,” Hunter says.“See, I’m thinking if my brother had been put somewhere and he got help that he needed, he could still be alive today.”Hunter nods silently. Would she accept that the council has failed to fulfil its duty to homeless people? “A hundred per cent,” she says. “Those figures are provided by us, and it’s part of our system to record every instance where somebody isn’t accommodated.”She says the SNP-run council is making progress, but Shelter hasn’t given it enough time. “You can’t just shut the system down and reboot it. It has to happen incrementally. That’s why it’s a five-year plan. I would absolutely not say our homelessness systems are fit for purpose because I know they are not.”Hunter has a point. The very fact that it is unlawful to deny homeless people temporary accommodation in Scotland is a sign of how seriously it takes the issue. As is the fact that Glasgow city council itself provides figures for the number of times it has failed to accommodate people in temporary accommodation – the stick with which Shelter can beat it. But the bottom line, as Hunter acknowledges, is that the council has acted unlawfully.It’s a beautiful, cold, fresh day in Glasgow Green. Tony has brought Mark’s ashes to scatter over the Nelson Monument, close to where he died. He opens the box, throws them into the air and breaks down. “There you go, Hump. There you go, bruv.” He kisses the memorial and crosses himself. “I love you, Hump. God bless you, brother. Will you keep a space for me up there, Humpy? Take care, bruv. I love you.”After gathering himself, he phones Sue to tell her he has scattered Mark’s ashes. She asks him what he has found out about Mark’s time in Glasgow. He tells her that he has met people who knew him, and that they have only good things to say about him. He doesn’t say anything about whether Mark was happy here in his final days.When he puts the phone down, he tells us he has been shocked to discover the life Mark was leading. “I didn’t think he’d go downhill like this. I really didn’t. He had a hard life up here – on his own, a lot of the time wandering around the streets, freezing cold, soaking wet, nothing to eat, treated like a dog, really.” And yet, despite everything, he says something positive has come out of this. “Walking in Humpy’s footsteps, I felt closer to him,” he says. “Being with the homeless in Glasgow has been very humbling. After hearing some of the stories. I can’t believe the kindness they show.”What was he expecting? “To be honest, I was expecting: ‘No, I don’t want to talk to you, F-off.’ No one said that. I just think of Humpy being on a park bench somewhere, freezing cold, and Margaret turning up with her friends and trying to cheer him up. Some of the public think they’re the dregs of society, yet they’ve got more kindness, more resilience, more compassion ... they’re unbelievable.”As we head back south, Tony opens a can of lager. There is so much to tell the family, he says. No, he can’t say Mark died happy or comfortably, but he thinks he can tell them something equally important. He talks about the Shelter case, and sitting in Mhairi Hunter’s office telling her that Mark might still be here if the council had done right by him. And he talks about the possibility of Mark being cited as evidence that the council did not fulfil its statutory duty to the homeless people of Glasgow. He knows his family will continue to grieve for Mark, but maybe, just maybe, something good will come of his death. “If Humpy stops more people dying on the streets by holding the council to account,” he says, “then his death won’t have been in vain.”Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or by emailing jo@samaritans.orgIf you are worried about becoming homeless, contact the housing department of your local authority to fill in a homeless application.

Bringing her new show to Sydney, the bushfire smoke presents another problemHanna Cormick is allergic to the industrialised world. When the Helsinki-born, Canberra-raised actor, acrobat and contortionist is exposed to everyday items such as plastic, pesticides, cigarettes, perfumes, some food odour or even the ink in a book, she is prone to not only hives, throat swelling and anaphylaxis but “very violent” seizures too.The seizures “look like I’ve lost consciousness and my whole body is jerking and moving about on its own”, she explains. They are caused by mast cell activation syndrome, an immunological condition that forces Cormick to spend most of her life in a sealed “safe” room in her mother’s Canberra house.Anyone entering Cormick’s room has to go through a decontamination process, because many products derived from fossil fuels pose her serious danger. She lives in the house with her actor partner, and her safe room contains a positive-pressure air system, multiple air filtration devices and, by necessity, little furniture.Soon, Cormick will briefly journey to Sydney festival to perform her short, text-based show The Mermaid: both the story of her life and a metaphor for the poisoning of the planet. “I had been treating my body as something I could exploit, without expecting to meet its needs,” she recalls via Skype from her sealed room.“I realised, like the world’s reliance on fossil fuels and their impact on the planet, I had been treating my body with the same hyper-capitalist mindset.”Cormick’s performances will be staged at the Coal Loader in Waverton, a former coal plant turned into a sustainability centre on the waterfront. The Sydney trip has required detailed advanced planning. She had planned to stay in an eco-construction on a remote Blue Mountains property – the clean air of bush living is easier on her mast cells – but the bushfires sweeping through the state have presented high risks.“It’s obviously in all our minds, given the current fires, but we haven’t found a good back-up yet,” she says, when emailed a follow-up question amid the haze this week. “We will probably have to find a less immunologically safe (but more fire-safe) location, and I would need to sleep in protective gear and my respiratory equipment and oxygen – which I’ve been having to do with the smoke pollution right now anyway.“It’s really painful – respirator masks are very painful to wear for long periods – but it’s kept me breathing fine so far.”Performing in public carries severe risks to her safety, too. At the start and end of her first performance of the premiere season of The Mermaid, in Canberra in March 2018, Cormick suffered seizures while sitting on the floor in front of her audience.“It can be really confronting, and I think not just to see these sorts of medical events they don’t always happen in the work, it is random,” she says.“The audience also has to think about the way our own actions might be impacting others.”The Sydney festival shows require audience members to be mindful of what they bring in with them – but the venue’s naturally ventilated, outdoor harbourside location lessens the risk.Until 2015, Cormick had been enjoying a multiskilled acrobatic and acting career in Europe – including an arts residency in the south of France, working with circus in refugee camps on the Turkish-Syrian border, devising and rehearsing shows in Paris and performing with a troupe at the Edinburgh fringe festival.But she had been hiding a growing list of unexplained symptoms – weight and muscle strength loss, fainting and being out of breath – until “the crash” of April that year: allergic reactions to all food, great pain and an inability to walk up a flight of stairs.Forced to return to Australia to rest and seek answers, her doctor raised the possibility Cormick was suffering a form of the debilitating genetic connective tissue disorder Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. This bad news was just the beginning.This syndrome impacts not only joint mobility but, in more severe cases such as Cormick’s, causes serious problems in every organ system: brain, heart, lungs, spinal cord, gastrointestinal tract, pelvic organs and veins.“Now, my bones are coming out of their sockets many times every day,” says the former contortionist, who was finally diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome in 2017. The next year Cormick was diagnosed with – among other diseases – mast cell activation syndrome, the cause of her seizures and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, a form of orthostatic intolerance which can also cause her body to collapse. Her father has the same “trifecta”, she says, and her mother has mast cell activation syndrome too.These days, when Cormick ventures outside her safe room in her wheelchair – “once a week, once a fortnight, that kind of thing, usually for an hour at a time” – she wears a respirator and relies on an oxygen tank to avoid seizure triggers. It is a “big operation”, requiring multiple helpers, to ensure she is as safe from pollutants as possible.There is no treatment for Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, but physiotherapy helps prevent deterioration. For postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome, Cormick is on regular IV saline infusions and is weighing up getting a pacemaker fitted. Frequent injections of a high-dose drug, omalizumab, have decreased the frequency of Cormick’s seizures, and she has the standard rescue medications for acute episodes: adrenaline, oxygen and albuterol.There are other immunotherapy medications that could help, she says, but they are restricted in Australia. “Sometimes it feels like you fight bureaucracy more than you fight the symptoms.”Part of Cormick’s motivation in creating The Mermaid was to confront her own past attitudes to disability. She says she will be forever grateful to the performer Liz Carr, who drew her attention to the concept of the “social model” of disability, which holds that disability is caused by the way society is organised.“The circus industry, the dance industry are incredibly ableist spaces, and I had developed a damaging mindset that confused my values with what I could do, with my productivity, especially my physical abilities,” Cormick says.“They are industries that foster the idea you can do anything if you try hard enough. Having the antidote of the social model was necessary for me to start unlearning that.”• The Mermaid is at the Coal Loader from 17 to 19 January 2020. Sydney festival runs from 8 to 26 January"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b7c0df91f9c57779b95b79258adcb62091736bc7/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c789a34fb4370780942308b915d4ac","title":"previously extinct guam rail saved in rare conservation success aoe","story":"Ten species with improved numbers in IUCN red list unveiled amid call for more bioersity focus at COP25by  Fiona Harvey in MadridThe Guam rail, a flightless bird typically about 30cm long, usually dull brown in colour and adorned with black and white stripes, has become a rare success story in the recent history of conservation.Previously extinct in the wild, the bird has been saved by captive breeding programmes and on Tuesday its status was updated on the IUCN red list of threatened species to critically endangered, along with nine others whose numbers have recently improved.The Guam rail fell prey to the brown tree snake, an invasive species accidentally introduced to the US island territory at the end of the second world war. It is only the second bird in history to recover from being extinct in the wild, after the California condor.Other species to have their status updated include the echo parakeet, of which there are now more than 750 in the wild, leading to a reclassification as a “vulnerable” species, having been critically endangered more than a decade ago.The Australian trout cod and pedder galaxias, both freshwater fish, have also showed improvement, the former moving from endangered to vulnerable and the latter from critically endangered to endangered, after many years of conservation efforts.However, the red list data released on Tuesday also showed 73 species declines despite conservation efforts, and the list now numbers 112,432 species around the world, of which more than 30,000 are on the brink of extinction.The IUCN update came as governments from more than 190 nations met in Madrid for two weeks of talks aimed at pushing global action on greenhouse gas emissions. Progress at the talks has been slow, despite public pressure, and campaigners have been frustrated that key issues such as the bioersity crisis have received little official attention.“The tightly woven links between climate and bioersity must be recognised at COP25 and there is good reason for this: the impact that a changing climate will have on the ability of ecosystems to support plant and animal life, and the challenges that bioersity already face in a warming world are both vast,” said Gareth Redmond-King, the head of climate change at WWF UK.1mSpecies threatened with extinctionEcosystems are already under unprecedented pressure from human impacts, including habitat loss from encroachment by urbanisation and farming, pollution, hunting, overfishing and invasive species. But the accelerating climate crisis is pushing nature to breaking point around the world, wiping out vital ecosystems, putting unbearable pressure on species and leading some experts to declare a fifth mass extinction.“To avert the worst of these impacts, we have to keep the global temperature rise to 1.5C,” said Redmond-King. “There is no time for debate. Only a dramatic increase in the ambition of our collective response can avert the climate crisis we are in.”One of the ironies of the UN climate talks is that protecting natural systems could provide a lifeline for humanity out of the climate crisis – yet it is one that is often neglected at these annual talks. A focus on “nature-based solutions” could make a marked difference to action on the climate, said Inger Andersen, the executive director of the UN Environment Programme. “We need to take the lessons we have learned on the climate change journey.”She pointed to deforestation, which threatens species and is accelerating the rise in greenhouse gas emissions. Preserving forests is relatively cheap, but is the subject of tense debate at the COP25 talks because some nations want to sell carbon credits from their standing forests, as well as counting them towards their national emissions reduction targets. That argument has yet to be resolved, and may not be before the UN talks end on Friday.Marine bioersity – which is under threat from climate breakdown – was also supposed to be a key focus at these talks, which were billed as the Blue COP when the location was fixed as Santiago in Chile. The move to Madrid, forced by political unrest in Chile, has meant a loss of some of that focus, frustrating oceans campaigners, who have argued that protecting the oceans is vital to their capacity to store carbon and help combat the climate emergency.Oceana, a marine NGO, called attention to the “blue forests” composed of marine algae which are widespread across the planet and which store carbon dioxide and provide a lifeline for the thousands of species that depend on them “Blue forests are one of the main lungs of our oceans, and we should protect them as they deserve,” said Ricardo Aguilar, the senior research director at Oceana in Europe. “Scientific reports tend to focus on terrestrial forests, but marine algae can account for as much as a fifth of the CO2 stored by oceans. It is vital that decision-makers include their protection within international policies against the climate crisis.”Another study released at COP25, published in the journal Global Change Biology, illustrated how preserving mangrove groves can provide a key buffer against the impacts of global heating. Researchers studied the Segara Anakan lagoon in Java, Indonesia, and found it had huge potential for storing carbon, fostering bioersity and protecting against storms.Next year will be a crucial one for action on both the climate emergency and the bioersity crisis. The UK will host the next UN climate talks, where nations will have to come up with vastly improved targets to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the coming decade to fulfil the pledges of the 2015 Paris agreement.Before those talks take place, in Glasgow next November, the IUCN will hold its four-yearly World Conservation Congress in June and the UN Bioersity Convention will decide on new measures for preserving species at a meeting in Kunming, China, in October.Campaigners hope the sequence of key meetings will lead to a greater focus on nature in the coming year, but stressed that more needed to be done to draw out the interdependency of these issues, rather than allowing them to be seen in isolation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b1efab452d6dc908d91a86cace51f48a8e8bb727/0_109_5152_3091/master/5152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ff11f3a7ba7c9204a2d0bd6682d1fdc1","title":"christmas side dishes a pan fried sprouts with soy and hazelnuts recipe","story":"Even the sprout-shy will warm to these flash-fried, soy-covered flavour bombs that go so well with a Christmas turkeyYotam Ottolenghi’s Christmas side dish: harissa and gruyere gratinThis is such a delicious way to cook sprouts, and they go beautifully with turkey.

I’d recommend making this a day ahead, because it tastes even better when fridge-cold. 160g caramel sauce (thick set), store bought or homemade – I used Waitrose salted caramel dipping sauce1 tbsp whole milkFor the chocolate cake120g unsalted butter, at room temperature, plus extra for greasing250g plain flour½ tsp baking powder½ tsp bicarbonate of soda70g cocoa powder¼ tsp salt100g dark muscovado sugar125g caster sugar2 large eggs200ml buttermilkFor the flan1 x 400g tin evaporated milk 1 x 397g tin sweetened condensed milk 120g full-fat cream cheese, at room temperature3 large eggs2 tsp vanilla bean paste¼ tsp saltHeat the oven to 170C (160C fan) 350Fgas 4. Liberally grease a 27cm bundt tin with butter, then coat the bottom with half the caramel sauce and put the tin into a larger roasting tin about 40cm x 28cm in size.Now start on the cake batter. Sift the flour, baking powder, bicarb, cocoa powder and salt into a medium bowl. Put the butter and both sugars in the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment in place. Beat on medium speed for about two minutes, until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time only until just incorporated, then turn the speed to medium-low. Mix in a third of the flour mixture and half the buttermilk, then repeat before adding the last of the flour. Mix until everything is just incorporated, then transfer to the bundt tin, smoothing out the top with the back of a spoon.For the flan batter, blitz all the ingredients in a blender until smooth – about 15 seconds. Pour the flan batter over the cake batter in the tin, then cover the bundt tin first with a piece of greaseproof paper and then with a piece of foil, wrapping it up tightly. Add enough boiling water to the roasting tin to come about 2cm up the sides of the bundt tin, then transfer to the oven and bake for an hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out almost clean rotate the tin once after 30 minutes, to ensure an even bake. Lift the tin out of its water bath, remove the foil and greaseproof paper, and leave for about an hour, until completely cool.Invert the chocoflan on to a large, round platter – you may need to shake it slightly to release it from the tin – then refrigerate until cold, for at least two hours and, ideally, if time allows, overnight. To serve, thin the remaining 80g caramel with the milk and drizzle all over the flan.• This article was edited on 10 December 2019.

Klopp said the Egypt international’s refusal to lose focus after the misses was a major factor in Liverpool’s highly impressive victory.Liverpool qualified top of their group, with Napoli finishing second, and Klopp cited his players’ respect for the Austrian champions as another impressive hallmark of their performance. He added: “I couldn’t have more respect for what Salzburg are doing. I know how people see it, you think about being best in Austria is OK but some people don’t respect that. You see how good they are, how good they were in the first game, how good they were against Napoli.“We came here as current Champions League winners and I would really love it if my team is so smart that they listen and put a shift in like that. Salzburg were unbelievably strong, especially in the first half, but we were as well and were ready for the fight. We should have scored in the first half and then in the second half, it’s not easy to keep that intensity. We scored the goals and could have scored more, but I have really massive respect for Salzburg.”Jesse Marsch, the Salzburg coach, said his confident team were ultimately undone by Liverpool’s European pedigree. “In the end they showed their quality,” he said. “Salah’s goal was unbelievable. It was like a heavyweight fight. We punched them but then they punched us twice more.”Dejan Lovren was forced off with an injury in the second half but Klopp claimed it was not serious and hopefully a repeat of the minor problem the defender suffered in the win at Bournemouth on Saturday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5a04e00aa7d4e63e0d31429937d7f23bb0144a4/0_384_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f08028861fc190d094b2ec5d7978e24","title":"ice baths and deep breaths how rewilding myself left me feeling superhuman","story":"Sedentary lifestyles, artificial lights and too much comfort are bad for us. So is it time to kick away our chairs and go back to nature?I drop into an outdoor freezer full of water and ice, with no clothes on, in December. My body starts to buck, breath unable to leave my lungs. It feels as if I’m going into cardiac arrest.I suspect that this one-to-one session with Tony Riddle, ultra-athlete and natural lifestyle coach, will be my ruin. When he greets me, too early in the morning, he is disconcertingly hale, with the focused gaze of a Viking approaching shore. Worse, he is wearing a pair of those amphibious foot-gloves. You know, the ones with inidual toe sheaths that make you think a gorilla is walking towards you on its hands.“Inside every human is an endurance athlete,” is one of his remarks on meeting, which is a) too inspiring for a Tuesday morning, and b) not true. Beneath my feckless exterior is an even lazier core slob, only kept at bay with strategic food bribes and inconvenient council tax demands.Riddle’s “rewilding” philosophy is about reconnecting humans to natural behaviours – particularly ways of moving that modern lifestyles have estranged us from. We were not designed to sit for 10 hours a day, he explains. Electric lighting confuses our sleep cycles. Urban architecture encourages bad posture. The artificial repetitions of the gym encourage strain and uneven musculature. He winces when he sees my trainers, which is rich. Why are most shoes narrower at the front than the heel? he asks. A foot’s natural shape is the opposite – toes are meant to spread, and grip the ground: we have more than 100 muscles down there. Thick-soled, cushioned running shoes cause these to atrophy, and deprive us of sensory feetback. I mean back feet. I mean feedback. Sorry, I’ve been sitting for a while.I thought the session might involve gently foraging for nuts actually, Riddle’s thesis is that naturally developed bodies have incredible abilities. There’s much focus on feet – “the basis of your superstructure”. I stand on one leg, flailing, confirming my body has less balance than my bank account. Yet I find revelations, too. We practice the Wim Hof breathing technique, and I’m astonished to learn I can hold my breath – after exhaling – for a full minute.Next, we move to straight-arm pullups, and I’m a little confused by these attempts to raise my body toward a metal bar, without bending at the elbow. Surely an anatomical impossibility, at best a physical riddle? Oh, my God, I think, arms shaking, his name is Toe Knee Riddle? Like a superhero alias. A few weeks ago, Riddle ran the length of the country barefoot, to raise money for charity, despite being born with underdeveloped lower limbs and spending years in braces. Needless to say, he pulls himself toward the bar using just his back muscles, until he is almost horizontal.There are also simpler ideas for living naturally in the modern world: squatting at your office desk “surfing” inside train carriages, which involves avoiding handrails and using micro-adjustments of your feet to balance removing chairs from your home.But the extreme ideas are fascinating. “Cold immersion is so under-rated,” Riddle announces. I, however, don’t think it’s under-rated enough. He believes ice baths have benefits for cellular response, digestion and the immune system. I believe it will make my organs shut down. The disagreement is academic – I check my bag, realise I’ve forgotten my swimming trunks. Riddle looks at me in a way that seems to say: “That was a subconscious choice, to avoid the ice bath.” He has a spare pair, he laughs, slapping me on the back.And this is how I found myself climbing into a freezer of water, worrying about having a heart attack. “Breathe,” Riddle compels me. Exhaling will calm my nervous system, he says. And it does. I stop shivering. I spend two minutes submerged in the ice, surprisingly calm. My body adapts, capable of more than I thought. When I step out, I feel superhuman.You know what? I do recommend this. Rewilding chimes with me. It’s not macho and it emphasises play. I would sooner climb a tree than up my reps in the gym. I like running the low walls in my neighbourhood, and prefer a dance around the kitchen to any fitness fad. A morning of getting back to nature has left me feeling vital and empowered. I wonder what six months of this could do. When I agreed to go rewilding, I thought we would be releasing wolves in Leeds city centre. I’d definitely pack my trunks for that. Wildness. I won’t wear the glove shoe, though. 55One-to-one Rewilding sessions with Tony Riddle start from £120, and there are workshops available from 14 December for £60.

It became an important part of the relationship – even when things were going well.”After their wedding this summer, the couple continued to attend sessions while they settled into marriage. By discussing potential problems with an unbiased third party, Thomas says they both felt confident to be more open with each other.It also helped them to work on their communication styles, which has further strengthened their relationship. “It’s not just what you say, but when and how you say it. Before therapy, I might say something critical first thing in the morning and Jenny would immediately become defensive. We’ve learned that we communicate better when we allocate a time to sit down after dinner and rationally discuss things.”Although the couple dated for eight years before they got married, Thomas believes that counselling prepared them for the changes that come with marriage. “Even after all that time, therapy opened my eyes to new things about Jenny. It helped me to understand that people deal with issues in different ways and I have become better at seeing things from her perspective.”While premarital or wedding therapy may sound unromantic to some, for many couples, it is a way to future-proof a relationship and smash the dangerous illusion of the fairytale ending. “We had a fantastic connection when we met, but over time you have to put effort into a relationship,” says Thomas.It might seem out of the ordinary, but Cate Campbell, a sex and relationship therapist and a member of the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, says such therapy is on the rise. “In the past five years, this type of counselling has become increasingly popular,” she says. “I think people are becoming increasingly realistic about relationships.”However loved-up couples seem on their wedding day, the Office for National Statistics shows that the average marriage in the UK lasts 12 years. It is a far cry from the “happy ever after” ending promised by books and movies, which could explain why more couples are taking a proactive approach to maintaining healthy relationships.Unlike traditional couples therapy, which is often attended after a serious relationship breakdown, premarital therapy aims to prevent problems before they arise. It can cover a wide range of topics tailored to the couple, including money management, parenting, holidays, sex and other issues.“Sometimes I see couples who consider themselves soulmates. When they realise they have differences, this can be very hard to digest and they run into problems,” says Campbell. During the honeymoon phase, any small disagreements are often obscured by oxytocin, the love hormone that helps us to bond and reproduce. “Once we commit to each other or have a baby, this starts to wear off. That’s where small problems can start to escalate.”For many religious communities, premarital counselling isn’t a new phenomenon. When Georgina Fuller got married 11 years ago, she was expected to take a six-week marriage preparation course, run by priests. “It was mandatory so that we could marry in the Catholic church,” she says.“We went once a week for a couple of hours and got advice about our relationship. It included topics such as shared values, and managing expectations about marriage. They advised couples to discuss how they would want to bring up children together. It’s a very important thing to talk about and it’s not always the first thing people think of when they’re in love and planning a wedding.”Although elements of the course were useful, Fuller says the heavy focus on religion was alienating. “I felt the course was more about telling us what to do so that we could be good Catholics, as opposed to listening to us and helping us to understand our feelings. I think traditional therapy, where couples discuss their feelings openly with their partner, is more helpful.”As the complexities of modern life increase and people live more secular lives, many people are turning to independent, non-religious counselling for support. Last year, the School of Life in London introduced premarital psychotherapy to help couples build on the existing foundations of their relationship.“Our pre-marriage or pre-commitment therapy isn’t just for people getting married,” says Charlotte Fox Weber, the head of psychotherapy for the school. “It could be for couples who are having a baby or buying a house together. We support people to understand the realities of taking their relationship to the next level.”Known as “romantic realism”, more than 70 couples have signed up for premarital therapy since the sessions were launched. “We have seen a big rise in the number of young couples attending therapy, but we’re also seeing older couples who have been orced, recognised they made mistakes and want to make things work this time around.”Fox Weber says that some couples are even given therapy sessions as a wedding gift. “Sometimes people think they’re so in love that they don’t need therapy. But counselling can make a good life even better. It’s like taking out breakdown cover before your car breaks down.”It is something that Angela wishes she had considered when she got married in 2010, after a three-year engagement. “I never imagined anything could go wrong. We were so in love on our honeymoon, it made me wonder how relationships ever break down.” But almost a decade on, she is able to see how easily cracks can form. “We’ve faced a lot of stress over the years which has been hard to cope with,” she says.At the end of 2012, her partner lost his job shortly after the birth of their first child. The couple moved from their home in Australia to New Zealand to find work, which left Angela homesick and without the support of her extended family. By the time her second child was born two years later, she was struggling to keep her head above water.“Premarital therapy prepares you for what’s to come and there was a lot I wasn’t expecting,” she says. “I had no idea how difficult it would be to have two small children, or how much I would struggle with losing my financial independence on maternity leave. It became harder to discuss these issues with my partner because I was so exhausted I couldn’t even articulate how I was feeling.”Although she recognises, in hindsight, that these emotions are normal, it made her feel there was something wrong. “Communication starts to break down so quickly when you’re tired and stressed. Every tiny thing can build into resentment. Therapy helps you to see the potential pitfalls to prevent these clashes from happening.”The couple are extremely happy now, but it has taken time to iron out their differences. “One of the most important things for me is realising that when you are in a relationship, you are still an independent person responsible for your own happiness,” says Angela.In 2017, she made the decision to retrain as a mindset and success coach, which she believes has given her the tools she needs to take control of her own life. “Once I had this, it was easy to see how to get my marriage to a great place again.”Her sentiments are echoed by Campbell, who says that part of being in a healthy relationship is having confidence in yourself. “You need to feel happy that you can disagree with your partner and the world won’t end,” she says. “In reality, soulmates and perfect relationships do not exist. But premarital therapy can help two iniduals build strong foundations for the future.”(Some names have been changed)"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5c914ef1d269ab9726a01209e88ce2702c285d9/0_148_4446_2668/master/4446.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d123a9f3cd36a3498b54bf10a018e2","title":"what would you like us to cover in 2020 share your thoughts","story":"We want to know what you hope to make space for next year and what you would like to see us coverAs 2019 comes to a close, we want to reflect on our journalism and look ahead to next year’s stories.

Johnson spent Tuesday in Staffordshire attempting to recover from a disastrous previous day, when he refused to look at a photo of a sick boy lying on the floor of a hospital in Leeds and his advisers then wrongly briefed that an aide had been punched.With polling stations due to open at 7am on Thursday, Corbyn will say it is time for people to vote for “a Labour government that will be on your side a Labour government that will save our NHS”.“It’s time for a pay rise for 12 million people, for lower fares and bills, and for free childcare,” he will say in a speech in Middlesbrough in the north-east on Wednesday.“It’s time for pension justice for women born in the 1950s, and for free personal care for pensioners. And it’s time for everyone to have free education and decent jobs.“We will put money in your pocket because you deserve it. The richest and big business will pay for it. We will save our NHS by giving it the money it needs, ending privatisation and by not selling it out to Trump.”He will argue that Thursday’s choice is the “most important election in a generation”, in which people have the chance “to vote for a government for the many, not the few”.Johnson, who will start his day on a milk-round in Yorkshire at 7am, said the Tories could not be complacent about being ahead in the polls and said the election remained “close-fought”.Asked at a campaign event in a JCB factory in Staffordshire whether the general election was “in the bag”, the prime minister insisted “absolutely not”.“This is a very close-fought election, and we need every vote,” he told his audience of factory workers at a carefully staged event. “The only mathematical alternative to a working majority for a Conservative government is the real, real risk of another hung parliament. That’s another five years of confusion, chaos, dither and delay. We cannot go down that route.”In an attempt to emphasise his point, he drove a union jack-emblazoned bulldozer through a wall of polystyrene blocks in a stunt for the TV cameras.He told JCB workers: “We’ve only got 48 hours to get this thing done. I want you now to reflect on the gravity of the choice we have before us. This is a momentous occasion for our country. I’ve never seen an election quite like it.”Labour quickly countered with an edited version of the clip that made it look as if Johnson was tearing down the NHS.The prime minister also sought to exploit comments by the shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, whose downbeat remarks about Labour’s chances were leaked by a “friend”.“Jon Ashworth made absolutely clear that he thinks the reason Mr Corbyn is failing to persuade large numbers of people to vote for him is he is blocking Brexit, he won’t get Brexit done,” Johnson said. “He’s absolutely right.”In an apparent bid to reach out to voters who supported remain in 2017, he said: “We want to respect the will of the people. We’re democrats. I mean, whether we’re leavers or remainers, whichever way we voted, we’ve come together and we want to get it done. We can we’ve got a deal.”Johnson was accompanied by the chancellor, Sajid Javid, at the first of several stage-managed appearances as the Tories sought to get their campaign back on track for the final 48 hours.The prime minister was challenged on Monday over the photograph of a four-year-old boy, Jack Williment-Barr, sleeping on the floor of a Leeds hospital, and responded by pocketing the journalist’s phone. And his aides were later accused of lying about an incident outside the same hospital involving an aide to the health secretary, Matt Hancock.Javid introduced the prime minister at JCB by warning that a Labour government would create an economic crisis by Christmas.“Corbyn has a programme for government that is far left, that is the most anti-business, the most anti-enterprise, this country has ever seen. It will guarantee an economic crisis,” he said.“Normally a Labour government takes a few years to leave a crisis,” he added. “With this lot, it won’t be years it won’t be months it won’t even be weeks it will be days. There will be a crisis by Christmas.”The departure of the Conservatives’ campaign battle bus from JCB was delayed because Extinction Rebellion protesters dressed as bees glued themselves to its windscreen – though Johnson himself left separately.Both party leaders will end the day with rallies for supporters in London.

But this is the part of the UK where the Liberal Democrats are most relevant.Labour needs particular support here, where pro-remain vote-splitting in London means that the Conservatives could retake Kensington (Lab majority 20) and Battersea (Lab maj 2,416) – as well as outside London in Canterbury (Lab maj 187) and Portsmouth South (Lab maj 1,554).There are handful of Conservative held seats where the residual Lib Dem vote is greater than the winning majority: Hastings and Rye (Con maj 346), and Norwich North (Con maj 507). Other key Labour targets where there has been a significant Lib Dem vote include Watford (Con maj 2,092).This is more clearcut, because the Lib Dems are generally not registering among voters in this part of the country, although Tim Farron’s narrow 777 seat majority means that support from those who voted Labour last time could help him hang on in Westmorland and Lonsdale.Key seats where Labour particularly needs support from the often small number of previous Lib Dem voters include: Newcastle-under-Lyme (Lab maj 30), Bishop Auckland (Lab maj 502) and Colne Valley (Lab maj 915).Labour targets, which could in theory be taken with residual support from the Lib Dems, include Pudsey (Con maj 331) and Stoke-on-Trent South (Con maj 663). The party also appears best placed in Broxtowe, Nottinghamshire, even though the sitting MP, Anna Soubry, is running for the Independent Group for Change.By contrast the Lib Dems best hope is Cheadle, south Manchester, where the party is in second place, chasing a Conservative majority of 4,507.Labour is fighting a defensive operation in Wales, where it held Wrexham (Lab maj 1,832) and Gower (Lab maj 3,269) with less than half the vote at the last election and needs the support of Plaid Cymru and Lib Dem supporters.However, if Plaid voters switched – and Labour could hold its vote despite the regional polling – then it could in theory gain Preseli Pembrokeshire (Con maj 314) and Aberconwy (Con maj 635) from the Conservatives.The Lib Dems best chance is to hang on to Brecon and Radnorshire, which it won at a byelection from the Conservatives in August, and Plaid’s main concern would be to see off the Tories in Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Plaid maj 4,850).Against that backdrop, in every Conservative held seat, the nearest challengers are the SNP, with Stirling the top target (Con maj 148) followed by Gordon (Con maj 2,607) and Ayr, Carrick and Cumnock (Con maj 2,774), where there are enough Labour votes to unseat the Tory.The SNP meanwhile, needs support to defend seats like Perth and North Perthshire, which it held by 21 votes from the Conservatives. And while Labour would dearly like to make gains from the SNP, in an anti-Tory tactical voting guide the focus is elsewhere.Finally, in Northern Ireland, nationalists voting against the Conservative party’s former confidence and supply partners, the Democratic Unionist party, are expected to lead to the DUP losing Belfast South (DUP maj 1,996) to the Social Democratic and Labour party, and possibly Belfast North (DUP maj 2,081), where Nigel Dodds is standing, to Sinn Féin."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4704845d04c69edec082ed093af1da7c6d156b8c/57_0_647_388/master/647.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f132914b09aa1c17f4d71940404204a","title":"election polls uk 2019 latest opinion poll tracker tories labour","story":"Find out who’s ahead using our opinion poll tracker.

During a visit coordinated by the National Organisation of Social Workers (NOSW), I saw the powerful contribution of social work to restoring a nation torn apart by genocide, working towards a reconciliatory and vibrant future.The social work profession in Rwanda was formed following the 1994 genocide, which had its roots in the colonialist ide-and-rule administration and systematic oppression of the Tutsi population. After the slaughter of more than 800,000 people, Rwanda’s social fabric was in tatters. Economic institutions collapsed, there was widespread displacement and many women were pregnant as the result of rape.However, Consolee Uwihangana of the NOSW stresses: “The story of Rwanda is one of overcoming the history sown by the colonists. Ours is a story of reconciliation, repair and self-reliance, and as a nation we have made immense strides.”Social work has been a key factor in making this progress, through homegrown solutions or indigenous models of development that address the many layers of social wounds. Uwihangana explains the role of social workers: “We are counsellors, community facilitators, advocates and policy influencers. We work both with iniduals and whole communities as the nation needs to work together to overcome the challenges.”Among other approaches, social workers have been deeply involved with programmes such as umuganda (community work), ubudehe (local collective action) and girinka (one cow per poor family).With girinka, social workers are using an indigenous tradition as a vehicle for community change. A cow is issued to every poor family and, according to Charles Kalinganire of NOSW: “Giving the firstborn calf to your neighbour has been an enormous part of the reconciliation process, as neighbours and villagers to this day swap cows, reinforcing their connections and bonds.”Another inspiring example of social change from Rwanda’s capital city, Kigali, is Hope and Homes for Children, a community hub that prevents children from being abandoned. Emery Nduwimana, a social worker with the charity, explains that some of the factors that contribute to child abandonment include parental trauma resulting from rape, family isolation, drug abuse, vulnerability and stigma towards children with disabilities.As we drive into the mid-city community along the red earth road, Nduwimana points out the range of activity at the centre. In one classroom the walls are vibrating from loud drumming as young men practise traditional dance. “Our traditional culture is a safe and vibrant setting for them,” Nduwimana says before leading me to a classroom where adults are learning English as skills for employment.Outside, a group of women in patterned dresses and brightly coloured head scarves are holding a weekly meeting to administer their community finances. The programme offers loans to community members, supporting their entrepreneurial plans and providing relief when times are hard.There is still more work to be done to promote reconciliation in Rwanda – but as the fragrances of eucalyptus and pine drift through the air, I am hopeful. It’s clear from the absence of street children and beggars, and the inclusive gatherings of men and women planning their collective futures, that innovative social work has made an impact.Rwandans are right to be proud: in a short timeframe, the nation has achieved unparalleled progress in reconciliation and development. Social work has played a vital role in this success.• Rory Truell is secretary-general of the International Federation of Social Workers"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74a5d2acb2873abc14bed956a93236f61b4fd467/0_1242_2678_1607/master/2678.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e2f5d5dfe6bccef4b42f69d3c0008aaa","title":"buy a classic sport photograph the big splash","story":"The tenth of a  Print Shop series featuring classic sports images from the likes of Gerry Cranham, Mark Leech and Tom Jenkins – yours to own for just £55 including free deliveryWhile most other photographers took their places on the sidelines of the athletics track at the White City stadium for the 1965 British Games, photographer Gerry Cranham, always hunting something a little different, ducked down alongside one of the steeplechase hurdles and awaited his quarry.

And when you are constantly not being listened to – and constantly berated – there comes a time when you think should I put my efforts elsewhere? Without making knee-jerk reactions I think a lot will happen in the next 48 hours.”On Monday Wada’s president, Sir Craig Reedie, announced Russia would be banned from global competitions for four years after manipulating and deleting doping data from its Moscow laboratory. However, Wada also agreed that inidual Russian athletes would still be able to compete internationally if they could prove they were not tainted.Reedie also rejected calls for a blanket ban from Wada’s athlete commission, calling them a “ginger group” and saying full bans didn’t work. However, Aggar said those comments were both “laughable and disrespectful”.“I thought about quitting when Wada made the Russian Anti-Doping Agency compliant again last year so I don’t want to be the person that cries wolf and never acts on it after this appalling decision,” she added. “But, while I’ve hoped that things might head in the right direction, it’s looking pretty bleak at the minute.“ I also know Wada would love me to leave because I am challenging them.”Aggar has received the full support of Scott, who told the  that the fight against doping was in a difficult place. “It just feels like an uphill battle,” she said. “There is a real disconnect between the athlete commission and leadership at Wada.“The commission is really dedicated and passionate about protecting clean athletes. However, at a time when Wada’s Executive Committee finally had the power and authority to take legal action against such blatant corruption from Russia, it chose not to. It is surreal.”Adam Pengilly, the second British member of Wada’s athlete commission, also said he supported a full ban on Russian athletes because of the country’s failure to tackle widespread state-sponsored doping.“Nothing has worked,” he said. “I’ve been reluctant to call for a full ban but until the system changes athletes will continue to get exploited in Russia.“I have been told by a Russian friend in sport that it is a collective system and the majority of those who were around five to 10 years ago are still there. So the 12-year-old girl who wants to be a 1500m runner will probably be at major risk of having to be pushed into doping later in her career.”Meanwhile, Rob Koehler, who heads the athlete-led movement Global Athlete, said a significant number of leading sportsmen and women had contacted him to express their frustration with Wada.“It is a step backwards compared to where we were in 2016, when Wada recommended a complete ban on Russia for the Olympics and Paralympics,” added Koehler, who was previously the deputy general of Wada. “Reedie now says that blanket bans don’t work – but the example of South Africa under apartheid suggests otherwise.”Koehler also warned that the decision not to stand up to Russia would have worrying consequences. “I think the credibility of Wada had already deteriorated but this decision has made it worse,” he added. “The problem is that Russia is powerful. They host events and there is a lot of Russian representatives on various international sports boards, so their influence is wide and their tentacles are everywhere.”The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said his country have “reason to appeal” against the four-year ban imposed on Monday, claiming he did not agree with collective punishment. “The main thing, in my opinion, and it seems to me that everyone agrees with it, is that any punishment – since the times of Roman law – should be inidual and based on what that inidual did,” he added.However, the head of the US Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, told the  the court of arbitration for sport might also listen to an appeal from clean athletes who feel Wada’s sanctions against Russia do not go far enough.“Cas rules allow for parties to intervene when it is appropriate and they are adversely affected,” he said. “Whether the athletes end up doing that will be their choice but, if Cas agrees with them, it would then have the ability to increase any punishment on Russia.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/58f2b2ec0a368e4583b72da30e4f33fffd824081/230_159_3317_1990/master/3317.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3b14b17054eecb955230a217f6021608","title":"the tailor of gloucester review tabby triumphs in custom made show","story":"Salisbury PlayhouseBrightly designed, this jaunty version of Beatrix Potter’s seasonal tale boasts a scene-stealing Simpkin the catBeatrix Potter’s book about an ailing tailor tasked with making a coat for the mayor’s wedding was written as a Christmas gift for her former governess’s daughter. It’s full of the spirit of the season, from the message of peace and goodwill to the snow-lined streets in the illustrations, the cherry-coloured twist used for the outfit and even the festive lurgy that lays the tailor low.As Potter’s Peter Rabbit was recently reinvented as a kind of frathouse bunny in the recent James Corden film, audiences for Wiltshire Creative’s musical production may expect more of a twist than the cherry-coloured variety. But the show sweetens the original, with the tone set by the tailor’s pink-hued, present-lined workshop, which looks more like a Cath Kidston pop-up than the bare room that Potter drew.Verity Quinn’s appealing design for the Playhouse’s Salberg studio has bright cloths hanging from the balcony and even a length of green fabric to convey the mouldy walls of the tailor’s home. It seems Scrooge-like to suggest that a festive children’s show should look a bit bleaker, but the result is that amid such wall-to-wall finery the climactic unveiling of the mayor’s wedding clobber lacks impact.Director Jo Newman’s show has a female tailor, so cheerily played by Lara Stubbs that her straits never seem so dire and the stakes don’t feel that high. But it’s an engaging, likable performance and Jake Mitchell makes a flamboyant flunky to the mayor, while Glyn Kerslake tickles the ivories at a white baby grand in the corner.Gareth Machin and Kerslake’s adaptation recognises that the book’s best character is the crotchety cat Simpkin, with the growly meow and the insatiable appetite for plump mice. Natalie Williams gives us a sly, slinky and deliciously sarcastic Simpkin, who has a paw-licking ode to favourite types of fish. Williams’s cat ears are craftily provided by a bow headband that is part of a bow motif stretching from the design of the tiles to the ribbon tied on the tailor’s shoes.If the script cuts away many of the idiosyncrasies of Potter’s storytelling, it’s nevertheless an easy-to-follow, interactive tale with the cast deftly getting the children involved – at one stage they assemble the mayor’s outfit – and just as deftly responding to their unpredictable interjections. This is an hour that’s jaunty, prettily presented and worth it for the tabby of Gloucester."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1021e20b1e4a9b634b906c0c7340e48e2a357bcf/0_160_4285_2571/master/4285.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=90524c7ca7e5676925fa57ff0bfddfdd","title":"worzel gummidge mackenzie crook returns at christmas with green message","story":"Mackenzie Crook writes and stars in two one-hour specials about kind-hearted scarecrow Worzel Gummidge, the popular and kind-hearted scarecrow character in British children’s fiction, will return to screens this Christmas with a strong and unapologetic message: protect the environment.A children’s television classic since Jon Pertwee portrayed him on ITV between 1979-81, Worzel, the nattily dressed scarecrow of ten acre field, has been rebooted for BBC One by the writer and actor Mackenzie Crook.Two lavishly made one-hour specials will be shown in prime slots over Christmas aimed at the whole family.Crook said he saw the character as a “ of the natural world” and the programmes were an opportunity to write something which was, he hoped, very funny but did have environmental messages. “Hopefully it is very subtly done, not in a preachy way. I don’t want it to be annoying.The two episodes touch on the consequences of the climate crisis as well as plastic pollution. Crook said: “It seems to be the easiest, most visible thing we can start doing, just not using single-use plastic. I can see even in a year or two it will be banned and we won’t be able to believe that we were able to use it.”The programmes do have serious intent but they are also very daft and will appeal to both children and adults. Sir Michael Palin, who plays the Green Man, the creator of all scarecrows, saw the programmes as an “oasis of calm … it is also a lovely oasis to be in because it is warm and friendly and extremely silly”.The programmes are markedly different in tone to so much that is on television at the moment, he said. “It’s usually in your face, fast, high action, noisy … this is calm and you have to listen, take it in and I think the more TV like that the better, really, otherwise we’re just getting everyone shouting for attention.”The films will be shown in the evening on Boxing Day and on 27 December.The creatives who worked with Crook on his BBC Four show Detectorists have teamed up with him again for Worzel Gummidge. The cast includes Steve Pemberton and Rosie Cavaliero as a farming couple who take in two foster children and quickly learn there is more to the wooden scarecrow in the field than meets the eye. Zoe Wanamaker plays an eccentric aristocrat and Vicki Pepperdine plays Aunt Sally, which is a very different role to the one played by Una Stubbs 30 years ago. She is definitely not a love interest.Another difference is that Crook’s Gummidge does not have interchangeable turnip and swede heads. He has one, which is made of wood. His brain is made from conkers.Worzel Gummidge was created in the 1930s by the novelist Barbara Euphan Todd and the first book was published in 1936.“It is an enduring story of fish-out-of-water kids who find a secret and magical friend who leads them on adventures,” said Crook.The books are “of their time but the world and the characters are still there so we brought it up to date and made our own stories”.Crook said he hopes there will be more Gummidge to come. “Adapting Barbara Euphan Todd’s books into these two films has been a joy and I’ve completely fallen for her charming, irreverent scarecrow.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46cdd23c6c9db517f5fede44f60992aa2116cc7b/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a5538f615b18df3d184d402178626c18","title":"us mexico canada trade deal nafta","story":"Pact was agreed more than a year ago but Democrats insisted on major changes to improve enforcement of worker rightsOfficials from Canada, Mexico and the United States have signed a fresh overhaul of a quarter-century-old trade pact that aims to improve enforcement of worker rights and hold down prices for biologic drugs by eliminating a patent provision.The signing ceremony in Mexico City launched what may be the final approval effort for Donald Trump’s three-year quest to revamp the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta), a deal he has blamed for the loss of millions of US manufacturing jobs.The event was attended by Mexico’s president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Canada’s deputy prime minister, Chrystia Freeland, the US trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.The result of a rare show of bipartisan and cross-border cooperation in the Trump era of global trade conflicts, the deal was inked the same day as he became the fourth US president in history to face formal impeachment.Lighthizer called it “a miracle” that actors from across the political spectrum had come together, calling it a testament to the benefits of the deal. López Obrador credited Trump for working with him, while Freeland celebrated a win for multilateralism.“We have accomplished this together at a moment when, around the world, it is increasingly difficult to get trade deals done,” she said.The US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) was signed more than a year ago to replace Nafta, but Democrats controlling the US House of Representatives insisted on major changes to labor and environmental enforcement before bringing it to a vote.Intense negotiations over the past week among Democrats, the Trump administration and Mexico produced more stringent rules on labor rights aimed at reducing Mexico’s low-wage advantage, including verification of labor compliance by independent labor experts.“It is infinitely better than what was initially proposed by the administration,” said the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi.Some Mexican business groups fear that López Obrador and his chief negotiator, the deputy foreign minister, Jesús Seade, have ceded too much, and call the labor verification a violation of Mexican sovereignty.Seade himself, who signed the deal on Tuesday, said some of the changes were reasonable but not necessarily “good for Mexico”.Republican and Democratic US lawmakers say there is broad support for revising the trade pact, which encompasses $1.2tn in annual trade across the continent and supports 12m US jobs and a third of American agricultural exports, backers say.The House ways and means committee chairman, Richard Neal, a Democrat, said he saw no reason for “unnecessary delays” in bringing the trade pact to a vote on the House floor.However, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said the Republican-controlled Senate would not take up the deal before congressional recess, potentially pushing the vote into next year.Trump launched a renegotiation of Nafta in his first year in office, intent on delivering on his 2016 campaign promise to replace what he has derided as the “worst deal ever”. Canadian and Mexican leaders reluctantly agreed to join the negotiations with their largest trading partner.“America’s great USMCA Trade Bill is looking good. It will be the best and most important trade deal ever made by the USA. Good for everybody,” Trump tweeted on Tuesday. “Importantly, we will finally end our Country’s worst Trade Deal, NAFTA!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4cfd72efd715cc1fbb130ba49a2102ab1b3d55b/175_0_2575_1545/master/2575.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f7014af15058eec5c01a32bc424f977","title":"argentina alberto fernandez inauguration","story":"Center-left leader calls for healing as Peronists, including ex-president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, return to powerArgentina’s Peronist leader, Alberto Fernández, has been sworn in as president, marking a shift to the left for Latin America’s third-largest economy as the country fights rampant inflation, credit default fears and rising poverty.The 60-year-old center-left politician took his presidential oath on Tuesday in front of cheering lawmakers, political leaders from the region and representatives from major trade partners including Brazil and the United States.In an hour-long speech, he criticized rising rates of hunger and poverty and said the country needed to revive growth to escape from “virtual default” after a period of painful austerity under the outgoing conservative Mauricio Macri.“We have to heal so many open wounds in our homeland,” he said in the speech in Congress after he had symbolically taken the presidential baton and sash from Macri, whose administration was hit by recession and a spiraling debt crisis.Fernández pledged to bridge social isions and to roll out a “massive” credit system with low rates to bolster domestic demand.“Without bread, there is no present or future. Without bread, life only suffers,” he said.The rise of Fernández marks a return of Argentina’s powerful left-leaning Peronists, including the vice-president, Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, a rock-star populist politician who clashed with investors and farmers during her twin terms as president between 2007-2015.In a move to underscore his man-of-the-people credentials, Fernández had driven himself in his silver Toyota to Congress, waving to crowds lined along the roadside.In the historical Plaza de Mayo square in central Buenos Aires, supporters gathered opposite the Casa Rosada palace, waving banners and beating drums. T-shirts with the face of Fernández de Kirchner read “We’re back”.The new administration is expected to usher in growth-focused policies after unpopular fiscal tightening, which critics warn could strain already depleted state coffers.Fernández picked Martín Guzmán, a young disciple of the Nobel prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, to head the economy ministry last week.“Alberto needs to improve the economic and social situation,” said Verónica Quintana, 34, selling flags in the central square. “There are many people who are hungry and it is a critical situation we are in.“In a reflection of political challenges ahead, Brazil’s rightwing leader, Jair Bolsonaro, who has clashed publicly with Fernández, did not attend, the first time since 2002 a Brazilian president has not attended the inauguration in Buenos Aires.Fernandez will need to balance varied demands of his broad Peronist coalition and pressure from Macri’s weakened, though still influential, party.Political analyst Julio Burdman said this juggling act would be Fernández’s biggest challenge. “He needs to do a rapid maneuver to get the economy started again, which will all depend on how he is able to handle the debt.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8efbc520ac10c584a8e8132ef569ea21c124a56/254_386_3305_1983/master/3305.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=beabfd2ad2f02431aeca2460ccddf63e","title":"the country faces a bright future finland readers on their new pm","story":"We asked readers in Finland to share their thoughts on the country’s new prime minister.

It is supposed to look into the future, think of the welfare of the people. Ella Kivisaari, student, Helsinki, FinlandShe’s going to have a challenging time finding a way to fund government spending and find a path to improving employment. She’s fresh, popular and brings a major improvement in communication skills but also needs to break her ties with her predecessor Antti Rinne to be able to avoid an impression of being a marionette of his. Ilkka Kivi, 48, works in IT, Espoo, FinlandBest choice for prime minister. Our political party has long needed ‘fresh air’. Sanna is very good at speaking in the media and doesn’t hesitate to say her opinion. I’m very pleased. The opposition parties will have to face a lady in parliament and I’m loving it. Finland faces a bright future with Sanna Marin! Teemu Lintumaa, 35, FinlandShe seems competent and will probably do alright, but I would say that her appointment is almost like an act of desperation from her party. The SDP is in a similar downfall such as so many former ruling parties across Europe, with their voter base leaking both to the far-right, far-left and to the greens. She is basically their only politician with star power, and they are now pulling her from the sleeve to save them from oblivion. Whether that will work is yet to be seen, but basically this appointment is about a 20th century party trying to be hip, cool and relevant in the 21st century. Mikko Damskägg, 28, student, HelsinkiI first met Sanna Marin around 10 years ago in an election panel. She stood out from the other panelists in a most positive way, with deep knowledge and formidable arguments. Over the years, she has proven herself as one of Finland’s most apt politicians. I am so very happy and proud that she is our prime minister. Jari Kallio, 46, journalist and teacher, TampereI’m super excited and happy about our new PM! I think she’s starting a whole new chapter in Finnish politics by lifting up some really important values like equality, climate change and solidarity between people. Finland has been led by more or less right-wing politicians for over 15 years and since the actual election things have started to change in Finland for the better. Sanna Marin as our new PM will surely keep our new government in order and work towards the goals set six months ago. To see a young woman rise up to this position makes me really happy. Jarkko Veijanen, 39, project manager for a telephone company, Jyväskylä, FinlandIt’s great to see women and young women on the frontline in politics. We’ve been hailed as a very equal country but even now the comments regarding Marin’s appointment still leave me speechless. Her age, education, experience in both ‘normal jobs’ as well as politics are being questioned and I’m quite sure this wouldn’t have been the case if Antti Lindtman was appointed instead. I’m so disappointed in Finns not even giving her a chance.

I actually had to back off on the power,” he said.McDougall took the plane on a short loop along the Fraser River near Vancouver international airport in front of around 100 onlookers soon after sunrise. The flight lasted less than 15 minutes, according to an AFP journalist on the scene.“Our goal is to actually electrify the entire fleet,” said McDougall.On top of fuel efficiency, the company would save millions in maintenance costs because electric motors require “drastically” less upkeep, Mr McDougall said.However, Harbour Air will have to wait at least two years before it can begin electrifying its fleet of more than 40 seaplanes.The e-plane has to be tested further to confirm it is reliable and safe. In addition, the electric motor must be approved and certified by regulators.In Ottawa, transport minister Marc Garneau said ahead of the maiden flight that he had his “fingers crossed that the electric plane will work well”. If it does, he said: “It could set a trend for more environmentally friendly flying.”Battery power is also a challenge. An aircraft like the one flown on Tuesday could fly only about 160km on lithium battery power, said Ganzarski. While that’s not far, it’s sufficient for the majority of short-haul flights run by Harbour Air.“The range now is not where we’d love it to be, but it’s enough to start the revolution,” said Ganzarski, who predicts batteries and electric motors will eventually be developed to power longer flights.While the world waits, he said cheaper short-haul flights powered by electricity could transform the way people connect and where they work. “If people are willing to drive an hour to work, why not fly 15 minutes to work?” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4111222.1575999682!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new liffey bridge in dublin to cost more than 20m","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tA planning design of the proposed Blood Stoney Bridge. Image: Dublin City CouncilThe first dedicated pedestrian and cycle bridge over the Liffey, which will be located in Dublin’s docklands, will cost in excess of €20 million, Dublin City Council has said. The board rejected the council’s plans for a bridge at the same location earlier this year. However, the council said it hopes changes made to the docklands strategic development zone (SDZ), which are under consideration by the board, will lead it to consider the new bridge more positively.The council had planned to build a €17 million bridge 150m further west connecting the old London and North Western Railway Company station on North Wall Quay to Forbes Street on Sir John Rogerson’s Quay south of the river.The Victorian train station was the planned location of a proposed Dart Underground station for the north docks.In mid-2016 the council deferred development of the bridge on the request of the National Transport Authority to allow a review of the Dart Underground plans.Underground stationsThe 7.6km rail line, which was to link Heuston Station to the Dart line, with underground stations at the north docks, Pearse Station, St Stephen’s Green, Christ Church and Heuston, was shelved by the Fine Gael-Labour government in 2011. While it re-emerged in the Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2035, the underground was not included in the 10-year National Development Plan published in 2018.However, as the proposed bridge would run over the reservation strip for the line, the council decided it would be best to move it 150m to the east.But last January the board refused permission for the relocation. It said it believed the original location was “appropriate” owing to its position on a “clear desire line for pedestrians and cyclists between north and south of the river Liffey”.Direct connectionIn the longer term, the board said the Forbes Street bridge would offer the potential of a direct connection from the south of the river to a “ future Dart Underground commuter rail station” at North Wall Quay.“The board considered that, notwithstanding the technical and cost arguments put forward in support of relocation, the existing approved position for the Forbes Street bridge would better serve the interests and amenities of the area in the long term, and would accord with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area.” However, councillors were on Monday told changes to the docklands plan would make a positive decision by the board more likely. However, they were also told the cost of the bridge at the new location was expected to exceed €20 million, the threshold that requires the council to undertake a cost benefit analysis. The council still expected to make a fresh application to the board early in the new year and hopes the bridge will open in 2023."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4111300.1576002910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"plans to build 512 apartments in howth lodged with bord plean%C3%A1la","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tAn  image of the proposed development at the former Techrete site in Howth,  Co Dublin. Image: courtesy Marlet. Plans to build more than 500 apartments in Howth, Co Dublin, have been lodged with Bord Pleanála.The application, which lists costs of €135 million, is the fourth attempt to redevelop the derelict former Techrete factory site near the village’s Dart station.The 512 units sought in the application is substantially higher than in previous efforts to build on the site, which have been met by objections from locals concerned about the heavy traffic already experienced in the area.The application was lodged by Atlas, a subsidiary of developer Marlet, under strategic planning rules, which means it bypasses Fingal County Council and goes straight to the board.The proposed development includes a gross floor area of 48,252sq m on a 2.68 hectare site. It would include 512 mainly one- and two-bed apartments in blocks totalling eight storeys in height, with 439 parking spaces and 1,335 bike spaces.The plan also includes a publicly accessible walkway and cycleway to the north of the site, a civic plaza, a landscaped park and communal gardens. The commercial aspect includes a 1,705sq m anchor unit, a restaurant, a retail unit and a café.Regarding pressures on schools, Atlas says the development “could give rise to” 72 children of primary school age and 48 of secondary school age.“However, it is very unlikely that the numbers will be that high. It is anticipated that a far higher percentage of the development will be single people, pre-family couples and empty-nest families.”CommunitySocial Democrats councillor Cian O’Callaghan said there was support locally for the development of the derelict site but it must make a “positive contribution” to the community.“The understandable concerns of the local community about how these latest proposals to intensify development at the site will impact on the village character of Howth and traffic congestion must be addressed.”A spokesman for Marlet said urban development required a “delicate balance” between the required car parking and integration into established traffic flows “while at the same time following national policy towards reducing car-usage and utilising existing public transport”.“We were very conscious of this in making this application,” he said."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4110645.1575968774!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland has third highest quality of life in world says un report","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tIreland has a life expectancy of 82 years.

Photograph: ITVPA WireBoris Johnson’s claim that checks will not be needed on goods travelling between Northern Ireland and Britain under the terms of his Brexit deal have been rejected by Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney. Mr Coveney said inspections would have to take place on goods moving in both directions under the terms of the withdrawal agreement the British prime minister struck with the European Union. Mr Johnson has been accused of lying to voters on the issue ahead of Thursday’s general election after repeatedly saying that there would be no checks as the North would remain part of the UK customs territory. He subsequently said there would be some, but these would apply only to items destined for the Republic.DUP leader Arlene Foster yesterday said that before the latest version of the deal was announced in October, she and her deputy Nigel Dodds were informed by British Revenue and Customs that goods coming from Britain to the North would face customs checks under the agreement. ChecksSpeaking in Brussels, Mr Coveney said: “Goods coming from Great Britain into Northern Ireland will need to have some checks to ensure that the EU knows what is potentially coming into their market through Northern Ireland.“Goods going the other way from NI into Great Britain will have far less requirement for checks at all . . . The British government has indicated that they want frictionless or unfettered access for goods originating in Northern Ireland going into the rest of the UK single market.” Mr Coveney also cast doubt on the likelihood of a deal on the future relationship between the EU and the UK being hammered out before the end of next year during the Brexit transition period. “That’s possible but there’s an awful lot to do in a relatively short space of time if that is to be achieved,” he said. Former British attorney general Dominic Grieve yesterday told The  that Mr Johnson is “simply not telling the truth” when he claims that there will be no checks on the Irish Sea after Brexit. Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell agreed with Ms Foster that Mr Johnson’s claims on the issue could not be trusted. Mr Johnson yesterday faced accusations that he is uncaring after he refused to look at a photograph of a four-year-old boy forced to sleep on the floor of an overcrowded hospital emergency department. Questioned about the incident during a visit to Sunderland, Mr Johnson took ITV reporter Joe Pike’s phone and put it in his pocket rather than look at the picture.The photograph, first published by the Daily Mirror, showed Jack Williment-Barr, who was thought to have pneumonia, lying on a pile of coats on the floor at Leeds General Hospital with an oxygen mask at his side because all beds were occupied.Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021“At Drax, even without carbon capture, only 32 per cent of the power generated ends up as useful energy,” said Ms\u0026nbspErnsting.\u0026nbsp“That’s already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up as quickly and effectively as Drax has claimed.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects.“We don’t know exactly what the solvent is, how it is produced and how environmentally friendly it is because it is a trade secret,” said Professor Ocone.\u0026nbspA further problem is the cost. Drax said on Tuesday it would not be able to go carbon negative unless it is handed more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show

The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer. From crate digger space-funk to dance floor ecstasy (and a Bryan Ferry feature), It’s Album Time is endlessly replayable: a perfectly formed confection that requires no sequel. (JM)There’s a kind of telepathy that develops when a band spends as much time together as Big Thief. The indie-rock band’s second album in the space of five months (the first being UFOF), was described as the “earth twin” and, indeed, they sound utterly grounded – to each other, and to their surroundings in the arid Chihuahuan Desert of Texas, near the Mexico border. In contrast to her fragile performance on UFOF, here Adrianne Lenker sings in lusty whoops and calls on “Forgotten Eyes”, while “Not”, the record’s dark, brooding soul, caterwauls with feedback screeches and a merciless, two-minute guitar solo that leaves you simultaneously devastated and enthralled. (RO)1150 40) Christine and the Queens – Chaleur Humaine (2014)On her electropop-laden debut – the UK release of which meanders between French and English – Heloise Letissier explores the lonelinesses and triumphs of being queer. On “Saint Claude”, she steals glimpses of a feminine boy being mocked on a Paris bus, too ashamed to step in. On “Tilted”, she is newly defiant. “I am actually good, can’t help it if we’re tilted.” (AP)Inspired by the “icy altitudes” of Joni Mitchell’s open-tuned confessionals, the dubstep producer took singer-songwriting into a compelling new landscape of minimalist clicks and autotuned emotion. He sang of “testing sounds For the deaf and the forest cold” and now describes his sparse, graceful debut as “a fractured diary” reflecting “a lack of something”. (HB)In 2016, the UK was in chaos. The EU referendum produced a shock result, David Cameron resigned as prime minister, and the arguing began, as a new harder-right politics emerged. The future felt bleak. In the midst of all this, Skepta – always wary of institutions – poured gasoline over the whole mess and lit a match. Konnichiwa is an album heavy with contempt for authority a sizzling brew of jungle, UK garage and dancehall into which he pours all of his anger, frustration, fear and suspicion. (RO)Where 2008’s For Emma, Forever Ago was an exercise in sparse, solipsistic introspection, Justin Vernon’s follow-up is the sound of a man setting himself free and fully embracing the depths of his imagination. Less hermetically sealed than his debut, it\u0027s exquisite in every way, with Vernon’s soulful falsetto woven into a gorgeous patchwork of jazz, folk, ambient and electronica. He would add more autotune to his voice on later albums here it’s just perfect. (PS)There’s a glorious elasticity of both sound and spirit to the Norwegian singer-songwriter’s seventh album. Gone is the feathery folk of her early releases as she flings open the doors to big timpani, hip hop rhythms and liquid Eighties bass lines. Lyrically, she celebrated the suffragettes and her own possibilities in the face of chronic illness. (HB)A solo album from The xx’s most elusive member was the subject of rumour for a good few years the reality was better than fans could have hoped for. In Colour is a lovingly crafted tribute to the rave a kaleidoscope of beats and pulsing synths that stitch together the many moods you can find on the dancefloor, from the ecstasy of a drop to the melancholy of knowing the night must, at some point, come to an end. (RO)1750 34) Mitski – Be the Cowboy (2018)Upon the release of Be the Cowboy, Mitski described how she had “f***ed with the form, almost in ways that make me uncomfortable” – hardly surprising for an artist whose songs pivot between lullaby-like calm and reckless, scuzzy urgency. Her fifth album sits to the left of just about every box you might try to put it in, those signature distorted guitars joined by bright, bold synths, organs and show-tune pianos. Lead single “Nobody”, with its almost aggressive vulnerability, is a masterpiece. (AP)Three albums in, Kacey Musgraves worried that falling in love with her husband would affect her music. “I was a little wary,” she told The Independent last year. “I was like, ‘Man, I wonder if I’m gonna be able to write.’” She needn’t have worried. With synths and Daft Punk guitar licks added into the mix, her fourth album, which she dubbed “cosmic country”, is rich and ambitious with a subtle, psychedelic gloss, winning the Grammy for Album of the Year. (AP)For three decades, Björk has weathered professional belittlement, abuse and tragedy, always reiterating herself in song, as if it were normal to absorb so much. On Vulnicura, recorded amid a scrappy breakup, the Icelandic virtuoso snapped. Monstrous ballads meet shattered beats and siren strings, a cyclone propelled by the wisdom of age. When the dust settles, she sounds reborn. (JM)A breathtakingly brave and graceful testament from the ultimate survivor of patriarchal rock. Romance and realism, love and fear are held in perfect tension as the 71-year-old conjures shimmering myths of ye olde England, then tells a friend: “I do understand why you want no more f***ing treatment.” (HB)2150 30) These New Puritans – Field of Reeds (2013)With 2010’s Hidden, These New Puritans fashioned dancehall and medieval heraldry into pop overtures. They re-emerged with something improbably subtle: a dreamscape shorn of excess pomp, beats and even consonants, with Jack Barnett’s voice remade as an instrument. Amid ineffable neoclassical, his shy croak elevates the record, the sound of a doomed romantic awash in the music of the heavens. (JM)Released before Trump’s election and the Brexit vote, there was a dark prescience to this gleefully disruptive blast of electronica. Anohni jettisoned the gorgeous chamber pop which had brought her critical acclaim to make a radical ecofeminist wake-up call about the horrors of the violent patriarchy, drone warfare and global warming. (HB)2350 28) Joanna Newsom – Have One on Me (2010)Newsom’s third album – an elaborate, six-sided odyssey whose musical palette blends harp, tambura and kaval with drums and electric guitars – heralded a noticeable change in her voice. The removal of vocal cord nodules had shaved the edges off its trill, and its new deeper, fuller sound suited an album as intricate and aching as this. “I found a little plot of land In the Garden of Eden,” she sings on one of its best tracks, “81”, seemingly poised on the edge of religious reverence. “It was dirt, and dirt is all the same.” (AP)“Why did you cut the flower that makes me a woman?” sings the Malian artist on “Boloko”, the first African song to address female genital mutilation. Immigration and forced adoption are also challenged on a culture-shifting debut that brings a rare sweetness to the protest genre. The sensual power of Diawara’s lullsome voice and her shimmering guitar patterns remain hypnotic. (HB)As “deconstructed club music” became a buzzword, electronic artists considered how to reassemble the pieces. One pitch for how that might sound – somehow futuristic yet familiar – came from Venezuelan producer Arca. The Björk and FKA twigs collaborator’s third album relaunched her zero-gravity sound world with a secret weapon: the bruised, disarmingly operatic voice of an angel in hell. (JM)On his 69th birthday, two days before his death, David Bowie released perhaps the most extreme album of his career. Blackstar is more alien than Ziggy as inscrutable as the deepest corners of the universe. He refuses to go quietly, whether making a joyous racket on “’Tis a Pity She Was a Whore” or adding eerie buzzes and whines to album closer “I Can’t Give Everything Away” where, faced with the nearness of his own death, Bowie engages in a final tussle with his own myth. (RO)Earlier this year, Adele announced that she had split from her husband Simon Konecki. While some sympathised, others rejoiced at the brilliant break-up album that was surely on the cards. “Bunch of f***ing savages,” she joked in response to those gleeful fans. “30 will be a drum ’n’ bass record to spite you.” Cruel though it was, there was a reason for the gleeful reaction – Adele sings of heartbreak like nobody else. And never better than on 21, a sad, soulful masterpiece which on these shores is the best-selling album of the century. (AP)The French electronic pioneers brought funk back for the summer of 2013 with an album drawing heavily on the sounds of the Seventies and Eighties. Pretty much everything you need to know is in the opening salvo “Give Life Back to Music” Daft Punk tend to pop up at times where other artists are grasping frantically for something new. Random Access Memories restarted the party with good old-fashioned craftmanship and Le Daft’s undiluted love for what they do. (RO)It is striking that Lana Del Rey – the greatest artist of her generation – creates art full of meaningful observations about men and women that are deeply unfashionable outside of an Esther Perel podcast. Del Rey desires to be desired she likes it when her man makes her feel like a child she wants to die. The longing for unconsciousness is still present in NFR (I’m the void, she sings on Mariners Apartment Complex) but her most playful record to date is as close to a celebration of her world-conquering status as you are ever likely to hear. (PS)Tiptoeing to the bleeding heart of Steven’s relationship with his schizophrenic, alcoholic mother, this is an album that faces difficult truths with hushed grace. The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. Nils Frahm’s music feels most alive when you’re witnessing it in concert, so it makes sense that Spaces, a collection of field recordings made over two years, is his most immersive and dynamic. The shifting energy is due to how no single performance is ever the same the one constant is the German composer’s joy in creating sound, and the spaces in between. (RO)“I have learnt, when things are beautiful, to just keep on,” confides Callahan on the most laconic and nuanced album of his career. Warm grains of flute and fiddle run through the rich country soul. Masterful, minimalist storytelling guides us through summers spent painting boats and long nights in hotel bars. (HB)Twelve years after Arctic Monkeys released a debut album that shook the British rock scene out of its doldrums, the Sheffield boy wonders came up with this: a concept album about a luxury lunar resort that surgically removed the blues influences on AM and replaced them with lounge jazz and absurdist lyrics. It upset fans who wanted more of the same, and yet, frontman Alex Turner’s musical and lyrical meanderings mark one of the boldest moves by any rock band in recent memory. (RO)Richard Dawson was once a heart-on-sleeve singer-songwriter, but by 2014, the Geordie’s outré folk had made him Britain’s leading avant-bard. On his breakthrough LP, malevolent instrumentals bookend a pair of 16-minute epics, bending from the ambitiously autobiographical title track to “The Vile Stuff”, a delirious tale of a boozy school trip gone awry. (JM)550 46) Julia Holter – Have You in My Wilderness (2015)Refreshing as summer rain, the avant-garde – and occasionally difficult – Californian artist’s fourth album sees melodies splashing merrily from her keyboard. Her pretty, literate vocals spin playful mysteries of faceless lovers in raincoats and strange women on remote shores. “It’s lucidity!” Holter teased. “So clear!” A ludic, lucid dream of a record. (HB)Sky Ferreira did it her way. After years of label disputes about image and musical direction, the Californian finally decided to put her own modelling money towards financing her debut record, 2013’s Night Time, My Time. And what a record it is: melding Eighties pop with alternative rock, it brims with a wild vivacity, as squelching synths come up against gnashing guitars, vulnerable lyrics and often distorted vocals. “Everything is Embarrassing”, produced by Dev Hynes, is one of the songs of the decade. (PS)Combining rumbustious soul-rock with swampy blues grit, this four-piece from Athens, Alabama, were one of the most exciting sounds of 2012 thanks to their humdinger of a debut album. Gutsy and unrefined, Boys \u0026amp Girls is indebted to a bygone era but somehow feels fresh. It’s underpinned by powerhouse frontwoman Brittany Howard’s astonishing voice – capable of both a piercing falsetto or a guttural roar. Barack Obama would subsequently invite the band to play at the White House. (PS)When the documentarians of the future make films about the UK in the 2010s, you can bet they’ll put Michael Ebenazer Kwadjo Omari Owuo Jr on the soundtrack. The charismatic grime MC is bursting with all the self-aware anger, humour, confusion, vulnerability and creativity of his generation in multicultural urban Britain. (HB)After a run of spellbinding singles, the Norse disco maverick released this synthesis of the frivolous and cinematic: an album so casually virtuosic it seemed to have dropped out of an alien supercomputer.

The featherlight folk acquires a remarkable bioluminescence, as the artist finds hope in “signs and wonders, sea lion caves in the dark”. (HB)ANTI’s botched rollout – Rihanna was teasing the record for years before a leak prompted a hasty free release – seems strangely fitting for an album as joyfully scattershot and unrefined as this. Dark dancehall sounds flirt with hip hop and R\u0026ampB, as the Bajan singer embraces her roots and slyly rebels against the pop tropes du jour. (AP)Having released arguably the Noughties’ defining rock album in Funeral, the Montreal six-piece began this decade with a record bathed in nostalgia. Loosely inspired by frontman Win Butler and his brother Will’s childhood on the outskirts of Houston, The Suburbs has much in common with Bruce Springsteen’s Born in the USA, with its themes of familial responsibility and personal crises. The sound is expansive there are lyrical and musical motifs throughout. If 2007’s Neon Bible was a little portentous and po-faced, this album offers moments of levity in tracks such as the shimmering synth-pop masterpiece Sprawl II. Nothing they’ve done since has been as good.St Vincent, AKA Annie Clark, has a tagline for each of her albums. This one, her third, was “housewives on pills”, though that does little justice to a record that marries uncomfortable intimacy with a cool detachment, its obtuse stories of grief, loss and lust told through angular art-rock, frenzied guitar solos and bold melodies. (AP)When his 15-year-old son died in 2015, Cave thought public grieving would be “impossible”. But he found unexpected relief in sharing his feelings with his fans. This ambient double album plays like a warm cloud of solace: direct about the agony and inevitability of loss, in awe of the love that helps us survive it.  (HB)Red is the last album Swift released before it became impossible to discuss her work without mentioning the narrative around her as a person, not just an artist. Her turn of phrase – already impressive for an artist so young – improves immeasurably from opener “State of Grace” and leads the listener to the greatest song of her career to date: “All Too Well”. The analogies and references are less spelt out, too. Then there’s the song structure, the way these songs unfurl as she dissects – with scientific scrutiny – the most intimate details of a relationship, in order to find out where it all went wrong. Red shows Swift with a newfound confidence – and at times, weariness – that can only come with experience. (RO)Brilliantly confounding, Blond keeps the spotlight fixed firmly on its creator’s voice. Tracks are stripped of any unnecessary embellishment, anything that might distract from Ocean’s hypnotic musings on love, sex and death. “Every day counts like crazy,” he sings on “Skyline To” – few lyrics capture quite so well the suffocating feeling of being dragged through life at breakneck speed. Blond is far less cohesive than its predecessor, Channel Orange, but does that really matter? Life is messy and confusing Ocean makes all of it sound beautiful. (RO)A passing comment in a New Yorker profile about being “ready to die” forced Leonard Cohen to tell fans that reports of his imminent death had been hugely exaggerated. Yet the album he was promoting, You Want It Darker, is as powerful a last testament as any artist could hope to release Cohen’s weary utterances – “I’m ready, my Lord” – are delivered in that fathomless baritone, and his meditations on mortality are bleak, even for him. The fact that Cohen did in fact die just three weeks after its release makes those themes, although it didn’t seem possible at the time, even more poignant. (RO)3850 13) Solange – When I Get Home (2019)The decade’s second great Solange album churns several deformed, jazzy aesthetics – including Brainfeeder’s gloopy electro-funk and the concoctions of DJ Screw – into a lustrous cloud of R\u0026ampB. The result hints at Seventies soul voyagers like Stevie Wonder yet retains its future-shock, celebrating Houston futurism without pandering to fans of its explicitly political predecessor. (JM)The spooky piano and PJ Harvey’s keening howls on the opening, title track of her eighth studio album are enough to signal this album isn’t a barrel of laughs. Yet her finely wrought arrangements – echoing guitars, beautiful melodies and samples that wrongfoot the listener with their cheerfulness – form a superb kind of juxtaposition with the album’s themes. Across 12 brisk tracks, she casts a despairing eye over everything from the conflict in Afghanistan to the mass casualties of the First World War she sings in a kind of pleading tone, all the while knowing that humans are doomed to repeat the mistakes of the past. (RO)West has always been a complicated, isive, frustrating sort of genius. Never is that more on display than on My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, a maximalist, genre-crushing album that looks both outwards and inwards – self-aware even in its most crowing moments – it breaks apart the myth of the American Dream. “The system broken, the school is closed, the prison’s open,” he sings on “Power”, one of the best protest songs of the century. Later, he adds, “They say I was the abomination of Obama’s nation Well that’s a pretty bad way to start a conversation.” So far, West has yet to write anything half as sharp about Trump’s nation. (AP)Robyn’s magnum opus barely even charted when it was first released at the dawn of the decade. It’s almost a compilation album of the three great EPs she released in one year, Body Talk Pt 1, Pt 2 and Pt 3. But, nearly 10 years on, it is rightly one of the most influential pop albums of the 21st century. Every popstar tries (and mostly fails) to emulate the silky dance-and-cry beauty of songs such as “Dancing on My Own” and “Call Your Girlfriend”. (AP)4250 9) A Tribe Called Quest – We Got it From Here... Thank You 4 Your Service (2016)After an 18-year break – and within months of co-founder Phife Dawg’s death – there were mixed expectations for ATCQ’s return. It arrived in the hubbub of election week, but the group rode into the melee like angry gods on horseback, firing out thunderous rebukes. The hip-hop odyssey delivers America’s existential reckoning, one equally suited to street protests or a recuperative headphone voyage. (JM)When you experience your first heartbreak, you feel as though you’re the only person to have ever felt pain like it. On Melodrama, written when New Zealand musician Lorde was 19 and on the cusp of adulthood, she indulges her heartache, grief, and self-pity with both tenderness and reckless abandon. This is pop music at its most precise – every synth and drumbeat fired off like a bullet from a sniper – but at its most unbound, too, finding brutal, beautiful new ways to sing about the most saturated of subjects: breaking up. (AP)Kendrick has always been a superb storyteller, but the Pulitzer Prize-winning DAMN is his odyssey, an album where he presents evidence of his greatness via a series of challenges: tests of loyalty, will, faith and perseverance. It’s an epic punctuated by schizophrenic changes in pace and track structure all the while Kendrick raps as though he doesn’t need oxygen, and you realise his greatest battle has never been with his fans, or another rapper… he’s competing against himself. (RO)After hit album Voodoo, D’Angelo almost died by various means, including addiction and a car crash. Fifteen years on, its follow-up arrived suddenly one Christmas: a grungy, deathly reanimation of the sexy, Soulquarian R\u0026ampB he helped pioneer. Its #BlackLivesMatter-referencing lyrics reveal a man renewed yet still fluttering in the crosswinds of passion and vulnerability. (JM)When footage leaked of Solange Knowles hitting and kicking Jay Z in an elevator at the 2014 Met Gala, word was that the rapper had cheated on his wife, and was receiving the full force of her sister’s wrath. Two years later, Beyoncé seemed to confirm the affair as only she could: not with a statement, but with an astonishing concept album and accompanying 65-minute film. Dipping into genres as though they’re a dressing-up box, the singer traverses the whole spectrum of emotions as she grapples with the betrayal: “My lonely ear pressed against the walls of your world,” she sings on opener “Pray You Catch Me”. “Suck on my balls I’ve had enough,” she sings on “Sorry”. (AP)A few days before this album’s release, Frank Ocean released a Tumblr post where he spoke about how, aged 19, he fell in love with his friend, a boy. At the time, many interpreted the letter to mean Ocean was coming out as bisexual, when in fact he has never felt a need to put a label on his sexuality. Channel Orange’s ever-shifting nature – the lolloping bass and his meanderings between that exquisite falsetto and richer timbres – is a beautiful statement about the paradoxes we can find in our own identity. (RO)4850 3) Lana Del Rey – Born to Die (2012)It’s easy to forget that before Lana Del Rey came along – back when Billie Eilish was barely in double figures – lo-tempo sad-pop was not the chart-hogging phenomenon it is today. Born to Die, a minimalist masterpiece, languid and lachrymose, changed that. The month of its release, a shaky performance on SNL prompted naysayers to write the singer off as a flash-in-the-pan, but the album – full of beauty, gloom and strange subservience – had staying power. As did Del Rey.  (AP)4950 2) Solange – A Seat at the Table (2016)Solange’s third album is so meticulous, so modernist in its approach to space and structure, that early listens could feel like walking admiringly around an exhibition. Then the lights go out, and a distant scream draws you into the shadows. Anguish is the true pitch of this quiet masterpiece, yet it’s impossibly graceful: an R\u0026ampB battle cry of black art against white supremacy. (JM)By 2015, Kendrick Lamar was already a grandmaster stylist. But with To Pimp a Butterfly, the Compton rapper became a cultural institution, as if summoned by the decade’s converging flash points. There was the murmur of creeping fascism, the roar of a re-energised black rights movement, and its roots in racist police shootings broadcast and protested across an infernal social media landscape. In a statement published on\u0026nbspher Instagram, Cornell wrote: “This was not the way I would have chosen to move forward. But I will not be pushed aside for someone else’s convenience or gain.“I will not sacrifice our children’s futures for someone else’s greed. And I will not let someone else make me feel shame because the man I loved was taken from all of us too soon.”Metallica, Soundgarden and more perform at Chris Cornell tribute showChris Cornell’s widow sues the rock star’s doctor over his deathChris Cornell’s daughter releases duet in moving tribute She continued:\u0026nbsp“I will do justice by my husband’s work and memory for our children and for everything we stood for. I want to thank everyone who has stood by Chris and has supported us through this devastating time. Your love and your kindness will never be forgotten.”Cornell was found dead in a Detroit hotel room on 18 May, 2017. A coroner ruled that the cause of death was suicide.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Drax imports much of its wood from as far as North Carolina, while coal is available on its doorstep.\u0026nbspCapturing the carbon released when biomass is burnt\u0026nbspalso has its problems, said Almuth Ernsting, a campaigner for Biofuelwatch. “Drax has been talking about carbon capture for a long time. But it’s not proven that this technology can work at scale when combined with biomass.”Only the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailDrax currently removes around one ton\u0026nbspof CO2 per day but plans to scale this up to 16 million tons a year.One of the largest carbon-capture projects in the world, Boundary Dam in Saskatchewan, uses 31 per cent of all the energy it produces to collect CO2 and store it.UK will get by far its biggest carbon capture plant in 2021“At Drax, even without carbon capture, only 32 per cent of the power generated ends up as useful energy,” said Ms\u0026nbspErnsting.\u0026nbsp“That’s already pretty inefficient and it would become even less so if you add carbon capture, meaning you have to cut down and burn a lot of trees.”“If you increase logging that is not good for the climate. It is completely unsustainable.”\u0026nbspRaffaella Ocone, professor of chemical engineering at Heriot-Watt University, also questioned whether carbon capture could be scaled up as quickly and effectively as Drax has claimed.“I welcome that something is being done because we are in an emergency,” said Professor Ocone. “But it is unclear how long they would need before they can operate at full capture capacity and utilise the CO2 captured.”She pointed out a further environmental problem being\u0026nbspthe solvent chemicals\u0026nbspused to separate CO2 from other gases and allowing it to be stored. Many of these chemicals are corrosive and can cause environmental damage, but Drax says\u0026nbspits solvent is safer than those used in other\u0026nbspprojects.“We don’t know exactly what the solvent is, how it is produced and how environmentally friendly it is because it is a trade secret,” said Professor Ocone.\u0026nbspA further problem is the cost. Drax said on Tuesday it would not be able to go carbon negative unless it is handed more government subsidies after existing ones run out in 2027.Created with Sketch.Environment news in pictures Show

instead of coal. “That money should be going to genuinely zero-carbon energy,” said Ms Ernsting.Greenpeace UK’s chief scientist, Doug Parr, said governments and businesses had a very poor record so far on making biomass work for large-scale energy production.“Decades of inaction by heavy polluters, such as Drax, has left us in a state where more drastic action is needed to tackle the nature emergency as well as the climate emergency,” he said.\u0026nbsp“Carbon capture with biomass remains speculative and cannot be used as an excuse to carry on with business as usual.\u0026nbsp“Any action

Should the world\u0027s second largest phone maker be forced to introduce it to new devices, third party apps\u0026nbspwould also then be required to create\u0026nbspnew versions of their apps that are\u0026nbspcompatible with the software.In August, Chinese media reported that a new Huawei\u0026nbspphone running the HarmonyOS software would be introduced before the end of the year.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Apple has specifically stressed that the aim of the computer is for it to be modular, allowing people to include the expensive, powerful\u0026nbspcomponents they need and not pay for the parts they don\u0027t.It is also likely that anyone spending near the top of the range for the computer will be doing so for a business.

Against the backdrop of the battle against climate change, McEwan tells the story of middle-aged Nobel laureate Michael Beard, a self-serving physicist whose own world is in danger of meltdown. (MC)340 Manning Marable – Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention (2011)Columbia University professor Manning Marable died on 1 April 2011, just days before the publication of his Pulitzer Prize-winning biography Malcolm X: A Life of Reinvention.

The book cuts through the myths to reveal Malcolm X in all his conflicted complexity. (MC)440 . Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey – She Said (2019)They wrote the story that changed the world and now they’ve explained how they did it. In She Said, the Pulitzer Prize-winning duo explain how they managed to barge through Hollywood’s ironclad gates and break the Weinstein story, publishing allegations from several women accusing the disgraced producer of sexual assault in The New York Times. While the details are sparse in terms of sources and specific tactics, there are some startling revelations, including how Gwyneth Paltrow became a helping hand and the extreme lengths Weinstein’s team went to in order to thwart both reporters and silence the alleged victims. (OP)Future Sex is perhaps one of the few nonfiction books about sex and relationships that came before #MeToo and somehow remains relevant today. Finding herself suddenly single at the age of 30, Witt immerses herself in the sexual subcultures of San Francisco, trying her hand at everything from polyamory to orgasmic meditation. It’s a fascinating piece of work, one that illustrates Witt’s talents as an essayist and gives plenty of room to many astute observations on sexual liberation. (OP)Every now and then a book comes along that tilts your perspective on the world. This internationally best-selling phenomenon is one of them. Covering just about the entire sweep of human history, it makes you understand the fits, starts and savagery of progress. (CR)The Girls is about exploring the appeal of being in a cult. Inspired by Charles Manson’s murderous “family”, the book serves up a more tense, richer depiction than Quentin Tarantino’s Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, one that puts women at the centre, examining what motivates and captivates them. (OP)840 Marlon James: A Brief History of Seven Killings (2014)The Booker-winning A Brief History of Seven Killings, by Jamaican-born Marlon James, follows the lives and deaths of seven of the would-be killers in the failed 1976 assassination attempt on Bob Marley. The novel cleverly weaves fiction and fact – and the language has a musical rhythm. Some of the epiphanies in the book are linked to songs. (MC)Terminal illness and bankruptcy shouldn’t make for an inspiring read but they somehow do in Raynor Winn’s poetic, provocative memoir. After losing the family home, Win and her husband set out to walk the South West Coast path, shaking a fist at his grim diagnosis. It’s as much a meditation on the power of nature as 1040 Nina Stibbe – Love, Nina: Despatches from Family Life (2013)There’s deadpan and then there’s Nina Stibbe, who proves herself the heir to Adrian Mole in this novel written in the form of letters to her sister from a child-minding job in London. A provincial girl grappling with the strange salads of the metropolitan literary elite, Stibbe is comic gold. (CR) The assassins Eli and Charlie Sisters were played by John C Reilly and Joaquin Phoenix in the film version of Canadian-born writer Patrick deWitt’s second novel. The narrator Eli captures the lawless, unpredictable nature of frontier life in the mid-19th century. The Sisters Brothers is a compelling, unsettling tale of the Gold Rush era. (MC)Every office has its misfit, and this is the funny, deeply touching story of a woman whose aversion to social niceties and the work Christmas lunch hides a traumatic past. Common acts of kindness rekindle the protagonist in this beautifully told debut. (CR)Anna Burns became the first writer from Northern Ireland to win the Man Booker Prize, when she triumphed with The Milkman in 2018. Burns’s challenging, intriguing novel presents an unnamed 18-year-old girl’s perspective of her life during the Troubles in the Seventies. The 41-year-old paramilitary leader known as “the Thanks to Margaret Atwood and the state of the world, feminist dystopian fiction is having a moment and Sophie Mackintosh’s The Water Cure is a notable contribution to the genre. It is perhaps one of the most creative of additions, cleverly weaving mystery and murder with sex and sisterhood, all while Mackintosh seduces the reader into her Shakespearean realm. (OP)1540 Anne Tyler – A Spool of Blue Thread (2015)Anne Tyler is a master of stories about family life in middle-class America. A Spool of Blue Thread, the 20th novel from the author of The Accidental Tourist, adroitly shines a light on sibling rivalry, family secrets and the wounding power of grief. Her tale of four generations of the Whitshanks demonstrates again her gift for comic detail. (MC)The Green Road, by Dublin-born Anne Enright, is set in County Clare, a wild place geographically and emotionally. Enright’s keen gift for observation is at play in this family saga based around Hanna, Dan, Constance and Emmet’s Christmas return to the home that their scary matriarch, Rosaleen, is selling. A funny, painful tale of selfishness and compassion. (MC)1740 Amor Towles – A Gentleman in Moscow (2016)The gentleman in question is Count Rostov, a bon vivant and aristocrat placed under house arrest in a fancy Moscow hotel after the communists seize control. His wit and enduring humanity make this charming, quirky novel sing. (CR)When fact meets fiction, the result is almost always fascinating as the reader spends hours trying to discern which is which. Such is the appeal of The Idiot, Elif Batuman’s debut novel, which tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a young woman studying at Harvard in the mid-Nineties. After pontificating on the purpose of email, she soon becomes obsessed with an enigmatic Hungarian student whose insouciance will leave you spinning in a state of total frustration. (OP)Nobel Prize winner Orhan Pamuk’s 10th novel was the short, stunning The Red-Haired Woman, which is at once a fable and a gripping tale of youthful obsession, exploring protagonist Cem Celik’s desire for the red-haired, enigmatic member of a theatre troupe. The father-son relationship in the novel also allows Pamuk to deftly explore the changing nature of Turkey. (MC)A dazzling insight into the mind of one of The New Yorker’s most prolific writers, Ariel Levy’s memoir will seem relatable to all those who have at one time or another felt a startling sense of dissociation from their life, which is probably most of us. Levy’s personal tragedies will leave readers reeling. There is one passage in particular that will stay with you for months in which Levy describes how she suffered a miscarriage on a hotel room floor while on an assignment in Mongolia. She was 19 weeks pregnant at the time and her son, born alive, died in her arms. It is a story of resilience to the highest degree. (OP)Lila was the third novel in Marilynne Robinson’s Gilead Chronicles – following Gilead (2004) and Home (2008) – and tells, in unflinching terms, the story of Lila, the young woman who married the elderly Reverend Ames in a dusty Iowa town. Robinson writes beautifully and, as a sophisticated religious thinker, asks searching questions about faith and doubt. (MC)There are few writers as gloriously strange, acerbic, funny and faintly ruthless as Sedaris, who once again mines his family history in this collection of autobiographical short stories. It includes a tale in which he feeds his Both a love story and a look at how racial ides play out in the UK and the USA, Americanah is as enchanting as it is thought-provoking. It’s impossible not to root for Ifemelu, the clever Nigerian ingenue who ends up struggling to find a minimum wage job as she studies in America. (CR)2440 Julian Barnes – The Sense of an Ending (2011)Julian Barnes’s novella The Sense of an Ending is a subtle examination of the search for answers to life’s unresolved relationships. The orced sexagenarian protagonist Tony Webster, is thrown into emotional turmoil when he receives an unexpected bequest that prompts him to reconnect with a college girlfriend. He is forced to face up to “the accumulation, the multiplication, of loss”. (MC)No matter how many documentaries you watch or books you read on Mormonism, it’s almost impossible to understand such a community from the outside. Tara Westover opened people’s eyes with Educated, explaining how she went from growing up in a Mormon fundamentalist family in Idaho to studying for a PhD at the University of Cambridge. It’s an inspiring story of grit and determination that doubles up as an homage to the power of self-education and, well, reading. (OP)Few things reinforce tired gender clichés like marriage and parenthood, so huzzah for Maggie Nelson with this subversive memoir. It subjects romantic love, pregnancy, motherhood and all the attendant tedious cultural baggage to an intensely intelligent, glittering critique. (CR)In Canada, retired English teacher Dell Parsons, the son of hapless bank robbers, looks back on the heart-breaking events of his teenage years and tries to “take account” of how his life was shaped. The settings include Great Falls, Montana, and Saskatchewan in Canada, but it’s Richard Ford sure-footed journey over emotional terrain that is so utterly majestic. (MC)A 13-year-boy survives a terrorist bomb that kills his mother at an art museum, and as he stumbles through the wreckage, he takes a small painting called The Goldfinch. The tiny relic of the Dutch Golden Age becomes a source of both solace and enigma in Tartt’s superb, Pulitzer-winning third novel. (CR)Walter and Patty Berglund, the seemingly perfect couple who meet at college in the 1970s, are at the heart of Jonathan Franzen’s fourth novel. The story of their unravelling marriage is explored in a rich, nuanced novel. Freedom is more than just a tale of wedded unbliss: it is about the messiness of love and longing in the modern world. (MC)A sprawling, multi-generational tale of a Turkish family who make a new life in London, this novel has a so-called ‘honour killing’ as its centre of gravity. Shafak, a best-selling author in Turkey and many other countries, conjures up the hypocrisy that holds women to different standards, with devastating results. (CR) 3140 Helen Macdonald – H Is for Hawk (2016)When Helen Macdonald lost her father, she acquired a hawk. This idiosyncratic approach to grief makes for a lyrical, moving probe into both the process of mourning and our relationship with the natural world. (CR)Not just a novel but a fully fledged cultural phenomenon, the sequel to the Handmaid’s Tale was met with midnight readings and fans decked out in the creepy red and white gowns from the TV adaptation of the original. A superb and suspenseful exposé of misogyny and the moral ambiguity at the heart of a fanatical regime. (CR)3340 Jennifer Egan – A Visit from the Goon Squad (2010)Time is a central theme of Jennifer Egan’s vibrant A Visit from the Goon Squad, which interconnects stories involving Sasha, a kleptomaniac New Yorker in her mid-thirties, and her music business boss Bennie Salazar. The problems of relationships are explored in a witty novel that has interesting things to say about the loss of vitality in the digital world. (MC)3440 Matt Haig – Reasons to Stay Alive (2015)There’s a reason why Matt Haig’s writing on mental health has earned him such high praise, with the Duchess of Sussex among his fans. And it all started with this bestselling memoir in which the children’s fiction author describes falling into a deep depression in his early twenties that left him contemplating taking his own life. It’s not an easy read, but in a society where suicide remains grossly misunderstood and gender stereotypes hinder men from speaking openly about their mental wellbeing, it’s a crucial one. (OP) 3540 Arundhati Roy – The Ministry of Utmost Happiness (2017)Twenty years after her stunning debut The God of Small Things, Arundhati Roy followed up with the mesmerising The Ministry of Utmost Happiness. With biting ironic wit, Roy’s epic dissects life in India in the wake of the partition conflict. The characters, including the transgender woman Anjum, are intimately drawn. Roy’s novel challenges you to care about life. (MC)3640 Sally Rooney – Conversations with Friends (2017)The fêted 27-year-old author has acquired a reputation as a millennial literary powerhouse since her debut in 2017. While Rooney has gone on to publish a second novel, Normal People, which was shortlisted for this year’s Man Booker Prize, Conversations with Friends remains her best work. With its snappy short sentences, sophisticated plot and characters so complex that it’s hard to like any of them, the novel established Rooney as one of the most exciting new writers around. (OP)3740 George Saunders – Lincoln in the Bardo (2017)Lincoln in the Bardo tells the story of a single night in the life of Abraham Lincoln – when his 11-year-old son was buried – through an experimental tale involving 166 narrators in the bardo, the transitional state between one’s death and rebirth, according to Tibetan Buddhism. George Saunders’ enchanting tour-de-force won the 2017 Man Booker Prize. (MC)In 2019, female desire warrants shrewd examination more than ever. Thank goodness, then, for Lisa Taddeo, who spent eight years documenting the sexual experiences of three very relatable but very different women. The result is a powerful collection of interspersed narratives that probe the most intimate corners of the female psyche. I can think of nothing like it. (OP)An outrageous satire of contemporary race relations, Beatty’s The Sellout tells the story of a black man called Bonbon who is seeking to reinstitute slavery and segregation. When it won the Booker, the chair of the judges compared Beatty to Swift and Twain. (CR)4040 . Hilary Mantel –  Bring Up the Bodies (2012)The sequel to Mantel’s Booker-winning Tudor tour de force, Wolf Hall, Bring up the Bodies did not Let Down the Readers. Her immersive prose takes us back into the poetic, rigorous mind of the archetypal career politician, Thomas Cromwell. The subject is the stuff of school days – Henry Tudor’s marriage to Anne Boleyn, and her fatal failure to produce a male heir. To allow another marriage and safeguard the stability of the country, Cromwell engineers Boleyn’s downfall, constructing capital charges against the queen along with a few of his old enemies to boot. Despite the biggest spoiler in history, Mantel’s novel is so finely pitched that we feel all the tension of the luxurious, blood-tinged Tudor court.

(CR)“Giving the Nobel Literature Prize to a racist, who denies the genocide in Bosnia and defends war criminals, on 10 December, Human Rights Day, will have no meaning other than the rewarding of human rights violations,” Erdogan said.Milosevic was charged with war crimes in connection with atrocities and ethnic cleansing committed by Serb forces in Bosnia, Croatia and Kosovo during the 1990s wars triggered by the disintegration of federal Yugoslavia.In a news conference last week ahead of the prize award ceremony, Handke bristled at questions about his writings on the wars in former Yugoslavia.He concluded the testy meeting by saying that after the prize was announced, he had received a letter filled with\u0026nbsptoilet paper “and I tell you ... I prefer toilet paper, the anonymous letter with toilet paper, to your empty and ignorant questions”.This Tuesday, he will formally be handed the 9m\u0026nbspcrown ($935,000£300,000) award and later attend the traditional Nobel banquet.Handke is the author of books such as The Goalie’s Anxiety at the Penalty Kick and Slow Homecoming. He also co-wrote the script of the critically acclaimed 1987 film Wings of Desire.The Academy has defended its decision to award Handke the prize, saying he had clearly condemned the Srebrenica massacre, though it accepted he had made “provocative, unsuitable and unclear comments in political questions”.However, one of the Academy’s 18 members said on Friday he would boycott this year’s celebrations in protest.“To celebrate Peter Handke’s Nobel Prize would be gross hypocrisy on my part,” Peter Englund, who headed the Academy until 2015, told daily Dagens Nyheter.Additional reporting by agenciesThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

House of FraserHomebase has recently dropped the Bunnings association from its storesAn exit from Asia would mean leaving one of the few international markets where Tesco has experienced sustained success.Despite recent challenges, Thailand had remained an area\u0026nbspearmarked for expansion with Tesco chief executive Dave Lewis unveiling\u0026nbspplans in June to open a further 750 convenience stores.Like-for-like sales at Tesco’s Asia business dropped 6.2 per cent in the last financial year, partly as a result of welfare cards issued by the Thai government that could not be used in Tesco\u0026nbspstores.​​Tesco expanded rapidly into Asia, the US and Europe in the 1990s under former chief executive Sir Terry Leahy but has pared back its overseas ambitions to refocus on the UK in the face of strengthening competition from discount rivals Aldi and Lidl.David Lewis shocks the City by quitting Tesco. What next?Tesco sold its US business Fresh \u0026amp Easy in 2013, citing “cultural differences” and announced a withdrawal from China after failing to make any significant headway with Chinese consumers.\u0026nbspAn accounting scandal\u0026nbspand record losses in 2014 prompted Tesco to launch a turnaround plan which has helped it regain UK market share. That included further disposals including the £4.2bn sale of Tesco’s South Korea business in 2015. If the Lotus sale goes ahead,\u0026nbspTesco\u0026nbspwould have stores only in the UK, Ireland and central Europe.Mr\u0026nbspLewis shocked the retail sector by announcing in October that he would step down at the start of next year.He returned Tesco\u0026nbspto profitability\u0026nbspafter taking the helm in 2014 cutting prices, by slashing\u0026nbspthousands of jobs, overseeing\u0026nbspa merger with wholesaler Booker, and simplifying the product range.

But there appears\u0026nbspto be something in the crisp Surrey air\u0026nbspthat is putting a spring in the step of Lib Dem activists.Harding, a first-time candidate, is hoping to snatch\u0026nbspEsher and Walton from Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary and erstwhile Tory leadership contender, in what is being seen as this election’s potential “Portillo moment”.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProsperous and leafy, the Surrey seat has been\u0026nbspfaithfully sending Tory MPs to parliament since its creation in 1997. Indeed, the area has not elected an MP who was not a Conservative for more than 100 years.Raab, who has held the seat since 2010, is defending a\u0026nbsp23,000 majority on 12 December but his hardline Brexit stance has put him at odds with his voters, who backed Remain by over 58 per cent.Raab on target list in Lib Dem push for Remain-backing seatsYet Raab is one of the cabinet’s most hardline Brexiteers. In his tilt for the Tory leadership, he was relaxed about a no-deal Brexit and first mooted\u0026nbspthe idea of proroguing parliament.A recent Deltapoll survey put Harding just five points behind Raab on 41 per cent to the Tory minister’s 46 per cent, suggesting Labour voters – who took their party to second place in 2017 – were switching to the Lib\u0026nbspDems.\u0026nbspWhen asked who they would support if only the Tories and the Lib Dems had a realistic chance, the parties were tied on 48 per cent.Veteran pollster Peter Kellner\u0026nbspwrote\u0026nbspat the time: “Dominic Raab’s fierce enthusiasm for Brexit could cost him dear in a constituency that voted Remain in the 2016 referendum.”Tactical voting is likely to play a part here, with the Green candidate standing aside for Harding in the seat. Labour are standing by their candidate Peter Ashurst but Remain campaigners have been piling pressure on Jeremy Corbyn to also fall in line.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailOver lunch in the Wheatsheaf pub, near Sandown racecourse, Harding tells\u0026nbspThe Independent\u0026nbspthat discontentment with Raab over Brexit and local services is galvanising voters.“The membership has gone through the roof in a year,” she says.\u0026nbspSome of the near 900 members are former Conservatives, who have defected out of discontent with their MP.She says: “There was one lady that I met who said, ‘Be very gentle with us’. She said, ‘I’ve been leafleting for the Conservative Party since I was four-years-old, and this is the first time that I have not only not voted for the Conservative Party, but I’m actually now joining another party. So it’s a big deal for me’.”Many voters in the area feel alienated and disenfranchised by Raab’s Brexit stance, she says. “I was one of them which is why I am standing. Because I felt I had no voice.”“Our MP hasn’t moderated his position one little bit in the last three years and in fact he was the first of the Tory leadership to suggest prorogation of parliament and he’s been touting no deal for a long time. Of course, it’s resonating here.”She is confident that she has a good chance of winning, with Brexit the catalyst to a wider picture of discontent.Harding says: “There’s been a huge amount of disquiet in the constituency for a long time.“I think that’s got bigger over the last three years because of the shambles the government have made of Brexit. Because of this position, what was once a moderate, One Nation Conservative Party has moved so far to the right, people are very uncomfortable with that.“They are very uncomfortable with the prorogation of parliament, very uncomfortable with the kind of language that’s coming out of the government at the moment and the misinformation that’s coming on a daily basis. That lands very badly here.”Created with Sketch.

Her campaign literature is emblazoned with commitments on Brexit, schools, the NHS and the environment issues.A school governor and a mother-of-four, Harding is also preoccupied with cuts to education funding and provision for children special educational needs (SEN), as well as community policing and hospitals.She says: “What you have got here is a battle between me and Dominic Raab and what we’re saying to voters is you know, you’ve got two very, very different choices here.”\u0026nbspWhen asked if she is worried about taking on\u0026nbspa\u0026nbspbig beast at the polls, she laughs.She says: “Dominic Raab is my MP. At the end of the day he’s answerable to the constituents and I’m a constituent ... I have no problem going up against my local MP who I disagree with – foreign secretary or not.”​One thing that seems to be resonating on the doorstep for Harding was the surprise endorsement of Ian Taylor, the former Tory MP who represented the constituency for 23 years.Hugh Grant reacts to Boris Johnson’s Love Actually spoofTaylor, a former minister, urged Tory voters to abandon a party he “no longer recognises” as he condemned\u0026nbspJohnson for allowing the “damaging threat” of a no-deal Brexit to remain on the table.As well as his endorsement, Harding has been received help from some big names, with Tory grandee Michael Heseltine and ex-Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable visiting the constituency.Hugh Grant, the Love Actually star, joined her to canvas in Walton-on-Thames at the weekend, while Gina Miller, the Remain campaigner, also joined Harding for a lunchtime canvas session in Cobham.“If there is no tactical voting there will be a Tory majority,” she told\u0026nbspThe Independent. “If there is a Tory majority then a referendum is gone.“A hung parliament takes us to a second referendum. If there is a Conservative majority, all routes are closed.”Activists are confident – if a little bemused – by the turn of events.“Leafy Surrey, genteel Surrey. People are standing up and shouting, ‘Enough!’, says Saira Ramadan, a lawyer who joined the Lib Dems in May.“People are fed up of Raab. Our activists are hearing voters are saying they voted Tory all their lives but Dominic Raab doesn’t represent them anymore.”A Conservative Party spokesperson said: “No matter what they say, a vote for the Liberal Democrats would risk putting Corbyn in Downing Street.“A vote for the Liberal Democrats would mean we keep on arguing about Brexit whilst important issues – like the NHS, schools and police – don’t get the attention they deserve.“Only voting for the Conservatives in Esher and Walton will keep our economy strong, meaning we will be able to invest in the people’s priorities and unleash Britain’s potential.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

win a parliamentary majority at Thursday’s general election, according to a major new poll – but their predicted margin of victory has been halved in the past fortnight.Labour and Liberal Democrat gains have eaten into the Tories’ majority, according to the\u0026nbsppoll of more than 100,000 voters that came closest to predicting the 2017 result.The Conservatives are set to win 339 seats, with Labour on 231, the Lib Dems\u0026nbspon\u0026nbsp15,\u0026nbspthe SNP\u0026nbspon 41, and the Brexit Party empty-handed,\u0026nbspYouGov’s\u0026nbspMRP poll for The Times\u0026nbspforecasts.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut the level of variation in the poll suggests the Tories could secure as many as 367 seats, or as few as 311, leading YouGov’s\u0026nbspdirector of political research, Anthony Wells, to conclude: “Based on the model we cannot rule out a hung parliament.”The sophisticated polling model uses more than 100,000 voter interviews over a seven-day period, combined with analysis of key demographics, past voting behaviour and other metrics to guess the likelihood of a person voting for a particular party.Created with Sketch.General election: Facts and

intention since the most recent MRP poll on 27 November, which saw the Tories barrelling towards a 68-seat majority and Labour heading for a disastrous 211 seats.YouGov’s MRP poll was alone in correctly forecasting that Theresa May would lose her majority, calculating her party would win 310 seats. This turned out to be just seven short of the reality, with the poll correctly calling the result in 93 per cent of the country.However, in what is arguably the least predictable election in modern history, voter intentions are changing daily, casting some doubt over the week-long snapshot.Expectations of widespread tactical voting are a further hindrance to nationwide polls, with another YouGov\u0026nbspsurvey on Tuesday suggesting one in five voters intend to do so.What the parties are promising on the big issuesHow a photo of a boy sleeping on a hospital floor Hung parliament? Corbyn as PM? Tory win? The five possible scenariosWhich politicians have been the winners and losers on TV?“The margins are extremely tight and small swings in a small number of seats, perhaps from tactical voting and a continuation of Labour’s recent upward trend, means we can’t currently rule out a hung parliament,” said YouGov’s political research manager, Chris Curtis.The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by email“As things currently stand, there are 85 seats with a margin of error of five per cent or less.”If the predicted result materialises, it would hand the PM the largest Tory majority since the Eighties, topping John Major’s 21-seat margin of Commons control in 1992.For Labour, the prediction of winning 231 seats would be its worst result for more than 30 years, according to YouGov.But the result will add to\u0026nbspMr Johnson’s woes as each party\u0026nbspprepares for a final blitz across the country in the final full day of the campaign, with Tory gains from Labour reduced from 44 to 29 since the MRP poll a fortnight ago.Labour appear to be “patching the cracks” in its so-called “red wall” of seats across the north and the midlands, YouGov said, but the Tories are still predicted to commandeer seats such as Don Valley, Bishop Auckland, Wrexham and Great Grimsby.The party leaders will on Wednesday issue\u0026nbsptheir eve-of-poll messages to voters in a last-minute bid to shore up their support. Speaking at a rally in Middlesbrough,\u0026nbspJeremy Corbyn is expected to ask the electorate to “save the NHS”.“My message to all those voters who are still undecided is that you can vote for hope in this election. It’s time for a pay rise for 12 million people, for lower fares and bills and for free childcare,” he is expected to say.“You can vote for a Labour government that will be on your side. A Labour government that will save our NHS.”The party has also released figures that it says show five more years of Tory government will push health service waiting lists up to 5.8 million by the end of 2024, up from 4.4 million in 2019. The figure was 2.5 million when the Tories took office in 2010.Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth says the stats, drawn from official data, illustrate a “Tory demolition of our NHS”.But on Tuesday Boris Johnson\u0026nbsphammered home his party’s own simple message, telling voters that “the stalemate in parliament has held this country back for too long”.“Instead of concentrating on your priorities, Westminster has been mired in ision and deadlock,” he said.“Politicians have spent so much time shouting at each other and devising ways of wriggling out of Brexit that they have neglected the issues people care about,” he said during a speech in Staffordshire\u0026nbspwhere he brought to reality the symbolism of his statement: “It’s time to send in the bulldozers and smash through the gridlock.”Corbyn will appoint Brexit negotiators backing ‘both Leave and Remain’Terror victim’s father insists PM has not given condolences to familyI wish Boris Johnson could sit in my GP’s chairThe Lib Dems will also be on familiar political terrain for the last full day of campaigning. Jo Swinson, who will be visiting a string of Tory-held target seats in Esher and Walton, Guildford and Wimbledon, will tell voters: “My message today is clear. To stop Brexit, we must stop Boris Johnson. We have one more day left to do it.“To all my fellow Lib Dem activists up and down the country,\u0026nbspI say this: keep going. Keep fighting for every vote. And to everyone out there who has a growing pile of Lib Dem leaflets on their kitchen table: we can win where you live.”She is expected to say that Mr Johnson had “showed us the kind of leader he is going to be” when he refused to acknowledge a photo of a sick child forced to sleep on the floor of an understaffed NHS hospital.\u0026nbspAhead of her visit to Esher and Walton, Lib Dems released a dossier of comments from Dominic Raab to bolster their audacious bid to target the foreign secretary’s true-blue seat for what they hope will be one of the most remarkable upsets in modern electoral history.These included Mr Raab’s description of British workers as “among the worst idlers in the world”, his claim that typical food bank users were people with “a cash flow problem”, and his characterisation of some feminists as “obnoxious bigots”.The dossier also pointed to his admission of ignorance of the UK’s reliance on the CalaisDover link and co-authorship of a pamphlet containing calls to break up the “monolith” of the NHS – language also used by the PM as a nascent MP.Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said: “Dominic Raab is a right-wing ideologue and has a long and chequered history of insulting the British public. He simply cannot be trusted to represent the people of Esher and Walton or stand up for this country on the global stage.“This Thursday’s general election gives voters the chance to unseat this man for good. Only the Liberal Democrats can take seats off the Conservatives and beat leading Brexiteers like Raab, John Redwood and Jacob Rees-Mogg.”The latest Ipsos MORI poll carried out from 6 to 9 December shows Ms Swinson is now more unpopular than Mr Corbyn, with a -31 per cent popularity rating. Mr Corbyn’s is now -30, up eight percentage points on the previous week, building on previous improvements during the campaign.\u0026nbspBoth leaders, however, trail Mr Johnson, who is rated -14. But the survey was largely conducted before Monday, when the prime minister was strongly criticised for his response to the photo of a sick child sleeping on the floor of a hospital.Additional reporting by PAShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But beyond the seemingly endless campaign gimmicks, soundbite interviews and scripted appearances, there are real policies at stake that will affect the country we live in for years to come. Here, we run through key issues that have seen less of the limelight in the build-up to Thursday’s vote, telling you what each of the three major parties is pledging – and what we think about it.Tories:\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspA “triple lock” on taxes, with no increases in income tax, national insurance and VAT for five years. Boost public sector investment up to 3 per cent of GDP but rethink if debt interest hits 6 per cent of revenue.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesLabour: Public spending boost of £83bn, with rises in corporation tax, capital gains tax and income tax for the highest earners to fund it. Nationalisation of rail, mail, water and the big six energy firms, as well as the broadband arm of BT.Lib Dems: A “mechanism” that lets the public share profits of tech firms, plus a tax on frequent fliers, while cannabis use would be legalised and taxed. Corporation tax would be restored to 20 per cent, but the marriage tax allowance would be scrapped.Is Labour’s policy of planting 2bn trees by 2040 realistic?Our view:\u0026nbspPain and short- to medium-term economic damage from Brexit will be substantial, and restrict the ability to boost public spending, cut taxes or reduce the national debt. The terms of a new trade deal with the EU, let alone any with other major nations, are unknown – and therefore so are the nation’s future prospects. Tories promise to “unleash Britain’s potential”, presumably by making the economy more competitive via “supply side” reforms, while Labour’s huge fiscal stimulus would raise the rate of growth in the economy, but experts say\u0026nbspto only a relatively modest extent. The Liberal Democrats have enjoyed the most favourable reviews from independent think tanks such as the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Tories: Ensure universal credit “works for the most vulnerable”, but end the benefit freeze and bring in tough punishments for those who cheat the system. £1bn for extra childcare places before and after school, and during holidays.Labour:\u0026nbspScrap universal credit, the benefit cap and the two-child policy, while bringing in a pilot of universal basic income. £58bn for the “Waspi women” affected by state pension age changes.Lib\u0026nbspDems: Reform universal credit, reducing the wait for first payments from five weeks to five days. Introduce a legal right to food. Keep the triple lock on the basic state pension while Waspi women would be “properly compensated”.Our view:\u0026nbspUniversal credit is almost universally loathed, and its shortcomings have been well-advertised. Even in its primary goal of reducing the cost to the taxpayer the new system has failed – and it is yet to be fully rolled out nationally. The problem, as the Commons Public Accounts Committee has pointed out, is that scrapping universal credit at this late stage in its development and returning to either the old system or yet another new system would cost more than persisting. In other words, UC may be the least bad option for the public finances. \u0026nbspClimate and environmentThe latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailTories: Cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, spending £9.2bn to improve the energy efficiency of homes, schools and hospitals – with £6.3bn installing energy-saving measures to cut bills in 2.2 million homes.\u0026nbspLabour: Aim to “achieve the substantial majority” of emissions reductions by 2030, but no pledge to cut out greenhouse gases by that date.Lib\u0026nbspDems: With a net-zero target to 2045, the Lib Dems will insulate all of the UK’s homes by 2030, ensuring 80 per cent of electricity comes from renewable sources by 2030 and planting 60 million trees a year. Ban on fracking and non-recyclable single-use plastics, with all cars electric by 2030.The key seats that will decide the general electionIs Nicola Sturgeon the key to a second Brexit referendum?Our view:\u0026nbspIn their ways, all the parties’ promises to make the UK carbon-neutral are ambitious. Even the Tories’ would cost £1 trillion. The problem, of course, with any of these plans is public resistance to moving out of conventional cars, scrapping gas boiler central heating, and taking fewer flights. The parties are also unclear about whether these targets account for offshoring our pollution to China and elsewhere.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspTories: £14bn for schools, and programmes to deal with bullying and disruption.Labour: Charitable status removed from independent schools, 30 hours of free childcare for pre-school children and a Sure Start centre in every community. Scrap university tuition fees and bring back maintenance grants.Lib\u0026nbspDems: £13.9bn a year on early years, including boosts for children’s centres and free childcare for 2-4-year-olds, as well as those aged nine months and over whose parents work full-time. An extra £10.6bn a year on schools, including 20,000 more teachers, and £10,000 skills wallet for adults to invest in training.Our view:\u0026nbspEducation, education, education was once the chant, and, under new management, Labour has the edge on radicalism. In economic terms, encouraging higher education should improve skills and therefore the underlying performance of the economy. The question is how much of the cost should be paid by the inidual and what should be accounted for by the state. On schools, after years in which they were prioritised by New Labour, then partly ring-fenced from austerity, the state of British school is not as dire as its times portrayed, which may be one reason why the issue has subsided in importance.\u0026nbspTories: New social housing white paper and a pledge to renew the affordable homes programme.Labour: Pledge to build 100,000 homes for social rent each year. Some 8,000 homes available for people with a history of homelessness, and £1bn a year for councils’ homelessness services.Lib\u0026nbspDems: Build 300,000 homes a year, including 100,000 for social rent. Government-backed tenancy deposits for private renters under 30. Council-tax hikes on properties left empty for more than six months.Our view:\u0026nbspIf tougher regulation and a larger role for the state is the solution to the housing crisis, then the Labour Party has all the answers. The obvious retort to that is that measures such as rent control have been tried and sometimes led to perverse consequences. In terms of supply, there is some agreement – Labour and the Liberal Democrats and committed to building, but the Tories promise only a white paper.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.General election:

NHS Visa for qualified doctors and nurses. Freedom of movement will end.Labour: Numerical targets scrapped along with the 2014 Immigration Act. Pledge to dismantle the “hostile environment” that led to the Windrush scandal, while free movement will be subject to Brexit negotiations.Lib\u0026nbspDems: Stop Brexit and retain freedom of movement. End hostile environment. Resettle 10,000 refugees a year, and a further 10,000 refugee children over the next decade.Our view:\u0026nbspAll the main parties refuse to say whether immigration will be higher or lower than it is now, whether Brexit happens or not. There is much talk of “control” and, in different ways, they all stress that migration should match the needs of the economy, but beyond broad principles there is little specific – because immigration remains so explosive.\u0026nbspTories: £1 billion in extra funding every year, while building “a cross-party consensus” to find a long-term solution, on the condition that any reform must ensure nobody needing care would be forced to sell their home to pay for it.Labour: A comprehensive National Care Service for England. Under a lifetime cap on personal contributions, no one would be required to face costs of more than £100,000 for care in old age.Lib\u0026nbspDems:\u0026nbspRaise £7bn a year with a 1p in the pound rise in the basic, higher and additional rates of income tax for health and social care.\u0026nbspOur view:\u0026nbspAll parties agree there is a crisis none has an actual plan. Despite promising such a scheme, Boris Johnson has conceded the plan is not fully worked through. Labour and the Liberal Dems talk in more detail, but again a few paragraphs in a manifesto do not constitute a plan.\u0026nbspCrime and justiceTories: Recruit 20,000 police officers over the next three years to replace those lost due to budget cuts since 2010. Consult on toughening laws for attacks on emergency service workers and boost the number of Tasers and body cameras available for police.Labour: Re-establish neighbourhood policing and recruit 2,000 more frontline officers than the Conservatives. Establish a royal commission to develop a public health approach to drugs. Review the Prevent programme. Eliminate institutional bias against black and ethnic minority groups.Lib Dems: Invest £1bn in community policing and take a public health approach on violence. An extra 2,000 prison officers to help make prisons “places of rehabilitation”. Pledge for an immediate 2 per cent pay rise for police officers.Our view:\u0026nbspEvery political party promises to reduce crime, but few governments succeed in doing so. The extra police promised by all, plus the restoration of cuts to the criminal justice system (such as the courts and probation service) offered by the opposition parties might well improve matters. However, crime levels are also linked to social conditions and the wider state of the economy. Thus, as new Labour used to say, political parties need to be tough on crime, but also tough the causes of crime.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I think middle-class graduates – Remainy people – Labour’s doing well among ... but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority.”Most polls agree with Mr Ashworth’s assessment, though some point to a possible hung parliament, particularly if tactical voting is taken into account. A pre-election survey of political scientists carried out by the Political Studies Association (PSA) found that academics are ided on whether the Conservatives will win a majority.Mr Ashworth letter wrote an email to all Labour members to apologise. He told them: “I want to apologise. I’ve made a terrible devastating error which I’m so so sorry for.“So many of you have been campaigning hard in the rain and cold for me long into dark nights. The fact that you are all working so hard only makes my sense of remorse all the more deeper.”He added that the leak was a “a Tory dirty trick to try to distract us from our central campaign on the future of the NHS”.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75James Cleverly, chair\u0026nbspof the Conservative Party, said of the leaked recording: “This is an honest and truly devastating assessment of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership by one of his most trusted election lieutenants.\u0026nbsp“He admits that Labour has blocked Brexit and that is why voters ‘can’t stand Corbyn’. If even Corbyn’s closest political allies think he is unfit to be prime minister, why on earth should voters be expected to put their trust in him and them?“Corbyn’s Labour have broken their promises to the British people on Brexit and they will not be able to deliver their fantasy manifesto. As Ashworth himself says, only a vote for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will mean we can get Brexit done.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

After rejecting Theresa May’s deal (too soft), then Boris Johnson’s deal (hard, but with an unacceptable Irish Sea border), they returned to Belfast, with their tails between their legs.In this election, again they’re asking voters to give them a mandate to go and influence the Westminster government - without so much as a hint of irony. The truth is they won’t be hugely punished.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPolitics in Northern Ireland remains deeply tribal, and many unionists will still back their biggest party for fear of splitting the vote\u0026nbspand handing a victory to what they see as the other side. The DUP are also attempting to distance themselves from Boris Johnson’s betrayal over the unpopular Brexit deal.So while Sinn Fein will take a fistful of seats along the border, the DUP will still\u0026nbspromp home in many of its safe constituencies.Created with Sketch.Top 10 marginal seats to watch at the general election Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 2Currently held by Labour with a majority of 20310 Perth and North PerthshireCurrently held by the SNP with a majority of 21Currently held by independent, formerly Labour, MP Ian Austin with a majority of 22Currently held by Labour with a majority of 30Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 31Currently held by the Conservatives with a majority of 45810 Crewe and NantwichCurrently held by Labour with a majority of 48Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 60Currently held by the SNP with a majority of 75But in some seats, Remainers are giving them a run for their money. As many as 60 per cent of voters in Belfast wanted to remain in the EU, yet aside from Sinn Fein in West Belfast, the other three seats in the city are held by the DUP. This week, the pro-Remain parties of Northern Ireland hope to change that.For 20 years, North Belfast has been the seat of Nigel Dodds, DUP grandee and their leader at Westminster. He is being challenged here by Sinn Fein’s John Finucane - the current Lord Mayor of Belfast and the son of solicitor Pat, who was murdered by loyalist gunmen in his\u0026nbspfamily home in 1989.\u0026nbsp“I grew up in North Belfast and it was pretty much as safe a unionist seat as you could get,” he tells The Independent.\u0026nbsp“But I think that’s different now because society has moved on, and there’s a regressive brand of politics that they want to leave behind. People want to remove those very loud Brexiteer voices who are not representative.”Mr Dodds has a majority of 2,081, but with the SDLP and Greens not running against Sinn Fein, this seat is in a virtual dead heat. Mr Finucane is working hard to win over people who wouldn’t normally vote for his party. As Irish republicans, Sinn Fein abstain from taking their seats in the House of Commons (seven at the last election), but he believes this position has never been easier to justify, given the chaos that has played out at Westminster.“The Brexit project is very much an English nationalist project, and they’re entitled to have that,” he explains. “There is a momentum that will be forcing this through no matter how much damage it will cause here in Belfast or across Northern Ireland.“For those who backed Remain, or have come around to backing Remain since 2016, protection for them has come from Dublin, Brussels, Washington DC, and protection is never going to come from the green benches of Westminster.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailMr Finucane describes Mr Dodds as the arch-Brexiteer\u0026nbspof Northern Ireland, having been part of the Vote Leave campaign. “People see this as a real opportunity to send a powerful message beyond Belfast that we rejected, and continue to reject, Brexit.”What does the Sinn Fein-SDLP electoral pact in mean for Brexit?In South Belfast, the DUP’s Emma Little-Pengelly (with a majority of 1,996) is under threat from a nationalist who would take up her seat in Westminster. The SDLP’s Claire Hanna says people are feeling “disenfranchised and unheard” in the Brexit debate, and she wants to change that.“There are some crazy things being said in Westminster about Ireland and Brexit, and there’s nobody there to correct them,” she says. “There are many people who may have voted Sinn Fein in the past, but who now see a situation where we have votes coming down to a handful of MPs, and that protecting Ireland’s interests should come ahead of party ideology.”Indeed both Sinn Fein and the Greens have stood aside in this seat to aide Ms Hanna’s fight against the DUP, who she says have left Northern Ireland in an “unequivocally worse position” than when they entered the confidence and supply arrangement with the Conservatives in 2017.“They had an incredible amount of power and influence, and they had the opportunity to use it to positive effect for people in Northern Ireland and they chose not to.”\u0026nbspThe DUP have dug themselves into a Brexit-shaped hole, first by backing it in spite of the ever-increasing Remain consensus\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland, then by rejecting Theresa May’s deal in favour of a harder one, then by rejecting Boris Johnson’s harder deal once they saw it would be damaging to the union.“They have yet to articulate a form of Brexit that matches both their red lines and the red lines of the people who live here and don’t want a hard border,” says Ms Hanna. “Perhaps it’s dawning on them that you can have a hard Brexit or you can have the union but you can’t have both.”Arguably the SDLP’s strongest asset, Ms Hanna - a Stormont MLA who has even been endorsed by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar - looks poised to take this seat and ensure her party’s return to Westminster. Nevertheless, she is well aware that Northern Ireland MPs cannot reroute Brexit alone.“We’ve got to roll with the punches in terms of what is on the table after the election,” she admits. “If there happens to be a majority of parties other than the Conservatives, then a People’s Vote is our preferred next step.”But it’s not just nationalists like Sinn Fein and the SDLP who are lining up to take on the DUP - this extends to all the pro-Remain parties, including the Alliance Party. Neither nationalist nor unionist, Alliance is a centre-ground party, increasingly representative of the other\u0026nbspconstituency in Northern Ireland, who are not committed either way on the constitutional question.The slow but steady growth of Alliance was evident in local council elections earlier this year, as well as the election of party leader Naomi Long as one of the region’s three MEPs. She is taking on the DUP’s Gavin Robinson in East Belfast (with a majority of 8,474), a seat which she previously held from 2010 to 2015, because she says the unionist party is pursuing an agenda which is not supported in the constituency.“What we’ve had from the DUP is a very extreme Brexit stance,” says Ms Long, pointing out that the party has lurched to the right as the process has gone on. “Even some of those in East Belfast who would have voted Leave feel they’re not being listened to at Westminster.”While nationalists and Others\u0026nbspin Northern Ireland have largely backed Remain, a Lucid Talk poll released in recent days showed that only 38 per cent of unionists now back Leave, with 41 per cent in favour of Remain. Support for Boris Johnson’s deal is in single digits across all communities. And it seems the DUP have already got the message. Brexit doesn’t feature at all in the party’s election broadcast, campaign literature, or their official website. Ms Long says this “speaks volumes about how wrong they have got this, and how little they want to be held to account for their decision.”Alliance must draw cross-party support to take East Belfast, but the party is not in favour of pacts. So while Sinn Fein, the SDLP and the Greens have stood aside to give Ms Long a clear run here, Alliance have not exactly returned the favour. In fact, they are the only party running in all 18 of Northern Ireland’s constituencies - and with a 50-50 gender quota at that.\u0026nbsp“We are standing to be MPs for five years, and our manifesto is broader than just Brexit,” says Ms Long. “So I think it’s important that we stand and give people that choice.”Like the SDLP, Alliance are in favour of a second referendum - with Remain on the ballot. While this stance has been criticised as one which ignores the wishes of Leave voters, Ms Long argues that’s not the case.“I’ve never patronised people who voted Leave,” she says, “but what they were promised in 2016 was a kind of unicorn Brexit which would be all things to all people, and what we’re now getting is a lame donkey Brexit under Boris Johnson, and I think given that choice, some people may decide that they would prefer to keep things as they are.A seat-by-seat guide to the general election in Northern Ireland“They should have the opportunity to change their mind just as the prime minister himself has done on numerous occasions on this issue.”As election day approaches, it seems likely that the SDLP will take South Belfast, although it will be a harder fight for Alliance in East Belfast. But if there’s only one Northern Ireland seat to keep your eye on, it’s Dodds v Finucane in North Belfast. A win for Sinn Fein here would be a major victory, and its loss would be devastating for the DUP.As with so many seats across the UK, the success of pro-Remain candidates in Northern Ireland will lie entirely in people’s willingness to vote tactically to send a message to the DUP, and elect more voices who will reflect the pro-EU majority.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Corbyn would bankrupt the nation. Corbyn despises this country. Corbyn has spent a career licking the boots of terrorists. Corbyn never met a hate preacher he didn’t like.If Jeremy Corbyn gets elected on Thursday then, in the words of The Carpenters, it will be yesterday once more — and ato the ravages of gormless Socialism, red in tooth and claw, unseen since the Seventies.We have forgotten what mass unemployment is like in this country. We have forgotten what soaring inflation is like. We have forgotten what it is like to endure endless strikes. Corbyn would bring it all back — and worse.For Jeremy Corbyn has no love for this country. He has no affection for our people, our history or our flag.Personally, I couldn’t give a flying figCorbyn watches the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day.But it does bother me that he always takes the side of this country’s enemies.It concerns me that his “friends” include terrorists such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the IRA. It disturbs me like hell that Corbyn can even find excuses for Russian thugs conducting their murderous business on British soil.Jeremy Corbyn despises the nation he seeks to lead. And that scares me most of all.Thursday will dawn cold, dark and with the possibility of snow. This close to Christmas, nobody feels like going to a polling booth. But this close to a terrorist-sympathising Marxist moron seizing power, we can’t afford NOT to vote.There are real problems that the incoming government will need to address on day one.Yes, our departure from the European Union is absolutely crucial. But no matter how much we may despise the unelected fat cats in Brussels, the nations of Europe will always be our neighbours and should always be our friends.Leaving the EU while maintaining good trading relations with it is no easy day at the office.And the new PM will have far more than Brexit to deal with. The housing crisis has made owning your own home an impossible dream for the younger generation.The pressures on our schools, roads and NHS are at breaking point. The working man and woman pay too much tax. Serious crime is rising. Climate change is real.All this is waiting in our new Prime Minister’s inbox.Jeremy Corbyn — a stupid, tenth-rate little man with stale, left-wing clichés where his brain should be — is clearly not up to the job.He is an economic cretin who would empty your pockets. He is a spineless hypocrite on Brexit. He has enabled racism to enter the bloodstream of the Labour Party. And he hates the wicked West.“What goes around comes around,” Corbyn sneered when almost , people were murdered on  .Every time there is a terrorist attack, Corbyn finds a way of saying that we had it coming.On Thursday, YOUR vote can keep the worthless old git and his deranged supporters from power.This country deserves better than Jeremy Corbyn.THE Pirelli Calendar was once the byword for lavishly shot sexiness, but it is struggling to find its role in the modern world.Pretentious pictures of Emma Watson as a po-faced nun are probably not the answer to the Italian firm’s dilemma.Next year Pirelli should just print pictures of tyres.It has to be more interesting than this pompous cobblers.HARDCORE James Bond fans have long feared that an increasingly politically correct  was becoming licensed to kill joy.Bond had started coming over all woke. Daniel Craig never needs much encouragement to moan about Bond’s old-fashioned, sexist ways, while sources have claimed that the term “Bond girls” is now banned on  film sets as it is deemed unacceptable in the modern era.All very worthy. And all light years away from the gritty, sexy essence of Ian Fleming’s iconic hero.But the good news is that the trailer for the new Bond movie, No Time To Die, dropped this week and it looks exactly like a  blockbuster should look.Evil villains dreaming of world domination. Fast cars and fast women. Fiendishly clever gadgets. Car chases that would get you nine points on your licence.AndAna de Arma is not the ultimate Bond girl, then my name is Pussy Galore.WHEN I was a child, my family would make a -mile round trip just to gawp at the Christmas wonders of London.The lights of the West End. Santa’s grotto in Selfridges.And the giant Christmas tree given to us every year since  by the nation of Norway, grateful to us for chasing out the Nazis.This year the tree in Trafalgar Square is, frankly, a bit of a disappointment.Did the Norwegians forget to water it That’s not a giant Christmas tree.It’s a big twig.I’m not sure I would go to the end of the garden to see it, let alone drive all the way from Billericay.THE Duchess of Cambridge is such a great ambassador for the Royal Family.In these dficult days, with Prince Andrew all sweaty and Prince Harry all sulky, the glorious Kate never puts a foot wrong.Look at her helping out at a charity for disadvantaged kids on a Christmas tree farm in Great Missenden, Bucks.Sometimes I think that, after the Queen has gone, there is no future for the monarchy in modern Britain.But then I look at Kate – always smiling, always gracious – and I change my mind.WHEN BBC-approved comedian Nish Kumar appeared at The Lord’s Taverners Christmas Lunch he was booed off stage and narrowly dodged a bread roll.Nish made the mistake of trotting out lame anti-Brexit quips that would have had the canned laughter turned up to ten on any BBC  show.This material doesn’t work so well in the real world.The Lord’s Taverners is a cricket charity that supports children living in poverty or with disability. A very good cause.But the audience at their Christmas beano had no appetite for jokes about evil Tories. Although jokes about evil Tories will get your contract renewed at the BBC.Nish, the host of The Mash Report – me neither – told the audience: “I should have known this would happen when I agreed to do a set in front of people who colonised my ancestors.”Desperate stuff, Nish.I very much doubtanyone at that charity lunch colonised anyone’s ancestors.One of these BBC-approved comics should do a stand-up routine on Diane Abbott’s mathematics.Or the Labour Party’s inability to elect a woman leader in  years.This is all worthy of biting satire!But then they would never be asked back on Mock The Week, or The Mash Report nor any of the Beeb’s dreary, joyless, biased crap.Nish Kumar’s humiliation in the real world begs the question: Why should we all pay the BBC £. a year for a licence fee when it only represents the views of some of us Kumar – and all of these BBC-approved comedians – should stay in Broadcasting House.They will be safe there – Nish, Dara O Briain, Sandi Toksvig, Jo Brand and all the rest.They should never go into the real world.Someone might chuck a bread roll at them.PRINCE WILLIAM says he “recycles as much as he can”.Any chance of leaving his beleaguered uncle, the Duke of York, out for the bin men If Andrew is as innocent as he claims in his dealings with child-abusing billionaire Jeffrey Epstein, then he should go to the United States and do whatever it takes to clear his name.Until he does so, the former Randy Andy is an embarrassment to his family.And his country. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But we are also their role models in terms of food choices. If we breakfast on Pringles, pizza and doughnuts then the odds are they will too.By the same token,we start the day with porridge, seeds and fruit, they’ll likely grow up assuming that’s the best way.School is a huge influence, too, and it is great Jamie did succeed. In fact, he started a nationwide trend of schools providing and promoting a healthy diet.But some schools are taking it too far. At one primary I know of, teachers and dinner ladies patrol the lunchtime tables hunting out contraband such as sugary drinks and chocolate, to confiscate it then attempt to shame the parents into submission with letters about their snack misdemeanours.Other schools, it has emerged, are taking it even further than that, with pupils being followed when school has ended.Yes, following them from the school gates to the high street to intervenethey are seen going into a takeaway.Children at Cotham School, in Bristol, have been told they are not allowed to enter at least three convenience stores and a takeaway between .pm and .pm.Not only that, but school staff acting as bouncers have been patrolling the shopping parade and standing in high-vis jackets outside the chippy.The school says it is using powers given by Michael Gove’s  Education Act, which allows it to rule over the conduct of pupils in certain circumstances outside the school gates.The school’s business manager, Allison Crossland, said teachers have the authority over what the pupils do even after the end of the school day.And they are doing so to, “ensure the safety of children on their way home from school”.According to one takeaway owner, teachers went inside and started giving out detentions to children they found in there, although the school denies this.But the takeaway shops on the street say they have seen a drop in business since Cotham School staff started patrolling the streets and, unsurprisingly, they are up in arms as a result.I’m not saying it’s great for kids to snack on high-fat or sugary food when they leave school. Of course it’s not.But is it really the responsibility of their teachers to make sure they don’t  Is it right teachers can rule on what your kids eat when they leave school I don’t think so. AndI was a parent of a child being told what to eat by someone other than me, I’d be furious.I know some people will say this comes down to money, that it’s more expensive to eat healthily.And yes, it is cheaper and easier to snack on sugary foods such as chips and biscuits.Some might say that school dinners are not satisfying enough.Parents need to take it upon themselves to learn about how to cook and eat healthily.You don’t have to spend a fortune to eat well. Look at Jack Monroe, who has written a book on how to cook well with tinned food.There is no doubt something needs to change when it comes to kids and food.The number of obese people in the UK has almost doubled in  years. Rather than paying staff to patrol the chippy, I would vote to bring back domestic science and teach all children how to cook properly from scratch.But as parents, it is our duty, and no one ’s, to look after our children and teach them how to eat well.I KNOW they were doing important work at the Nato summit and all . . . But bloody hell, it was easy for the onlooker to be distracted, wasn’t it, with all the world leaders’ power-mongering going on First of all there were the handshakes. The amount of one-upmanship that can occur in a simple greeting is staggering: Who gets to overpower who by making sure their hand is firmly on top throughout the shake.Who lets go and de-shakes first, and who insists on prolonging the handshake so enthusiastically that it is impossible for the other party to get away until the prolonger is good and ready.Donald Trump famously shakes LONG and HARD. I think it is called the Power Shake and is often employed by people who think the harder they squeeze, the more important and manly they are.They hold on to show they have control over you. But at this summit, Trump possibly met his match with Canada’s Justin Trudeau, who was repeatedly filmed gripping people’s hands so hard that both sets of knuckles were going white.Mind you, that is better than the limp shake. No one likes nor trusts someone with a limp handshake. It’s like shaking hands with a person with no bones.But my least favourite is the sweaty-palm shake.And then there was the footage of Trudeau, France’s Emmanuel Macron and Boris Johnson apparently gossiping about Trump like a bunch of naughty schoolboys.Where’s the leadership qualities in behaving like that It all left me feeling like they need to grow up.And then I saw the photo of our magnicent Queen and all  Nato allies. Guess how many women were in the group  I counted seven, including the Queen. I can’t help but thinkthere were more women involved, less of this childish stuff would go on.But it comes with at least one benefit: An utterly fabulous clothing budget!I have never seen Melania in the same outfit twice .She wore a coat a few months ago which I quite liked the look of, so I thought I might buy it.I looked it up online and it was £,, for something made out of wool. I passed! Mind you, whatever the cost, she looks great and oozes class.I SHUDDERED when I read the story of Jayney Nascimento, , who borrowed £, from her mother for liposuction in the hope of having skinnier legs. But instead of getting the legs of her dreams, she contracted a deadly flesh-eating bug called necrotising fasciitis, which left her fighting for her le and she almost had her legs amputated.Jayney, an administrator from Shropshire, says: “I paid for an expensive cosmetic procedure so I would feel comfortable showing off my legs.“Instead, I nearly lost them and I hate them more now than I did before the operation.”Talk about a sobering reminder that all cosmetic surgery is invasive and has potentially le-threatening side-effects. Is it really worth it I’m guessing this woman would say no.CHRISTIE Brinkley was photographed looking absolutely spectacular at an event in New York. Wearing this black, trenchcoat-style mini- dress, with bedazzling purse and sparkly calf boots she seemed about half her age, which is, incredibly, .If I have half of her joie de vivre and charisma at that age, I will be over the moon.And so should she be.POOR Rhodri Giggs, who told this week about the devastating effect brother Ryan’s affair with his we has had on the family. Quite understandably, he hasn’t spoken to footballer Ryan, , in eight years, since the affair with Rhodri’s we Natasha was revealed.But shockingly, he said his mother Lynne hasn’t spoken to him in the past eight years.Rhodri, , says she has taken Ryan’s side: “Because I haven’t got  medals, I haven’t played for Manchester United for -odd years and own a big house.”Turns out this was a triple betrayal. His we. His brother. His mother. Your entire support network gone overnight. Shame on his motherthat is true.DID anyone  wince over Jeremy Corbyn vowing to confront Donald Trump at this week’s Buckingham Palace reception It was about the sanctity of the NHS, which Trump does not appear to be interested in having anything to do with anyway.In the end, Corbyn didn’t get a chance as he was kept firmly away from the US President, possibly after publicly announcing his intentions.But the US is our main ally and it’s quite shocking that on a visit by the President, the opposition leader has to be kept away from Trump because he can’t be trusted to act with respect.What a calamity it would behe became the leader on December .JUST when I thought my admiration for black cab drivers had reached a peak, I got an invitation to a Christmas lunch organised by the Taxi Charity for Military Veterans.They offered Christmas lunch – turkey and all the trimmings – to  veterans who were taken to the venue by a fleet of black cabs driven by volunteer cabbies.It is so heart-warming that it actually brought a tear to my eye.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Haskell was big enough to pacy Wrighty, the series’ one real character, and Jenner was a waste of £, as she had everyone treading on PC eggshells and queuing up to assure us she was “an amazing, amazing woman”.Most of the rest were merely present and it was hard to have an opinion about almost any of them. Especially Adele, who had a picture of Jane McDonald rather than a personality, and Oddboddish Myles, who seemed to be using “the experience of a letime” to get his own cookery show. Not the reason most people would go in there.But a lot of this year’s contestants were young, tearful, mollycoddled, over-entitled, insecure products of our woke times and were treated accordingly by the production team, who bombarded the poor homesick little lambs with fry-ups, roast dinners, care packages, letters from home and so much food, most of them left the camp sounding like they’d just spent a fortnight at The Palms in Vegas.Roman: “That was the best thing I’ve ever done in my le.”Andy: “I loved every single minute of it.” Myles: “It’s been the most beautul time of my le.”Which was lovely for them but dull as hell for us, no matter how much they banged on about the “emotional rollercoaster ride” and missing their ruddy kids.Nor did it help Ant  Dec, who tried their brilliant best to inject laughter and running gags into the show. This, though, was one series of I’m A Celeb not even they could save.On Sunday it ended, appropriately enough, with victory for Jacqueline Jossa, who probably hoovered up the “Gloria Gaynor” block vote on account of her husband Dan Osborne’s off-screen shenanigans, which were far more interesting than anything that happened on screen.If this flat, tearful, commercially driven series got the winner it deserved, it certainly didn’t get the right epitaph from Ant.“One thing’s for sure,” he claimed confidently at the end, “We’ll never forget the class of .”And with that, I’d forgotten them.A FEW points to make regarding the BBC continuity announcer’s plug for Gemma Collins’ podcast, which kicked in during The Apprentice: You’re Fired credits.“I’ve got a great podcast to tell you about.” You haven’t.“It’s so entertaining.” It’s not.“Was Gemma Collins an elephant in a past le ” PAST FEELGOOD television story of the week Nish Kumar getting booed off stage at the Lord’s Taverners charity dinner. Proof he really hasn’t been paying attention to his Mash Report audience.If he had, Nish would’ve noticed they’re not laughing, they’re applauding in furious agreement about just how much they also hate the Tories, Boris, Trump and Brexit.Those of us who don’t share any of these left-wing prejudices, of course, are just meant to sit and meekly accept the abuse and the fact that all the least funny, most obnoxious and radioactively smug people on TV suddenly seem to have decided they’re the nation’s new moral compass and we’re racist bigots.What’s brilliant about the Lord’s Taverners story and accompanying internet footage of the audience is they refuse to play ball. At the point the clip kicks in, Nish has already lost them and is, as always, playing the race card.Half the crowd are booing, the other half are begging him to say something funny, ashe might suddenly turn into Robin Williams.A great comedian could still have turned it round and adjusted their material, of course.But Nish Kumar is neither great nor even a comedian. He’s a left-wing propagandist who cannotoutside of the tiny BBC Channel  echo chamber, so he has to be ushered off stage by the tombola bloke in red livery.It could’ve happened to any one of a number of C BBC “comedians”, obviously. The Tez O’Clock Show, The Last Leg, Have I Got News For You and Frankie Boyle’s New World Order are all just as biased and unpleasant as The Mash Report.Nish is by far the smuggest offender, though, andthe BBC is ever going to make a mass audience laugh again, instead of just lecturing us, it needs to learn the Lord’s Taverners lesson and carve these words on a comedy gravestone: “Ladies and gentlemen, Nish Kumar. It’s time for us to draw the raffle.”THE title of ITV’s It’s Not The Robbie Williams Christmas Show was loaded with all sorts of obvious threats.He would sing and smirk and then sing some more.But even I wasn’t prepared for the ego, which I blame fairly and squarely on his we Ayda Field who, Robbie claimed: “Gave me the gt of loving myself.”And certainly didn’t need to keep the receipt.The comedy segments were another endurance, featuring his dad, Jamie Cullum, Ant  Dec and David Walliams, who’d dressed up as an obsessive female fan, but was nothing like as terrying as the real thing, Julie from Norfolk, who Robbie winched out of the audience for a burst of Something Stupid. Then instantly regretted it.His own fault. Robbie suggested, “Do whatever you want”, and she took him at his word.To the audible shock of the crowd, Julie was over him, under him, round him and very nearly up him. And hell knows where it would’ve endedRobbie hadn’t drawn things to a close with the instruction: “Take a bow, Julie.”Then take a sedative, take a cold shower and take your head out of his fundament.

It’s awful for them and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit….outside of the city seats… it’s abysmal out there… they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.I think middle-class graduates – remainy people – Labour’s doing well among… but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority.”When asked by the pala Corbyn PM would be as “bad as I expect”, the Labour frontbencher replied: “I don’t know, on the security stuff I worked in No., I think the machine will pretty quickly move to safeguard security .“But it’s not going to happen! I can’t see it happening!”When askedthere was any chance of moderate Labour MPs launching a coup to get rid of Mr Corbyn, Ashworth replied “No, because we f****d it up.This is referring to when a vote of No Confidence in the leftie-boss was passed by his own MPs in  but he refused to step down.The leak is a blow for Labour as they were hoping to give Mr Ashworth a prominent role in the closing days of the campaign as they attack the Tories on the NHS.But with the shadow health secretary already pulling out of media appearances as he faced questions over his damning comments, it places the party on the back foot. On voters hating Jeremy CorbynHe said: “I’ve been going round these national places, it’s dire for Labour.“It’s awful for them and it’s the combination of Corbyn and Brexit….outside of the city seats… it’s abysmal out there… they can’t stand Corbyn and they think Labour’s blocked Brexit.“I think middle-class graduates – remainy people – Labour’s doing well among… but not in big enough numbers to deny the Tories a majority.” On Mr Corbyn’s chances of reaching NoHe said: “I just can’t see it happening.“It wouldn’t surprise me – for sake of argument – we held Canterbury because of sort of middle-class, -reading people, but then the Tories take Bolsover off of Labour it wouldn’t surprise me.“The electoral map has being going topsy-turvey because of Brexit and Corbyn.” On a Labour coup to get rid of Mr Corbyn“No because we f****d it up we fucked it up in  when we went too early. People like me were internally saying ‘this isn’t the right moment’ but I got kind of ignored.“But I don’t think we’re going to get there In Mansfield, in Ashfield, it’s dire for the Labour Party up there, these traditional working areas.” On getting rid of Mr Corbynthe Tories get a majorityHe said: “That’s the thing that’s on our minds… I think things can change quickly I think things change more quickly anyway now.” On Mr Corbyn being a risk to national securityHe said: “I don’t know, on the security stuff I worked in No., I think the machine will pretty quickly move to safeguard security .“But it’s not going to happen! I can’t see it happening!”Mr Ashworth has hit back the tape and said it was just banter between two “mates” but conceded it had made him look like a plonker.He told the BBC’s Victoria Derbyshire: “I was having a bit of banter with a Tory friend of mine, at least I thought he was a friend, a Tory activist called Greig Baker.“He was like the Tories are going to lose and I said ‘no you’re going to be fine’. Joshing as old friends do and he’s only gone and leaked it to a website.It’s a bit of joshing, because he’s an activist, it’s a bit like saying to your mate who’s a fan of a rival football team. You’re trying to unnecessarily boost their ego and make them become complacent.“He was my friend, I went to America with this guy  years ago and he’s leaked it all – I can’t believe it. It’s joshing around and he’s leaked it, I can’t believe it. We’re supposed to be mates.”Tory chairman James Cleverly saidMr Corbyn own “lieutenants” can’t trust him – then voters should not either.He said: “This is an honest and truly devastating assessment of Jeremy Corbyn’s leadership by one of his most trusted election lieutenants.“He admits that Labour has blocked Brexit and that is why voters ‘can’t stand Corbyn’.If even Corbyn’s closest political allies think he is unfit to be Prime Minister, why on earth should voters be expected to put their trust in him and them.“Corbyn’s Labour have broken their promises to the British people on Brexit and they will not be able to deliver their fantasy manesto.“As Ashworth himself says, only a vote for Boris Johnson and the Conservatives will mean we can get Brexit done.”The Tories seized on his comments to warn that Mr Corbyn’s opposition to Nato and nuclear weapons, and links with terrorists make him unfit to be PM.In a speech in Uttoxeter Mr Johnson called Mr ­Corbyn a “Hamas-backing, IRA-supporting, anti-Semitism- ­condoning appeaser of the Kremlin”.He said: “If you doubt me, look at what his health spokesman said. He revealed he thought his own leader is a security risk.”The Tory leader added: “Jon Ashworth made it absolutely clear the reason Mr Corbyn is failing to persuade some people to vote for him is he is blocking Brexit — he won’t get Brexit done.”"},{"url":null,"title":"these remainers want brexit done so are voting tory","story":"Brits who voted to stay in  told The Sun that the country should go with the will of the majority at the time, and carry out what the majority decided.Just two days to go before voters head to the polls, many of them admitted they had changed their mind on politics - showing that anything could happen in Thursdays historic election.All of them said they would now vote for Boris Johnsons Conservatives to deliver Brexit.Speaking outside Parliament this week one voter said: “For many years I voted for Labour, but Corbyn is totally incompetent and frankly dim, so I have absolutely no respect for him.She was also furious at the Lib Dems, saying: “Ah, the Limp Dims!

The same poll said that an even lower number of  Lib Dem voters,  per cent, want another referendum.On a BBC Question Time special, Mr Corbyn said he would take a “neutral stance” in a second referendum, and would refuse to publicly back a side.According to a YouGov poll last week, a signicant proportion of Remain-voting Labour supporters aren’t sure about this policy.Only  per cent of Labour supporters who voted Remain think it’s “a good outcome.”The Labour leader was attacked by the PM, who called it a failure of leadership.Sally told The Sun that she was a former Labour voter, and disagreed with Mr Corbyns position: “With the Conservatives, I’m not really looking beyond Brexit, but I know what the other parties are doing I don’t agree with.“I voted Lib Dems many, many years ago.I’m ashamed to say in the last election I voted for Corbyn.”These Remainers now think that the only way to deliver Brexit is to vote Conservative.Earlier this month, YouGov published data which said that  per cent of Remain voters in  believe that the Tories will “get Brexit done”.In an even starker finding, results from Deltapoll show that  per cent of Remain voters think a Conservative government led by Boris Johnson “would be best for dealing with the issue of Brexit”.Three years after the  referendum, it seems as though the British public will finally make it clear that they want Brexit done."},{"url":null,"title":"shipwreck mediterranean greek roman jesus","story":"The boat was found off the coast of Greece with preserved jugs used to preserve wine and food.The containers - known as amphorae - were also thought to be carrying olive oil and grains.Experts reckon the merchant ship measures m inand m in width.Archaeologist Dr George Ferentinos said: Its half-buried in the sediment, so we have high expectations thatwe go to an excavation in the future we will find part or the whole wooden hull.He hopes the wreck can be raised in full from the bottom of the Mediterranean.But a final decision on salvaging it has not been made.The ship is believed to have been in operation between the first century BC and the first century AD.The jars have been analysed by experts who determined they were used by the Greeks and Romans.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the PM even ditched cuts for higher paid in order to fund it.Boris promised he would freeze income tax, VAT and National Insurance for the next five years, as well as cut NI for the Brits earning the least.The promised tax cuts will save  million people £ next year, the Tories claim.And the PM recently hinted he would also scrap the hated TV licence, so families could save even more on their costs.On issues that are traditionally the most important to working class voters, Boris comes out on top, polls have shown.Almost half of Brits think the current government is tackling unemployment totally well, and  per cent of people think a Tory government led by Boris will provide more jobs.On who Brits think will keep prices down, the Conservatives have a nine point lead against the Labour party.Ms Ainsley, who has written a report on low-income voters being locked out of political debate, warned the Tories that they would need to deliver the promises they had made in order to keep the support of the working class.She added:have seen parties make promises before and they havent seen fundamental change in their communities.Many of their communities feel worse off than they did before so all politicians are going to have to deliver.Former Work and Pensions Secretary and Conservative candidate for Tatton, Esther McVey, said the modern incarnation of the Labour party has become too detached from the working class.She told The Sun Online: Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnells Labour is nothing at all like the Labourgrew up with.They wouldnt understand the concerns of a Labour voterthey fell over one in the street, she said.People understand sounds too good to be true, it iniably is,people are doing a four day week they know it ultimately cant work out like that. is detached from reality.They are a metropolitan elite that is just detached from the day-to-day le of regular working people.They are not talking about things which resonate or relate or ordinary people.Working class voters flocked to the Leave campaign in  and made up a huge  per cent of the vote to leave the EU.Those who voted to Leave have been left disillusioned by Jeremy Corbyns ambiguous neutral stance on Brexit and promises for a second referendum.Mr Corbyns recent Brexit position comes after years of wavering and failing to articulate a clear point on one of the biggest issues facing the UK.It has gone down appallingly with working class voters, predominately in traditional Labour heartlands, who have turned now turned their backs on the Labour party.Even Unite boss Len McCluskey, a Corbyn supporter, warned he was losing working class support after a poll of , Labour members showed the parties failure to back Brexit was hitting them hard in the Midlands and North of the country.The crash in support for Labour - and the Tories after failing to get Brexit done in March - led to huge wins for the Brexit party in the European elections earlier this year.As Boris continues to fight for his pledge to get Brexit done, Tory insiders are confident that left behind Labour voters will turn to the Conservatives.While Mr Corbyn has been campaigning for the many, not the few, his party has become dominated by posh career politicians who are out of touch with the working class.Academics at UCL released a report into the decline of working class Labour MPs: in the s seven out of  came from working class backgrounds, now that number is only one in .The lack of real world experience has alienated the voters the Labour party claim to champion.Retiring Labour MP Gloria de Piera warned her party is in the midst of a war for its soul and must reconnect with what was once the workers party.When voting intention is categorised by education level, the Labour party haemorrhage even more votes.In   per cent of people with GCSEs or below voted for Labour, as few as  per cent of equivalent voters intend to cast ballots for Mr Corbyns big spending party on Thursday.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A decent majority will liberate him to secure Brexit by January .But Boris also has a zeal to radically improve Sun readers’ lives — and we would hold him to it.His rival for PM, Marxist Jeremy Corbyn, was yesterday branded a danger to national security by one of his OWN senior front-benchers, shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth. A Boris victory would kill off that threat for ever.He would then be able to pour £billion extra into the NHS, hire , more cops to hammer crime, inject substantial new funding into schools and green-light multi-billion-pound, job-creating infrastructure projects.Plus, Boris will not raise income tax, National Insurance or VAT for five years.No sane politician can or should compete with the absurd freebies Corbyn claims he could dole out. Labour’s entire plan is a vast, ruinous fantasy, relying solely on the better-off sticking around to be hammered again and again for extra tax. The truth is everyone would pay for Marxist revolution.Boris, by contrast, would not bankrupt Britain. Nor wage war on private companies, as Corbyn would, and scare off investors, causing mass job losses.And, crucially, he tends to achieve what he sets out to. He ran for Mayor in Labour-dominated London and won twice. He led the Leave campaign to victory against the Remainer establishment. He was written off as a futureTory leader but won that too. He doggedly pursued, and won, the new Brexit deal every know-all said was impossible.Boris is being subjected to a tsunami of hate from Corbyn’s thugs and diehard Remainers who know he is Brexit’s last hope. Almost all of it is confected cobblers. Boris is as liberal as any of them.He is nothing like their hard-right caricature and they know it. Had he backed Remain they would love him.Boris is the right man to lead Britain into the s. And the alternative, as Corbyn’s own front-benchers privately admit, is too horric to think about.Vote Tory tomorrow.HEARING Corbyn branded a national security risk by one of his most senior frontbenchers is almost too much to grasp.Jon Ashworth, shadow health secretary, believes that his own leader is a danger to Britain. ThatCorbyn becomes PM on Friday the civil service will need to act rapidly to keep us all safe.The Sun has long considered Corbyn an unprecedented threat to our country. He is far closer to terrorists like Hamas than our No ally, America, which he detests. Our security partners would not trust him with classied information.But this taped confession tells us much about those around him too.In public Ashworth is a loyal Corbynista. In private he says Corbyn is a security threat and a loser who blocked Brexit. He longs to replace him with someone “half-decent”.He and his allies know their leader to be useless. Worse, they are beseeching voters to hand power to an extremist they know endangers every one of us.How can they look themselves in the mirror Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But here there is nowhere to go.“We are all on top of one another.“No one is giving us straight answer. I just want an answer.”The couple added the conservatory to their council home and made changes in the loft without permission from building control or housing, the council has said.But Solly claims he was given the go-ahead for the conservatory and insists the only works he carried out in the loft were to put plywood flooring down and plasterboard on the sides.They were booted out of their home of  years as a result of a prohibition order in response to a “category  hazard”.Solly said: I know we shouldn’t have, but I did it to make the family more comfortable. It was there four – five years.“Then the council came round to do an inspection, looked in the loft and told us we weren’t meant to have a bedroom in the loft.“But there are ten of us in a three bedroom house. We needed extra space. I didn’t do it out of maliciousness.

Tell us how much money you are requesting between £, and £,. Please note there are a limited number of larger grants available. The Sun Readers’ Fund , that decides who gets what and how much, will be looking to donate the majority of the £million as small grants to help as many good causes as possible.BY POSTIf you don’t have access to the internet, post your nomination to: Sun Readers’ Fund, The Sun, , London Bridge Street, London SE GF. Lamar, who is on the autistic spectrum, had been overlooked by other potential parents until we ran our story as part of the annual adoption drive to find loving “forever families” for children.Jan says: “We were drawn to Lamar immediately, even though he had challenging behaviour at that point in his le — he had had quite a rough start in le.“The reality is that a lot of these children are lost, they’re hurting and you have to put in a lot of work to get them to a place of being the best versions of themselves.”Tony says: “A child like Lamar can get moved from foster carer to foster carer. But you can break that cycle and give a child a home, and do the best you can.“My thought was, because he has a condition, you can’t just leave him, so that drew us more towards him.”Tony remembers the moving moment when he officially became Lamar’s dad and says: “One of the great joys was the feeling when we had to change all the paperwork into our surname.“The judge called Lamar up and sat him on his knees while the judge was signing the form, then he said, ‘You’re now a Coombs’. That was a fulfilling day.” Lamar has flourished in his adoptive family, he is making strong progress with his schoolwork and is very sporty, particularly enjoying running and rugby.He is also a gted street dancer, who has won numerous competitions and trophies, and hopes to forge a career in modelling.Speaking to The Sun, Lamar comes over as a typical teenage boy — obsessed with sport and, of course, social media. He says: “I like hanging out with friends, going bowling and going to theme parks. I now have almost , followers on Instagram.“Some of my favourite family memories have been of the holidays we have been on, like to Cuba.”Jan and Tony reckon Lamar has come on leaps and bounds and they are both hugely proud of the determination he has shown over the years.Jan says: “He’s doing really well in school, the headteacher has sung his praises.”Two years before Tony first made that excited call to Jan about Lamar, the couple had adopted another child, Shai, again thanks to a newspaper campaign for National Adoption Week.But before adopting, they had never planned to start a family. Jan says: “Believe it or not, I never actually wanted to have children. If it wasn’t for National Adoption Week, we may not have even started. That was the start of the road for us.”As Shai got older, the couple then began to think again about adopting. Janet says: “We would go away on holiday and think, ‘He’s on his own, he’s on the beach with no one to play with — he needs a brother’.“But adopting Lamar took almost a year to complete because we had to go through loads of meetings and .“Social workers had originally thought Lamar would be better off as an only child, because he is very high-energy and had experienced a few problems with a previous foster carer’s son.“But we managed to persuade them that he would be able to live with our family. Lamar finally came home with us in the April of , nine months after we had first seen him in The Sun.”Lamar and Shai have grown close over the years and get on well, but for the occasional tf.Jan says: “Most of the time we all sit at the table and eat together, and that’s when we take the mickey out of each other — or on WhatsApp throughout the day.”Tony adds: “It’s all been joyful. You have the ups and downs, which is normal with children, but on the whole it’s a real joy.”Looking again at that original Sun story, Jan says: “Seeing the picture of Lamar is amazing because he is still like this. He is still very bright and mischievous.” Tony adds: “If I hadn’t seen him in the newspaper, we wouldn’t be where we are today.“It’s only when you look back at things like this, you think, ‘Oh my God, I’m so glad we’ve done it’. It reminds you. It grounds you.“You can take things for granted sometimes when the children are growing up and you go through dferent stages in their le.“But looking back at this article again brings back all those memories. It will be nice to give the article to Lamar when he is older — not to say, ‘Look what we have done’ but just as a way of being appreciative of our le together.”Ever since he was a toddler, Lamar has loved rollercoasters. At first, he got a thrill from just looking at the rides, then as he got older, he has grown braver and the family has travelled to theme parks all over the UK for him.Lamar says: “Going to theme parks with my family are some of my favourite memories of growing up. We have been to Thorpe Park, Blackpool, Drayton Manor, Chessington, Six Flags, all of them.“I remember going to Blackpool — the big red rollercoaster, that’s scary. It makes your tummy feel well weird.”But while Lamar has always loved the ups and downs of a rollercoaster ride, thanks to Jan and Tony his le could not have been more stable. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

but the other path follows a far darker course into chaos under Jeremy Corbyn’s Marxist cult.A Johnson victory should usher in a new age of prosperity and national freedom, while a Corbyn triumph will end in Brexit paralysis and financial bankruptcy.A Tory Government will ensure that Britain remains an advanced western economy, where taxes are kept down and enterprise encouraged, where as a Labour Government will turn our country into a basket case, wrecked by trade union bullying and the confiscation of wealth.Every citizen who genuinely cares about our future and cherishes British values therefore has a duty to vote against Corbyn’s hard-left Labour.In practice, that requires everyone - from Tory Remainers to hard Brexiteers - backing the Tories - because only a vote for Boris Johnson can be guaranteed to prevent a brutal Corbyn regime.A vote for the Liberal Democrats or the Brexit Party is not a wasted vote in this election -its something far more dangerous.It is effectively an act of support for Corbyn, forthere is another hung Parliament he will almost certainly emerge as the new Prime Minister.The same is true of moderate, centrist Labour voters who kid themselves that they can back their local Labour candidate while still hoping to avoid the calamity of a Corbyn Government.This is just irresponsible self-deceit. Every vote for Labour brings the Corbyn revolution a step closer.That catastrophe could easily happen this week.In recent opinion polls, the Tories have maintained a consistent lead over Labour by about  per cent - enough for a comfortable majority.But in some surveys, the gap has fallen to just  points, while one poll at the weekend suggested a Conservative majority of just .Moreover, as the last two General Elections proved, the polls can be badly wrong. The result this time could go down to the wire.What the country needs to ensure Corbyn’s defeat is a vast coalition of voters united by the one aim of keeping him out of Downing Street.This was meant to be the Brexit election but it has rightly turned into a referendum on Corbyn’s spectacular unfitness for high office.And the only result should be a wholesale rejection of his bid for power.To achieve that, all anti-Corbyn voters – no matter what their past allegiances or their personal hostility to Johnson – must vote tactically for the Conservatives.Jeremy Corbyn and his shadow Chancellor John McDonnell must be stoppedThroughout the campaign, Remain supporters have talked feverishly of the potential for anti-Tory tactical voting to stop Brexit.But far more potent would be a wave of pro-Tory tactical voting to keep out Corbyn.At the heart of such a drive must lie the millions of decent, patriotic voters in Labour’s heartlands of the North and the Midlands, who have backed the party all their lives but are now profoundly disillusioned with Corbyn.If they held their noses and supported Johnson, then Labour would face annihilation.There are already signs that this could be happening.The so-called “Red Wall” of around  Labour marginals from Yorkshire to Wales, characterised by seats like Bolsover in Derbyshire and Crewe in Cheshire, appears to be crumbling.If a new army of Red Tory voters materialises on Thursday, the damage to Corbyn could be phenomenal.This week were reports that Labour are even in trouble in Leigh, where Joanne Platt has a majority of almost , and which is only th on the Tories’ target list.Similarly, the latest poll in the Lincolnshire port of Grimsby, which has been held by Labour for generations, shows a big lead for the Tories.This mood of revolt against political loyalties was captured in the words of one café worker in Labour-held Wrexham, North Wales, who said at the weekend: “I’ve always voted Labour and my family always voted Labour. On Thursday I shall be voting Tory.”People like her recognise that traditional Labour – the party of Clem Attlee, John Smith and Tony Blair – is now dead, replaced by a dogmatic, intolerant movement dedicated to the overthrow of capitalism.The election campaign has only reinforced Labour’s unfitness for office.Lavish pledges of free services and extravagant spending increases have been dished out like confetti, shattering the last remnants of the party’s economic credibility.Meanwhile, Labour has nothing coherent to say about Brexit beyond the threat of yet more dither and delay.It is no wonder that the five million Labour voters who backed Leave in the  referendum are in such despair.Boris himself put it well on a visit to Grimsby yesterday when he said that Labour’s Brexit stance represented “the great betrayal, orchestrated from Islington by politicians who sneer at your values and ignore your votes.”But it is not just Leave voters who should back the Tories. Remainers who loathe the idea of a Corbyn regime should do so as well.A hard-left Government is too big a price for stopping Brexit, for which the British people democratically voted three years ago.The arch pro-EU Tory rebel Dominic Grieve, now standing as an independent in his Beaconsfield constituency, said recently that he was “absolutely satisfied that Mr Corbyn would be a disaster in Downing Street.”Yet Grieve is making that dire possibility more likely by trying to siphon off votes from the Tory party.Indeed, all the opposition parties are acting as Corbyn’s allies, whatever their protestations.Nigel Farage’s Brexit party, in particular, could still badly split the anti-Corbyn vote in a string of Northern and Midlands seats, like Hartlepool.The latest poll in the constituency shows the Brexit Party on  per cent and the Tories on  per cent, a far higher combined total of Labour’s  per cent.In Doncaster North, held by Ed Miliband, Labour is on  per cent against a combined total of  per cent for the Brexit Party and the Conservatives.Further south, a vote for Jo Swinson’s Liberal Democrats is realistically a vote for Corbyn, just as in Scotland, support for the SNP will help to propel Corbyn into Downing Street.The choice is stark. Our country’s security, liberty and growth can only be secured by theof a Conservative Government.There is nothing to fear from the continuation in office of Boris Johnson, who stands in the long tradition of one-nation Conservatism epitomised by Benjamin Disraeli and Winston Churchill.But there is everything to fear from Corbyn’s ascent to power.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Labour leader said he “feels the pain” of millions of people trying to get by and is determined to make the country a fairer place. And he made a heartfelt promise to protect the NHS after our stories about desperate families struggling to get treatment from the struggling health service. In his final interview before polling day, Mr Corbyn revealed what put the fire in his belly as he appealed to undecided voters to back him to be the next Prime Minister. “I feel the pain of the people I represent, the pain of trying to bring up children in a small overcrowded flat, and wanting them to do well and wanting them to achieve at school,” he said. “I think of the people saying theyaposve got three children with quite wide age gap sharing a bedroom, one wants to play music, one wants to do their homework, one wants to play with lego on the floor. “They just end up fighting for space, then those children donapost achieve what they could at school and their whole le path is damaged because we, the community as a whole, did not provide the housing they need. Itaposs that sort of thing that drives me to change things in our society.” Speaking to the Mirror on Labouraposs battlebus in the North West of England, he added: “Le can be cruel to many people and I want us to have a much fairer society.” Mr Corbyn revealed that his first act on becoming PM would be to allocate emergency funding for more hostel places to help those sleeping on the streets. “Iaposll do something urgently about the rough-sleeping crisis around the country as a symbol of what we are determined to do to end the injustice of the housing crisis,” he said. Labour will also prioritise shoring up the NHS in its first weeks in power – after the Mirror published a series of devastating stories about children struggling to get treatment. “It is an utter disgrace in a civilized world, we can do better. It indicates just how desperate the situation is in our health service,” he said.  But he backed away from personally attacking Boris Johnsonaposs handling of the situation. “I would rather go out there and be positive about what we want to achieve. People can make their own judgements on Boris Johnson when confronted with a picture of a child on the floor of the hospital, compared with the approach that we would take.” He praised his shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth as “absolutely brilliant” despite a leaked conversation in which he predicted they would lose the election as a result of Brexit and Mr Corbynaposs leadership. The Labour leader revealed Mr Ashworth had called him up straight away and was “mortied” and “very upset” that his “banter” had been published. “Heaposs working flat out for a Labour government. I know that and I think heaposs been absolutely brilliant on health and I think we just move on,” Mr Corbyn said. But he acknowledged candidatesapos concerns that Labouraposs Brexit policy was coming up regularly on the doorstep in Leave seats. He admitted that many people were “fed up” with Brexit but that any deal needed to be one that protected people’s livelihoods and security. “Iaposm sure many people are fed up and bored with it,” he said. “Iaposve had as my bottom line that I would prevent a no deal Brexit and would prevent a trade deal with Donald Trump that would sell off our public services.” He admitted it was going to be “dficult” to resolve the issue once and for all but he wanted to try to represent both the % and % as it was the “sensible, grown-up” approach. “I recognise that itaposs going to be dficult. I donapost want to represent just the % or the %, I want to represent the people as a whole”. A Labour government would spend three months negotiating a Leave deal with the EU that wouldnapost destroy industry and then put it – and Remain – to a public confirmatory vote in six months. Its negotiating team would include Brexiteer Labour MPs as well as Remainer ones. “It will be people who have dfering views,” he said. But he admitted his decision not to campaign for either side was “not easy”. He added: “What  could we as a party do to represent people who voted both ways in the referendum  Anything  would be even harder.”  And he warned that under Boris Johnson the risk of a damaging no deal Brexit at the end of  was very high. Mr Corbyn, who has been accused of not being tough enough on security, insisted the first job of any government was to “keep the country safe and secure”. He talked passionately about the welfare of armed forces personnel and cited their pride in missions including rescuing refugees, dealing with the Ebola crisis and UN peacekeeping. “Our armed services are there, yes to protect us against attack, but also there to deal with the insecurities that come from poverty, from environmental disaster and from refugee flows.” Asked whether he could envisage a scenario where he would be prepared to deploy troops for security reasons, he replied: “I would hope we didnapost have to, but of course you have to be prepared to defend society”. Throughout his leadership, Mr Corbyn has faced allegations of not dealing with anti-semitism in party ranks swtly or tough enough. “Antisemitism is utterly evil. Obviously weaposll continue to clamp down on it,” he said. He suggested that Labour could adopt recommendations from the ongoing Equality and Human Rights Commission inquiry in full. “Theyaposre only looking at processes and so yes... Weaposd look at it of course. I would imagine we would implement them but theyaposve not made any suggestions yet.” Mr Corbyn was last week accused of being unpatriotic for not watching the Queenaposs Christmas message – but claried that he had watched news bulletins in the morning. “When her Majesty finally gets to make the speech we all know whataposs in it because weaposve seen the trails on it. There was a bit of miscommunication between the interviewer and myself on that. I think weaposre now cool.” He and we Laura Alez, who was sitting next to him on the battle bus, would celebrate Christmas together “hopefully in No , thataposs the idea”. He claimed that “we both” do the cooking but was interrupted by his we who added: “Mainly me”. What was he getting her for Christmas  “A present.” They laughed. “Something nice and something surprising”. But would he have the time to go shopping  “I make time. If you want something done, ask a busy person.” Mr Corbyn claimed he was able to cope with the scale of personal abuse he sometimes faced from the media – but that he worried about his family. “It gets to people around me more than it does me. It is very stressful for family and friends who get very angry on my behalf and feel thereaposs been a lot of unfairness. “I have been active in politics all of my le and I do it because I believe in it. You get personal abuse. Iaposm not replying to it, Iaposm not getting into the gutter with anybody.” He did not criticise Labour candidates for choosing not to put his name or picture on leaflets. “Itaposs up to them what they put on their literature. Nothing bothers me. The only thing that bothers me is winning the election. Itaposs not a Presidential election, itaposs a parliamentary election and Iaposm proud to be Leader of the party.” Mr Corbyn ruled out endorsing tactical voting but admitted he was “looking forward” to seeing Iain Duncan Smith, the architect of universal credit, lose his seat to his Labour rival.  “Iaposm not in favour of tactical voting. I want the Labour message to be there clearly all across the country.” He has ruled out forming a coalition in the event of a hung Parliament and asked whether he would stand downhe lost insisted: “I donapost intend to lose”. But after shadow chancellor John McDonnell appealed for the next Labour leader to be a woman, Mr Corbyn yesterday admitted there was a “fair case” for that to happen. He also hopes that in the future there would be two Labour deputies – a man and a woman. Mr Corbyn revealed the first thing he would do on walking through the famous black door of No  would be to check out the coffee machine – so he would be equipped to work late into the night.

The squirming Tory leader refused to even look at the photo when confronted by a TV reporter. At one point the mumbling PM even pocketed the reporter’s mobile to avoid doing so. The shocking tale prompted Louise Webb, , to contact the Mirror after her nine-month old baby, Lily, was forced to wait six hours for a bed. Louise had taken Lily to the Countess of Chester Hospital near their Ellesmere Port home, after she deteriorated following weeks of illness.

Research for Age UK shows three-quarters of over-s say their TV offers an insight into the modern world, with % saying television helps them feel less alone. Charity director Caroline Abrahams said: “As the UK prepares to go to the polls it is salutary to remember just how important the TV is to many older people, not only as a source of companionship but also as a means of keeping up with a rapidly changing world and the twists and turns in the le of our nation.  “For many older people their TV is their principal way of knowing what is going on, both here and abroad, and of feeling part of the big moments that affect us all – whether that’s the outcome of an election, a major sporting success, or important national events such as Remembrance Day. “We underestimate at our peril just how much feeling part of these things means to many older people. “Let’s not make tomorrow the last time some of our over-s are able to turn on their TV to watch the general election coverage – because by the next time they will have had to switch off their television for good, or risk court action for non-payment of a bill they simply cannot afford.” Labour has promised to save free licences for the over-s but the Tories have called on the BBC to stump up.Bectu broadcasting union chief Philippa Childs said: “Ahead of the upcoming election, we would urge the next government to take responsibility for funding free licence fees for over s. “As a public service broadcaster, the BBC is a vital leline for older people, providing news, drama and entertainment for the vulnerable - but they shouldn’t be expected to administer a welfare benefit. “The next Government should recognise the value of BBC to the country, fund it properly to deliver excellent output and stop treating it as a political football.”The warning comes after Boris Johnson threatened to axe the licence fee as he stepped up his bitter war on the media this week. The Prime Minister said he was “certainly looking at” abolishing TV licences - casting doubt on the corporation’s vital funding as he toured target seats in the run-up to the general election.The revelation could force the BBC to become a subscription-only service like Netflix , Sky or Amazon Prime.Viewers currently pay £. for a TV licence, regardless of whether they watch the BBC. The Tories are also thought to be considering decriminalising non-payment of the licence fee.  The Conservatives promised at the  election to protect free licences for the over-s for the rest of the Parliament, which had been due to run until . But the BBC had already been handed responsibility for funding the leline from June , under a deal stitched up in . The corporation says continuing to fund free licences would have cost £million - a fth of its budget - by -. That is equivalent to what it spends on BBC, BBC, BBC, the BBC News Channel, and children’s stations CBBC and CBeebies.  The corporation plans to curb the benefit, meaning just . million OAPs are likely to continue receiving free licences when restrictions take effect next Spring. Only over-s receiving Pension Credit will be eligible - meaning % of over-s, some . million OAPs, will have to stump up to watch their favourite shows.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWalk through the streets of Chingford canvassing with Labour’s Faiza Shaheen, and the memories come flooding back. “There’s the Greggs I used to work at,” she points out, as we walk past the War Memorial. “That’s the Iceland where my mum used to know the price of everything.”Faiza is the local Labour candidate within a heartbeat of unseating the former leader of the Conservative Party Iain Duncan Smith.Should she overturn his majority of just ,, millions would see it as poetic justice. “Symbolically,” Faiza says, “I think it would mean a lot, to a lot of people.”Millionaire IDS is the architect of welfare ‘reforms’ including Universal Credit , the bedroom tax, and a myriad of disability cuts, who symbolises the cruelty of nine years of Tory government.Faiza’s mum, Nuzhat, a laboratory researcher, relied on disability benefits to survive while she was waiting for a heart transplant, and is one of those who were humiliatingly reassessed. “This is personal for me,” Faiza, , says. “I think people talk a lot about the cuts and the money, but the pain that those policies have caused is horric. The first time it even got in my head that I should even run here was when I watched I, Daniel Blake, the Ken Loach film, because I know that experience to be true, and I saw it in my mum, the indignity in how she was treated by the state.” In , Nuzhat died from an infection following the transplant. Her last hours were spent waiting for help on a trolley in an over-run NHS hospital, struggling under Tory cuts. “Mum was a classic front-of-the-Mirror story on a trolley,” Faiza says, her voice catching. “She was so vulnerable to infection, she’d just had a heart transplant’.” If there is a point on the map that most symbolises the fight between Labour and the Tories this election it is right here. “There’s no undoing that pain that was caused,” Faiza says. “But I do think there’ll be a bit of justice for everyone that went through thatwe can get Iain Duncan Smith out.” As we walk around the corner to see the two-bedroom terrace where she grew up, it’s clear there’s more to the story of Faiza’s childhood. “I’d stand here some nights,” she says, “looking at the house, dreading going in”.  Her story comes tumbling out. “My dad isn’t a good man,” Faiza says. “He was a temperamental character. Moody and a very dficult person to live with, especially for my mum.” She hesitates. “To the point that people would come to my house and find my mum beaten up. That’s why the community is so important to me now, because people did have to look out for us.” Her Fijian father, a car mechanic, had settled in Chingford in the s but met Faiza’s mum in Pakistan when he was visiting his sister who had settled there. In England, he had experienced racism so severe that at one point a man set fire to the newspaper he was reading. He taught his kids the teachings of Martin Luther King, as well as how to punch, in case of being confronted by racists. “We lived in Walthamstow for a couple of years and that was a really bad time for us,” Faiza remembers. “My dad left for a while, the house didn’t really have any heating, it was really atrocious, my mum was on benefits. Then my grandma made him come back from Fiji and we all moved to South Chingford.” She looks up. “Mum’s le was so unfair,” she says. “Within six months of my dad eventually leaving for good, she went for a routine test and her heart burst. I’m sure it was related. Coming from Pakistan, orce was a big deal.”  Her mother was fiercely bright and fought all her le to be recognised. “When mum was growing up in Pakistan, she went on hunger strike to stay in education,” Faiza says. In later le, Nuzhat went on to join a pioneering medical team working on stem cell research at the Royal London Hospital, as a researcher. “She never got enough credit for the work she was doing.” Faiza says. “Mum ended up winning an out-of-court settlement. But she lost her job, the thing she wanted most of all.” Instead Nuzhat put her hopes into her children, naming her middle child ‘Faiza’, which means ‘winner’, and ‘Shaheen’ which means, ‘flies high’.” These are the names that the Labour candidate now uses, the ones on the posters looking out across Chingford. “I dropped my dad’s surname,” Faiza shrugs. “It’s nothing to do with me any more.” She tells a story of her dad coming to see her at Oxford University. “He was crying, which was strange because my dad never cried,” Faiza says. “He said: ‘All those years ago in Fiji and we would do test papers with Oxford University Press at the top and I never thought my daughter would come here’.”  She went to see her father, with her husband the Prison Break actor Akin Gazi, because she had heard he was dying. “I told him mum had died,” she says. Faiza says it’s her mum who was the fighter, but Faiza too has been fighting her whole le. She went to Chingford County High School, the same school as David Beckham and Harry Kane. “After that, my mum’s plans for me always included Oxford, a Masters, and Phd,” she laughs. “Which was statistically so unlikely.” Having achieved all three, Dr Shaheen now runs a thinktank, the Centre for Labour and Social Studies . “Obviously, my mum was disappointed,” Faiza laughs. “She’s Pakistani, she wanted me to be a medic.” Now she faces a tough battle in Chingford and Woodford Green, where the election fight is as dirty as they come. “The lies and the gutter politics are straight out of Trump’s playbook,” she says. Nicknamed the ‘British AOC’ after the Democratic politician Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the Greggs where she once did early shts has sold out of vegan sausage rolls thanks to the hundreds of young activists come to canvas for her. We are back in her constituency office, in a parade of shops next to a Brexit-loving hairdressers. There are so many IDS posters in the window that it looks like it’s advertising the Chingford Skinhead.“This battle is even bigger than the NHS and Brexit ,” Faiza warns. “It’s about values that will be held at the very top of our society and it really does scare me that that set of values could win. That’s why we’re fighting so hard, that’s why all these people are here. I just think that the stakes couldn’t be higher.”Her gaze strays to the pile of posters in the office. “Mum would have loved to see my poster in all these windows now,” Faiza says. “She’d be telling everyone, ‘that’s my daughter’.” She laughs. “My mum would always say, ‘my daughter is going to stand on the highest mountains’, that’s the translation from Urdu.” This Thursday, should Faiza Shaheen bring down Iain Duncan Smith, the voters of Chingford and Woodford Green may start to see that prophecy come true.

That is my election message to Daily Mirror readers. The choice on  December is between a Labour government that will repair the damage done to your communities by a decade of austerity, or a continuation of Tory cuts and crises. Working people know which Party is on their side. Which Party offers real change – and can be trusted to deliver it. It will never be Boris Johnson’s Conservatives. They are the Party of the well-to-do and the privileged, and we can be sure they will continue to put the interests of the rich first. Johnson thinks that Brexit is his trump card. And I know that many Mirror readers voted to leave the European Union in . I can understand why they did. I don’t live in the metropolitan bubble that many politicians seem to. Communities felt abandoned. Left behind as decent well-paid work was relocated where, town centres rotted, the sense of stability and security was destroyed and their opinions ignored. People are concerned about the greedy bosses who use and abuse migrant labour to undercut wages and conditions. It’s not the migrant workers who are to blame but the unscrupulous Companies and Agencies. But I tell you this. If the Tories get re-elected nothing is going to change. The left-behind won’t catch up. Our towns will be left to rot for another generation. Only Labour will fund an investment programme on the scale needed to fund the jobs and industries of the future. Only Labour will stop the undercutting of wages with Labour Market Regulations.  Only Labour will rebuild our public services by taxing the super-rich and the corporate elite who can afford to pay more. Only Labour will end the scandal of people depending on foodbanks to survive, and lt children and pensioners alike out of poverty. Only Labour will create a real Living Wage of £ an hour minimum, and end insecurity at work by giving all workers new rights and abolishing zero hours contracts and bogus self-employment. And only Labour will save the NHS from privatisation under the Tories, and give our hospitals, doctors and nurses the funding they need to do their job.  That is the sort of programme that our communities need. This election is about far more than “getting Brexit done”, which will not on its own solve a single pressing problem. That does not mean that we can just forget about Brexit. Unite has all along recognised the importance of delivering on the  referendum result. But Boris Johnson’s deal is a bad Tory deal that will see many thousands of jobs lost in our manufacturing industries, aswe haven’t lost enough already. Brexit does not need to risk jobs nor the sale of the NHS to Donald Trump’s pals. We can do better than that. That is why Labour will negotiate a Brexit deal that protects jobs and the rights of workers and consumers - rights that the Tories will rip up as soon as they get the chance.

The South Gloucestershire family has blamed a complete lack of signage after missing their flight from Bristol Airport to Paris and cutting short a planned trip to Disneyland. Jack Gray booked a trip to Disneyland with his five-year-old son Oliver and partner, expecting to fly out on Monday morning, BristolLive reported. Despite getting to the airport at .am, the Yate family missed the .am departure because of confusion over the queue to board. Jack said: “We were waiting for the fast-track passengers to board, but we hadn’t seen the normal passengers were queuing behind a pillar. It wasn’t signposted.” The -year-old mechanic ended up paying an extra £ for seats on the .pm flight to Paris – a price he branded “ridiculous”. Mangotsfield School pupil Oliver was left in tears, while his grandmother Helen described the family as “devastated”. Jack said: “We got checked in fine, and we were waiting around. At .am, they released the gate number we needed to go to. At .am they saw a big sign for the fast-track queue, so were were under the assumption they were doing fast passes first. “It got to .am and the board was saying the gate closed at am, Jack said. I thought they must be running behind.” At .am, with all queuers through the gate, the family made their way to the easyJet desk to get an update. “As we got there, the doors were closing,” Jack said. “The women at the desk said we’d missed our flight. “We were like, ‘Oh OK – how ’ It was all down to a complete lack of signage. There was no signpost for the normal queue. “One of the women said she’d radio through to try and get us on, but the departure people on the other end said no.” An employee at the desk then said a bus might be available to take the family to the plane, Jack claims. He said: “The woman radioed through again and I heard her say, ‘I already told them you said no, so it’s down to you.’  “It was so rude. If she’d said to the departure people that there was a five-year-old waiting to go to Disneyland, it could have been dferent. “We were really frustrated. If we’d got to the doors five seconds earlier, we would have made it.” Jack claims easyJet staff told him it had not done a last call on the tannoy because of a “silent airport” policy. He said an employee at the Bristol Airport information desk then told him there is no policy against last calls in the airport. Jack also alleges the information desk later told him the gate had shut at .am. He says the gate closure actually happened at .am. He added: “The guy on the desk offered us the .pm flight tickets for £ in total. When we didn’t accept that, he told us we could get it cheaper online. “He did not help in any way, shape or form, but I suppose he was the most helpful person there because at least he was giving us the truth.” Jack eventually booked the tickets online, costing a total of £, on top of the £ he paid for the initial tickets. He was frustrated at having lost a full day at Disneyland. “We’d woken up Oliver at am as a surprise. He hadn’t known we were going.

After the excitement of Christmas Day - the presents, the food and time spent with loved ones - the mood will start to sour the following day as families begin to grate on one another. Disagreements over board games, what to watch on TV and politics are among the most common niggles.

Four in  of all those polled admit they tend to get to a point when they cannot bear to spend any more time with their family.

But they have today hit out at their new accommodation - a tiny flat in Brentwood, Essex.Speaking today to Essex Live , Donna said: One of the children has autism and being in a confined space he suffers quite badly. Normally he can take himself off. But here there is nowhere to go.There’s nowhere for Solly to go, we are all on top of one another. No one is giving us straight answer. I just want an answer. Solly, -year-old Ryan and a nine-year-old are sleeping in the living room. Everyone , including Donna, Robert,  and Connor, , along with four children all aged under ten, are sharing one bedroom – two children are top and tailing in one bed. The other bedroom is inhabitable due to mould. But Brentwood Borough Council, which is controlled by the Tories, said none of the works on the previous three-bedroom house had the appropriate permissions from building control or housing. The family, who had been living there for  years, were rehomed after a prohibition order in response to a category  hazard was issued.  I know we shouldnapost have but I did it to make the family more comfortable. It was there four five years, Solly said. Then the council came round to do an inspection, looked in the loft and told us we weren’t meant to have a bedroom in the loft. But there are ten of us in a three bedroom house. We needed extra space. I didnapost do it out of maliciousness. I did it to house our family. The council says by removing and cutting away at the support joists, the remaining timbers were bearing six times their safe load. It adds that the conservatory can be seen pulling away from the wall. Solly said : The engineer said it is bearing six times the weight but all I did was put floorboards down and plaster board up. They said Iaposve removed joists which I havenapost. He believes the building inspector was in the property for around  minutes and didnapost even go in the loft before making a judgement.

Mum-of-two Deirdre McShane, , had been swimming with a friend on Monday morning when she got into dficulties in the high waves. Local resident Aine Paterson spotted both women in the sea when she was walking her dog on the beach along Co Antrim in Northern Ireland. She managed to pull one of them to safety before recovering Deirdreaposs body.Aine told Belfast Live : I went for my normal walk on the beach and saw what I thought was a big bit of drtwood being washed into the shore.“Then I thought it was maybe a seal but then I realised it was a person as I got closer. “She was trying to get out of the water and I just dragged her out of the water. Her legs failed and she kept passing out...I got her sitting up a little bit but then she would pass out again. When she looked out to the sea again, she saw another person in the water. I realised then there was somebody  in the water but the waves were so high, you just wouldnapost have seen anybody toady. I went into the water and there was just, well, she was gone at that point...I knew. I just wanted to get her body out of the sea.Deirdre had worked as a community midwe for many years in the Co Antrim area and was a member of the Frosses Medical Centre in  Ballymena  . A source said: “Deirdre was well known and well loved in the area. She was a fit and a very physically able woman who always seemed to be cheerful and ready to help anyone she could. “She had helped so many women and families over the years and welcomed hundreds of new lives with such ease and love, it’s just hard to fathom she’s been taken from us. “It’s well known she was one of the open water swimmers in the area and she seemed to go down with a group on a very regular basis to start the day with a swim. “Tragically today she’s died doing what she loved and her loss will leave a huge gap in this community. Now we are praying for the safe recovery of her friend who is also known to so many of us. The first call for help was made to the emergency services at .am and the Northern Ireland Ambulance Service sent a number of crews to the scene. The Coastguard also received a call around .am reporting two women in dficulty in the water.A spokesman said: “We tasked two RNLI leboats, one from Red Bay and one from  Portrush  and two coastguard rescue teams, one from Ballycastle and one from Coleraine. A Coastguard rescue helicopter was also sent to the scene. As the first team was arriving they reported that the two females were out of the water. The ambulance service was dealing with the casualties so we stood down the two RNLI leboats and the Coastguard helicopter. Deirdreaposs friend was taken to Causeway Hospital where doctors described her condition as aposstableapos. Cara McShane, SF councillor for Causeway Coast  Glens Borough Council said she was related to Deirdre McShane. She said: Ballycastle is reeling from this tragedy this morning. There would have been a large group of people who, on a daily basis, would have been swimming on the beach. Deirdre is such a lovable person, really well liked and loved. She is such a pillar of strength for her own two children - and she is such a careful and cautious person who wouldn’t have been doing anything that was at all reckless. This would have been a regular thing. She would have been going for a swim this morning and then going to work. She has a long term partner and we are all devastated for her immediate family. Deirdre worked as a community midwe so she would have been well known, particularly among young families. DUP election candidate for the area, Ian Paisley described the death of Deirdre as an aposabsolute tragedyapos. He said: It is a regular beauty spot for people to go swimming... and you usually find a lot of accomplished swimmers up round there. Unfortunately it appears one of these poor people have got into tragic circumstances, maybe caught in a riptide. Another person is in hospital, I understand quite seriously ill with hypothermia. My heart goes out to them and their families. A Northern Trust spokesperson also paid tribute to Ms McShane. They said: The Northern Trust team and in particular our midwery colleagues, are heartbroken by the tragic death of Deirdre McShane, who was a community midwe in the Ballycastle area. We extend our most sincere and heartfelt sympathies to her partner, her two beloved children and the wider family circle.

Please see ourPrivacy Noticefor details of your data protection rightsThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA -year-old who is one of Britainaposs youngest transgender children has started transitioning - after realising she was born in the aposwrong bodyapos aged just three. Ash Lammin, who was born a boy, began insisting that she was a girl as soon as she could speak, according to her mum. Terri, , said that watching her daughter - who was born Ashton - grow up confused and upset by her body was heartbreaking. She said: Although she was born male, from the moment she could speak Ash insisted she was a girl. By age five, she was asking aposwhen is someone going to chop my winky off apos - and questioning why she had it at all. Family photos from Ashaposs upbringing therefore mask a very dficult period for the family, who live near Ramsgate in Kent. In one, Ash is splashing around in a bath, wearing a sparkly mermaidaposs swimming costume and looking like an average three-year-old girl - obsessed with pink and wearing a princess dress, the sort of thing thataposs usually seen at birthday parties. But, Terri revealed, the only reason she was wearing her swimming costume in the bath was to hide her body - which had dismayed her from an early age. Ash says that it has been dficult growing up as a trans girl, but says she feels that she is firmly on the right path. She said: The journey is long and itaposs still going, but I feel like the sense of victory is there through it all. I do feel accepted sometimes, but other times not.  Not everyone is going to understand and people have to have their own opinions and I understand that. Some people might not like the idea of trans. I hope I inspire others but I just hope that love and acceptance comes through everything. According to her mum, Ash is the perfect example of a child who has been born in the wrong body. Now, aged almost , she is embarking on a y journey to transition her gender from male to female at an NHS-run clinic - and is one of the youngest in the country to do so. Ash - who changed her name by deed poll to Ashley when she was eight - will start by taking hormone blockers to halt the onset of puberty.  She has researched the process incessantly - and eventually wants a womb transplant so that she can be a mother when sheaposs older. While some critics have accused Terri of taking drastic decisions on behalf of a child who is too young to know better, she points out that Ash will take the blockers until she is . At that point, she herself will decide whether to go ahead with gender reassignment surgery. If she decides not to go ahead with it, Ash will come off the blocker - and her puberty will kick in just a few years later than her peers. Terri said: I never thought it was a phase, Ash was just Ash. When she was three she said to me, aposIaposm a boy because you gave me a boyaposs name - itaposs your fault.apos  I remember feeling horrible, because she blamed me. I personally thought maybe this was what an extremely camp gay man is like as a child. Iaposd never come across it before and I just went along with it. I just thought apos heaposs happy, well thataposs the main thing. But Terri, who has seven other children, said that le became much harder when Ash started at primary school. She said: I sent her to school in a boyaposs unorm. I felt awful, she didnapost want to wear it and I was making her. The school were great. The headmaster at the time said apos you think itaposs going to make le easier then bring Ash in a girlaposs unormapos, so I did. I was in a right state. I thought aposeverybody is going to think Iaposm weirdapos - but Ash loved it, she found it easy.  Before, when I was taking her into school, she was biting me and kicking me, she didnapost want to go in. As soon as she put the girlaposs unorm on, she wanted to go every day. Despite the schoolaposs willingness to help and the kindness of Ashaposs classmates, Terri says that other parents were very dficult - leaving her out of social events and complaining that Ash was using the girlsapos toilets. She added: When Ash was Ashton, she was invited to all the kidsapos parties, even though she used to turn up in a princess dress. The parents didnapost mind then. But as soon as I let her be Ashley all the time, for a whole year she didnapost get invited to one party. The kids were fine itaposs not the children, kids play with anybody. Itaposs not until an adult comes in and says you shouldnapost do that then it changes. When Ash turned  and went to secondary school, she became a target for bullies who would throw things at her on the bus and shout apostrannyapos at her - forcing Terri to take her out of the school after just one term.

By the end of January all playthings will have been removed from Daisy Chains nursery in Prestatyn, North Wales.Instead children will be able to play with everyday items such as pots, pans and crockery, the Daily Post reported. Fancy dress costumes such as princess outfits have also been thrown out, to be replaced with real clothes. The move has been welcomed by parents who support the schemesapos ambition to foster the imaginations of the nurseryaposs children. Rebecca Wright, who runs the nursery, said: I have always wanted the nursery to be toy free. Parents will have all had the situation where you buy a child a big expensive toy and then they play with the box, that should tell you something. When I told staff some were initially a little taken aback but they have quickly seen the benefits and everyone is fully onboard. Parents have loved it too, tech has its place and kids take pictures and make plans on iPads but parents love old school skills. Expensive toys take away imagination, with this everyone benefits, the children, staff and the envrionment.  Rebecca said that a lot of research had been done suggesting there were positive effects of putting children in a toy free environment. They are dressing up using real clothes, using household things like pots and pans, pieces of pipes or building blocks, she said. There was some apprehension  over the crockery but everything we use is risk assessed. We need thinkers and doers. We need people who think outside of the box, we will need creative thinkers for the jobs that we will be creating in  years time.

But after the latter party in April , it is alleged McPaul, then , raped her in her bed and said: This is one of those unfortunate things that happen. Heaposs also alleged to have said: Oh, no, this is really awkward. Prosecuting today at Oxford Crown Court, Matthew Walsh said: [McPaul] was on top of her and she came-to in a confused state. In fact as you will hear in this case, there is no argument between the prosecution and defence about one thing - that the defendant had penetrated her vagina with his penis.  That had taken place, he accepts that. What is at issue is firstly whether she was consenting to that, agreeing to it taking place, andnot,she was not consenting, whether the defendant reasonably believed that she was. A video of the alleged offence was played to the jury of seven men and five women. The court was told the woman later reported McPaul, then , to police after reading the account of a woman who accused American actor and comedian Aziz Ansari of sexual misconduct.I donapost knowyou remember reading about this account of a young woman who spent the night with Aziz Ansari.

She added: It was late and probably quite cold outside and he lives a long way away. I had no reason not to let him in. Although on some level I must have wanted that [sex with him], I do not think I would have, even when I have been very drunk I do not think I would have.  I went to sleep saying, aposI am not going to have sex with youapos. But Eleanor Laws, defending, suggested the victim had engaged in consensual kissing and sexual touching while they were in bed together before she had gone to sleep and after she had woken up. The lawyer asked: Do you remember saying that what went on between you and Niall McPaul in the morning, from you waking up with him inside you, was in fact pleasurable  "},{"url":null,"title":"sick newborn baby waits 11","story":"NewsSick newborn baby waits  hours with no bed at same hospital where boy slept on floorEXCLUSIVE: Distressing images show little baby Blanka suffering in her dads arms while his tearful mother pleaded with nurses.

Mum of two Kertu Babik, said she was reduced to tears and left pleading with nurses to see a doctor. Her three week old baby girl, Blanka, was eventually diagnosed with bronchiolitis and spent a week recovering at Leeds General Infirmary. The family have decided to speak out in support of the mum who found herself under fire after revealing her four-year old-son’s plight. Kertu, , and partner Benjamin, , are at pains to say the doctors and nurses were “phenomenal”.Benjamin said: “The staff are truly amazing, we love them. But the NHS is like a sinking ship where the talented band are still playing.” The worried couple spent an “exhausting”  hours waiting for treatment after arriving at AE with Blanka at .pm on November . They had travelled to the hospital on the advice of their midwe as their baby was coughing and lethargic.  Several hours later, around .pm, they were sent to the Children’s Assessment Unit, where they waited in a “dark and boiling”, corridor. Eventually, at midnight, they were transferred to a treatment room where their baby was diagnosed. They insist it was not until am that they were put on the ward with a bed and cot. The hospital say it was am. Kertu said: “I was feeling so poorly and my baby needed to be held constantly in an upright condition because she was coughing.  There was no air and it was so very hot and I was worried about her. She is tiny. “I was in tears when I went to the nurses at .pm to ask how long before we saw a doctor. They said soon, but it was not until midnight. It was not until much later that I found out how serious her condition was and she could have died from it.” Software developer Benjamin, of Leeds, said: “I saw children sleeping on sofas and plastic chairs.Some were on makesht beds with two chairs put together and a parent was sleeping next to their child on the floor. When we got a bed I felt guilty stepping over them.” “We’ve only decided to speak out because of what the other mum has had to put up with. She was not lying about the state of the NHS.” It also follows the story of nine-month-old Lily, who was forced to wait six hours for a bed while poorly at the Countess of Chester Hospital in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire.Ben said: “I have watched the NHS gradually decline over the last  years. My mum used to be a nurse and my two aunts are still. My grandparents came here as refugees from Poland and Austria. He served in the Polish air force and later the RAF, going on to fight at Normandy. They would turn in their gravesthey saw the NHS they were once so proud of.”Lisa Grant, Chief Nurse at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: “I’d like to sincerely apologise to Blanka and her family for the long wait they experienced when they attended our hospital. Our Chief Executive, Julian Hartley, has offered an apology. “Our hospitals are extremely busy and are experiencing signicant demand. On busy days in our Children’s Assessment and TreatmentUnit we usually see up to  patients in a day.

It grew in size and Nikki soon discovered she had a rare tumour.As Liverpool Echo reports, the woman was given the all clear but the cancer ed and had spread to her lungs months later.Itaposs like a movie, it doesnapost feel real, it doesnapost feel like itaposs happening to me, Nikki, of Aintree, Merseyside, said. How is this happening, Iaposve got no symptoms. If I hadnapost had to go to the doctors for check ups because of the tumour in my ankle I would have been completely unaware. Iaposve got no breathing problems, Iaposve been running in the gym and doing normal stuff. When they told me I was really shocked. Iaposd expect someone with lung cancer to be coughing all the time and look ill but Iaposm not. The athlete booked an appointment to see her GP and was sent for multiple tests and X-rays after the lump on her ankle initially failed to clear in January. However it wasnapost until May when she was referred to a specialist and underwent a biopsy, that she was told the lump on her ankle was in fact a rare form of cancer called Plemomorphic Rhabdomyosarcoma. In the weeks that followed, Nikki underwent an operation to remove the tumour, followed by a nine hour operation, where skin was taken from her thigh to cover the hole in her ankle where the tumour had been. And in September, after completing radio therapy for the cancer, Nikki was given the all clear. Yet sadly, just months later during a routine check up at the hospital on October , doctors discovered Nikkiaposs cancer had ed and this time it had spread to her lungs.  On November , Nikki receiving the devastating news that she could have just  months to live, as she was diagnosed with stage four terminal lung cancer. Despite the diagnosis and the limited options available to her on the NHS, Nikki is determined to find alternative treatments to cure the cancer through private health care. Nikki said: I said to them [doctors] apos I donapost do anything what happens apos and they said I would have a maximum of  months to live, so I started chemotherapy the following week. Determined not to give up, Nikki and her devastated family are researching extensively to find alternative treatments and raise the money to fund them. Nikki added: When Iaposve been looking into it Iaposve found a couple of dferent options for treatments but theyaposre only available privately which is expensive. So far Iaposve found an imunotherapy and a protontherapy for my type of cancer but they are only available privately. I need to work out what the best course of action is to take. Iaposm trying to deal with having chemo and the emotional impact itaposs having on my family and doing the research on top.  Nikki who works as a a professional bikini fitness athlete, said she has always been passionate about health and fitness and regularly travels the world to compete in bikini body building competitions. The athlete, who has been undergoing chemotherapy, is now also trying to cope with the side effects of her treatment. She said: I said it wasnapost going to bother me when my hair comes out during the chemo but when it actually happened I was so upset. It happens so fast after having it. Youaposre just brushing your hair and it comes out. I never imagined being ill like this. Nikkiaposs niece, Keely Ray, , said her and all the family have been left devastated by Nikkiaposs diagnosis but they are determined not to give up. And now her family are asking anyone with information on Plemomorphic Rhabdomyosarcoma to come forward. A fundraiser has also been set up to try to raise money for an alternative treatment. Nikki said: Anything at all will help and Iaposm very grateful for anything. It just gives me hope that I can do something about this because being told that you could be dead in  months time is grim.  Nikkiaposs niece Keeley Ray, who is helping her to raise money along with the rest of her family, said: Itaposs been devastating for all of us, none of us expected this to happen. Nikkiaposs whole le has been dedicated to health and fitness. Sheaposs travelled around the world with her career, competing in bikini body building competitions.

Funds raised go towards the peace building work of the Peace Pledge Union, who are unashamedly against wars and the causes of wars.On Tuesday November  and Thursday November  we will be selling white poppies from the foyer of the Lochgilphead Co-op.Bob Dixon, MinardSir,I agree with the points made by Robert MacIntyre in last week#s edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser, when he says that the proposed education cuts are #madness#.This madness is being forced on councils by the SNP government and its Green Party allies at Holyrood, who for years have been voting for Scottish Government budgets which force councils to make cuts.Unless the SNP and the Greens change course and stop cutting the money they give to councils, this madness will continue.I hope that Mr MacIntyre, a former SNP councillor, will write to the leaders of the SNP and the Greens and demand they give councils enough money to stop these mad cuts.Councillor Alan Reid, Liberal Democrat candidate for Argyll and ButeDear AileenWe are responding to your recent consultation about the council budget.Whilst we are very sympathetic to the dficulties that all public bodies, including the Scottish Government, have faced as a result of a decade of austerity it is only fair to point out that this was imposed not by the Scottish Parliament, but by Westminster.The truth is that overall the Scottish Government has maintained the overall funding for local government, as a share of the overall budget, at around  per cent.Councils have, once again, the option of raising additional funds by increasing the council tax, something they have sought for a long while.The inidual share of the total funding allocated to councils is decided by COSLA, using a needs-based formula. Argyll and Bute Council will receive a total of £. million to fund their services in - which, taken alongside the council tax increase they have decided to implement, will give the council an additional £. million this year compared to last – a rise of . per cent.They will also receive their fair share of the extra funding that has already been announced during the current financial year including £ million for teacher’s pay and £. million for increased teacher’s pension contributions.The council could do a number of things to improve its own prospects.You and your administration could work hard to influence the COSLA formula which does not favour rural authorities with falling populations. The Scottish Government Cabinet Secretary for Finance has confirmed to us that he is always willing to consider suggestions, through COSLA, from inidual local authorities.You and your administration could be more imaginative in streamlining central management and devolving delivery and local decision-making closer to local people.You and your administration could maximise income whilst remembering that local businesses are the leblood of recovery. The recent massive hike in inspection charges for food products is an example of the wrong decision being likely to damage the economy rather than enhance it.You and your administration could maximise your assets by working with communities. The council has been slow to undertake any signicant asset transfer which could lead to useful and productive partnerships.You and your administration could be more responsive to, and careful with, communities. The waste of money and time on things like the abortive Traffic Regulating Order for Mull and Iona indicates where you are not using resource wisely and storing up dficulties for the future.You and your administration could ensure that any cuts do not fall on essential services needed for future success. The proposed reduction in educational support staff is an example of where a choice is being made that will not only be counterproductive in terms of our collective future and wellbeing, but will also lose the council local sympathy and support.And you and your administration could prepare to use the already agreed additional £ million for the rural growth deal – coming jointly from the Scottish and UK Governments # to make a long term dference in your performance by instituting a step change in the local economy.As your local constituency parliamentarians we are committed to ensuring the maximum resource comes from central government to Argyll and Bute.We are always happy to work alongside, and in support of, the council and we would be keen to meet to help you develop a detailed plan for the future of the area we are all elected to serve. But we must all be straight with local people and explain that responsibility for the dficulties that the council is experiencing do not all lie at the door of the Scottish Government, and therefore nor do all the possible solutions.Michael Russell MSP and Brendan O’Hara MP"},{"url":null,"title":"negotiating the modern world","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWhy is it so hard to negotiate the modern world That is the question asked by Dame Helen Mirren in the Radio Times.

Last year the SNP councillors supported the administration’s budget, this year there were only slight dferences between the administration’s budget and the SNP’s one.It would be great to see our MP and MSP work with the council to make the case to the Scottish Government for more money for Argyll and Bute. COSLA has made a very clear request of the Scottish Government in terms of funding for local councils next year – three per cent plus inflation. The choices facing the council would be substantially dferentthis was delivered and of course it’s the Scottish Cabinet, including our MSP, who actually make the decisions.The fact is that over the past  years, the council has had to make savings of over £million. That means real hardship for many local people – many jobs lost, many services withdrawn. That is the sad reality.Like all councillors I#m sure, I would be happy to work with the local MP and MSP to make the case for more funding for Argyll and Bute.Councillor Aileen Morton, Argyll and Bute Council leaderSir,Regarding council leader Aileen Morton’s comments in the edition of the Advertiser dated October  # why should the public tolerate more cuts to their services year on yearthey are consistently paying their council tax and other taxes This seems unfair and should be challenged. Surely council leader Morton should be saying to the Scottish Government that the funding provided is not enough and we can’t make any more cuts.Instead of a reduced budget, the council should be asking for an increased budget to operate services when you consider all the cutbacks to their budget over the past few years.Perhapsthe situation was made clear to the Scottish Government by local councils that annual cuts to local authority services cannot be sustained, this situation will stop.It is unfair on council staff too, with threats of cutbacks having a negative effect on their own jobs through no fault of their own. Adding more work to an employee already struggling with their workload causes more stress which is not good for staff or their employer.Instead of accepting a reduced budget, please therefore can the budget be challenged and not accepted Peter Laing, LochgilpheadSir,Being non-funded, Mojo Festival of Original Music relies on my own initial outlay and the kindly volunteering of the team to help achieve at least a small bonus for all the hard working and talented acts who put on a really good night at the event.This year, even though we had more expenses, we had an even bigger attendance which meant we made roughly the same profit as last yearto share out, giving the bands £ each.

Those of us familiar with it know full well to treat it with respect and to be particularly careful when coming away from Cairnbaan towards Lochgilphead.Like Rev Mackenzie, I am aware of a number of accidents there over the last  months. I would estimate at least five,not more. This is a hugely disproportionate amount compared with other junctions on this road. That fact alone should ring alarm bells with the roads authority.This, however, is not the be-all-and-end-all. I have personally witnessed more near misses at the junction than I would care to mention. The problem comes particularly, but not exclusively, during the height of the tourist season with drivers who are not familiar with the area.Rev Mackenzie quite rightly points out there is a deceptive vista that appears to make the road look like a long straight one and despite the presence of warning signs, for some reason, these are ignored.I thought it rather a trite response from Argyll and Bute Council, which is effectively saying the junction meets all legal requirements sign wise and motorists need to be more aware. It is effectively shrugging its shoulders about the reality of the situation and refusing to take the constant presence of risk seriously.It really does need someone to come up with a genuine solution that will eliminate these risks as far as humanly possible and hopefully curtail the number of incidents that will inevitably occur in futurenothing positive is done.Peter J Garrett, Ardrishaig.Sir,We are now into gloomier weather conditions and on occasions a low sun casts long shadows on our roads.I have advice for cyclists who venture on to the highways wearing black hats, black jackets, black trousers, black shoes, carrying black bags and riding their black bikes.Wear clothes that enhance your visibility, please.Earlier this year, in such conditions, I passed such a cyclist on my way into Oban.

It won#t be easy, but doing nothing is not an option.A clearly passionate audience fired all kinds of questions at the candidates ranging from cycle routes, oil production public transport, CO emissions, renewable energy and the ongoing Climate Strike campaign by young people.With subject matter straying regularly beyond reserved Westminster matters into devolved areas of responsibility, the chair clearly came to the conclusion that it was pointless to make any distinction, though the candidates struggled at times to match their Westminster briefing notes to Holyrood issues.The chair wound up proceedings by thanking the audience, the candidates and Time for Change Argyll, adding that he respected the fact that when they didn#t know the answer to a question, the candidates admitted it, rather than trying to waffle.The UK general election takes place on Thursday December .

The games were well contested, and the Argyll boys could have won both games. Two lapses of concentration against Lomond let them in for easy tries and only two points separated the teams in the Shawlands game at the end, when SAS had been in the lead for large parts of the match.The whole team thought it was important to finish the group with a good home win.The boys set out their stall early at MacRae Park when a contested ruck ended with a good turnover from SAS number seven McLean and a great pass out to winger Gritten from number eight McColl-Smith, who then released MacKay.

No. . Dedicated to his hero, Haydn, this was delivered with the reverence it deserved and the clarity and drive of the final Prestissimo would have pleased the dedicatee no end.The first half ended with two Chopin Polonaises # Op.  Nos.  and  # and his third Ballade. The second Polonaise was particularly impressive with its menacing opening figure and Vitaly#s judicious use of the sustaining pedal lent great clarity to all three pieces and indeed to all his recital.After the intermission came Beethoven#s Sonata Op.  No. . By this time Beethoven had developed his own inidual persona and the three contrasting movements of this work were beautully executed, particularly the Adagio with its slow melody and stuttering accompaniment and the contrasting fluidity of the final Allegretto.Next we heard Bela Bartok#s Suite Op. . This was typical Bartok from beginning to end, spikey, angular and generally very speedy and played with incredible precision. When I said to Vitaly that it sounded fiendishly dficult he retorted: # It#s actually quite easy I learned it in three days.#While not normal fare for our audience this, hopefully, was an interestingFirebird is probably Stravinsky#s best known work apart from, maybe, his #Rite of Spring#, and both were originally written as ballet scores. However, due to their popularity, over time these and other works of his have been transcribed by ious people for all sorts of instrumental combinations, and the Agosti transcription of Firebird for piano solo that Vitaly played as his finale is probably the most well known. It makes huge demands on the soloist as Agosti endeavoured to encapsulate Stravinsky#s rich orchestration into a work for only two hands it only works in the correct hands and Vitaly#s were just such hands.This was an electrying rendition and not just for the sheer virtuosity as there were gorgeous quiet sections as well. The thunderous applause at the end said it all.Virtuosity is a given nowadays and over the years we have heard some fine pianists at Ardrishaig, but it was Vitaly#s musical integrity and attention to detail which was a cut above and truly inspirational. This was indeed a recital to remember.The concert, in Ardrishaig Public Hall, was staged by Mid Argyll Arts Association in association with Argyll and Bute Concert tours."},{"url":null,"title":"ardfern first responders recognised after saving mans life","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Ardfern First Responder group was nominated for the  national Scottish Ambulance Service awards after their rapid action saved a Barbreck man#s le.There were seven other groups on the shortlist and the Ardfern groupThe Scottish Ambulance Servicesaid of the Ardfern group: #The team gives the community a sense of safety and support when an emergency happens in this remote area.#The volunteers of this group display exceptional leadership skills and clinical skills and always ensure a great handover to SAS staff when they arrive.

Thatrsquos because therersquos been a lack of strategic vision. You cannot expect public transport, such as buses, to pay for itself,itrsquos going to be a consistent service.ldquoIn Glasgow, we realised that keeping buses on during the night was vital because although they wouldnrsquot be used often, when people did use them it would be urgent.ldquoNow, Scottish Borders Council, in my view, does not adequately fund public transport.\"They say, and I think theyrsquore absolutely right, that theyrsquore inadequately funded by the Scottish Government.ldquoThe Scottish Government say: lsquoit was a bad boy who done it and he ran away because Westminster didnrsquot give us enough moneyrsquo. Now, thatrsquos an example of where there needs to be a degree of strategic thinking.ldquoOn the question of the train being driven by oil, that, as I understand it, was because it was going to be far too expensive to electry it.ldquoThey could only get diesel-driven stock, so it was that or nothing. Now thatrsquos not acceptable. Itrsquos also not acceptable, in my view, that the rails the Borders line runs on were actually made in China.ldquoThat didnrsquot create pollution here in Scotland, but it did across the world and the jobs werenrsquot created here they were created in China.Conservative candidate John Lamont said: ldquoSome parts of the Borders are very well connected but a lot are not,you speak to residents in Newcastleton or Paxton, they do not have a regular bus service to allow them to get around, so itrsquos wrong to say that buses and public transport are accessible.ldquoWersquore very lucky to have Borders Buses here, I have their exceptionally good app, I donrsquot knowmany of you use it but itrsquos a very simple way to get around and very easily find out where your bus is.ldquoI do use it, because itrsquos a good way to get around and itrsquos better for the environment.ldquoBut you canrsquot say that just because I can use it to get from Berwick Station to my house in Coldstream, that other people have access to public transport services, you canrsquot, because thatrsquos simply not true.On buses, Liberal Democrat candidate Jenny Marr said: ldquoBorders Buses is great, and the routes that have started this week with space for the bikes I think as really important.ldquoTo follow on from what John was saying, at Eyemouth College, they have a high rate of dropout In January and February because of how few buses there are and how dficult it is in the winter.ldquoI think we need to look at the successes in some parts of the region and then try and apply that to other places.ldquoI think with Newcastleton, one of the guys from the Campaign for Borders Rail was telling me thata kid wants to get out of the village on a Saturday they will struggle to get back after one or two in the afternoon, and I think we need to make sure that our public transport infrastructure is not a barrier to progress and not a barrier to children and younger people having the le they deserve to have.Finally, SNP candidate Calum Kerr added: ldquoIn relation to the points made on the railway, obviously there is a move around electrication and talk about hydrogen as well, the Scottish Government has set the target that the railways will be net-zero by , as it stands today.ldquoIn terms of public transport and buses, certainly when I met with bus companies previously, therersquos only two bus routes in the Borders which makes a profit, the X and the X.ldquoPeople just donrsquot use it, so it becomes self perpetuating, because then routes get cut, so people have to use their cars, soa green new deal means fundamentally resetting aspects of the economy, and included in that needs to be transport, then you have to invest:you build it they will come.ldquoYou canrsquot just hope people will start using it, and then yoursquoll find a way to make the routes work, it does require signicant investment.ldquoThere is a pound.m green bus fund, so itrsquos about adding green buses continually. There is a lot of work going on, but I think we can do more.The next general elections hustings are set to take place on Monday.At .am, BBC Scotland will host a hustings at Heart of Hawick, while in the evening a second hustings, organised by Selkirk Community Council, will take place at Victoria Halls, Selkirk, at pm."},{"url":null,"title":"musical-instruments-ready-collect-peebles-high","story":"MUSICAL instruments left behind after last weeks fire are now ready to collect.All instruments have been collected from Peebles High School after the fire which has forced the High School to close until after Christmas.The instruments have been transported to Priorsford Primary School and will be available until pm today .Scottish Borders Council are making arrangements for further opportunities to collect belongings and instruments tomorrow , details of which will be released in due course.For all updates on the fire, visithttps:www.scotborders.gov.uk PHSfireHave you been impacted by the fire  Get in touch.

tricks of the trade.Its December now and, as most of the country are battening down the hatches, we keen photographers are getting their thermies ready for sorties outside to shoot winter scenes.The first pieces of kit before you even think about cameras are proper winter outdoor clothing. Plenty of layers, with a good waterproof top layer. Good thermal socks too as you may find yourself standing around for ages on the spot waiting for suitable light to shoot a scene.If you are comfortable then yoursquoll be thinking about photography and not about getting home to a warm fire. Thatrsquos protection for you, but you have to think about your equipment too.Top-end cameras have good weather sealing these days but it may not be  per cent effective, so get a rain cover for your camera bag and a cover for your camera. You can easily make a camera cover from plastic bags and rubber bands, and yoursquore recycling into the bargain.Another thing to think about is batteries, take at least one spare with you and keep it your pocket, not the camera bag. When itrsquos really cold the batteries donrsquot last very long at all so keeping them a bit warmer than ambient maintains their charge until you need it.Snow scenes make great subjects to photograph, and extremely popular. They are one of my favourite genres, running a close second to pictures of the night sky.There is a big problem with snow scenes however and that is SNOW. In a lot of hurriedly taken snow scenes, the snow will appear blue or grey. Thats not the cameras fault, its exposure meter doing what it was designed to do and try and get a compromise exposure to fit the whole frame. However, the camera tries to base everything on what we call an  per cent grey and averages the exposure to suit. Snow is very reflective, particularly in sunlight, and fools the camera meter into under-exposing the scene hence everything will appear dull and not like the lovely glistening snow you were looking at.This is where the photographer has to intervene. We deliberately over-expose what the camera meter is telling us by at least one stop, probably two. It ies a little between cameras and personal preference. I like to over-expose by one and a half stops. Stop! Whatrsquos a stop  A stop is the doubling or halving of the amount of light reaching your sensor . For example,the camera meter says expose for  th of a second, one stop over-exposed would be  th of a second and two stops over would be  th of a second. Using this method you compensate for the light meter wanting to under-expose.On your camera, you can achieve this by either using full manual control of your exposure or using an exposure compensation setting, which many cameras have. Et voila, nice white snow every time. Be careful you donrsquot drop the shutter speed too low though, or you wont get sharp shots handheld, even with image stabilisation . I try to avoid going below  th handheld, faster than that sometimes, depending on how much coffee Ive had.Irsquom not going to be popular for saying this but I hope we get Beast from the East . I had a couple of the best days out with a camera Irsquove had in years during and after that storm.Herersquos a couple of shots I took before sunrise two days before The Beast struck proper. The sunrise one is two exposures blended, one for the sky and one for the snow. If Irsquod just exposed to get the snow right Irsquod have blown out the sky. If Irsquod exposed for the sky the snow would have been dark grey. Sometimes you have to resort to a few tricks.Photo of the month this time is Festival Salute by our syllabus secretary Alistair Peacock. It is a multi-award-winning image this one, and one my favourites. Taken in Edinburgh around Tattoo time, Alistair asked this US soldierhe could take a photo of him. He obliged by standing to attention and snapping a salute, what a bonus. Perfectly exposed and works well in monochrome, great shot Alistair.

particularly bathers going through the motions and winning the No-Belle Prize - the capers and costumes were crazy, and the fun-filled score was sensational.But the true highlights of this adorable show were the tearjerkers and the heart-breaking performances of Aimee Richardson, as Belle, and Sam Johnston, as Prince Danton.The Right Angle Theatre Company has uncovered a couple of crackers with these two.Their dueted version of Calum Scotts Youre the Reason was breathtaking.Johnston had already made an impact with his remarkably good take on Im On My Way, and Richardson had shone throughout the early scenes, but once together it was veneration rather than laughter that resounded around the Volunteer Hall.Steve Hartley-Oliver didnt help either with his accomplished performance as the tormented Beast.And, while slightly more limited in his vocal range than the two leads, his performance of Lewis Capaldis Someone You Loved had most reaching for the tissues.But Beauty and the Beast is much, much more than a weep-fest.Tracy Borthwick and Emma Wilson were a hoot as Belles sisters, Whitney and Britney.From their fainting fits at the sight of Gustave to their obsession with treatments, laughs were never far away.And the dynamic duo of Stuart Mitchell and Amanda Blacklock as the Brawest beauticians in Galae, Marcell and Monique, had the hall in uproar for much of the night.Clad in Olivia Newtown-John-esque Lets Get Physical clobber from the s, Blacklock and Mitchell stole many a scene.And their accents - Mitchells pure Galae and Blacklocks Essex - worked a treat.Craig Douglass De Niro-sounding Gustave also had his fair share of one-liners in his attempts to deflect the unwanted attentions of Whitney and Britney.And both Julie Smith, as Madame Le Fou, and Scott Robertson, as Alphonse, were a delight with their over-the-top performances.A panto, though, isnt a panto without a dame.The Right Angle Theatre Company appears to have a natural - Jodie Millar as Madame Fi was yet again a sensation.From wild wigs and fervently festive costumes to hilariously adapted versions of Ghostbusters and Chansom Damour, Millar made the stage his own.And he was ably supported by Billy Rooney as Fis son, Jacques.Having tumbled straight from the set of childrens show Rainbow, Rooney has a natural ability for slapstick.Rachel Falconer provided the good side of panto from the sidelines as the fairy Flora, while hitting back with her own couplets was Amy Welsh as the sinister Belladonna.,params: .pushWelsh, with her scarlet dress and green-lighting, was remarkably good as the villain.All good shows, though, rely on the music and Calders song choice was spot-on.From the Boo Radleys and Abba to Elton John and Queen, Beauty and the Beast was a foot-tapping, sing-alonging great night out.While the hits rolled, traditional favourites werent forgotten.The wonderful cast of children were delightful with their environmentally aware Country Gardens and Ugly Bugs Ball, and they made sure Coulter wasnt forgotten with a lovely version of Ally Bally Bee.Stuart Mitchell and Julie Smith should take an additional bow for the choreography.And the dancers and chorus were in fine form throughout the show with every big number being turned into a visual treat.As has become the custom with the Right Angle Theatre Companys annual panto, the loudest cheers of the night were saved for the Braw Lad and Lass as well as Santa Claus.While the mood wasnt always merry, Beauty and the Beast provided the opportunity for this talented company to showcase what they can do -

Then me an ma husband can get oan wi oor lives thegither.The witch thought for a moment, then nodded her head.ldquoVery weel, I will help ye, but ye maun dae whit I say.The we smiled with relief: ldquoThank ye.The old woman went ben the hoose to where she kept her herbs and ingredients. The young woman was curious and tried to sneak a look but the witch told her to stay by the fireside until she was finished.Then she came through holding a small bottle of potion.ldquoHere, she said to the we. ldquoThis will dae the trick.

Soon her problems would be over, she thought to herself.The witch watched her go, then closed the door. She had a knowing grin on her face.Two months later there was a desperate knocking on the old womanrsquos door. She looked out of the window and saw the young we standing just outwith the cottage, in a terrible state.So she opened her door.ldquoPlease, please help me, begged the young woman.The witch took her inside. The young woman had run all the way and her shawl had become wrapped round her hair, and her dress was dishevelled with the wind.ldquoOch hen, ye are in a richt fankle, sort yersel oot and sit by the fire fir a warm.The young we rearranged her clothes and started to greet as she spoke.ldquoHae ye got an antidote fir the potion please say ye huv, she said.ldquoAn antidote, hen ldquoAye, Irsquove changed ma mind.

And it has. It wis the hatred ye hud that needed kilt, no yer mither-in-law. And the same goes fir her.The young we was so relieved. For a moment she wondered about asking for her money back, but she realised the potion had indeed done its job.Her relationship with her mother-in-law was not always easy, but they had regular cups of tea and chats together, and often they would laugh as they shared memories and stories from le.ldquoThe claes are in a richt bumfle, said the mother-in-law the following day, then she smiled. ldquoBut letrsquos hae oor tea first and we can sort the claes thegither.The we thought to herself that the witch was indeed a wise woman."},{"url":null,"title":"weekends-christmas-lights-switch-ons-east-lothian","story":"Tomorrow , those in Elphinstone can head along to the switch-on at pm.Hot chocolate and mince pies will be served, with people invited to the minersrsquo club afterwards.On Saturday it is North Berwickrsquos turn, with carol singing from pm outside Abbey Church marking the start of the countdown.The light switch-on takes place at .pm, just before Santa arrives, and children have a chance to meet the special guest.

I agree that the majority prevails, but I think we have to realise thatyou win by one the winner canrsquot have all.Mr Hoy said he would agree there should be a threshold in future elections.He added: ldquoI understand why Kenny doesnrsquot support it because the SNP can barely secure  per cent, never mind  per cent, for independence.Candidates were then asked why they should be trusted by the public.Mr Sisson took this opportunity to point out that he wasnrsquot a politician and he was standing because he felt it was the right thing to do.Mr Whitfield suggested constituents believe those who did what they said they would do, adding: ldquoI think the Government breaking the law and having to be told by the Supreme Court that they have broken the law severely undermines the trust in politicians.Next, with Russia raised as a potential threat, candidates were asked about defence spending.MacAskill thought the defence budget should not change, saying: ldquoThe dficulty that faces our military is that everything is being put into nuclear weapons and Trident. I do not believe in Trident, I do not believe in nuclear weapons.Mr Sisson questioned the British Armyrsquos future as ldquoBritish defence more and more seems to be integrated into European forces.Mr Hoy said the Conservatives would increase expenditure on defence by . per cent above the rate of inflation.

But she asked why the young woman was so determined to climb the stairs, even though she was clearly very ill and finding it dficult.This led to me mentioning who Anne Frank was and that people visit the attic because itrsquos the place where she hid.ldquoWhy was she hiding  was the inevitable question, just as bedtime arrived.I was suddenly presented with a dilemma, not so much that bedtime was now delayed, but how to explain to a six-year-old the depth of evil and hatred that was the reason for Anne Frank having to hide in an attic with her family. And then whether to explain what happened to her after she was discovered.I knew that I couldnrsquot just ignore her question. So we searched for images of Anne Frank, which meant she became a real person for my daughter.Skye studied her and said she looked nice and kind, and asked again why she was hiding.I explained that people who didnrsquot even know her hated her just because she was a bit dferent to them. I couldnrsquot explain the horrors of genocide and concentration camps, but she understood that Anne Frank and her family must have been really scared to hide in an attic.ldquoWhat happened to her  asked Skye as she dressed for bed.This was not a bedtime story I wanted to tell. Indeed, for a child so young, it was not a story I wanted to tell at all. She knows there are bad people and staying safe is important, but we feel the need to protect our children from the evil and hatred that is sadly so deep-seated.But it is at this young age that the seeds of intolerance and hatred can be plantedthey are not encouraged and helped to feel empathy to others, including those who are dferent in fact, especially those who are dferent.So I told her a lsquochild-friendlyrsquo version of Anne Frankrsquos story,there can be such a thing. I gave no details of the horror of the Holocaust but we imagined how she must have missed her family when they were split up, and how sad it was that she died not long before the war ended.She wanted to look at Anne Frankrsquos photo again and say goodnight to her.ldquoThank goodness that could never happen to us here, could it dad ldquoNo, that is not going to happen, and we have to make sure it doesnrsquot happen to anyone  either, I reassured her.I felt quite emotional as I went downstairs with my kids sleeping safely in their cosy beds. I thought of the families in Syria who cannot keep their children safe from hatred and violence. I knew that such horrors could happen anywhere, at any time yes, even here yes, maybe even to us or our neighbours or friends. In fact, hatred of dference is indeed amongst us.A friend of mine was on a bus heading from East Lothian into Edinburgh last week and witnessed a horrible racist verbal assault on a Polish family. The horric murders in London are also part of the same hatred of dference ndash a man so full of hatred for people who think dferently that he randomly killed two amazing young people.Hatred is a virus that can infect any society and any inidual in it. History has taught us that fanning its flames can be an easy way for politicians to win power. But like real fire, once itrsquos released it can spread and destroy uncontrollably.People say fight fire with fire, but here the comparison ends, for we cannot fight hatred with hatred. Hatred only spawns more of it.And so I searched for words of that remarkable young woman Anne Frank, who left her diary behind, unknowing that it would be her gt to the world. Words I could share with my daughter, from one young thinking child to another. Despite writing at a time of unimaginable fear and horror, in her diary she has left us a timeless message of hope that comes from her rejection of hate:ldquoItrsquos dficult in times like these ideals, dreams and cherished hopes rise within us, only to be crushed by grim reality. Itrsquos a wonder I havenrsquot abandoned all my ideals, they seem so absurd and impractical. Yet I cling to them because I still believe, in spite of everything, that people are truly good at heart.It is our responsibility to live up to that inspiring message from a young woman who was a victim of the hate she rejected utterly to show our children, our family and friends, our colleagues and those we meet on a bus, that love, tolerance, empathy and respect of dference is the counter to hate.And we should expect no less from all our politicians."},{"url":null,"title":"bid-replace-old-boxing-gym-housing","story":"REM Associates have lodged planning applications seeking to replace the th century former Tranent Methodist Church building on Bridge Street with four two-bedroom flats.They submitted the applications on behalf of businessman and premises owner Alex Brown, who founded Bronx Boxing Gym, which was based at the old church, a decade ago.In recent years, Mr Brown had no involvement in the running of the boxing club but still let its boxers use the building.However, costly repairs were needed to make the former church safe, which led to the boxing club vacating the premises.Earlier this year, the club moved to the newly established Fit-in Fitness Gym on High Street, Musselburgh.A planning application has been submitted for the former church building and the east wall which faces the car park on Coal Neuk to be demolished.Drawings included within a second planning application show designs for erecting four two-bedroom flats with a basement car park with space for four cars."},{"url":null,"title":"familys-spectacular-christmas-lights-display","story":"The Woods family open their very own Santarsquos grotto and decorate their home each year to raise money for Mission Christmas and Cash for Kids.This year, there are more than , lights at their family home and in their garden.Dad Stevie Woods said the family ldquojust love Christmas and hope the stream of visitors theyrsquore expecting will leave donations for charity, either cash or a toy.They raised pound on their opening night.The lights were switched on for visitors on Sunday at pm and will be on from .pm to pm daily until Christmas.The grotto is open for visitors, who can enjoy the Disney characters painted on the inside and the Christmas films playing.There is also a Santa Sleigh where children can get their photograph taken, and this year there will be the addition of a Santa train, which Stevie made himself out of whisky barrels.He said: ldquoLast year we raised about pound so wersquore hoping to beat that.

And so it might yet prove with another of Fukuyamas pronouncements. It is his contention that the developed world has recently become more peaceable thanks to women as heads of state and in positions of political influence.Ive often heard people say there would be less conflict and fewer warswomen were in charge. Usually its the middle-aged and elderly ndash mothers, aunts and grandmothers ndash who make this claim. They have never scaled the heights of a male-dominated industry or profession, yet hope that the women they see in charge are imbued with the same gentle, conciliatory and nurturing personalities as themselves. And there, I would suggest, is the snag.Nor am I being unduly cynical. A study by the University of Chicago covering  years of European historyhas shown that not only were queens more inclined to take their country into battle than kings, but also more certain to win.:Nicola Sturgeon announces funding for women leaders schemeIn Victorias day, Britain was at war with some part of the empire, or would-be empire, almost every year of her reign. Three hundred years earlier, Elizabeth I set a gold standard for empire building, showing her mettle as she fought off Spanish incursions, despatching her own conquistadors across the globe, and managing to maintain stability in a precariously inflammable period of religious stre asshe were refereeing a game of croquet.The leader of the Chicago study, Professor Oeindrila Dube, points out that you need only think of Catherine the Great of Russia, or Isabella I of Castile to appreciate that, in previous centuries, royal women were every bit as war-like as men. When circumstances dictated, they didnrsquot hesitate to shed blood.Quite how they felt privately, of course, is another matter. Henry VIIIs daughter, who earned the title Bloody Mary after condemning almost  Protestants and religious dissenters to the pyre, was apparently a warm and affectionate person. What her notorious actions indicate, perhaps, is less a vengeful nature and more the vicious tenor of her times.Even our own Mary Queen of Scots was no peacenik, riding at the head of her troops on more than one occasion and, far from avoiding conflict, at times seeming actively to court it.Professor Dubersquos analysis of royal authority shows that when a queen was in power, she was even more effective than a man. Since she would often work in partnership with her consort, her subjects were effectively getting two warriors for the price of one. There is, however, a great dference between what was required of female rulers in the reign of Victoria and before, and attitudes in modern times.In almost every era prior to our own Elizabethan age, to be a woman was seen to be weak. Debate raged across Europe in the th century about how worthy and capable females could ever beplaced on a throne. John Knox, enraged at Mary of Guise becoming Regent of Scotland, spoke for many when he declared her appointment ldquoas seemly a sight as to put a saddle upon the back of an unruly cow.Given such hostility, itrsquos entirely possible that it was not the assistance of their husbands that made Boudiccas of high-ranking women, but the need to show that they were every bit as aggressive and dangerous as men. The message needed to be sent that anyone who tried to topple them would live ndash albeit briefly ndash to regret it.Margaret Thatcher thrust us into battle in the Falklands where many other prime ministers might have hesitated. You could see her pugnacity, on this and other inflammatory issues, as the problem with Fukuyamas theory. Women who reach the political pinnacle today have had to fight to get there. These are no ordinary women, these are powerful women. Hilary Clintonrsquos personality surely proves that point: her pitch for the presidency showed her to be a great deal more hawk than dove.:Project aims to help women stand for electionYet Fukuyama ndash and others ndash might nevertheless be right in hoping for a less violent futuremore women are at the top table. Nobody has done more to show Germany in a pacic and positively humanitarian light than Angela Merkel, even though she knew her policies risked her political standing in some quarters.To date, the performance of those like Mary Robinson, when she was Irish president, or Helle Thorning-Schmidt when Denmarkrsquos prime minister, or New Zealandrsquos Jacinda Ardern, not to mention Scotlands first minister, offers reason to hope. The ability to compromise, to use diplomatic means to defuse conflict, or find a way around an impasse is, while by no means solely a female quality, certainly one at which we are beginning to excel.Sweeping generalisation though it is, women are undoubtedly less physically combative and martial than men, though potentially nasty nevertheless. It can be seen as early as the school playground that our preferred weaponry is verbal attack and the ability to work stealthily, in ways of which Machiavelli would approve, to undermine the enemy.Irsquove never believed we are nicer than men ndash my experience has been quite the opposite. Yet in the West at least, attitudes in government and society are changing. Itrsquos now possible to be feminine and command respect. Gender no longer signals deficiency. Increasingly, even, it could be seen as a positive advantage.Growing numbers of women are rising through the democratic ranks on the strength of their strategic and negotiating skills, rather than their gung-ho, macho credentials. As a new generation is attracted to these roles, seeing that they no longer need to act tough in order to succeed, then things might just improve. Perhaps it is a reasonable assumption after all that, with more female hands at the tiller, nations will become stronger and safer."},{"url":null,"title":"The election no one wanted with the politicians no one trusts","story":"Channel  confirmed that the age of deference is truly over by refusing to accept the Deputy Prime Minister, Michael Gove, as a stand in for Boris Johnson in their climate change debate. To the Conservative Partys dismay, the TV regulator, Ofcom, sided with the block of ice.Elsewhere on the dial, the BBC has been the target of unprecedented criticism for alleged bias in favour of the Conservatives. Two editing errors, one of which removed laughter from a clip of Boris Johnson in an earlier debate, became the justication for a social media tirade against the corporation. The clips have been watched and shared many times more than any of the TV debates.The BBCs political editor, Laura Kuenssberg, has been widely portrayed, unfairly, as a Government spokeswoman. Contrariwise, Andrew Neil, who used to be attacked for having right-wing views, became an unlikely Twitter hero when his piece to camera condemning Boris Johnsons non-appearance on his show went viral. The block of ice, it seems, was otherwise engaged.Social media had been encroaching on the conventional press and media in the last two elections this time it came close to eclipsing them altogether. Analysis by Research Reality suggests that people are increasingly consuming political news through fragmented and partisan clips on their mobile phones, rather than from watching TV debates or reading articles. Politics has merged with entertainment. Comedians are now as influential as journalists or even politicians in shaping attitudes.Young people derive their political information almost exclusively from the internet, with its preoccupations about race and gender identity. Labour, with its media-savvy Momentum shock-troops, has dominated the new medium, churning out memes, jokes and provocative videos. If this were an election for the under-s, Jeremy Corbyn would already be measuring the curtains in Number . Hes called ldquothe absolute boy.Boris Johnson is portrayed as a Bullingdon blowhard, a racist, misogynist and, above all, a liar. Each speech and interview is tracked by a flotilla of ldquofact check posts of ying quality demonstrating that his pants are on fire. These are amplied by comedians and commentators condemning the Tories for being in the pockets of billionaires, letting children starve and for harbouring Jacob Rees-Mogg. The Eton-educated Leader of the House has been kept well away from microphones since his suggestion that people consumed in the Grenfell Tower blaze lacked common sense.Labour has had its own image problems, of course, not least the charge of anti-Semitism that simply wont go away. Last week an extraordinary dossier of allegations from  Labour current party staff, compiled for the forthcoming Equalities Commission investigation into anti-Semitism, was leaked at a crucial moment in Labourrsquos campaign. The leaders of all the major UK religious faiths had earlier condemned Jeremy Corbyn for failing to stamp out hatred towards Jews in Labour ranks. A succession of Labour candidates have been dumped for trading in anti-Semitic imagery and tropes.Mind you, a number of Tory and SNP candidates have also been dropped over anti-Semitism. One of the SNP casualties, Neale Hanvey, in the key target seat of Kirkcaldy, has not gone quietly. He enlisted the support of many in the Yes movement, including the outspoken nationalist blogger Wings Over Scotland, aka Stuart Campbell, who has urged supporters to vote for Hanvey on Thursday.Then, in a bizarre twist, the SNPs conduct investigator on the Hanvey case, Denise Findlay, also resigned. Someone revealed that she too had tweeted last year that: ldquoIt is not anti-Semitic to call Israel a Nazi state. Many of Campbellrsquos readers believe these candidates have been casualties of a growing factional ision in SNP ranks, mainly fought on social media, between transgender activists and members, like Hanvey and Findlay, who oppose self-ID.This winnowing of candidates would have been unimaginable in previous elections. It demonstrates again how social media has become a parallel battleground even at constituency level. Candidates social media accounts are ransacked for dodgy remarks. Twitter has taken on the character of a McCarthyite inquisition.The Big Issues, like taxation and spending, have taken a back seat. Labour evidently decided that it was no longer necessary in the social media age to be cautious about spending pledges. In for a penny in for a billion. The Labour manesto is bold and radical, and has been compared to the  Labour manesto of Clement Attlee. It also involves the biggest peacetime increase in Government spending.Labour is planning to spend and invest a grand total of pound billion over five years, to be financed, improbably, by a % tax on those earning over pound, . And this is only for its declared spending. The Labour manesto ldquoGrey Book did not include the cost of a four-day week, freezing the pension age or nationalising a raft of industries like energy and rail.It is easy to pick holes in the Labour programme, not least in the uncosted poundbn that Labour belatedly offered to the so-called Waspi women, who feel they lost out when the pension age for women was equalised with that of men. The Institute for Fiscal Studies was scathing about the Labour programme in general and that in particular.However, the influential IFS was scathing about all the parties programmes. It said the Tories promise of no increase in income tax, VAT or National Insurance is unsustainable. It also criticised the SNPs proposals, adding that independence would lead to greater austerity than under the Conservatives. This blanket condemnation of the respective parties numbers meant that the spending issue was largely neutralised as the campaign progressed. In the social media scrum, fiscal issues have hardly registered.Focus groups suggest that most voters do not believe Labours promises are credible, however. There has been an air of desperation about Corbyn offering free broadband, cheap rail tickets, lower rents, free childcare, free elderly care, cheaper fuel etc. Labour claimed this week that families will gain pound, a yearthey win the election. Its a shameless exercise in retail politics, but that doesnt mean it isnt effective.The Conservative manesto, by contrast, offers thin gruel. It does include increases in spending but only around poundbn a year, mainly on health, police and gigabit broadband. But the increases mostly restore the cuts made by the Tories in these areas since . The proposal for  new hospitals looks provisional at best and the promise of , nurses includes ,  already employed by the NHS.If you want free stuff, and are prepared to suspend disbelief, Labour certainly sounds attractive ndashyou live in England, that is. Most of the headline measures like free personal care, free tuition fees, free childcare and higher health spending, are already in place in Scotland. Nicola Sturgeon said, with some justication, that Labours manesto was a ldquocut and paste job of the SNPs record in office.However, not even the SNP has proposed borrowing on the scale Labour envisage. The shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, wants to spend poundbn alone on retooling the economy to meet the challenge of climate change. Electrication of transport, planting two billion trees, investing in green industries. There has been a greater tolerance of government borrowing in this campaign, largely because the Conservatives have stopped using their old language of austerity: of ldquospending what we can afford.Both main parties are saying, in effect, that now is the time to invest because the cost of borrowing has signicantly reduced. Indeed, with near-zero interest rates, money is almost free right now. The UK deficit is only .% of GDP. However, the absolute debt pile is higher than ever.It has already increased from pound trillion to pound. trillion since the Conservatives came to office. This debt will eventually have to be repaid, andthere is an increase in interest rates ndash historically averaging % ndash then there could be a huge bill for millennials to pay. This on top of their present burden of tuition debt , high housing costs, insecure work and low pay.The generational ide has never been more apparent than in this general election. ldquoOK Boomer and ldquogammon have become widely-used terms of abuse on social media, directed at those born in the decades after the Second World War. The over-s are, of course, the generation that overwhelmingly voted for Brexit.This was supposed to be a Brexit election, but Europe has for much of the campaign been crowded out by other relatively trivial issues. In the final days it will no doubt , with the Tories repeating their mantra of ldquoget Brexit done beyond pain threshold. Jeremy Corbyn will be defending his much-criticised pretence that he has no view on the most important issue facing the country in  years.The Liberal Democrats, whove had a disastrous election, will be trying to remind us of their existence. Their leader, Jo Swinson, has been called a marmite politician ndashno-one liked marmite. Nicola Sturgeon still wants a referendum on independence next year and is expected to gain many seats.But this is a binary election for a non-binary age: between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson. For good or ill, one of them alone will be entering Number  on Friday. The Conservatives have led the opinion polls throughout the campaign, but there is great volatility and it could still end with a hung Parliament.The weather on this December Thursday could have a major impact on the turnout. That ice could be about to get the last word."},{"url":null,"title":"electricity-firm-bids-use-scottish-energy-help-save-climate","story":"SSEN says the plan will add only pound a year to the average customerrsquos bill, but will make a major contribution to the UK and Scottish Government commitments to achieving net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by  and  respectively.In a pitch to regulator Ofgem for the next price control period which will run from  through to , the company says its plans for electricity transmission in the north of Scotland and remote islands include upgrading distribution lines down the Est coast of Scotland from Peterhead to the central belt with higher capacity cables ndash allowing more power to be transmitted south from offshore windfarms and ultimately to the national grid.Another key part of the plan is to upgrade cables currently connecting Fort Augustus to Skye, which have reached the end of their le and are currently over-capacity ndash enabling the development of windfarms connecting to the network on Skye.In a document submitted to the energy regulator yesterday, SSEN says it will reduce greenhouse emissions by a third, connect new providers and customers to the network on time and transport renewable energy to power  million homes. Rob McDonald, Managing Director for SSEN Transmission, said the North of Scotland was vital to efforts to cut emissions for the whole of the UK. ldquoWith our network region home to some of the UKrsquos greatest resources of renewable energy we have a critical role to play in the fight to prevent the worst effects of climate change, connecting up more renewable energy and transporting it across the country, he said.SSEN Transmission also aims to contribute to climate goals by cutting its own greenhouse gas emissions by a third - primarily by decarbonising its vehicles and cleaning up the fluorinated gases used in its network infrastructure.As part of Ofgemrsquos consideration of the final plan, the regulator will consult with stakeholders such as consumers, renewables firms and environmental groups next year before deciding what level of investment should be taken forward from  through to .Environmental campaigners will be keen to see the regulator prioritise the reduction of emissions, but Ofgem is also likely to be concerned to limit the cost to bill-payers.Nicholas Gubbins, chief executive of Community Energy Scotland said issues like fuel poverty needed to be balanced with climate goals. ldquoThere are signicant concerns about higher fuel costs in the north of Scotland, for example and Ofgem will need to weigh those against the urgent need for decarbonisation, he said.ldquoThe companyrsquos commitment to deliver every connection on time is particularly welcome, as obtaining access to the electricity network is one of the key challenges faced by renewable electricity generators, adding cost to projects and delaying the environmental benefits which their operation delivers."},{"url":null,"title":"herald-diary-large-verdict-elfingrove-kelvingrove","story":"IrsquoM starting to think that I might be the worst dad in the world. The evidence is almost irrefutable, and I have to come clean about this for the sake of my own consciencehellipThe whole sorry story kicks off on Sunday afternoon. My fourteen-year-old son, Ben, is enjoying a hectic day of sofa slumping. Phone in hand, hersquos engrossed in a YouTube video showing another fourteen-year-old boy slumped on a sofa watching a YouTube video.ldquoFancy an entertaining night on the tiles  I ask him.Ben doesnrsquot glance up from his phone. ldquoIrsquove got to watch this before doing anything , he mumbles. ldquoItrsquos the most important YouTube video Irsquove watched since the last one I watched half an hour ago.ldquoHow long will it last  I ask.ldquoJust a couple more hours, he says.At which point I amputate Benrsquos backside from the sofa, dislocate his brain from YouTube, and guide him firmly in the direction of Glasgowrsquos west end, where Elfingrove awaits us.All of which sounds like fun, especiallyyoursquore into over-the-top Christmas events, which I certainly am. At this time of year my inner child executes a daring Steve McQueen-style prison break to go on an eggnog fuelled rampage that doesnrsquot end until December the th.However, itrsquos my other child, the phone-loving dude who goes by the name of Ben, who Irsquom really hoping will enjoy this eveningrsquos entertainment. Although therersquos a sizable risk he wonrsquot be impressed at all. And not just because the night doesnrsquot involve any YouTube celebrities.Elfingrove has become a controversial topic on social media, with a number of mums and dads complaining that itrsquos overpriced and under-imagined. Of course social media doesnrsquot always provide the most balanced of forums. Take a reasonable comment, pluck it from its moorings and drop it in the Twittersphere and strange things start to happen. Like Dr Jekyll gulping down a pint of bubbling green potion, that same innocent statement will rapidly morph into something a lot less innocuous. It soon becomes a snarling, cackling, half-crazed, ldquoWit-you-lookin-at-pal  screech of unbridled rage.So perhaps social media manufactured the entire #elfingroveiseffinrubbish brouhaha.That doesnrsquot stop me feeling a tad trepidatious as Ben and I scurry through a west end thatrsquos being relentlessly rained upon by a mob of heckling storm clouds that are clearly on the side of Twitter and Facebook when it comes to the Elfingrove altercation.Benrsquos not making me feel any better. The daggers hersquos flashing me are the only thing illuminating the night sky. Until we reach Kelvingrove Museum, that is. Suddenly therersquos light everywhere. The entire faccedilade of the building has been turned into a modernist canvas, with spotlights painting wild patterns on the brickwork. Irsquom impressed, and sois Ben.Things improve even more when we reach the grounds of Kelvingrove, where a Christmas market has been rolled out. Readers of last weekrsquos Diary at Large may recall that I was disappointed with the Christmas market in Glasgow city centre. This onersquos smaller, though better, with more of a cosy Crimbo feel.Tents have been erected, similar to Native American teepees. Inside therersquos good cheer and drink. Opposite the teepees are food stalls and wood-burning fires for roasting marshmallows on sticks.Therersquos also a silent disco tent, which intrigues Ben, though wersquove no time to pause as wersquore racing up the steps into the museum. Awaiting us inside is an elf. Actually itrsquos an actor in an elf suitthough I donrsquot tell Ben this, not wanting to spoil the momentrsquos magic.ldquoOh look, itrsquos an actor in an elf suit, says Ben. Sometimes I forget hersquos . Almost a middle-aged bloke. Any moment now hersquoll be smoking a pipe, griping about the youth of today and voting to bring back hanging.Though hersquos not there yet, and I can tell that he is , ,starting to enjoy himself. Though obviously he doesnrsquot tell me that, as it would ruin his cool. The actor elf informs us shersquos in charge of elf and safety.She also gives us a card to guide us through the museum. It lists a number of elves wersquoll meet on the way, to be ticked-off on the card as we spot them.And so we head into the bowels of the museum. First up, therersquos a series of sculpted heads hanging from the cavernous ceiling in the main hall. Regular visitors to the museum will know this installation predates Elfingrove by quite a few years and was created by the artist Sophie Cave. However, for Elfingrove the heads have been brought to le. Almost. While spotlights flash upon them Queenrsquos Bohemian Rhapsody booms out, making it appear as though the heads are belting out the lyrics.Upstairs we come across more elves and more playful content. Therersquos an elf in charge of wrapping, although on this occasion thatrsquos been updated to mean rapping. Yrsquoknow, like P. Diddy and Emimem. This particular elf isnrsquot the best rapper Irsquove heard, though that doesnrsquot seem to bother the kids. Theyrsquore mostly primary school age, so probably arenrsquot well-versed in the traditional rapping lore of hook-ups, hold-ups and hustles. Though even a mature fellow like Ben is enjoying the performance.He also gets into the spirit of things in ious other rooms, dutully writing a letter to Santa which he slides down a chute.Then therersquos a Christmas Knight Out, with a pair of armoured knights battling in a corridor in a scrap to the death. Or at least until theyrsquore thoroughly knackered, which they seem to be already.Next up, we meet Rudolf. Though in this case hersquos not a reindeer but a roaring, robotic Tyrannosaurus Rex. We also come across a dancing fairy and some massive brussels sprouts hanging from a ceiling.An attempt has been made to enliven the spitfire that dangles from the museumrsquos western court. Flashing lights streak along the planersquos wings, and the roaring noise of engines create the illusion the planersquos in flight.Clearly a great deal of ambition, creativity and hard graft has gone into creating Elfingrove. So are the grumpy parents on social media being meanspirited  Not entirely.Some of the elf actors are a little bit awkward and amateurish, though Irsquom guessing the cream of the local acting talent are hamming it up in panto, this time of year.The major set pieces, such as the singing heads and flying spitfire, are impressive. Though not especially Christmas flavoured. Meanwhile the more intimate happenings lack a certain level of razzle-dazzle, and could almost have been cobbled together by a particularly energetic primary school teacher, well-versed in the wonders of glue, string, sticky-tape and papier-macirccheacute.Now Irsquom starting to sound like one of those Twitter tantrum types. So Irsquoll also add that the younger kids seemed to be having a ball. Plus a few of the older ones, too...ldquoTime to go home, I inform Ben, after wersquove roamed the museum for a couple of hours. ldquoBut I havenrsquot been in the silent disco yet! says Ben. ldquoAnd therersquos still a few rooms in the museum Irsquove got to seehellipHe shakes his head in disappointment as I guide him towards the exit gate.And so, because of me, the poor wee fellow only got to enjoy the singing heads, the flying spitfire, a mountain of marshmallows plus a few other quirky moments of minor magic.I told you I wasnrsquot much cop as a dad.

These may have been used to tie mooring ropes onto, to help hold the roof on.The archaeologists working on site uncovered the carved stones scattered around a hearth within the remains of an enigmatic structure that contained three cists, two hearths and a partial ring of holes packed with broken off upstanding stones. Three of the roughly carved figures were also important enough to the people who used the building to be incorporated within the structure of one of the hearths and in the foundations of one of the standing stones. The purpose of the building and how it was used by the inhabitants of this site four thousand years ago is still an enigma.Dating the necked stones firmly will require further work, since they have also been found on Iron Age sites in Orkney. On initial evidence, the ones from Finstown possibly date to around the Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age, roughly BC.Identying the purpose of these stones, andthey are figurines, will also require further work, with a close study for abrasion, wear and any other marks on these anthropomorphic objects.Futher details in The Orcadian on Thursday.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is not clear what the basis for the legal challenge is but communities in Orkney and Shetland will be appalled at this latest development.“Island residents and businesses depend on these leline services. The letting of this contract has already been delayed by more than  months. Continued uncertainty over the future of the service is the last thing communities in Orkney and Shetland need.“Ministers must do everything possible to resolve this dispute as quickly as possible.#Highlands and Islands MSP Jamie Halcro Johnston slammed the SNP and said this legal action by the government-owned CalMac will lead to more uncertainty and delay for travellers.He said: “When factored in with the completely unacceptable delays with the two new ferries being built, the delays on reducing fares to Orkney and Shetland and its refusal to meet its pledge on fair funding for inter-island ferries this really is turning into a fiasco.“People in the islands want assurances that these vital links will be secure and that improvements to the service will start to get underway.

The then minister for transport and the islands stated in June  that we did not have the financial resources to extend the scheme to business-related travel and that remains the case.”The Air Discount Scheme was introduced in  by the former MSP for Shetland, Tavish Scott. At that time, work-related travel was included, recognising, in part, that providing a more level playing field for island businesses was key to sustaining population. In April , the government at the time cut business travel for the scheme, insisting that it broke EU rules.Ministers have since been forced to admit that this was untrue and that the decision had been taken for cost-cutting reasons.Mr McArthur said: “This reply from the cabinet secretary is just the latest in a long line of untruths spun by this SNP government in relation to the Air Discount Scheme. When Tavish Scott first introduced ADS in , it covered all flights taken by islanders to and from the Scottish mainland, with the exception of medical flights. It was designed this way, in part, to help businesses in the Northern Isles contribute to their communities and compete on a more level playing field with mainland firms.“For Mr Matheson to state that business-related travel has never been eligible under the scheme, therefore, is flat out wrong. Just as his predecessors were entirely wrong in claiming the decision by the SNP government to cut business-related travel from the scheme was required under EU state aid rules.“Rather than continue to try re-writing history, Mr Matheson should do the right thing and reverse this cut.”Responding, a Transport Scotland spokesman said: #The Air Discount Scheme directly tackles the issue of high air fares in the Highlands and Islands and underlines our commitment to supporting remote communities. “We are committed to continuing the scheme, which provides a  per cent subsidy for eligible passengers and is the highest possible discount under European regulations. Earlier this year, we widened the eligibility area for the scheme to include the entire Caithness postcode, as well as further parts of Sutherland.“The Air Discount Scheme is designed for use by inidual residents in the eligible areas as a means to facilitate improved social cohesion. It is not for the benefit of public bodies or private companies or to subsidise their travel costs.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It carried out a survey of nearly , drivers which suggests only % of those in the lowest socio-economic group ldquoregularly spend pound in a single shopping trip and welcome the discounted fuel.AA fuel price spokesman Luke Bosdet said: ldquoOnce again, we see wholesale petrol costs falling, down more than a penny a litre since late November, and the only consumers to enjoy savings at the pump are those who can spend pound in-store first.ldquoI wonrsquot deny that the vouchers are a good deal for families, but they leave the lower-income customers out in the cold.ldquoWhen fuel vouchers were first introduced, those lower-spending customers were offered vouchers giving p off a litre from a pound spend or p from a pound spend.Almost three in foursurvey respondents think the Government should set a maximumof time for fuel retailers to cut pump prices when wholesale costs drop.The offer being run by Morrisonrsquos ends on Sunday, while Sainsburyrsquos will operate its promotion between Thursday and December .Sainsburyrsquos fuel buying manager David Pegg said: ldquoWe hope this offer will help put money back in customersrsquo pockets when theyrsquore doing their Christmas shopping.Last month the RAC claimed the failure of fuel retailers to pass on wholesale cost savings meant they were overcharging drivers by more than p per litre for petrol and more than p for diesel.Latest Government figures show the average price of a litre of fuel at UK forecourts stands at pound. for petrol and pound. for diesel.copy -.

Yet nothing is certain. Boris Johnson could still miss the goal spectacularly like Diana Ross famously missed that penalty at the ‘ World Cup opening ceremony.He undoubtedly has flair and talent, but can he be trusted to deliver  That has been the central issue that has limited his undoubted appeal and held him back from achieving an unassailable lead.At the outset of the campaign I argued that the election was Boris Johnson’s to lose. The danger facing him was that having benefitted from the public’s growing sense of grievance about Parliament obstructing the deliverance of Brexit he might be drawn into fighting on the ground of his opponents choosing where he could be more easily beaten. He might lose points on the NHS, he might be outflanked on social care or ridiculed for increasing police numbers that his party originally cut. Whatever the issue, Johnson had to remind the public that the general election had been called earlier than should be expected, and thatthey truly wanted to end their boredom and exhaustion with Brexit they must make a choice between giving him a majority – or sending him packing.In the end, from my own admittedly subjective viewpoint, Johnson has managed to hold on to a diminished lead because his main opponents have been unable to land any signicant blows. Indeed the very question of being able to trust Johnson that has been levelled at him by other leaders such as Corbyn, Sturgeon and Swinson has only raised the questions of trust in them.Labour’s revered Aunt Sally – the threat posed to the NHS by the dreaded Tories – becomes less convincing each time she is wheeled out in her bathchair. Thanks to the changing demographics a lot more demand is putting a strain on resources and with changing technology the costs rise further. NHS costs keep going up and this will not change whichever party governs the nation. Labour can argue you can’t trust the Tories on the NHS all it wants but it rings hollow when we know they say this every election and that every time they are in office they increase spending on the NHS – even during the period of austerity when other departments had their budgets cut.Nor do the attacks from Labour and the SNP about the threat of privatisation of NHS services have credibility.Their idea was to use President Trump as a bogey man but my MEP colleague Henrik Overgaard-Nin, a practising dentist and former head of the General Dental Practice Committee, utterly demolished this thesis last week by categorising how it has been the European Union forcing the growth of private provision of services in the NHS. Likewise it is the EU that was pushing a trade deal with President Obama that could have opened up the NHS further.In all of these points it is those such as Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson who by fighting to deliver Brexit are the real defenders of the NHS remaining accountable to the British electorate.In Scotland, the claims of Nicola Sturgeon are especially weak. The scandals of the tragic and avoidable deaths of children in Glasgow’s new infirmary due to contaminated water, and the unopened Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh costing an extra £ million that leaves her especially vulnerable to an accusation of rank hypocrisy. Claims about trust on law and order under Johnson – made after his promise to recruit , more police in England when it was the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats who originally reduced their numbers following the great recession – have no value when put by other parties who have their own records to feel ashamed about. This week in London the th murder was committed, surpassing last year’s total of  with three weeks of  still to go. The comparison of Johnson’s record as London mayor against the current Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, puts labour in the dock, not the Tories. Likewise the state of Scottish policing was brought into sharp focus by the resignation of Susan Deacon as the chair of the Scottish Police Authority claiming its governance and accountability is fundamentally flawed.While the issue of trust has undoubtedly undermined the Boris Johnson campaign it has not been a knockout blow, for sadly too many politicians come with the same reputational challenge about trust. Nicola Sturgeon promised the  independence referendum was “once in a generation” then “once in a letime” vote but started campaigning for a second referendum practically from the moment her campaign was defeated. At first she was careful enough to suggest it might take a few years but now, five years on and she has been pressing incessantly for a second vote – certainly not a generation later.Corbyn has his reputational problem with past associations with terrorist groups and now wishes to take our industrial relations back to the unrest of the seventies. Then there is labour’s ant-Semitism problem. Do people really trust Jeremy Corbyn The largest issue of trust for me is Johnson’s claim that only he can “get Brexit done”. It is proving a convincing slogan with the public fit to burst over the incessant parliamentary infighting and sharp practices to deliver a deal that suits the EU and leaves our country ided. I do not accept Boris’s “deal’ is anything other than an attempt to move the issue out of the public eye and play down the further capitulations of the UK’s interest that are yet to come. I fully expect the Prime Minister to get his majority and therefore get his deal through parliament – but I do not expect him to secure anything like the free trade deal with the EU that he claims is within his gt, nor do I expect him to go for leaving without a deal – so I foresee yet another extension to our membership after the end of .That’s why we need Brexit Party MPs to press Johnson to deliver, without them millions will have no voice. I would like to think I am wrong but this Brexit General Election could well prove fruitless and undermine public trust in politicians even more.Brian Monteith MEP is Chief Whip of the Brexit Party in the European Parliament.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"lesley riddoch brexit won t get done if boris wins an snp backed labour government is safer bet","story":"#Getting Brexit done# will simply continue to overshadow everything , says Lesley Riddoch.If the Tories get a working majority on Thursday, as predicted, will Boris Johnson actually get Brexit done  Will politicsto something like normal Even at a time of fairytales, flying reindeer, Wise Men and Tinkerbell most adults realise the answer to both questions is a resounding no.Passing Boris Johnson’s Withdrawal Agreementmarks only the end of the beginning – the first stage of a bitter, contested orce which moves on to the financial settlement and future trade negotiations. These must be concluded more speedily than any similar deal in political history andthe shambolic UK negotiating team fails – by accident or by design – the inhabitants of Britain will face the same “no deal” clf edge next Christmas that was supposedly seen off in .This much we know. Every news bulletin and parliamentary debate will continue to be dominated by Brexit in . Uncertainty will blight investment, job security, le-plans, recruitment and the quality of public services. The unbelievable total of , nursing vacancies in the English NHS will not diminish but increase as EU workers finally depart for good. There will be no Golden Age for public services – why should there be when the new boss is actually the old boss  At a deeper level, how can Brexit ever “get done” when leaving is bitterly opposed by millions of voters who will neither abandon their commitment to European identity, nor be accommodated in any way by the new Prime Minister. Thus, Europe will only become more isive and totemic as an issue and will continue to distract from the seismic issues of inequality, climate crisis, and democratic modernisation the entire British political system has chosen to ignore. Most Tory voters and even Brexit supporters know this in their hearts.They back Boris, not to get Brexit done but because he’s the one who lets them dream a while longer, indulges make-believe, allows disorientated people to take respite from the bleakness and empty affluence his party has created with the vain hope of making Britain great again. No harsh realities, dficult choices or tough reappraisals from Santa Johnson. You only have to believe in his magical powers, his innate superiority and his bona fides. Or pretend. It’s like an electoral version of the Stockholm syndrome. Some depressing yet powerful human dynamics are at work.So, a Boris win is likely – but looking on the bright side, a Tory majority would change the thrust of political debate in early .Firstly, it would rob Boris Johnson of the chance to keep posing as the champion of The People against an evil, unresponsive, high-handed Remainer Parliament. If he becomes Prime Minister again, that “self-serving political elite” will largely be his own hand-picked “do or die” foot-soldiers. Any mistakes, delays, crassness or missed deadlines will be entirely and demonstrably his fault and no-one ’s. Alienated Tory big beasts like John Major will join with expelled grandees like Michael Heseltine to rub the new leader’s nose in it – and he must watch for signs of mutiny amongst hisloyal band of lieutenants Gove, Hancock, Javid and Raab – all of whom wanted to be leader themselves. At the first sign of trouble they could try to challenge Johnson, supported by Jeremy Hunt and Theresa May on the backbenches, nursing their wrath to keep it piping hot.Boris may be the darling of the Tory Party membership, but he will have very few friends in Parliament or , in the capital city. Is Johnson an accomplished political tightrope walker – we may soon find out.Secondly, an overall majority would probably also rob Boris of his best recruiting sergeant – Jeremy Corbyn. Not even Teflon Tony could have withstood the sustained and concerted hatchet-job Corbyn has faced every waking day for the last five weeks. The Labour leader has made the media’s job easier than it needed to be, but he’s also overseen a much-needed policy alignment. If Labour’s popular programme of renationalisation and public ownership is wedded to a new, more articulate and assertive leader – Boris will face real, spirited political opposition every inch of the way in . Thirdly, a Boris working majority would also end the absurdity of Arlene Foster and the DUP \u2028representing the views of Remain voting Northern Ireland. Greens and other small parties won’t stand against some Alliance and SDLP candidates, so there’s a chance Ms Foster’s personal authority will be seriously clipped – and that this could precipitate the much-predicted break-up of Britain.Astonishingly, it’s influential parts of the London media who’ve decided that’s on the cards.Channel Four anchor Jon Snow is travelling around the Celtic nations, making a series of films about dissatisfaction in the devolved nations. Radio Four’s flagship World this Weekend is planning an hour-long debate on the future of the United Kingdom for next week. Doubtless, more is planned.It’s ironic. The Conservatives have won elections in the teeth of fierce opposition from Scots for decades. But Brexit has finally thrown that crushing unfairness into sharp relief and a supportive media spotlight. So too have recent opinion polls which suggest a majority of Scots would support independenceBoris Johnson triggers withdrawal from the EU. London’s sudden interest in Scotland’s constitutional bind is welcome, but dangerous too. Enthusiasm may soon waneScots don’t live up to our newfound billing as the Remain rebels who Won’t Stand For Brexit. Unfairly, since no smaller member of this “family of nations” has yet found a way to exercise authority or be heard. But the British media doesn’t do fair, patient, marginal or incremental. So, the pressure will not relent. Brexit won’t get doneBoris wins the vote. And an SNP-supported Corbyn government is still a much better bet.

And nothing on Islamophobia within the Conservative Party.Admittedly the splash headline “Corbyn has made Labour a welcoming refuge for anti-Semites” was legitimate. It was taken from the Jewish Labour Movement’s submission to the Equality and Human Rights Commissioninquiry. And what a damning submission it was.It said the party to which its members belonged “promotes anti-Semites to positions of power does not take actionagainst those guilty of abhorrent anti-Semitism victimises those who speak out against anti-Semitism fails to protect Jewish members from anti-Semitism allows Jewish MPs to be hounded out of their political home and derides the issue of anti-Semitism to the extent that its very existence within the party is denied.” Such criticism was not unexpected. In the past decade Corbyn has been involved in a succession of incidents – from his defence of an anti-Semitic mural in Tower Hamlets to the glowing foreword he wrote to a book laden with anti-Semitic tropes – which appeared to validate suggestions he was fostering a culture of racism. To understand the impact this has had on Jewish members one need only look as far as East Renfrewshire – home to the largest Jewish community in Scotland. For more than  years this constituency ed Jim Murphy, Blairite and one-time member of the Labour Friends of Israel group, as its MP. Last week, the current Labour candidate Carolann Davidson told a Glasgow Jewish Representative Councilhustings the Labour Party did not deserve their vote. She said she’d only come to reassure them some Labour politicians refused to surrender to racism.With Jewish MPs including Luciana Berger forced out, you would have to be a tinfoil-hat-wearing conspiracy theorist to believe Corbyn was being ly smeared . You might wonderfive full pages on the EHRC investigation and no pages on – for example – the poverty that is blighting the lives of hundreds of thousands of children at Christmas – was politically motivated. And you might go on to surmise that, while all racism is equally bad, some forms of racism are less equally bad than others.While Corbyn is suffering as a result of his failure to address anti-Semitism, Boris Johnson is shrugging off quite blatant Islamophobia and other forms of bigotry, such as Sally-Ann Hart’s claim that learning disabled people should earn less because “they don’t understand money.”We know Johnson is racist, because racist sentiments so often pop out of his racist mouth. He has talked about “piccaninnies with water melon smiles” and compared Muslim women to letter boxes. In , he described Islamophobia as the natural reaction to Islam, while in  he suggested Malaysian women coming to UK universities were looking for a man to marry.Like Corbyn, he has promised to root out the problem while continuing to support those who embody it. He promoted Zac Goldsmith to his cabinet despite Goldsmith’s Islamophobic London mayoral campaign against Sadiq Khan, and he continues to employ Tommy Robinson’s pal Chloe Westley as an aide.You can detect the same notes of betrayal in the voices of Berger and Conservative peer Sayeeda Warsi, who described the past four years as like being in an abusive relationship. She spoke after discovering a promised internal investigation into Islamophobia was to be watered down to “an investigation into prejudice of all kinds”.The incidents of Islamophobia go all the way down into the grassroots of the party. Earlier this year, the Conservatives suspended  party members for a string of abusive social media posts, including one that called for all Muslims to be turfed out of public office.Then, last month,  sitting and former Tory councillors were suspended in another social media scandal in which one poster referred to Muslims as “the enemy within”.The party insists such suspensions are evidence of a zero tolerance approach. What, then, are we to make of ministers Sajid Javid, Matt Hancock, Andrea Leadsom and Thérèse Coffey, who have been out on the campaign trail supporting candidates facing claims of Islamophobia  Meanwhile Channel ’s misquoting of Johnson – it claimed he uttered he words: “people of colour” when, in fact, he said “people of talent” – is \u2028being touted as evidence he is not prejudiced. In fact it is merely evidence that, now and again, he remembers not to gt-wrap racist ideology in racist rhetoric.This “talent” quote is a sanitised expression of an immigration policy that created a hostile environment for asylum seekers and deported British citizens back to the West Indies. Let’s not get too outraged with C for mishearing something that, to most people, seemed entirely plausible. And, while criticising Corbyn for failing to apologise for anti-Semitism during his Andrew Neil interview, let’s not forget Johnson wouldn’t submit to the Neil interrogation. And that his response to questions about Islamophobia in the latest leaders’ debate was to change the subject back to Brexit.All this measuring of Labour and Tory sins should not be reduced to whataboutery. But it very often is. The way in which the partiesturn examples of their rivals’ racism into anti-ballistic missile systems capable of combating their own is demoralising This election should not be a game of bigotry Top Trumps. The Conservative Party’s racism does nothing to dilute the Labour Party’s nor ought there to be some hierarchy of hatred. Still, it is worth asking why there is so much focus on one type of racism, while another is seen as more trivial. And why – when the concept of anti-Semitism is rightly sacrosanct – the Spectator and other right-wing publications feel free to carry columns suggesting Islamophobia is a fiction created to silence criticism of fundamentalism  The consequences of anti-Semitism and Islamophobia are almost identical: fear, hurt, and radicalisation within affected communities, and a rise in hate crime towards them. Othering is othering is othering. Whether you are a Hasidic Jew visiting the synagogue in Gfnock or a bearded Muslim attending a mosque in Pollokshields, the misery of being insulted, spat at or attacked is the same. It is to be hoped the EHRC launches an investigation into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party as it has into anti-Semitism in Labour to reinforce that any form of racial discrimination is unacceptable and must be rooted out. And that – instead of posturing and preicating and pointing to each others’ flaws – all the parties will come to a consensus on the iniquity of religious ethnic hatred: for the sake of social cohesion and so their own exiled members canto the fold.©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon conservatives can t be trusted on scottish devolution","story":"Nicola Sturgeon has warned the Conservatives record in government suggests they can not be trusted on devolutionthe party retains power at Thursdays general election.Nationalists believe the Tories have consistently used the on-going constitutional row over Brexit as a smokescreen for a power grab – planning to take control of powers in devolved areas as theyfrom Brussels.It followed the publication of the Tory manesto which said that “after Brexit we also need to look at the broader aspects of our constitution” and pledges a commission to draw up plans for reform.UK Treasury minister Michael Gove suggested earlier this year that Westminster could start spending cash in traditionally devolved areas which he believed would strengthen the Union.: Tory victory will set stage for huge power grabSpeaking while on the campaign trail in Coatbridge yesterday, the First Minister told The Scotsman: \"I think on the basis of our experience over the last few years - granted, not all of that Boris Johnson was PM -people should be very concerned about the devolution settlement should the Tories win a majority.\"We have already seen they are prepared to ride roughshod over the powers of the Scottish Parliamentshows any sign of getting in the way of what they want to achieve on Brexit.

O’Coineen has the ultimate dinner table boast – more people have been to the moon than have sailed around the world .This lonesome boatman’s ticket to sail came in the form of the Vendée Globe, the effectively year-long, round-the-world yacht race in which there is as much focus on finishing as in winning.It’s a risky business sailing into the tempest and braving both elements and unwelcome contact at night or in fog from fellow-vessels from military warships to cruise liners — one of which turned around at the insistence of worried passengers to check on the safety of our hero in his tiny skf.Replete with end-of-chapter tips and an introduction by President Higgins, Journey to the Edge is a lively and luminating read the perfect companion to his ’s business-primer memoir, The Unsinkable Entrepreneur.Now that he’s at the wheel of the Sunday Business Post — reborn as the Business Post at the weekend — O’Coineen is sure to have many adventures ahead, both on the high seas and on terra firma.Let’s leave the last word then with this Irish-speaking voyager proud to be flying the flag for the great seafaring nation of Ireland: “In a bizarre way, after achieving my sailing goal and dream, I can now set new horizons and get real joy, satisfaction and fulfilment in helping others achieve theirs. While in the process…my le was on hold and now I feel lucky to be starting the rest of it. This is about goals, visions and horizons. Without these, little would happen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Screen-Shot-2019-12-04-at-11.41.03.png","title":"jake mac siacais to launch autobiography","story":"“MEMORY is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool”. It can, however, offer a “true reflection” of an person’s own experiences, Jake Mac Siacais says ahead of his autobiography launch. From the perspective of those who know him, as an Irish language activist and lelong republican, his story is undoubtedly a fascinating one, and it is one that is laid bare in honest detail in his new book, Ón Taobh Istigh.Written in Irish, the autobiography starts as most stories do – at the beginning. Born onto a wooden bath board, Jake’s translated introduction describes his own beginning as neither “the most auspicious” nor “the worst”. It was, by his account, a relatively unremarkable day, although the events that have marked his le have been anything but.Our recent conflict and, of course, the republican struggle had a profound impact on Jake from an early age. Having joined the Fianna aged just , he had, by the time he was , resigned himself to either prison or death. For him, the latter came first. Arrested, questioned, and waterboarded by the RUC, he was eventually imprisoned at -years-old and would spend the best part of a decade in ‘the Crum’ and Long Kesh – eventually being moved to the H-Blocks in . During his part in the blanket protest, he became a friend and close confidant of Bobby Sands, who would die on hunger-strike in . As well as offering an honest and heartfelt insight into one of the most tragic periods our recent history, Ón Taobh Istigh is a discerning look at the social and political events that have shaped our post-conflict society.Speaking to the Andersonstown News, Jake told how he wrote the book as a means of dealing with his own personal struggle with depression.“I had suffered severe depression from  to  and I had worked through that with counselling,” he explained. “Then in , February, the counsellor said to me that one of the things that some people find useful is to write things down. So I just started to write my le story and somebody suggested that it would make a great book, so that’s what I did.”He continued: “It meant that I was examining my le in detail, going through everything that I’ve been through and literally just pouring it out on pages. “I decided that in the book I would be as honest and as forthright as I could, but that I would do it in a way which didn’t inidually insult or attack people. I deal with the politics of things, but not with iniduals.“I’ve dealt in detail with all of the major periods the struggle, the peace process – all of that.”He added: “I’m sure that historical figures will recognise themselves in the book, but the book is written with the clear intention of laying out how I remember things, and not straying into making judgements of any iniduals.”Ón Taobh Istigh is a forthright and genuine attempt by Jake to tell his story. While he admits that memory is often subjective, it is a “true reflection” of his own experiences.“I say in the introduction of the book that memory is never a trustworthy tool, or a very forensic tool,” he said.“It’s dficult to trust anyone ’s recall, and even more dficult when it comes to your own because memory is inclined to remember those things which it is favourable to remember, and to forget those things that are painful or dficult. Therefore, before you read this book bear in mind that it’s a true reflection of what I experienced, but others may take a dferent view.”Ón Taobh Istigh will be launched at Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich on Saturday at pm."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"they missed my sickness for 23 years and today its","story":"AN Oldpark woman has been diagnosed with a rare spinal illness –  years after being injured in a fall.Margaret Reevessays a scan revealed her condition in , but she was only told about it when she became one of the patients recalled last year by under-investigation neurologist Dr Michael Watt. Now, after waitingnearly a quarter-of-a-century for a correct diagnosis, she’s been told it’s too late for her to be cured of the spinal disorder spondylotic myelopathy.Margaret’s story began in  when she suffered a bad fall and was diagnosed with a fractured vertebra in her neck after a visit to the Mater. Days later, she was referred to the Royal Victoria Hospital who put the pain she was suffering down to an extra congenital rib that she was born with. Her chronic battle with pain took its toll to the extent that she had to quit her job in the Civil Service.Speaking to the North Belfast News in her Cedar Avenue flat, Margaret explained her long and painful journey to the truth began  years after her first fall.“I started having a series of bad falls in ,” she said. “In short, I was passed around dferent neurologists. I knew in my heart that something was wrong.“I was breaking bones all over my body. I just couldn’t balance. I was a patient of Dr Michael Watt. He diagnosed me with epilepsy, but I never took the medication because I never believed I had epilepsy.”On being recalled by Dr Watt last year, Margaret found out for the first time what a scan from the past had revealed.“It wasn’t until the recall that I was told a scan in  showed I had chronic spondylotic myelopathy, but now it was now too serious to be cured. I had been passed between neurology wards and GPs for over  years and the reality was that my diagnosis was known in  but nobody told me.“I only found out I had this condition because I was a recall patient for something .“How many more people are out there similar to me who haven’t been diagnosed with myelopathy “It is estimated that one in four people could have it. I would say to anyone who suffers from compression in the back, slipped discs, oryou are dropping things or have tingling in the hands, that you may have myelopathy.”A tearful Margaret added: “I will end up in a wheelchair. I will lose the power of my arms and not be able to feed myself because my diagnosis went on so long.“I feel very alone. I don’t know anyone  with it.“The sad reality is that this condition can be preventedit is discovered early enough.”Margaret wants to use her heartbreaking story to reach out to others and raise awareness of myelopathy to let them know they are not alone.She recently ed from a trip to New York to meet fellow patients and top neurologists from across the world at a myelopathy conference.“Myelopathy is out there but people don’t know they have it,” she added. “I want to focus on the disease and its progressionnot treated. Myelopathy is a degenerative disease and there are guidelines on when to operate.“Unfortunately for me, I wasn’t treated sooner and it may have slowed the condition down.“I suffered for years not knowing what was wrong with me.“There is no support here in Northern Ireland. I don’t know where I would be without the support of myelopathy.org, Spinal Injuries Association and AOSpine as well as Cambridge University who are pioneering more research and work into the condition.“We need to talk about myelopathy. If I was living in England I would have been treated quicker.“I am worried about the future because it has been left to deteriorate for so long.”Margaret said she wanted to thank Belfast Back Care for their treatment and Archie Coogan for his holistic therapies.If you suffer from, or believe you suffer from, myelopathy, you can get in touch with Margaret Reeves atMargaret-@hotmail."},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"tourism numbers soar in west belfast","story":"A new report has shown that West Belfast welcomed record number of tourists this year.Figures recorded for  thus far have shown at least  million visitor trips in this part of the city.Research commissioned by West Belfast tourism body Fáilte Feirste Thiar shows a dramatic increase in people visiting our local attractions, which have helped generate millions for the city’s economy. The staggering tourism data represents an almost  per cent visitor increase since  when over  million vistor trips were recorded.Fáilte Feirste Thiar Executive Director, Harry Connolly, said the record numbers were indicative of the “world class” attractions on offer in West Belfast.“Two million visitors have engaged with our established, world class visitor attractions and that includes the Coiste Political Walking Tours, Black Taxi Tours, people downloading the mural map and discovering the our murals by themselves, or visiting the new James Connolly Visitor Centre,” he said.“West Belfast also offers an urban and rural mix, where people can go to the Bog Meadows and the Belfast Hills or they can go to the city and see what our community has to offer.”He added: “The off-season in West Belfast used to be a lot longer, but that’s shortening and it shows that we are now a year-round destination.”Amongst this year’s tourism highlights were the opening of the new James Connolly Visitor Centre and the annual Féile an Phobail, which welcomed the world to West Belfast with hundreds of events including Michael Conlan’s headline bout in the Falls Park. While celebrating our culture and heritage, Mr Connolly said that the hospitality and tourism industry now employs , local people, who are boosting “regeneration”.“This is , homes, families and jobs sustained, which is enormous,” he said.“When we were established we wanted to ensure that tourism was part of the overall programme for social and economic regeneration. “You can really see now how tourism is having a very positive and profound impact on social and economic development of West Belfast.”Not content to rest on their laurels, Fáilte Feirste Thiar are already looking to  with the aim of bringing even more tourists to the area.“As we approach , we believe that we have a firm foundation in place to make sure that West Belfast’s potential is realised,” Harry enthused.“What will help us achieve that is new world class transformational projects. In , we look forward to seeing the development of the Roddy McCorley Society Museum and interactive visitor’s centre. “Of course, in the early part of  we hope to see permission granted to allow Casement Park to be granted, which will be an absolute game-changer. “We see the continued growth of Féile an Phobail, we hope to have Michael Conlan back in the Falls Park to win a world title, and we look forward to the enormous event that will be.”Commenting on the latest figures, outgoing West Belfast MP and Fáilte Feirste Thiar Chairperson, Paul Maskey, said: “When you look at the numbers it’s absolutely phenomenal. “Other parts of this city are now looking at West Belfast to learn and to see what lessons they can take from it moving forward. “Fáilte Feirste Thiar is engaging with organisations in other parts of the city to help them do that.“Tourism is vitally important for our economy in West Belfast and it is sustaining many jobs in the area, and that includes restaraunts, shops, bars and clubs.”He added: “We want to increase those numbers in the time ahead, and it is our job to do that.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38772925.ece/1b2d2/AUTOCROP/w620h342/RCNSTRIKE0007.jpg","title":"northern ireland nurses brave weather on picket lines amid storm over pay","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

While much of the argument has centred around pay levels, she explained that she was out on behalf of ensuring her patients had the best service possible.She said: \"It is not just about pay parity, it is about patient safety. Everyone is standing together and saying that the Belfast Trust need to recognise that there are big staff shortages and that will impact on patient safety.\"This is the first time the RCN is out on strike, so it is a big deal for all of the nurses. The nurses realise when they come out that the wards maybe are a bit short, but they all have to stick together.

The first occurred in the Ligoniel Road on May , with the second happening on the Crumlin Road on May .The -year-old has denied all six charges - including attempting to murder police officers, possessing explosives and causing an explosion - and was called to the witness box on Tuesday.Under questioning from her barrister Tim Moloney QC, Connor spoke of her Republican background and her involvement with the Republican Network for Unity .When questioned about the two incidents in north Belfast, Connor admitted she was out for an early morning walk in the area at the time of the second incident, but denied involvement in both incidents.Mr Moloney began his questioning by asking his client about her education, family background and employment history.She was then asked whether Republican politics was an important part of her upbringing, to which she said \"yes, very much so\". Connor said that around late  and early , she was actively involved with RNU which she described as \"a political organisation, not an armed group\".Connor said she and other members took part in protests, pickets and camp-outs \"to highlight the plight of republican prisoners\", with one such protest taking place outside the Alliance Party HQ in south Belfast when the partys David Ford was Justice Minister.When asked about other organisations, Connor said she was \"not aware\" of United Struggle\" and was \"aware of... but not part of\" ONH.Mr Moloney then turned to the \"specics of the allegations of the offences\" she was charged with.She was asked about former co-accused Stuart Downes, who was charged with offences linked to the incident. Downes - who the Crown say assisted Connor by purchasing component parts for the pipe bombs and ensuring they were delivered to Northern Ireland - died in June .Connor denied communicating with Mr Downes and when she was askedshe ever pretended to be Swedish model Sanne Anderson, she replied: \"no\".Mr Moloney then questioned his client about movie clips - one of which was found on Mr Downes phone and another on a laptop found in a mattress in her bedroom.Its the Crowns case that one of the clips is Connor conducting a \"dry-run\" of the route she planned to take before launching the first pipe bomb attack on May .Connor denied making the video, and when asked \"is that your voice on it \", she replied \"no it definitely is not.\" She also denied being involved in the incident.Mr Moloney then turned to the events of May , and when he asked Connor \"were you out and about that night \", she said she was. When asked why, she said: \"It is something that I did regularly.\"If the police had gone through CCTV for the weeks, months and days before that, they would have noticed that. It was something I did regularly.\"Connor then outlined the route she took, which included walking on the Ligoniel and Crumlin Roads as well as roads and streets in Ardoyne.Connor was then askedshe brought a bag with her and she replied \"yes... for water. I have type two Diabetes and Im constantly drinking water.\"When asked what type of bag it was, Connor said it was a Tesco reusable bag. And when Mr Moloney asked Connor \"did you carry pipe bombs in that bag \", she replied \"dont be ridiculous.\"Connor was also asked about hearing loud bangs when out walking at around am. She said she was \"about four minutes from the junction of Crumlin Road and Ligoniel Road\" when she heard the bangs.Connor said she recalled talking to a woman on the street who was in her pyjamas, they had a brief chat about the bangs and that Connor told the woman she had dropped her phone.The final line of questioning was about her arrest on May ,  and the police interviews.Connor denied putting a laptop and other material in a mattress found in her bedroom, and when asked about a pair of boots also seized, Connor said they didnt fit her and werent her size.Mr Moloney closed his questioning by asking Connor why she gave no response to questions asked during multiple police interviews. Connor said that whilst in custody in Antrim for seven days following her arrest, she had two dferent solicitors - both of whom advised her to make no comment.The non-jury trial is due to resume on Wednesday morning when Connor is expected to be cross-examined by a Crown barrister."},{"url":null,"title":"dogs pack christ church cathedral for annual dog carol service","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Both are happening at the same time,” she said.When asked what presenter agreed to have their pay cut and by how much she said: “I can’t comment on that at this stage. It was in excess of %.”She said she would not like to see the Government introduce legislation to regulate pay at RTE and said it should be “left to the open market”.Asked about the  million euro cost-cutting plan, Ms Forbes said half of this will be made up of what she described as “people costs”.“We expect in the region of  staff will leave RTE in a combination of voluntary redundancies,” she said.Ms Forbes said the current collection system of the licence fee is untenable and the  euro fee for the licence fee represents good value for money.She said it costs the equivalent of  cent per day, per household and is better value in comparison to online streaming services such as Netflix.She said RTE offers more homegrown programming than equivalent public service broadcasters across Europe and cited the Late Late Toy Show which attracted a live audience of . million people across the world."},{"url":null,"title":"constituency profile a tough tussle looms in south antrim as three parties believe they can win it","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

People Before Profits Gerry Carroll is also aiming to repeat his achievements in recent elections.This constituency has seen signicant development in recent years, including the new Andersonstown Leisure Centre, but it is still pockmarked by high levels of unemployment and deprivation.However, West Belfast has also largely reinvented itself as a tourism destination, turning the Troubles into an attraction.Read MoreConstituency Profile: DUPs Shannon all but certain to see off Alliance in StrangfordAds for the area urge tourists to \"visit Clonard Monastery with its sumptuous Rose window\" and \"walk up Divis or Black Mountain and be spoilt for choice for somewhere to eat afterwards\".The internationally popular Lonely Planet guide says: \"Though scarred by three decades of civil unrest, the former battleground of west Belfast is one of the most compelling places to visit in Northern Ireland.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet\"The Falls Road and Shankill Road are adorned with famous murals expressing local political and religious passions, and are ided by the infamous Peace Line, separating Catholic and Protestant communities.\"The glossy language and hyperbole mask an area still scarred with social problems, including the highest poverty levels in Northern Ireland.A tongue-in-cheek letter to the Irish News last month poked fun at the achievements and verbal ability of the abstentionist Mr Maskey, who has held the seat since Gerry Adams decided to run in the Republic.Paul MaskeyThe mischievous letter drew a reply a few days later, questioning the original letters veracity, but there is little doubt Maskey will romp home. He enjoys the largest majority of any Northern Ireland MP.What he may lack in vocal dexterity he more than makes up for on social media, tweeting last week that Santa had taken a few hours off to support striking health service workers \"who had all been good boys and girls this year\".Mr McCoubrey, the veteran DUP candidate, also has a Twitter account, which tends to retweet Nigel Dodds a lot, but he came second place to Mr Maskey last time round.Mr McCoubrey also pushed Mr Carroll into third after the People Before Profit man slashed Mr Maskeys majority two years earlier and amassed % of the vote.Frank McCoubreyMr Maskey said his recovery was \"no fluke\" but was down to hard work and delivery.Major talking points within the constituency include proposals for  new homes at the Glenmona site near Upper Springfield and the failure after more than , days to get planning approval for the new Casement Park plans.Mr Maskey has been vocal on both issues. \"I have families who have been on waiting lists for up to nine years. The shortage of social housing is one of the biggest issues,\" he said.\"I have pointed out to planners that applications lodged after Casement have been approved. It will be the jewel in the crown of West Belfast.\"Big-ticket issues such as Brexit are also to the fore. West Belfast had the second highest vote for Remain in the  referendum .Ongoing violence is also an issue, however.Two weeks ago, a family had a lucky escape after an air freshener exploded on top of a wood burning stove, a few days after a pipe bomb was defused in a front garden.Mr McCoubrey has claimed the unionist vote in the area has almost doubled in recent years, leaving the DUP \"knocking on the door\" in West Belfast.Gerry CarrollMr Carroll has also insisted that his aim is to win the seat, though his campaign will also be seen as a dry run for the next Assembly election.Alliance candidate Donnamarie Higgins said the constituency needed a strong pro-Remain voice and argued change is possible \"when people vote for it\" as they have in a pro-Alliance surge which saw the party take the third MEP seat this year.New party Aontu will be interesting to watch, particularly in terms how many votes it can take from Sinn Fein.Candidate Monica Digney said: \"Irish MPs north and south  years ago did not stand idly by like Sinn Fein do today. They refused to go to Westminster but went to Dublin, which is what we will do, demanding the right to represent people here.\"SDLP stalwart Alex Attwood has, after many years of struggle, left the battleground and, apparently, politics altogether.His long-serving councillor brother, Tim Attwood, polled just under , votes in the constituency, a fall of %, and came in fourth.The constituency has expanded in the recent past, taking in Dunmurry and the northern part of the Derriaghy council ward in , but the change did not affect the proportion of Catholics to Protestants.

It looks so miserable with no lights or tinsel.\"A new addition to the DUP canvassing team is William Traynor, who ran for UKIP in Mays council elections but has since joined the party. \"Its tight between Emma and the SDLPs Claire Hanna, but I really hope that we can do it,\" he says.Lisburn Road in south BelfastLittle-Pengelly has faced fierce criticism for becoming embroiled in arguments about UVF flags and for not building bridges in erse South Belfast, which she denies.\"I have reached out, thats what Im about, its who I am,\" she says. \"I held a constituency outreach in the Markets and an advice clinic in the Belfast Islamic Centre.\"I reached out on Twitter to the LGBT community and the GAA. Im confused about claims that I havent reached out. The DUP condemns paramilitary flags, but I try to sit down with people to address issues rather than just jumping up and down about them.\"Over in the liberal and increasingly Catholic Rosetta area, residents certainly dont see their DUP MP as a bridge-builder. At many doors shes denounced in a way that youd expect in republican Belfast, not in this middle-class and moderate district.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna doesnt bring her rival up, but voters do. \"I cant stand that woman Pengelly,\" a female householder says. \"I want to wake up on December  to find the nightmares over and we have a new MP.\"A pensioner says: \"Shes not our MP, she never was our MP. In the two years since she was elected, Ive not seen her once around these streets.\"SDLP candidate Claire HannaHannas canvassers meet outside The Frying Squad chip shop. Its by no means purely an SDLP team. Two Green Party activists and two former Womens Coalition members are there.The candidate needs to secure support from outside her partys usual voting base, and the evidence from the doors is that shes doing that.\"I normally vote Alliance, but youll get my preference this time because I think youre the person to oust our current Westminster representative\" a man tells her.\"If you lend me your vote, Ill look after it,\" Hanna pledges.A Co Armagh teacher says: \"I usually vote People Before Profit, but Im with you in this election. I hope Enmma Little-Pengelly comes to my door so I can give her a piece of my mind.\"Hanna is warm and chatty as doors are opened by busy parents putting kids to bed or mums already in their pyjamas.SDLP candidate Claire Hanna speaks to Tim and Elsie Trainor on their doorstep in Ardenlee Avenue\"Id be in mineI wasnt out here doing this,\" the candidate says. Many know her from the school gates or parks. Others have seen her whizzing about the area on her bike.One woman asks who will succeed her as South Belfast MLAshes elected to Westminster. \"There will be an internal party contest. Weve a lot of bright young things who will be eager to take the Assembly seat off me in a heartbeat,\" she explains.A pensioner advises her that she should fight this election not just by knocking doors, but on social media as well. \"I dont know anything about it myself, but you must get on all those sites the young people are on Claire,\" she urges.Michael Westland offers a cup of tea and more. \"There are five votes in this house, Claire, you dont need to ask,\" he says.Youre one of the few intelligent politicians on TV. Youre logical, rational and you dont tell lies.MichaelThe compliments for Hanna come so thick and fast at the doors - \"You echo what I think\", \"I trust you\", \"You keep my faith in politics\" - that its almost embarrassing for her.She blushes and jokes to one voter that all the praise means \"its like being at your own funeral\".On a two-hour canvass, there are only three out-and-out noes for the SDLP woman. One family is solid DUP. A man looks at the SDLP leaflet through his glass door and shakes his head. Another man opens his but the conversation is brief. When asked by Hanna what the big issues are for him, he replies: \"My dinner!\" She admires the handsome Christmas wreaths bursting with pine cones and blood-red berries hanging from many doors. Election demands mean shes behind on the Christmas front herself, \"although the kids do have an Advent calendar, and the decorations are out but not up\".Over in the religiously mixed middle-class Sicily Park in Finaghy, Alliances Paula Bradshaw is setting a brisk pace. Its late afternoon and most householders arent in, but she posts signed and timed leaflets through their doors.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw Privately, she must be annoyed that almost every journalist and commentator is putting Hanna ahead in the Alliance-SDLP race for the Remain vote. Yet admirably she doesnt complain.\"Im not taking it personally and I can understand why Im not the favourite to win this seat. I think I would have been had the pact between the SDLP, Sinn Fein and the Greens not happened,\" she says.\"But I would argue that Alliance cant be written off. We match the DUP in South Belfast in terms of councillors. We both have eight to the SDLPs four, and unofficial figures from Mays council election put us on % in the constituency with the DUP on .% and the SDLP on just .%.\"The Green Party may have stepped aside and endorsed Hanna, but Bradshaw claims that its voters arent listening.\"I havent met a Green supporter yet who is going SDLP, theyre all voting Alliance,\" she says.And she questions just how many Sinn Fein voters will come out for the SDLP. \"Ive found apathy about the election in the Lower Ormeau and the Market,\" she claims.\"There are also a fair few DUP voters telling us theyre disillusioned with the party - that its made a hames out of Brexit and theyre fed up with the scandals. Some are coming over to us, others arent. Theyll just stay at home.\"Voters at two homes in Sicily Park give off to the Belfastabout the DUP - one over Brexit and another over the health service. Three members in the latter household work for the NHS and arent impressed - to put it mildly - with Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and the DUP candidates husband.Alliance’s Paula Bradshaw talks to a constituent as she canvasses in Newtownbreda\"South Belfast is being very East Belfast in this election,\" says Bradshaw. Normally, its residents are reticent in expressing their preferences, but theyre shooting from the hip this time round.Paula Bradshaw\"Alliance are going great, although we dont really have strongholds. Somewhere like Stranmillis is excellent for us, but theres no place that well come in with % of the vote. Our strength is that we poll solidly across the constituency.\"Bradshaw reports the issues raised on the doorsteps as \"health, no Stormont, Brexit and abortion\"in that order.At one house, a woman praises Alliances stance on equality issues. Shes confused over Brexit. She supported Remain, her husband was a Leaver. She tells Bradshaw shell consider voting for her.But a few doors down, a woman is undecided about how shell vote and says shell wait to see what her husband does. \"Ive heard that at a few doors,\" the Alliance candidate says.Although Bradshaw will poll well, this feels first and foremost like a Hanna-Little-Pengelly fight. The DUP could winthe Remain vote splits evenly, but theres a confidence about the SDLP candidate and her campaign that is unmissable. South Belfast currently seems set toto the party and be represented at Westminster by a new female face."},{"url":null,"title":"general election northern ireland leaders in final tv clash before polling day","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Asked whether a Boris Brexit might be al for the Irish unity project, O’Neill insisted that running Northern Ireland into the ground was not the way forward for unity — which wiped out a few decades of recent republican history. Naomi Long also rejected the inevitability thesis.Colum Eastwood drew applause by attacking Sinn Fein for being absent from Westminster yet trousering millions in expenses. O’Neill responded sharply, by claiming the SDLP leader was “disingenuous”, highlighting SNP impotence in London. Special status for the North — which a Boris Brexit represented — was a product of Sinn Fein activism beyond Westminster, she claimed. We were only  minutes in and pan-nationalism and pan-unionism both seemed in tatters – except in North and South Belfast of course.Eastwood has enjoyed a good campaign. The nadir of his party’s  removal from Westminster left some wondering whether the SDLP would ever . He now stands of the brink of heading here along with a colleague. The SDLP leader may also have been buoyed by the apparent photo endorsement from Fine Gael Taoiseach Leo Varadkar. Interesting that, given it is only eleven months since the launch of the “historic partnership” between the SDLP and, er, Fianna Fáil — a tie-up rejected by the SDLP’s MP-to-be in South Belfast.Naomi Long performed solidly and it has been a fine year for her party, its vote up % in the council elections and % in the Europeans. But a First-Past-the-Post contest remains dficult terrain for Alliance. Another issue is that Westminster contests are for the true believers. In , those identying as unionist or nationalist were twice as likely to vote as those eschewing such labels.The debate moved onto the health crisis and the associated problem of Assembly restoration. It was everyone ’s fault that it was mothballed. Not their party’s responsibility. Oh no. Michelle O’Neill gave no ground on an Irish Language Act, insisting it was a right. “It’s not an either or” in terms of a Language Act versus dealing with the health crisis was her line. Good luck with those talks on Monday, Secretary of State.Each representative performed creditably. But how much any of Tuesday night really mattered is questionable. The viewing figure for Sunday night’s UTV leaders’ debate was just shy of ,. More watched the programme immediately afterwards, where the contestants had to eat grubs in a jungle. Maybe UTV host Marc Mallett should have made similar demands upon the politicians.

He said party officials only said they were \"looking at it\".\"And here we are, no DUP,\" he told his legion of listeners saying it was through the licence fee he was able to hold politicians to account so they could justy their actions.\"Thats why this is important,\" he said.\"Usually political parties fight for an opportunity to be on the BBC to sell their manestos.\"Every single party who were asked to have their manesto scrutinised by the Nolan show, have agreed a date, except one.\"We think it is important to scrutinise their manesto whether they are here or not.\"He said he \"deeply regretted\" the party would not appear on his show to answer his questions.On Facebook the show broadcast live an image of an empty chair with the DUP manesto sitting on it.Arlene FosterIn recent weeks broadcasters have taken the decision to empty chair politicians over their refusal to appear on shows during election campaigning. Sky News presenter Kay Burleys interrogation of an empty chair pulled in more viewers than any interview the absent Conservative chairman James Cleverly would have achieved had he appeared.And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has faced criticism for his refusal to be interviewed by the BBCs Andrew Neil.In all, Stephen Nolan dedicated an entire hour to the DUP manesto with contributions from BBC political and business editors and callers to the programme.He said the DUP could have reached out to his over , listeners but \"theyve chosen not to do that\".\"There are so many questions I have for the DUP on your behalf and do you know what  I am going to ask them.\"He askedthe party was \"embarrassed\" about how Prime Minister Boris Johnson had treated them,its pursuit of Brexit had damaged the Union and why they were not ruling out working with the Conservative leader in the future given his treatment of the party which lauded him as a \"friend of unionism\".Pointing to recent polling which suggests the majority of unionists are now pro-remain he said he would have asked the party on it.Read MoreWho were the winners and losers  Suzanne Breens verdict on UTV election debateDUP accuses Boris Johnson of breaking his word on union commitmentThe presenter spoke for almost  minutes on what he wanted to ask the party, breaking up his monologue with prolonged silences.He asked about social issues such as health and how the party could convince the next generation of unionism why it was \"best in class\" on those matters beyond the traditional green and orange stances taken.On the money secured by the party for health Mr Nolan said he wanted to ask how how it prioritised the matter andit was further down the order than \"preventing an Irish language act\" in reference to the ongoing political impasse which has seen Northern Ireland go without local government for almost three years.Mr Nolan said it would have been interesting to hear the partys thoughts on that political deadlock and - given the ongoing healthcare workers industrial action - its thoughts on the millions spent on MLA salaries.He also askedthe party regretted breaking pay parity between Northern Ireland and GB health staff which helped bring about the current industrial action crippling healthcare.Stephen NolanOn the partys outreach to \"as wide a base as possible\" he askedthat included gay people andthe DUP was prepared to apologise for comments made by some of its members in the past on homosexuality andsimilar comments could be made again.\"Because politicians are being held to account in this election, they are answering questions about their past words,\" he continued.\"You say in your manesto you want to protect animals better - might you be minded to protect gay people better - and should they vote for you this time around \"Callers to the show congratulated Mr Nolan on proceeding with his show in the absence of the party.He confirmed Sinn Fein would be appearing on his show on Tuesday morning.\"The details of any manesto is important - every other political party has consented to me scrutinising the detail within their promises - except the DUP,\" said Mr Nolan.Sammy WilsonThe DUP has denied holding a boycott over the show although Sammy Wilson admitted it came to a \"collective decision\" to not appear on the show \"as the best way of hurting him\".\"I would just say to the DUP,there is no Nolan show boycott, why are you not here \" asked Mr Nolan.\"If it is even possible for people to think you cant face up to me - how have you got what it takes to face down Boris Johnson or Mary Lou McDonald when your voters need you to \"He added: \"There are loads of articulate, seasoned politicians who could have come in this morning that could have answered these questions - possibly quite well, possibly attracting you to vote for them - instead my questions on your behalf are met with silence.\"I hope I have been able to bring you some of the questions I would have asked the DUP and I deeply regret that I could not convince them to answer them.\"The DUP did not respond to a request for comment.A BBC spokeswoman added: \"In the run up to the election, the Nolan show has been examining manestos and bringing listeners its trademark political interviews with representatives from the main political parties. The DUP was invited on to the programme but did not provide a representative. Stephen will continue to scrutinise manestos and drill down into the issues that matter to the public, as his listeners expect, in the run up to polling day on Thursday.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38765173.ece/ALTERNATES/w620/E%20081219KB1%20%200013.jpg","title":"who were the winners and losers suzanne breens verdict on utv election debate","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Steve, unfortunately, is absolutely wrong on this. Instead of being aggressive, you should go away and take a look at it.”“Don’t tell me that I’m wrong,” Mr Aiken replied. “On October , your party agreed to a regulatory border down the Irish Sea. The only dference between that and Boris Johnson’s deal now is around the issue of consent. Your party did that.”Michelle O’Neill disagreed with the suggestion that Sinn Fein should take its seats at Westminster to stop Brexit.Michelle ONeill addresses Sinn Féins abstentionist policy at Westminster during the #UTVdebate ... pic QggDMzB— UTVDecember , “Look at the last couple of years, Irish interests will never be served at Westminster,” she said. “Thirty-five SNP MPs couldn’t stop Brexit.”But Alliance leader Naomi Long challenged her, saying: “We haven’t Brexited because the SNP and others turned up and voted the government down consistently and you haven’t been there to be part of that and you won’t be there to be part of that.”Mr Eastwood said the only way to stop Brexit was to go to Westminster and vote against it with the SNP, Labour and Liberal Democrats.Who’ll get your vote  Suzanne Breen runs the rule over the candidates who took part in the UTV debate Colum Eastwood, SDLPColum Eastwood SDLP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Colum Eastwood has not put a foot wrong in this election. His media performances have been first-class, and this was no exception.Two SDLP advisers accompanied him to the debate, but he didn’t need them. From start to finish he was passionate, polished and professional. He was streets ahead of Michelle O’Neill. While he scored countless points against her, it wasn’t in a destructive way.His most successful moments were when he challenged Sinn Fein on abstentionism from a pragmatic, not ideological, position.He blew away the argument that going to Westminster made no practical dference.Whether we liked it or not, massive decisions were taken there, and MPs had already stopped Brexit several times. “We need to be there fighting against Boris Johnson, locking him out of Downing Street,” Eastwood said.He brushed off claims that this stance was at odds with pulling out of North Belfast for an abstentionist Sinn Fein candidate.“I’d much rather have John Finucane sitting in his house than Nigel Dodds sitting in the House of Commons,” he replied.There was a stinging one-liner to the DUP about how “no amount of Ulster Hall meetings or banging drums” would change things on Brexit. Eastwood’s words will have secured him no friends among unionists. But his eyes are focused on Foyle, and he may well have won over soft Sinn Fein voters with this sparky performance.Emma Little-Pengelly, DUPEmma Little-Pengelly DUP at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.The word was that Nigel Dodds would stand in for Arlene Foster in this debate but the DUP opted for Emma Little-Pengelly as a substitute.She is fighting to retain her Westminster seat from the SDLP so prime-time media exposure helps. The outgoing South Belfast MP performed well given that she has considerably less experience than her rivals in such scenarios.Her opening statement was excellent. Her brief was obviously to mention the DUP’s £.bn confidence-and-supply money for Northern Ireland as often as possible. The repetition does get a little tedious. Naomi Long at one stage said the money was “a drop in the ocean” of what was needed to turn around public services here.Little-Pengelly didn’t have answers for some of the criticism her rivals made. On a Brexit plan, the best the DUP can come up with is that a hung Parliament is likely and it will exert its influence againholding the balance of power.Little-Pengelly did handle Steve Aiken’s assertive approach expertly. Her barrister training clearly helps.She came across as moderate and measured, and that will do her no harm in South Belfast.She held up her party’s manesto twice near the end of the debate. That is aimed not at the DUP’s core voters but at the middle-class unionist constituency whom the party wants to win over with its policy detail.Naomi Long, AllianceNaomi Long Alliance at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.Naomi Long started nervously, and that is not like her. She and Steve Aiken were the only leaders to look at their notes during their opening statements.But from there on the Alliance leader was in top form. She tackled both the DUP and Sinn Fein very successfully several times.There were some stinging one-liners. Long insisted it wasn’t a choice between dealing with health and an Irish Language Act — “we can walk and chew gum at the same time”.In the health discussion, she raised Richard Pengelly, the Department of Health permanent secretary and Little-Pengelly’s husband, which clearly is uncomfortable territory for the DUP.Less successful was Long’s metaphor about Brexit unicorns and donkeys. She has used it too many times and it has lost its appeal.The Alliance leader was totally honest about our NHS crisis, admitting there isn’t “a silver bullet or magic wand”.She was taking no prisoners regarding the DUP and Sinn Fein’s record of government at Stormont. Alliance, the SDLP and UUP sat around the Executive table while the two big parties sat in another room and carved things out between them, she said.Long came across as that rare breed — a straight-talking politician with integrity. This performance strengthens her image as someone who wants to get things done here but is frustrated by the obstinacy of others.Michelle O’Neill, Sinn FeinMichelle ONeill Sinn Fein at Sundays UTV Election Debate, moderated by Marc Mallett.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.This was a typical Michelle O’Neill performance. She didn’t drop the ball, but neither did she run with it and score.Sinn Fein prefers script over spontaneity, and its vice-president stuck to that approach. Tory austerity was a get out-of-jail card whenever her party’s own record was raised.Her best line came when accusing DUP politicians of initial over-excitement about their influence at Westminster. “They’re now sobering up to the reality thatyou’re bought, you can be sold,” she said. The image of a drunk DUP will have raised smiles in a fair few homes. O’Neill’s weakest moment came when she was asked why there was only a single line in Sinn Fein’s manesto about health. “This election is all about Brexit,” she said.Neither had O’Neill answers as to why as Health Minister she didn’t reverse the DUP’s decision to end pay parity for health service workers here. In her favour, she came across as pleasant, and someone who can definitely do business with unionists. She is no bogeywoman..jpg\" title\"Sinn Fein Deputy leader Michelle ONeilland DUP South Belfast Candidate Emma Little-Pengelly during the recording of UTV election debate at the Queens Film studio in Belfast.

Indeed, with so much gusto that he faced allegations of aggression from Emma Little-Pengelly.There was an awkward moment during the Brexit segment when the DUP candidate tried to cut across the UUP leader. “Wait!,” he said firmly, and put up his hand. A male politician saying that to a female one just doesn’t look good, whatever the intention. It wasn’t helped by Aiken then saying to her: “Don’t tell me I’m wrong!”The UUP is taking an assertive approach towards its DUP rival in this election and that is tactically no bad thing. But the tone of this particular exchange was perhaps not the wisest. The substance of what Aiken said, unlike the delivery, was actually very good.The point that a border down the Irish Sea appeared on the DUP’s watch and “Arlene Foster, Nigel Dodds, Sammy Wilson and you Emma” bear responsibility will hurt the DUP. Although it may not lose that party support, as grassroots unionists seem to blame Boris Johnson alone for the Brexit betrayal. Aiken called for a health emergency to be declared here by London rather than waiting for theof devolution.He pointed out that when the UUP held Stormont’s Health Ministry there were , on our waiting list compared to , now. But his whole performance, unfortunately, just didn’t hang together."},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein brings rent freeze measure to the dail","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsGeneral Election NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsGeneral Election RHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballIrish LeagueInternationalPremier LeagueScottishEuropeanBilly Weirs ColumnStephen CraiganGareth McAuleyRugbyRugby World CupUlster RugbyPodcastsSix NationsClub RugbySchools CupChris HenryGolfThe OpenMotorcyclingBoxingGAADeclan BogueAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneBelfast GiantsOther SportsMotor SportHorse RacingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop CCNNI AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksMagazinesCountdown To Christmas Holiday Guide Family LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMalachi ODohertyMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsIT AwardsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementPet ExpoSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

YouGov used the same method in the  General Election, when the model accurately predicted the results in % of constituencies, and pointed towards a hung Parliament when many other election predictions were pointing towards a Conservative majority.– Does that mean it is completely reliable and should be seen as an accurate prediction of what will happen on December  No. It is merely a projection forecasting what may happen based on current analysis.

In attendance to launch the project was Head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service David Sterling, along with members of Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space programme and the local Pathway to Peace initiative headed up by Rev Dr David Latimer.The impressive Peace Pledge Tree is a seven metre high sculpture created by local artist Maurice Harron.He is a highly regarded sculptor who has created iconic pieces including ‘Hands Across the Divide’ at the end of the Craigavon Bridge, ‘The Tinneys’ in Strabane and ‘Celebration’ situated in Creggan.Peace pledges are etched on the leaves of the tree, written by pupils from over  schools across Northern Ireland, and the border counties of the Republic of Ireland. They are written in both English and Irish.One young pupil’s vow reads: “I pledge to express my feelings with patience, not anger or frustration. To be loyal and supportive and avoid selfish choices.”Funding for the tree was provided by The Executive Office.Co-operation Ireland’s ‘Amazing the Space’ project was launched in . The Duke of Sussex Prince Harry attended the event in  and  when the schools who took part reunited to reaffirm their pledges and share their peace building experiences.The tree was designed to be a permanent reminder of the work of the young people.The late deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness and former First Minister Arlene Foster were among a number of politicians to publicly support the event, with both parties submitting pledges along with the eleven local councils.Amazing the Space came from an idea by Rev Dr David Latimer and was developed in conjunction with the peace building charity Co-operation Ireland. googletag.cmd.push ‘Peaceful future’  Derry and Strabane Mayor, Michaela Boyle described it as a “truly innovative project” that brings together young people from across the island of Ireland to express their personal aspirations for a peaceful future.“This stunning creative piece of public art is a powerful expression of optimism and hope for a positive and peaceful future. I am delighted that it will be located at Ebrington for future generations to enjoy.“I would like to acknowledge the role played by all the young people involved in Co-operation Ireland’s Amazing the Space project and the role they played in bringing forward fresh ideas with an open mind and a positive energy. “The work that is being done at a local and global level is very important to sustain and build a peaceful future for everyone,” she added.The Head of the NI Civil Service, Mr David Sterling, believes the ‘Peace Tree’ is a fitting legacy of the Amazing the Space programme. He said: “The tree forms part of the Pathway to Peace reaching from the Guildhall, across the Peace Bridge and ending at the Peace Pledge Tree, here at Ebrington.“This is a shared space for everyone from across Northern Ireland and beyond. I have no doubt that the pledges made by over  pupils will be read and enjoyed by many.”Meanwhile, Co-operation Ireland CEO Peter Sheridan said: “Amazing the Space was designed to allow young people to have their say in the promotion and development of a peaceful society in Northern Ireland and we in Co-operation Ireland are delighted that the effort put in by young people since  will have a permanent tribute here in the city where the project was first established.”Reverend Dr David Latimer declared it the “most exciting” peace initiative he’s been involved with and an enjoyable partnership with schools across the nine Counties of Ulster, since .He continued: “Young people, wherever they’re living, hope for a world free of poverty, inequality and exploitation. They want a world free of discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, creed, language and gender.“Our young people, with their vibrant ideas and clear perspectives, can reveal a better path. Their words and wisdom, displayed within The Peace Tree, can be a Beacon of Hope that will inspire many to turn their dreams of peace to reality.” googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Last season, they won the Grade D final and after a gutsy display, with goals at the right time, lted the McDevitt Cupon Tuesday afternoon at Celtic Park. The decisive score came in the st minute with a winning goal from St Conors midfielder Eoin Mullan. The sides met in the group stages and it was the Tyrone side who prevailed. As predicted by St Conors coach Declan Toner, the final went right down to the wire. googletag.cmd.push St Ciarans got into their groove in the second-half and looked the likely winners, but St Conors dug in and always had a response. Sean OConnell scored - in vain for Ballygawley, while Ryan Mallons runs from midfield gave the Tyrone side the impetus for their comeback. Oliver Wasoski opened the scoring for St Ciarans with the first of three goals in a frantic opening  minutes. Ben Murphy pounced on a rebound when Tommy Rodgers shot came off the bar, before dispatching to the bottom corner of the net to level the score. Then came a second St Conors goal from James ONeill, after he linked with effective ball-winner JP Hasson. Along with the roving Fintan McGlinchey, they always looked dangerous up front. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - Coach Declan Toner hails the St Conors character... St Conors struggled with their kick-outs against the breeze and went nine minutes without a score before Ben Murphy slotted over, after a fine catch by Eoin Mullan at midfield. Mullan hit his first goal before half-time but St Ciarans responded with points from Sean OConnell and centre-back Harry McGinn. St Conors led - to - at the break and with a battling defensive effort kept themselves in command until the game sprang into le in the nd minute. OConnell, after having his initial shot saved by goalkeeper McAtamney, bagged a second Ballygawley goal. When he added a point seconds later, the sides were level, - to -. Fintan McGlinchey squeezed home goal and St Conors were back in business, but it was St Ciarans who were in command with midfielder Mallon driving forward at will. St Ciarans edged ahead for only the second time in the game with an Oisin Neill goal after  minutes. The St Conors response was instant. In a move involving centre-back Conor Kearney, Mullan had a shot blocked on the line by Paul McGinley before the Glenullin man bundled the ball over the line. St Ciarans poured everything they had into the closing stages. Padraig Kelly cut the gap to a point before a free from Harry McGinn dropped short. After bobbling around in the St Conors squad, the ball was cleared and it was the last throw of the dice for Ballygawley.

Last season, they won the Grade D final and after a gutsy display, with goals at the right time, lted the McDevitt Cupon Tuesday afternoon at Celtic Park. The decisive score came in the st minute with a winning goal from St Conors midfielder Eoin Mullan. The sides met in the group stages and it was the Tyrone side who prevailed. As predicted by St Conors coach Declan Toner, the final went right down to the wire. googletag.cmd.push St Ciarans got into their groove in the second-half and looked the likely winners, but St Conors dug in and always had a response. Sean OConnell scored - in vain for Ballygawley, while Ryan Mallons runs from midfield gave the Tyrone side the impetus for their comeback. Oliver Wasoski opened the scoring for St Ciarans with the first of three goals in a frantic opening  minutes. Ben Murphy pounced on a rebound when Tommy Rodgers shot came off the bar, before dispatching to the bottom corner of the net to level the score. Then came a second St Conors goal from James ONeill, after he linked with effective ball-winner JP Hasson. Along with the roving Fintan McGlinchey, they always looked dangerous up front. googletag.cmd.push WATCH - Coach Declan Toner hails the St Conors character... St Conors struggled with their kick-outs against the breeze and went nine minutes without a score before Ben Murphy slotted over, after a fine catch by Eoin Mullan at midfield. Mullan hit his first goal before half-time but St Ciarans responded with points from Sean OConnell and centre-back Harry McGinn. St Conors led - to - at the break and with a battling defensive effort kept themselves in command until the game sprang into le in the nd minute. OConnell, after having his initial shot saved by goalkeeper McAtamney, bagged a second Ballygawley goal. When he added a point seconds later, the sides were level, - to -. Fintan McGlinchey squeezed home goal and St Conors were back in business, but it was St Ciarans who were in command with midfielder Mallon driving forward at will. St Ciarans edged ahead for only the second time in the game with an Oisin Neill goal after  minutes. The St Conors response was instant. In a move involving centre-back Conor Kearney, Mullan had a shot blocked on the line by Paul McGinley before the Glenullin man bundled the ball over the line. St Ciarans poured everything they had into the closing stages. Padraig Kelly cut the gap to a point before a free from Harry McGinn dropped short. After bobbling around in the St Conors squad, the ball was cleared and it was the last throw of the dice for Ballygawley.

So instead of saying ‘no, no no!”, ‘don’t touch’ or spending hours re-doing them every night, why not give your child a Christmas box  Simply fill a shoe box or a large cloth bag,with the decorations you don’t want any more, decorations donated from a friend or cheap ones bought from a bargain shop. Just make sure they aren’t dangerous, can’t be choked upon etc and let your little one feel the textures, enjoy the sparkly colours, see and touch the glittery baubles, the soft Father Christmas or sparkly beads, maybe you could even buy a little cheap tree for them to decorate! Add to your Christmas box wrapping paper, bows and ribbon to feel and crinkle and of course to wrap ‘presents up’ too , and of course Christmas cards to write on!Salt dough, to make snowman ornaments or baby hand prints to sprinkle with glitter and nish, just remember to add a hole before you bake them so they can hang on your tree. .Shake  Snow, wash an old jar and it’s lid and allow to dry. Stick a Christmas ornament to the lid , pour glitter, sequins or pretend snowinto the jar. Fill about   way with water, add approximately two tablespoons of glycerin and stir. Put on the lid and shake - fabulous! .Christmas cards, who doesn’t like a home made card! Here are a few suggestions For baby - paint their feet, print onto card and write mistletoes! For toddlers - paint their hand white and print onto cardstick on a Christmas hat, add two black finger print eyes and a smile of course!. For older children paint their hand brown, cut it out and stick onto card, add google eyes, have the finger part pointing downwards as the legs and the thumb as the face, draw on antlers and a red nose and decorate Rudolph with sparkles! Christmas cutting, children love to look at pictures of toys they’d like, younger children love to cut and toddlers love to glue and stick. So pick up a toy catalogue next time you are out and let them, or help them to make a Christmas stocking picture of what they might like! Great for practising cutting and fine motor skills, may also give you a few ideas too! Quick tip, plastic scissors are awful to learn to cut with so do buy a normal pair BUT do watch your little one with the scissors as you don’t want your child to have a ‘home done’ hair cut at Christmas!Christmas tree, easy, easy easy - simply cut out a Christmas tree shape, let your child decorate it however they want , stick the back of it onto a toilet roll and there you have it a stand up tree!Christmas biscuits, mmmm. Make simple biscuits and use a cutter to turn them into snowmen, decorate with icing, smarties and sweet laces for a smile, then deliver to your parent and toddler group or nursery class. . Just remember these activities are meant to be fun, so don’t take over, let your child do it - not you,you want you can make one too !Written by, on Facebook, Me  You @meandyoubyjenni to support the Greater Shantallow Talking To Our Babies, Greater Shantallow Area Partnership.

He imposed all the suspended sentences concurrently and imposed a six month sentence on the latest charges.  googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Creative industry businesses in Derry are encouraged to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to add to their teams.Funded by the Arts Council of Northern Ireland and Department for Communities, the programme will provide part funding to cover wage costs for employers who create the new jobs and hire a young person aged -.Run by Creative  Cultural Skills NI, the project aims to support the next generation of arts and cultural professionals and enable the growth of the sector by directly addressing skills gaps and shortages.“We want to offer greater paid opportunities to young people with the aim of eventually eradicating unpaid internships, which are so prevalent in this sector. Budgets are very tight in this sector so by offering additional funding, this programme will not only help organisations create new, exciting positions but also allow for fairer opportunities to young people,” explained Sarah Jones of Creative  Cultural Skills NI.NICEP ran as a two year pilot programme initially and this highlighted the demand for support by both industry and iniduals with  creative businesses creating  apprentices and paid intern opportunities over that period.Meacuteabh Rooney was a past participant on the programme, securing an internship with the NI Science Festival as a Marketing and Events Intern in . With a university degree in geography, she was working in retail when she spotted the post and applied for it.“The programme gave me a chance to get my first job in the creative sector. I never would have thought of event management as a career but I love it. I was hired back in  and for the upcoming festival and this year they are giving me the opportunity to take the lead in programming two big events so I’m continually learning and developing,” she explained.The organisation also benefitted from the NICEP funding and support. Chris McCreery, director of the Science Festival, explained: “We simply could never have done this without the support. It’s been hugely beneficial to us not just to have an extra team member but to have a new perspective by this smart, engaged young person. She quickly became a valued member of the team who has contributed so much to the festival.”The programme will support new jobs from a wide range of fields including music, dance, drama, literature, visual arts, craft, festivals, arts venues, community arts, galleries, museums, circus and carnival arts but will also accept applications from the wider creative sector including digital, film and TV. Employers looking to grow their staff teams and offer an opportunity to a young person, should contact the NI Creative Employment Programme team for more information.Roisin McDonough, Chief Executive of the Arts Council, said: “We want to encourage our talented young people to see the working in the arts as an attractive career option. The NI Creative Employment Programme was created to provide quality training and mentoring opportunities, to give fair access to careers in the creative and cultural industries, and help bolster the creative sector by harnessing the talent of the next generation.”For more information go to www.ccskills.org.uk or email nicep@ccskills.org.uk googletag.cmd.push  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

It came from a poor line-out which saw Derry lose possession and Enniscorthy broke quickly with second row Tomas Stamp scoring and Ivan Poole converting for the first of seven tries.Enniscorthy, with just one defeat in seven games ahead of this one, had the lead they wanted and they picked their moments again and again to frustrate Derrry. The home side looked short on ideas against a disciplined defence with brief forays by the energetic Simon Logue giving glimmers of hope, but the final pass did not live up to the build up.Enniscorthy were devastatingly efficient and when prop Sam Duffy was yellow-carded on  minutes the visitors wasted no time in striking again, a line-out ending with quick passing which opened Derry up for Ivan Jacob to score right under the posts. An easy conversion for Poole made it -.A frustrating first half ended on a positive note for Derry with Alex McDonnell converting a penalty to get the hosts on the scoreboard, but a big effort was needed second halfthis was going to go anywhere for OKanes side. googletag.cmd.push Half Time -The next score was crucial in this one and Derry began the second period positively, but within ten minutes the comeback looked beyond them as Enniscorthy, so clinical, hit two more scores. Davy Murphy hit the visitors third try to put daylight between the teams and after another yellow card, this time to Derrys Dara Gill, Poole scored and converted to make the score a daunting - with just  minutes played.This Derry team are not known for giving in however and to their credit they responded well to score their first try. David Ferguson was the driving force behind the period of pressure which eventually led to the score, with McDonell eventually picking his way through the Enniscorthy line to score a try which he also converted.Any hope of a comeback was killed inside four minutes however when David ODwyer replied for Enniscorthy to make it -. Kept comingAt this stage the win was Enniscorthys but Derry still kept coming. A yellow card for Enniscorthys Paddy Waters offered a glimmer of a hope of a losing bonus point and when Callum OHagan scored to take the game to -, it became a real possibility. One more score would have given Derry that point but in the dying seconds of the game, two misplaced passes gave Kidd and Dunne simple scores, to put an emphatic score on the result that Derry did not deserve.All eyes now turn to the game at Midleton this week, with Derry desperate to get another away win to take the pressure off. This defeat sees Derry drop two places to ninth in Division C but four points on the road this week could change the picture dramatically and see Derry enter the play-off places. With Midleton also desperate for points to avoid become marooned at the foot of the table, it will be all to play for in the last game before the Christmas break.

Those in support of the new development are confident that it will have a positive impact and also deter anti-social behaviour in the area.The amended plans which were lodged last week are seeking approval for a garage canopy and totem-style signage.And while the development will result in the loss of some existing open space, those behind the new filling station proposal insist that the benefits will ldquodecisively outweigh the loss, arguing that there is an abundance of existing open space and proposed amenity space at this part of the town.It is estimated that there are currently over  people employed at the Ballymote shopping centre site which is home to a number of businesses and community organisations.A petrol station located a short distance away at St Patrickrsquos Drive closed sometime ago, with people in the wider Lecale area having to make their way through Downpatrick town centre to access other filling stations.The Ballymote Community Project has described support for the planned petrol station as ldquosolid and has outlined plans for CCTV cameras to be mounted around the station and on the canopy. There are also plans to provide additional parking as part of the proposed development.The Community Project has previously argued that the new garage will help complete the ldquocarefully planned range of services at Ballymote and will ldquoprotect this unique community business from larger external supermarket interests buying land locally and trying to compete.In his submission to planners last April, Sean Kennedy of Nicholl Fuel Oils, explained that the retail fuel market in Northern Ireland is ldquorapidly moving to unmanned sites.He said the proposed Ballymote development will help the company grow its unmanned network and bring a ldquonew and necessary service to the local community.Mr Kennedy said the proposed filling station will also safeguard the future of the Ballymote Centre and the jobs it already provides..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Emma.jpg","title":"Emma’s teddy bears on Kirsty Allsopp’s Handmade Christmas show  ","story":"A WOMANrsquoS love of crafting landed her a spot as a maker of traditional teddy bears on TV presenter Kirsty Allsopprsquos annual celebration of handcrafted Christmas decorations and treats.Emma Phillips from Ballynahinch took part in the handmade toy competition in Kirstyrsquos Handmade Christmas series on Channel .While the mother of four sons did not win on last Fridayrsquos show mdash the honour went to the maker of a crochet knit reindeer toy mdash she did showcase her fantastic skills to a national audience.The fully jointed bear was made in just four hours and caught the eye of the presenter also known for Location, Location, Location and Kirsty and Philrsquos Love It or List It.Emma said that she was delighted to be asked to take part in the show after being one of thousands of crafters who applied to take part.ldquoIt was really all about taking part and I just glad to have been able to get through to the competition as it was just amazing, said EmmaldquoThe amount of skilled crafters that were there at Kirstyrsquos house, which is massive and absolutely amazing, were really impressive. There were people from all over the UK so I did have stf competition.Emma said that she was encouraged by friends and fellow local crafters to apply for the show as shersquos well-known the crafting circles.ldquoThe show was advertised in July and I got a call in August by researchers to find out more about what I did as I put through a couple of ideas of things that I made but it was the teddy bears that they were interested in.ldquoOnce I knew I was selected a TV crew came out to my studio in Spa to film me in September and it was a bit strange to ask my husband to get the Christmas lights outldquoIn early October I flew out to to go to Kirstyrsquos house Meadowgate in Devon where two weeks of filming took place. There were  episodes of the programme and four crafters competed every day. On the day we were being filmed, there were four competitions going on.Emma only started making the handmade bears two Christmases. She also makes a range of felted toys, such as personalised dolls and knits in merino wool.ldquoIrsquom self taught with the teddy bears, explained Emma. ldquoI just wanted to make a jointed bear so I ordered a kit online and went from there. I have been making and experimenting with them ever since.ldquoI have been doing a lot of crafting over the last year and selling at local artisan markets and hopefully I will be able to concentrated on making the bears from next year.The -inch felted mohair bear was a real hit with Kirsty who was fascinated at how Emma used a small blow torch to singe the wool to make it look authentically old. However, she added that she felt under pressure to have it made in the time allowed.ldquoThe only thing I was allowed to do beforehand was to draw my pattern out and everything  had to be done within the four hours allowed, she said. ldquoNormally I would take six to eight hours to make a bear but I had to plan everything out really well for the show. I had never done one that quick before and on the day I was hoping that I would be able to get it finished.Emma said that she got her love of crafting from her grandmother, Violet Spence, who still competes as a member of Drumbo Womenrsquos Institute, and her mother, Linda Davies, who kept the tradition going.Emma can be contacted on Facebook and Instagram as Emma Phillips Handmade..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 C Diary.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C December 4%2C 1979  ","story":"STRIKE mdash The bin strike in Down District has ended and normal bin collections have resumed. The four-day strike, which is believed to have been caused by overtime demands, was settled by a meeting of union officials and council administrators.After the meeting the council works manager, Mr Jim Mitchell, issued a short statement which said: ldquoThe strike is over, we will start back in the morning.Council officials refused to discuss what began the strike and they did not say whether overtime demands were met.The strike began on the day when manual workers in all of Northern Irelandrsquos  district councils were offered a  per cent pay rise, which could mean a hefty increase in local rates.A senior official of the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers Union travelled from Belfast to the council offices in Downpatrick and agreement was reached within a matter of hours.The unions have agreed to negotiate on the offer without committing themselves to accepting that  per cent is the final offer.KILLYLEAGH mdash The battle to remove parking control zones from Killyleagh town centre is hotting up. The Secretary of State, Mr Humphrey Atkins, at the request of the South Down MP, Mr Enoch Powell, is looking into the question of relaxing regulations, it was revealed at the local Town Committeersquos monthly meeting.The Town Committee drew up a petition last month calling for the removal of the controls because they felt they were unnecessary and crippling businesses. Every trader in the town signed the petition.At their last meeting committee members agreed to ask Mr Powell to take up the fright. He did, saying he would be ldquostrongly supporting their request.The Committeersquos decision to go above the heads of local polio and take up the issue with the Northern Ireland Office seems to have worked as well.It is believed the Secretary of State has already been in contact with local police, but everyone is keeping tight-lipped about the request.The latest developments in Killyleagh are being closely watched by traders in other towns and villages in the area, especially Saintfield where traders were told by police  months ago that the ban on unattended parking could not be lted.CASTLEWELLAN mdash A local councillor has condemned a weekend bomb attack in Castlewellan and claimed it is part of a concerted attempt to drive true minority Protestant community from the town.The claim was made by Mrs Ethel Smyth at a meeting of Down Council and she said she was concerned that attempts are still being made against the Protestant community in Castlewellan.ldquoIt has a more sinister motive than just the destruction of property, she said. ldquoIt is an all-out effort to intimidate and terrorise these people to make them leave the area.Mrs Smyth said councillors should join together and give encouragement to minority groups to stand fast. She felt Roman Catholics and Protestants wished nothing more than to live their lives in peace and harmony and she called on the RUC and British Army to apprehend ldquothese evil men.But Mrs Smyth did not receive full backing from fellow Castlewellan councillor, Mr Eamonn OrsquoNeill.Mr OrsquoNeill said he wanted to be partly associated with her remarks and he agreed it was heartbreaking when someone who is bombed is subjected to more bombing.He pointed out that in the Castlewellan area it was not Protestants alone who had suffered and that Roman Catholics had been targets for the bombers. Mr OrsquoNeill concluded by urging councillors to address the problem in a non-sectarian way.But Mrs Smyth persisted and said the facts would bear out that it was the Protestant section of the community which had suffered.BALLYNAHINCH mdash Ballynahinchrsquos new pound, Christmas illuminations will be officially switched on by Downtown Radio DJ Hendi at a special ceremony in the Square on Friday evening.Hendi will switch on the Christmas tree lights at .pm, while the  new Christmas lanterns, situated all over the townrsquos shopping areas, will be going on earlier, along with the street lighting.The switch-on promises to be quite an occasion, with Ballynahinch Silver Band in attendance, while a choir from Assumption Grammar, Ballynahinch High and St Colmanrsquos High Schools will provide a programme of Christmas carols.The nightrsquos activities will being to a climax all true plans drawn up by the forward-thinking Chamber of Commerce, whose idea to provide the town with Christmas illuminations looked a far-off dream at one stage.However, thanks to the generosity of the majority of the traders, a grant from Down Council and a share of the Swimming Pool Project Fund, the idea is now a reality. The pound, illuminations were erected by Mr Sean Murnin and his son, Paul.ARDGLASS mdash One womanrsquos battle to collect enough money for two kidney machines took a giant step forward in Ardglass this week.She is Mrs Winnie Cully, of Portavogie, and she was in Ardglass to collect two cheques totalling almost pound from fishermen, fish salesmen and friends in the port.The first cheque for pound came from the skippers of  Ardglass fishing boats and was handed over by Mr James Smyth, while the second cheque for pound was from six fish salesmen and three friends. It was handed over by Mr Willie Williams.Already the gold-hearted Winnie has raised pound,, but she still needs another pound before she can present two kidney machines to Belfast City Hospital.She started fund-raising two years ago when her son was on a kidney machine at the City Hospital. ldquoSince then he has had a kidney transplant, but I have my heart set on raising this money for the machines to help someone , she said.LISTOODER mdash Listooder and District Ploughing Society held their th annual competition on Saturday and were fortunate to have excellent weather, good ploughing conditions and a record turnout.These all helped to create a big interest for both spectators and competitors, making it one of the best the society has held.

The speed of the attack had caught Olympic flat-footed at the back and Ireland, with the goal at his mercy, unselfishly squared the ball to Kyle Morris in a better position.Alas, Morrisrsquo effort went the aerial route and went over the top, via the crossbar mdash a costly miss.Rovers continued to dominate proceedings, but then shot themselves in the foot after  minutes. They dithered at the back when asked to clear a Jack Roddy free kick and the predatory Aaron McCaffrey was on hand to steer Olympic into the lead.Ireland tried to get Rovers going again, but he was continually thwarted by Niall McGlew and Reece McConnell, but they wouldnrsquot keep the dangerman quiet for too much longer.With  minutes played Harrison spread a delightful pass out to Daniel Sloan. He immediately surged into the box and put the ball a plate for Ireland to make it -.Seven minutes later Ireland latched on to a long clearance from Ronan McDowell, but was off target and just before the break Conor Sloan headed an Ireland corner wide from a great position.The second half was barely  seconds old when Olympic regained the lead. Man of the match Lyons found room out on the left flank, left two defenders for dead and drilled a low effort past McDowell to make it -. Olympic now had the bit between their teeth and Lyons had two more efforts go close, one saved and the other went wide.However, with  minutes gone an under siege Rovers countered and Morris did the spadework before Ireland made it -.Seven minutes later Lyons scored from close range after McCaffrey had created the opening as Olympic again struck on the break, but their joy was short lived.With  minutes gone a searing run down the right flank by Ireland saw him cross for Daniel Sloan to make it -.It was anybodyrsquos game at this stage, but Olympic seized the moment and seven minutes later John Fennell popped up in the box, when least expected, to beat McDowell all ends up with a clinical finish.Olympic know how to close a game out and did so superbly to cement their place in the Bobby Dalzell Cup final for the third year in succession.Ballynahinch Olympic: John McMenamin, Jack Roddy, Daryl Russell, Reece McConnell, Niall McGlew, Simon Marmion, Shane Rodgers, Thomas Rodgers, Aaron McCaffrey, Darren Lyons, Josh Fennell.

A dangerous Nathan Jones cross was cleared and from Olympicrsquos second corner, taken by Anton McGrattan, Jason Noade headed straight at the lsquokeeper.At the other end Jake Kerr fired over the bar and after a good passing move, Thomas Morrison fired into the side netting.However, the early breakthrough, in the th minute, came from Olympic. A deep corner was headed back to Paul Dickson whose shot was blocked and the ball came out to Molloy who fired a low shot to the net from inside the box.Shankill hit back and were convinced they should have been awarded a penalty when Shane Murray tackled dangerman Curtis Black in the box, but referee Nathan McLean let play continue.Shankill manager Davy McAlinden received a caution and Tre Sterling was also in trouble with the match official for a tackle on Ryan Noade.A dangerous Jones corner had to be tipped away as it glided towards the angle of bar and post, but although Olympic were playing well, the Shankill threat was ever-present and when Jake Kerr played in Kyle Dillon, lsquokeeper Ryan Walsh made a great stop from a close range shot.Olympic had a great chance to increase their lead two minutes into the second half when Jones slipped a neat pass to Mason, who had found space in front of goal, but he couldnrsquot beat Andrew Dillon.Shankill breathed a sigh of relief, went on the attack and as Olympic switched off, they equalised.Sterling crossed to the back post and Luke Briers beat Walsh to loop a header to the net.Two more Shankill names went into the refereersquos notebook as Olympic exerted pressure from midfield. And the Ballynahinch men had another great chance after a great run by Mason down the right wing.His cross found Jones free with only the lsquokeeper to beat, but Dillon ed to his right to save one-handed and gather the ball with  minutes remaining.But just two minutes later Olympic were celebrating a second goal as Molloy met a Jones corner to head home what proved to be the winner.Olympic had to survive a late scare when they conceded a free kick on the edge of the D in injury time, but Sterlingrsquos shot was blocked, as was the follow-up from Briers, epitomising the determined defensive work of Olympic that was a feature of the game.Rathfriland needed penalties to see off East Belfast in the other semi-final, after it finished -, with their lsquokeeper Jonny Parr the hero as he saved all three East spot kicks.Ballynahinch Olympic: Ryan Walsh, Dalton Tate, Ryan Noade, Paul Dickson, Jason Noade, Anton McGrattan, Nathan Jones, Chris McNamara, Stefan Mason, Shane Murray, Ryan Molloy.

The process involved engineers fitting two large strops underneath the Dillon Owen before it was hoisted clear of the water by a crane in less than two hours.Weighing  tonnes, nearly  metres long and eight metres wide, the trawler was winched on to a barge before being taken away.Kevin Quigley, chief executive of the Northern Ireland Fishery Harbour Authority, said an investigation into the sinking would now be carried out by the Irish maritime organisation, the Marine Casualty Investigation Board.He added: ldquoThis was a very impressive operation to raise the Dillon Owen and it seemed to carried out very efficiently and safely.ldquoThere was no local pollution problems from the sinking of the boat.The trawler got into dficulty on October  as it headed towardsArdglass harbour, with a rescue operation mounted by Newcastle and Portaferry RNLI volunteer crews who responded to a Mayday call in the early hours.The local crews worked alongside Irish Coastguardrsquos Rescue  helicopter after the call for help was made at .am.The boat got into dficulty as it tried to dock to offload its catch in poor weather.It was listing badly and had started to take on water when the leboats arrived, helping the five crew members to safety with the help of the coastguard.While the vessel did not sink the day after it ran aground, it subsequently succumbed to the water afew days later due to further bad weather.The Cork-registered vessel is believed to have been badly damaged with its catch of mackerel lost, with most of it enjoyed by gulls and other sea birds.Since the incident, a massive barge twice visited Ardglass harbour over recent weeks to carry out the necessary preparation to raise the boat, but bad weather prevented an earlier attempt to raise it.The barge arrived back last Friday to carry out further work ahead of a window of calm weather to allow the trawler to be raised.Councillor Dermot Curran said that the earlier arrival of the barge made for interesting viewing for Ardglass people.ldquoWhen the barge was lit up at night, it was a quite a spectacle to see it twinkling in the harbour.

It is also hoped that more volunteers will give up some of their spare time to help run the new centre which has opened to wide acclaim.In the latest edition of Saintfield News, Development Association chairman Martyn Todd said a number of people have already made suggestions about how best to utilise available space in a number of other buildings at the Belfast Road site.He said the group, alongside the Saintfield Community Trust which is running the new facility, are seeking a meeting with Rowallane councillors and local council officials to discuss options for these remaining areas.Mr Todd said options would need to complement the community activities already on the site and confirmed that there would again be consultation with local people before final decisions are made.He said that since the centre was handed over to the people of Saintfield, it has gone from strength to strength.ldquoThe centre is managed by the Saintfield Community Trust and is run by a small group of volunteers. This means that having the centre open all day, every day is not practical as the staff to oversee s and meetings are just not available, said Mr Todd.ldquoIt is very satisfying to note, however, that at the end of October there has been over  hours of use across the site. The G pitch is now booked every week night and offers users a great opportunity to show off their skills indoors. It has become a training hub for Darragh Cross GAC, Saintfield United Football Club and Carryduff Colts.Mr Todd also confirmed that casual user groups are already making the most of the facility on their doorstep, with the unpredictable summer weather making the indoor pitch the ideal location for Saintfieldrsquos two primary schools to hold their end of year sports days.He continued: ldquoThe hall, studio and meeting room have been a big hit with user groups, providing a wide range of clubs, services and activities. From the outset, the aim for the end of the first year of operation was to attract user groups catering for a wide range of activities and age groups.ldquoThis has already been achieved in the first five months of operation and the centre is well ahead of projections. This early success is a testament to the hard work of the Saintfield Community Trust who oversee the centre, as well as the volunteers who keep it running.Mr Brian Gamble, the editor of Saintfield News, is also backing calls for local people to come forward to help run the new centre.He recalled that the late Gerry Lowe, former chairman of Saintfield Town Regeneration Committee, which was the Development Associationrsquos predecessor, was a key player in the push for a new community centre but sadly did not live to see his vision realised.ldquoThe new centre was handed over to the Saintfield Community Trust to run as a shared space to cater for the sporting and social needs of all the people of Saintfield and district, continued Mr Gamble.ldquoThe centre usage is growing rapidly and is already ahead of projections. There is a small group of people helping out with the ious duties, although more assistance is needed.Mr Gamble hopes that some people in the Saintfield area who care about the village and its residents will come forward and offer a few hours each month to support the operation of the new centre or by serving on one of the Development Associationrsquos committees .He added: ldquoYou donrsquot need any special skills and you will also benefit by making new friends and doing your bit for the community.Anyone who can spare an hour or two per week and would like to become involved in supporting the community is asked to email either reception, saintfieldcc@gmail or editor@discoverssaintfield.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/4th December 2019 Call.jpg","title":"Support for Down GAA centre of excellence  ","story":"ELECTED representatives are being urged to support plans for a multi-million pound investment in an ultra-modern GAA sports centre in Ballykinlar.Down GAArsquos proposed facility will include four floodlit pitches mdash including the current pitch owned by Ballykinlar GAC mdash and will also feature changing facilities for players and officials, and a multi-use sports area.Other key features of the development which will be financed via a cocktail of funding, include spectator seating for , fans at one of the new pitches which it is hoped will in futurehost club championship games.Plans have also been unveiled for a fitness studio and floodlit walking trail around the new development covering just over  acres of land.South Down SDLP Westminster election candidate Michael Savage mdash who has met with Down GAA chairman Sean Rooney mdash wants all politicians to support the planned investment.Mr Savage said that for too long, many members of Down GAA have been without a dedicated and specialist training facility in the county.

It boasts a unique approach to teaching vocational skills, as well as academic and sports facilities.In particular, one alleyway on the school site had seen sheds transformed into small businesses, which the pupils ran - earning qualications and gathering valuable work experience, with staff and students hoping to open it up to the public soon.ldquoItrsquos a bit like Diagon Alley, isnrsquot it  said Ms Wood. Here the school hosts its own bike repair shop, in the form of Spokes, a cafe, its own radio station - The Voice - and plans for a zero-waste food shop are well under way.Robin Hackett, head of KS, showed me around some of the buildings.ldquoThe cafe opened to our students around July time, and was fully operational and officially in September, for the new academic year, he said.ldquoIt opened at the same time as our radio station, with money generously donated from the Postcode Community Trust.ldquoNext on the agenda is our plan to open a fully zero-waste food shop. Wersquove been having talks with other similar shops around Cardf and here in Penarth, like Foxyrsquos, about how to do it.ldquoThe idea is that, because wersquore a residential school, it will give our pupils a place to shop for things like cereal, fruit, biscuits and so on without plastic wrappers or other waste.ldquoOur initial, short-term plan is to reduce our own, internal impact on the environment, butwe can get it up and running to the extent we want, we may as well open it to the local community. Imagine - popping over to the school, grab a tea or a coffee, do your food shop and get your bike serviced, all by our pupils.The pupils I spoke to were enthusiastic about opening their school to the community, and plenty of them had applied for shts in the shop and cafe.One proudly told me he had secured shts in the cafe, and while we peered through the window into the future site of the zero-waste shop, he made sure I noticed the poster for the Lego club. He was the president of it.ldquoWersquore hoping to open the shop in January, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore just waiting on the builders now.ldquoA lot of kids here struggle in academic settings, so this is all building good skills for the future. Our philosophy is, one percent change at a time adds up to a lot.We moved across the alleyway to the schoolrsquos music room.It was well-stocked with plenty of high-tech equipment, from first-class ampliers to cutting-edge keyboards. Excitingly, the school also has a state-of-the-art soundbooth on the way from Germany.ldquoWersquore looking to rent it out to local bands and others as a rehearsal and recording space, once wersquove built it up to the second floor, said Mr Hackett. ldquoWersquore investing in better equipment, and wersquoll be holding radio production workshops with the local primaries, like Victoria Road.The school doesnrsquot just offer vocational opportunities, either.ldquoRecently a lot of pupils went to Belgium, to Ypres, said principal Matthew Burns. ldquoThe best part is they cycled most of the way there!ldquoOver five days, they would cycle a huge distance, and then ride a coach or the Eurostar partway. That way, they got all the way to Ypres, to hear the Last Post and lay a wreath.ldquoWe also put a lot of emphasis on sport, with a state of the art Astroturf we rent out to the community, and a great football team - we recently attended a tournament at Heronsbridge and only narrowly lost to the overall winners.ldquoOutside of that, our KS group are putting together a foodbox raiser for Christmas for those in need, and wersquove just had our drama and music department invited to put on a production for the Senedd.With IT suites, science labs and gymnasiums, this barely scratched the surface of what the school had to offer. Itrsquos no surprise the school has been so successful, with such close attention from its staff. As a school focussing on children with learning dficulties, the pupil number is kept low, with around  pupils attending at any one time. The largest class has eight pupils, with most having fewer.ldquoWe have around  day pupils and  at the moment in residential, staying in one of our four homes on and off the site, said Ms Wood. ldquoFor those children, we offer a  week-a-year provision.ldquoThe houses are lovely - we really want it to feel like their own home, their own bedroom, with their belongings.ldquoIt forms part of our relational approach - how we talk to our children and how we talk to each other. If we have a new pupil arrive here, the first thing to focus on is building a positive relationship with them.ldquoThe conversations are all about recognising whatrsquos going on and supporting them, in their own time.Judging by the smiles on the faces of staff and students alike, itrsquos an approach to be emulated the world over. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This is not unique to Wales but an issue across the UK.Itrsquos important we act to ensure that our health service is sustainable in the long term.Recent figures show excellent progress has been made again this year.I increased the number of GP training places from  to  this year.However we actually filled  places.This is an increase of  per cent on last year and is great news for us locally.In order to ensure that we can recruit the medical workforce our health service needs now and in the future we also need to look outside Wales. That is why I recently visited India.The British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin have led the Medical Training Initiativescheme to bring medical professionals from India to work in NHS Wales for up to two years.This partnership with NHS Wales has led to over  doctors a year for the last three years being offered positions in NHS Wales through the scheme.During my visit I had the pleasure of meeting with some of the candidates who have applied to train work and live in Wales for two years together with the NHS Wales recruitment team.Our message that Wales is an excellent place to Train, Work and Live is clearly having an effect at home and abroad.As ever, I would be interested on hearing your views on this, please do get in touch. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

More than , people signed a petition to save the Victorian lamp posts, fearing a ldquoloss of valuable historic character from the streetscape in Penarth.A Vale council spokesman said: \"ldquoThe council has recently approved a more suitable replacement column for the old Victorian lampposts which will be painted black and feature embellishments to match the Victorian period style as well as having a swan neck arrangement that will accommodate a suspended LED lantern to meet its energy reduction strategy. It is intended to roll out this replacement column by replacing the previously installed steel columns along Cwrt y Vil Road before the end of this calendar year.\"Penarth Civic Society alleged the posts were safe in a letter sent last week to the Vale councilrsquos head of visible services and council leader Neil Moore.David Noble of the Penarth Civic Society said: ldquoWe would like to ask that the programme of removal and replacement of Victorian lampposts in Penarth is suspended with immediate effect.ldquoWe are completely in favour of the councilrsquos policy to replace old inefficient street lighting with modern more energy efficient LED lighting units. However, we are firmly of the opinion that not enough effort has gone into the decision.ldquoIt seems that the council is spending over pound, on replacing each lamppost. When two posts in Kymin Terrace and Beach Lane were converted, the contractor expressed concern that the spigot on the column was not strong enough to support the new unit. We believe this remains the sole justication for the claim the units are unsound.ldquoWe have been in contact with several street lighting contractors. They have all confirmed as long as the posts are structurally sound at their base there is no reason they cannot be upgraded.ldquoWe feel the decision to scrap the old columns was taken prematurely, without proper consideration and is motivated by a desire for expedience rather than sensibility and care.A Vale council spokesman said: ldquoThe council has a duty to ensure that the street lighting is in a safe condition and does not pose a hazard to the general public. As a result, a number of the older Victorian lampposts in Penarth were recently replaced because they were considered electrically and structurally unsafe with holes evident in some columns. Given the many safety concerns with these old columns it was not practical or cost-effective to attempt repairs and maintain appropriate level of public safety.ldquoThe council is confident the new replacement columns will address many of the concerns previously raised and enable the remaining unsafe Victorian cast iron columns throughout Penarth to be sympathetically replaced in , preserving the character and nature of the roads and streets which currently benefit from the visual appearance of the old Victorina cast iron columns.ldquoWhile the new replacement columns with embellishments and swan neck are more expensive than standard columns the cost will be offset by conversion to LED lanterns with signicant environment benefits as they produce less Co and will be more economical to operate over the letime of the new units. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Sadly, these ldquowins have not been quick, yet to become a reality.Penarth commuters are still being shuttled into work each morning on overcrowded pacers, and this is simply not good enough. The new rolling stock we were promised seems many years away, when the reality is we need it now. Welsh Government need to pull their finger out and sort this out. Transport is their responsibility and they need to get a grip of the situation.The controversial Barry incinerator is a saga that seems to be rumbling on and on. I have long held deep concerns about the site, with the minister responsible for making the decision indicating almost two years ago she was ldquominded to insist an Environmental Impact Assessment be carried out.This week in the Assembly, I raised these concerns yet again, and the minister confirmed that an Environmental Statement has been submitted by the developer and is currently being reviewed. She claimed NRW are monitoring compliance throughout the testing phase, and that this is the latest position.Locally, there have been several apparently unconfirmed rumours that the site will be up and running in a matter of days, and I was disappointed the minister failed to give a categorical answer on this. I have always said the site is wholly unsuitable, and the Welsh Assembly have let local people down in their handling of this.I was very pleased last week to see a statement from Cardf and the Vale Health Board dropping controversial plans to close the Sam Davies ward at Barry Hospital. Under the proposals, the  bed ward was to close, with services transferred to the Heath and Llandough. While I welcome the announcement, they also confirmed new proposals will be brought forward this week. Given the statement did not include explicit commitment to keep the ward open, I fear we will see a rehashed version of the same plans in the near future. It has not been a good month for the Welsh NHS, with recent figures confirming wait times were joint worst on record. Irsquom calling for a cast iron guarantee from them that under the revised plans, the ward will remain open. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Ulster Business sat down for a chat with chief executive Kevin Kingston and his new deputy CEOs “The three of us make a very good team,” Danske Bank chief executive Kevin Kingston says, warmly, over an early morning coffee at Panama Cafe, close to its Belfast headquarters.The bank boss was speaking of the appointment of his colleagues, Vicky Davies and Stephen Matchett, to the role of joint deputy chief executives .It’s a bold move, and Danske is the only bank in Northern Ireland which boasts the senior roles. The pair have already helped shape the burgeoning performance of Danske Bank in their respective roles over the last few years, and will continue to do so alongside their new additional responsibilities.“We are the biggest bank in Northern Ireland and we play a crucial role in fuelling the economy in Northern Ireland – at a time of increased economic and political uncertainty it seems like the right thing to do, to be investing in our management structures,” Kevin tells Ulster Business.“We want to make sure that whatever the opportunities and challenges that NI and the bank may face in the next year or so, that we have the capacity to do what we need to do to continue to support our customers.”It’s been another busy year for Danske Bank. It posted an operating profit of £.m in the first six months of , up % year-on-year.“Vicky and Stephen have been instrumental in the progress we have made over the last few years. Vicky in terms of her strategic insight and support to me in terms of our organisational development, and Stephen in terms of his commercial and financial insights,” Kevin says.“The three of us make a very good team. We play to each other’s strengths. A lot of the progress we have made in the last few years is down to, in no small part, these two people sitting beside me.”Vicky is managing director of strategy and corporate development within the bank, while Stephen has been Danske’s chief financial officer for the last five years.For Kevin, the two new deputy chief executive roles comes at a key time of increased uncertainty around Brexit, and the future economic landscape – so creating the front-facing positions will help develop and grow engagement with customers and a large range of stakeholders.“We will continue to support Northern Ireland, as we have done for the last  years – it’s a role we must fulfil, especially in the event that the economy is more challenging in the months ahead.”Kevin says the bank is putting a renewed and sharp focus on helping and supporting customers in the event of a dficult economic environment, post-Brexit.And aside from the business metrics, Danske Bank was also named as Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community. That’s something which Kevin and his team place considerable pride and value in.“The thing I’m most proud of is the work we have done to be named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community,” Kevin says.“We want the bank to be a force for good in the community. We are serious about that and we have four strategic pillars around our customers, stakeholders, society and our colleagues.” For Kevin, it’s about getting behind initiatives and “creating a legacy”. PROFILE: VICKY DAVIES Vicky Davies has settled in to her deputy chief executive role quickly – representing Danske Bank at the single largest delegation of Northern Ireland businesses to take their message to the heart of Westminster this summer.“The new deputy chief executive roles are a sign of the commitment the bank has to Northern Ireland,” Vicky says. “It’s a reflection of that and an outwards statement of intent to our customers and competitors. It’s also an opportunity for Stephen and I to expand our remits and our contribution to the bank.”A Cambridge University graduate, Vicky joined Danske Bank from Ulster Bank in  as Head of Business Development, before progressing to become managing director of strategy and corporate development. In  she became the bank’s first ever female executive board member.“My current core role is to devise and guide the strategy of the bank, plotting the course of its development over not just the next year, but the next five years and beyond” she said.With the new role that will also include spending more time with customers, industry bodies, and putting a face to the name amongst key stakeholders, as well as a sharpened internal focus – for example getting closer to the risk management aspects of the bank.Vicky and her fellow deputy chief executive Stephen Matchett have already been undertaking important executive roles, but the new posts will bring their roles and responsibilities to the fore.For years Vicky has been heavily involved in the burgeoning digital end of the bank, being close to the introduction of a number of mobile s and channels. On this, she says, “In the digital space, this year we have seen more than four million digital logons from customers each month and a % increase in digital transactions year-on-year.”Then there’s the Catalyst Belfast Fintech Hub on the ground floor of Danske HQ – a modern incubator and hub which in the space of little over a year now boasts around  members.“We wanted to help these businesses and also benefit from having their entrepreneurial spirit to rub off on our own colleagues,” she says. Vicky personally mentors some of these companies, hands on.She also chairs numerous committees within the bank and has a strong interest in its equality, ersity and inclusion agenda – having formed Danske’s Gender Diversity Network in .Vicky lives in Holywood with husband Bill and four young sons. On Brexit, she’s optimistic, given the strength of the bank’s position heading into the UK’s exit from the EU. “We hope there will be a good outcome. We are leading our competitors on a number of metrics, and that gives us a great springboard going forward.” PROFILE: STEPHEN MATCHETT Danske Bank’s other new deputy chief executive, Stephen Matchett, has held his core role as chief financial officerfor the last five years, and is a familiar face to journalists when it comes to discussing the minutiae of its results each year.“Danske Bank’s role in society is key, and we have an integral role in the economy here. The new leadership positions will see Vicky and I become more present and visible when it comes to customers, stakeholders and partners across the community” he says.A former Bank of Ireland executive, who began his career working for professional services giants PwC and Deloitte, at Danske Bank Stephen oversees a finance unit that also includes the treasury, economics, data intelligence and legal departments.Like Vicky, Stephen is also involved in leading in the Bank’s equality, ersity and inclusion agenda, and he is the senior management sponsor of ‘Enable’ – the Danske Disability Network.“My core role as CFO is traditionally slightly in the background – the changes now bring a public aspect to that, both within the wider Danske Bank Group and Northern Ireland.”It’s been a busy year for Stephen, and the rest of the bank, including being named Northern Ireland’s Responsible Company of the Year by Business in the Community.The Bank has also placed a renewed focus on its environmental impact and climate change. It’s already removed plastic cups, bottles and other packaging from its buildings, and is opting for more renewable and recyclable alternatives throughout its ious operations.Stephen, who lives in Belfast with his we Carrie and two young sons, is also a member of the CBI’s UK Financial Services Council.The Financial Services Council is made up of senior representatives from a erse range of financial services organisations and insurers, including Lloyds Banking Group, Barclays, JP Morgan, Bank of America, Santander, Aviva, MasterCard Europe and RSA Insurance Group.Looking at Danske Bank’s most recent financials, Stephen says while it remains an uncertain economic climate, Danske Bank is continuing to grow, year-on-year.And on Brexit, he says the Bank is preparing and planning by looking through two lenses – a focus on controlling costs, while also seeking out growth opportunities.“We want to maintain where we are at through this period of uncertainty and prepare ourselves for when the clouds clear – that’s the ambition.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/con211.jpg","title":"connaire mcgreevy brewing a burgeoning m business","story":"Posted on Monday December  by Ulster Business In the last  years Co Down man Connaire McGreevy has built his facilities management business CTS Projects into a £m firm, started a brewery, bought a bar and chaired a football club. He speaks to John Mulgrew about further growth, holding back on GB expansion due to Brexit, and why staying in the EU is the best deal we have “It’s good for the environment, businesses and people,” Connaire McGreevy tells me.He’s speaking of course about EU membership, and he’s one of Northern Ireland’s business leaders not concerned with remaining partisan on the matter, as we head into a Christmas General Election and sit with a deal on the table which would likely lead to increased costs and bureaucracy between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Connaire founded CTS Projects back in , and has developed it into a erse facilities management business, recently expanding further into the Republic – giving him reach from Donegal to Waterford, and “everything in between”.“We are an all-island facilities management company with signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland,” he told Ulster Business.“It has had signicant growth in the last number of years, particularly in the Republic of Ireland. We made moves after the Brexit referendum – we needed to ersy with a subsidiary.“There has been signicant growth in the Republic of Ireland, with % year-on-year. In business, it’s easy to grow from a base of nothing so we will see that normalise.”CTS began le refurbishing rundown properties, such as old social housing stock, to get them prepared to accept new tenants. That then grew and developed to include a focus on renewable heating, such as biomass boilers and solar  – focusing on energy efficiency. Around % of its work is with public sector clients, and the remainder with private companies.Those private sector clients include private office schemes in Belfast, looking after all of the main facilities management. CTS has grown into a -strong full-time workforce, with around  additional full-time sub-contractors also working for the business. And it’s on track to hit £m turnover this year.But CTS, like many other firms, has actively held back investing in new operations in GB, until there is a clear Brexit outcome.“Unfortunately we have noticed NI business opportunities have started to stagnate or decline,” he said. “A lack of an Assembly is having an impact on public sector– core maintenance, as opposed to new infrastructure development,” he says. “With private, there has been a downturn.”But he says since the summer “people seem to have found a new sense of confidence”. He says some of those who were holding back post-referendum appear to have now pushed forward with some investment.Speaking about which areas the company has grown in to, he said it has developed further into a more erse building management business.“We also expanded into fire and security in  – areas such as fire extinguishers, alarms and . We have found that energy efficiency and the environmentalis coming to the fore.” That includes areas such as battery energy storage and solar  for homes.“We have a lot of public sector clients in housing, education and healthcare. We have had local government in the past, and are actively targeting that area with new innovation.”Connaire’s own interest in decent beer drew out his entrepreneurship five years ago when he set up Mourne Mountains Brewery in Warrenpoint. On a separate note, he’s also the current chairman of Warrenpoint Town FC.“ was a passion turned into a business,” he says. “It’s exciting stuff, in terms of creating beer and marking five years. It’s still in its infancy and has been impacted by a mushroom of craft breweries.“I am still optimistic in the market, but I don’t see it growing as fast anymore. Looking at the market across the island, some may close their doors. The scale might not be there, and there are lots of larger breweries and imported beers – the consumer has so much choice. People know what they are looking for.”An opportunity also came knocking recently which saw Connaire taking on a bar in Warrenpoint, the Ye Old Ship Inn, which he says has a very personal connection.Connaire’s sister Ciara, who worked with him in CTS Projects and was a former gaelic footballer, passed away suddenly in . Connaire says she had worked in bars over the years, and the idea of taking one on was a conversation which they had.“There is vertical integration with the bar, as it’s an outlet there for us, with pop-up bars with the brewery.”But he, like many others in the brewing and distilling industry, says Northern Ireland’s licensing laws “are in the dark ages”. The main concern is that beer producers cannot sell their products to the public during a tour of the brewery, and require a drinks licence to do so.“We have a number of tourists who arrive at the doors, asking about tours and beer… it’s embarrassing for Northern Ireland. We don’t have the legislation in place. I am passionate about tourism in the area, and we have tourism projects in the mix.”With Brexit, Connaire believes the current deal from Prime Minister Boris Johnson would create a ergence down the Irish Sea, making all-island business a more attractive and palatable affair for companies here.“It’s an administrative border – paperwork, time and a cost to business,” he says. “Our plans would be going into GB to set up new company, with a small acquisition and some back office administration support. “All-island, under the deal it looks like we can have easy access, which is welcome. It’s so connected and any ergence is going to have an impact.”He said that could have an impact on foreign direct investmentas companies from outside the UK and Ireland. And Connaire says there is still no clarity of what a potential deal with the EU could look like on the outside.“It’s a waypoint in that journey and we have to be very cautious,” he said. “I personally feel we get the best deal possible being in the EU. Looking across the world, there are now trading blocs everywhere.“At this stage, in business circles, a lot of people are holding back investment to see what the trading environment is like. It’s the most uncertain period in my business journey.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/EHP_20191106_8525_web.jpg","title":"leading from the front kpmgs johnny hanna","story":"Posted on Wednesday December  by Ulster Business Fresh from a three month sabbatical travelling with his family, KPMG’s new partner in charge, Johnny Hanna, sits down with Ulster Business to discuss growing an already-strong local professional services firm with global reach, developing the next generation and what’s needed to set Northern Ireland apart on the world stage Johnny Hanna’s new role as partner in charge at KPMG in Northern Ireland sees him take the helm of an organisation already in a strong position, but also one which is very much in growth mode.And with more than  years under his belt working across KPMG, he’s now been tasked with taking the next leap forward – building on its strong client base, tackling the new business landscape which lies around the corner, and growing the next generation of top talent.While a global firm, KPMG works with a host of Northern Ireland businesses of all shapes and sizes – having le-long relationships with indigenous success stories such as First Derivatives and Norbrook – while also working with global businesses with connections to the UK and Ireland.TALENTKPMG now boasts a Belfast workforce of nearly  staff. But as the intake of top new graduates and experienced hires grows, that number looks set to expand and develop further still. Johnny’s confident that the company will continue to grow at its offices at the Soloist building in Belfast city centre. He points to the benefits for KPMG staff of signicant collaboration and shared working opportunities with Dublin as part a successful all-island business now employing over  people. The firm’s Corporate Finance team, for example, led by Russell Smyth are the go-to advisors in the renewables sector when it comes to fundraising for new assets north and south.“It’s an exciting time for the firm,” Johnny says. “We have done a lot in the last few years, working with many new clients, investing in our new office and increasing our graduate numbers. In addition there has been a record number of promotions. I’ve been working closely with our previous partner in charge John Hansen on all of that as well as continuing to grow and drive our large tax team, an area of expertise which we’ve always been renowned for.“My focus will be about maintaining this momentum and ensuring we continue to offer the expertise and solutions which our clients need, which will drive our growth. That means being alive to changing trading conditions, increased regulation and a business environment increasingly uncertain, disruptive and complex”.A law graduate from Queen’s University Belfast, Johnny’s also a fellow of Chartered Accountants Ireland, and a Chartered Tax Adviser– starting his career in Dublin with the former Arthur Andersen, which was later merged with KPMG.The Newry man became a partner with KPMG in  and has been head of tax in Northern Ireland since . The tax practice boasts around  tax professionals, most of which are dual qualied in tax and accountancy. “It’s a key dferentiator for us,” he says.“And while tax and audit represent the more traditional strands of business, KPMG has invested signicantly in new skills, specialisms and services arising from technological advances such as articical intelligence and cyber-security.”Johnny takes over his role at a time when Northern Ireland, along with the rest of the UK and Ireland, is undergoing arguably its biggest business and economic sht in a generation.“Brexit is just one part of it. We have been working closely with companies to prepare for Brexit, whether there is a ‘no deal’ or some sort of deal here.“We have had a lot of engagement with business groups and other stakeholders over the last three years to highlight our concerns and those of our clients. Wherever we end up on Brexit will definitely dictate the future trading conditions. Our role will be to help clients navigate their way around any new barriers they could face, as well as examining the potential opportunities which may arise from the UK’s exit from the EU.” ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT Attracting foreign direct investmentis something which cannot be ignored here, and a dferentiator for Northern Ireland could help bolster that – whether it’s a deal which moulds Northern Ireland as a unique business destination in the UK and Ireland, finally introducing a lower devolved rate of corporation tax or ideally a package of measures.“Not long after I took over the head of Tax role in  we co-hosted a breakfast in our KPMG New York office with ious international businesses. At that time there was a lot of talk around the reduced corporation tax rate. There was a lot of positivity and enthusiasm in the room that morning around the opportunity for Northern Ireland, and I’m looking forward to getting back to those types of discussions.“Northern Ireland requires a range of tools to help drive economic success in the post-Brexit era. It’s investment in infrastructure and skills, initiatives on export-led growth, delivering a .% tax rate and some sort of devolution of income tax powers – we need step change initiatives which can really turbocharge the private sector.”COMMUNITYGetting the right talent is also key for KPMG, building and developing a workforce which is increasingly erse, as well as giving back to the community. That includes a range of initiatives, including the recent launch of a skills-based scheme which has seen KPMG staff volunteering to help children, from a wide iety of backgrounds, with their literacy and numeracy skills.“Our graduates want to do more than get their qualications and service clients. They want to know that what they are doing has a broader purpose and objective. They want to know about our commitment to the local community and on environmental issues and be proud to work for KPMG”.  “We are ambitious to keep growing the practice and have a fantastic pool of talent in Belfast at all levels to help us realise those ambitions.“Ensuring we maintain the right culture within the firm for our people to reach their full potential and achieve their career aspirations is incredibly important. I was delighted we were able to add to our already strong team with the recent addition of four new partners in Ashleen Feeney, Paddy Doherty, Neil O’Hare and Dominic Mudge within our Deal Advisory, Tax and Audit teams.  “My role is to ensure that when I hand over to the next partner in charge, we are in an even stronger position than we are today. That’s the challenge and the goal but given the strong team and our market position, I know that I will relish the opportunity”.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
