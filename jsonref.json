I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

The terrifying moment a giant...Feline intuition: Cats at daycare center run for cover...Share this articleLeopards are solitary animals, unlike lions, and largely hunt at night to avoid competition with the so-called King of the Jungle.Because of their small size they will often drag their quarry up a tree to prevent it being stolen by other predators, which offers a clue as to where this leopard is hiding.They are similar in appearance to jaguars, but are smaller and less muscular. They also lack a dot in the centre of their spots, which is the mark of a jaguar.           The leopard is lazing in the branches of this tree, which is one of the animal\u0027s favoured hang-outs, as it keeps it out of the way of much larger predators that patrol the ground below          Even standing up in the tree, the leopard is hard to see (centre).

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet!

New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, pictured, told his first meeting of the Cabinet that accelerating contingency plans would be one of his first priorities in the new jobOne said: ‘If the EU won’t agree then we have got a very serious problem with the negotiations at that point.’EU leaders have so far given a muted reaction to Mrs May’s Chequers deal, saying they want to hear more detail before passing judgment. But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday suggested he was sceptical about Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without signing up to all the rules.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Barnier repeated that the single market and the four freedoms – goods, capital, services and labour – were the ‘the fundamental principles on which the EU is based’ and would be defended.Mr Barnier said 80 per cent of the issues surrounding the UK’s exit had now been resolved.But asked if he was worried other countries might follow Britain’s lead, Mr Barnier said: ‘Once again, I regret profoundly this vote of the UK, we respect it and we implement it.‘But it’s day after day more clear... I can tell you that it will be clear, clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation, that the best situation with the best relation with the EU, will remain to be a member of the EU.’Mr Barnier later said Brexit would be ‘costly and unpleasant’ for the UK. He warned the cost of Brexit would be ‘substantially higher for the UK than the EU’.He said that the EU would not accept Mrs May’s proposal for an exception for the financial industry from EU rules. He added: ‘It would go against all our objectives... I don’t know any country in the world that would accept such a loss of sovereignty.’He then half joked: ‘I have no personal experience of orce, it’s always costly and unpleasant’.Angela Merkel yesterday offered Theresa May a slender Brexit lifeline, saying the Chequers proposals would be viewed ‘in the spirit of friendship’.The German Chancellor also did not outright dismiss Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without accepting free movement. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19D84000000578-0-image-m-25_1531257019411.jpg","title":"Where Harry Kanes school cup winners Former classmates watch Englands Captain","story":"    His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialisingEven then, the 15-year-olds were often referred to as the ‘Harry Kane team’ and the players were under instructions to pass the ball to him if in trouble. His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialising. Kane, they said, shunned alcohol and was single-minded in his determination to become a professional footballer.One schoolfriend, Jack Coker, is at least a goalkeeper with semi-pro West Essex in the Essex Senior League but he earns his living as a PE teacher.Dean Ercan, a scaffolder from Chingford, played football with Kane from the age of eight.Share this article    Harry Kane of England national team plays with toy rooster during an England training session ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Semi-Final match against Croatia, on July 10English teacher Denis McElligott was coach of the school team and said Kane was always determined to make the most of his talent.‘He was a little bit stocky but then you would see him after a game out running, losing weight and working on his fitness,’ he said in a previous interview.‘Kids from other schools started to know who he was and know his name.

The firm has encouraged patients in the nearby area to de-register with their own surgery and join the new practice and 20,000 patients signed up in the first six months.But the BMA and the RCGP have accused Babylon of ‘cherry-picking’ the younger, easy-to-treat patients and leaving surgeries with the older, complex patients.          But GP leaders are very concerned about virtual consultations and fear they will miss serious, less obvious symptoms that doctors pick up through their gut instinctsSurgeries – including the one run by Babylon – are paid an average of £150 by the NHS for every patient on their books, so practices whose patients are moving to Babylon stand to lose substantial amounts of money. Last night it emerged that former culture secretary Mr Hancock, who was made Health Secretary in Monday’s mini-reshuffle, received a £5,000 in March 2015 from a donor who is the director of a number of companies working in the health sector. According to Companies House, Gurdev Dadral is director of several firms providing agency nurses and healthcare staff.Mr Hancock, 39, the MP for West Suffolk, who has three young children with his wife Martha, an osteopath, has inherited the hugely contentious social care remit from Jeremy Hunt and is supposed to be publishing a social care green paper this autumn.In a speech in 2012 he backed introducing an insurance system to fund social care. This would allow adults to take out insurance against the possibility of needing to spend many years being looked after in old age, if they develop dementia for example. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/12/4DF8E52E00000578-5925061-image-a-57_1530878002508.jpg","title":"Magical moment grandmother aunt learn Titan freed 18 days underground","story":"    As he was plucked from the cave mouth, his tearful grandmother Kong Kantawong, 60, spoke of her sheer relief, saying: ‘I am very happy and excited.

I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle\u0027\u0027Going back to the bun is a step away from the more casual low ponytail she sported yesterday, but as that was more of a private family occasion, perhaps she felt comfortable enough to try something new – today is a day for a tried-and-trusted look that she knows will photograph well.\u0027Meghan is known for wearing her hair in a looser and more relaxed style, but her hair today is much sleeker and more elegant, with a very tight ballerina-style knot in place of her usual messy bun.\u0027 Jason added: \u0027It\u0027s a sophisticated update on the look, ideal for such a formal occasion. I like that she\u0027s still given such a classic look a contemporary twist, by wearing the bun to the side, rather than in the middle of her head.\u0027This look also shows the neckline of her dress beautifully she clearly likes the combination of a bateau neckline, a fascinator and an up \u0027do. All three works together beautifully and it\u0027s a combination that looks fantastic, so I think it\u0027s safe to say this won\u0027t be the last time we see this look on Meghan.\u0027             The Duchess of Sussex was all smiles as she arrived at the event. To mark the RAF\u0027s centenary year, special events, activities and other initiatives at local, regional and national levels will run from April to the end of September 2018This year marks the centenary of the  Royal Air Force – the world\u0027s first independent air force – which was founded on 1 April 1918, independent of the British Army and Royal Navy.For one hundred years the RAF has defended the skies of Britain, preventing conflicts, delivering aid and combating cyber threats while working in partnership with other services.These include Operation Ruman – the UK\u0027s humanitarian assistance operation in the aftermath of hurricane Irma which hit the Caribbean in September 2017 – and the RAF\u0027s Quick Reaction Alert Typhoon Aircraft, providing a UK air defence capability 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.Today, the RAF is engaged on some 13 missions across 26 countries and is heavily committed on operations both at home and abroad.             The royals spent time speaking to RAF officials and members of the clergy before taking their seats in the church.

Meghan unveils a twist on her go-to style as she arrives in Ireland with a side bun and centre partingBy SIOFRA BRENNAN FOR MAILONLINE She\u0027s recently abandoned her beloved messy bun in favour of a more sleek and formal updo, and today the Duchess of Sussex debuted a new twist on the look.Stepping off the place in Dublin for her first official overseas visit with Harry, Meghan showed off a neat side bun with a side parting.It was a departure from the more severe style she\u0027s worn on several occasions, with hair swept to the back of her head with her hair parted down the middle.  The Duchess wore her hair in a neat updo with a side parting, lending a less severe look to the formal style. She wore her hair in swept back bun with a centre parting to a reception at Marlborough House in London last week Celebrity hairdresser James Johnson told Femail: \u0027The changing of a parting can alter your whole style, instantly.\u0027By keeping the side bun low and opposite, she\u0027s kept the symmetry in her look. This helps keep the over-style elegant, yet with a slight twist, making the hair a focal point.\u0027By keeping the hair balanced Meghans created a formal, more structured style, ideal for any royal appearance.\u0027Switching up the parting can create more dimension for any look, perfect for a plain outfit like Meghan has on here, giving the whole look more personality.   She ditched the messy bun she used to favour, seen here on a visit to Northern Ireland in March (left). But Meghan did mix things up today with a side parting and side bun The Duchess also showed off her prowess at literal dressing, wearing a top and pencil skirt by Givenchy in forest green, in a nod to the colour closely associated with the Emerald Isle.And she carried a £475 tan tote bag by Strathberry, the small Scottish brand whose designs Meghan has previously caused to sell out.This engagement is likely to be of particular interest to the Duchess, who has been outspoken on the topic of female empowerment.It\u0027s been a busy time for the newlyweds who kicked off the week by attending Prince Louis\u0027 christening at St James\u0027s Palace on Monday.Earlier today, they joined fellow members of the royal family for service to mark 100 years of the RAF at Westminster Abbey, followed by a flypast at Buckingham Palace.  Finding her royal feet!

Attorney General Geoffrey CoxYesterday, it was revealed that the Ministry of Justice has already been handed £17million to prepare for a no-deal Brexit.Justice Minister Lucy Frazer revealed that the Treasury had freed up the funds to ensure the MoJ ‘are ready for’ a no deal.The revelation came after a question in the Commons from Tory backbencher William Wragg.Justice Secretary David Gauke yesterday said that leaving the EU without a deal was ‘not an attractive proposition’.But, with time running out ahead of the UK’s departure next year, Mr Gauke said ministers had a duty to accelerate preparations. ‘It is absolutely right that we prepare for no deal,’ he said.Merkel praises May\u0027s \u0027progress\u0027 on Brexit and EU negotiator...May\u0027s fightback reshuffle: Millionaire lawyer who forgot to...Share this article‘We cannot rule out that that is where we will end up for one reason or another.’Mrs May warned MPs on Monday there was a ‘serious risk’ of Britain leaving without a deal if the EU rejects her latest compromise proposals.She added: ‘A responsible Government must prepare for a range of potential outcomes, including the possibility of no deal, and given the short period remaining before the conclusion of negotiations, the Cabinet agreed on Friday that these preparations should be stepped up.‘But at the same, we should recognise that such a disorderly no deal would have profound consequences for both the UK and the EU, and I believe that the UK deserves better.’Privately, Whitehall insiders believe Mrs May will be unable to go much further in offering concessions to the EU.          New Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, pictured, told his first meeting of the Cabinet that accelerating contingency plans would be one of his first priorities in the new jobOne said: ‘If the EU won’t agree then we have got a very serious problem with the negotiations at that point.’EU leaders have so far given a muted reaction to Mrs May’s Chequers deal, saying they want to hear more detail before passing judgment. But the EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier yesterday suggested he was sceptical about Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without signing up to all the rules.Speaking at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, Mr Barnier repeated that the single market and the four freedoms – goods, capital, services and labour – were the ‘the fundamental principles on which the EU is based’ and would be defended.Mr Barnier said 80 per cent of the issues surrounding the UK’s exit had now been resolved.But asked if he was worried other countries might follow Britain’s lead, Mr Barnier said: ‘Once again, I regret profoundly this vote of the UK, we respect it and we implement it.‘But it’s day after day more clear... I can tell you that it will be clear, clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation, that the best situation with the best relation with the EU, will remain to be a member of the EU.’Mr Barnier later said Brexit would be ‘costly and unpleasant’ for the UK. He warned the cost of Brexit would be ‘substantially higher for the UK than the EU’.He said that the EU would not accept Mrs May’s proposal for an exception for the financial industry from EU rules. He added: ‘It would go against all our objectives... I don’t know any country in the world that would accept such a loss of sovereignty.’He then half joked: ‘I have no personal experience of orce, it’s always costly and unpleasant’.Angela Merkel yesterday offered Theresa May a slender Brexit lifeline, saying the Chequers proposals would be viewed ‘in the spirit of friendship’.The German Chancellor also did not outright dismiss Mrs May’s idea of the UK retaining full access to the single market without accepting free movement. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/10/22/4E19D84000000578-0-image-m-25_1531257019411.jpg","title":"Where Harry Kanes school cup winners Former classmates watch Englands Captain","story":"    His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialisingEven then, the 15-year-olds were often referred to as the ‘Harry Kane team’ and the players were under instructions to pass the ball to him if in trouble. His former teammates admit that as they grew older their priorities switched to job hunting and socialising. Kane, they said, shunned alcohol and was single-minded in his determination to become a professional footballer.One schoolfriend, Jack Coker, is at least a goalkeeper with semi-pro West Essex in the Essex Senior League but he earns his living as a PE teacher.Dean Ercan, a scaffolder from Chingford, played football with Kane from the age of eight.Share this article    Harry Kane of England national team plays with toy rooster during an England training session ahead of the 2018 FIFA World Cup Russia Semi-Final match against Croatia, on July 10English teacher Denis McElligott was coach of the school team and said Kane was always determined to make the most of his talent.‘He was a little bit stocky but then you would see him after a game out running, losing weight and working on his fitness,’ he said in a previous interview.‘Kids from other schools started to know who he was and know his name.

Of the 90 exhibitions that fill the city’s museums and cultural spaces, five core shows have been selected and curated by the photographer Cristina de Middel, best known for her Afronaughts series, a playful reimagining of Zambia’s short-lived 1960s space mission. In Middel’s world, play isn’t a time-wasting, puerile distraction but an essential part of creativity. It is an invitation to stop and think differently. For this show of works by Magnum photographers, Middel and her co-curator Martin Parr searched for the word “players” in the Magnum archive. The resulting images show an unexpected side of the photography agency, bringing up questions about the definition of play and how it pervades everyday life, even in times of hardship.Marking 250 years of the modern circus, this exhibition explores the spectacle and thrill of the art form’s golden age, drawing from the vast collections within the Archive of Modern Conflict. While images of elephants standing on their hind legs and lions jumping through hoops are troubling from a contemporary perspective, they stand as a reminder of how differently joy has been experienced in the past. The show traces the trajectory of the spectacular, from human cannonballs to the nuclear tests in the 1950s. Here, Middel has chosen photographers who play with notions of time, place and scientific reason in unexpected ways. AnaHell’s absurdist series Secret Friends features people in multiple locations around the world, neatly bending their bodies forward to expose their backs. A hastily drawn face and a wig instantly transforms them into comic potato-like caricatures of the everyman.A comprehensive retrospective – and the 2018 PhotoEspaña award – celebrates Nigerian photographer Samuel Fosso’s exploration of identity, gender and colonialism in the African diaspora. The exhibition title references his own extraordinary journey from his childhood in Nigeria via Cameroon to the Central African Republic where he fled as a refugee after losing his parents in the civil war. Still a teenager, he became a photographer’s assistant before going on to run his own portrait studio. Fosso’s sardonic humour shines in his early experimental work and his later stylised recreations of black photo icons.

Matter of fact, full of bravado yet always wryly observational, these stack up steadily to construct the brisk interior landscape of her third novel, My Year of Rest and Relaxation.A young New York woman – unnamed, moneyed, a\u0026nbspspoiled Wasp by her own account, not long out of higher education and now a receptionist at a gallery where art thinks of itself as subversive but is in fact “just canned counterculture crap” – prepares herself for a\u0026nbspyear-long sleep. This self-induced coma, powered by prescription psychopharmaceuticals, will be broken only by short intervals of waking, during which she will eat ordered-in pizza and visit the lavatory. Why would anyone do this to herself? Because she’s already been made abject and partially erased by everyone she knows. Her mother – “a bedroom drunk” – used Valium to keep her placid as a baby. Her father ignored her. All she managed to elicit from either of them was an aggressive vagueness even their deaths were acts of absent-minded rejection. Meanwhile, Trevor, her boyfriend since college, now the ex she can’t stop obsessing about, has spent years wearing her down. At the height of their relationship Trevor’s idea of mutually rewarding sex was to come in her mouth while she slept – or pretended to.Everyone is vague about her\u0026nbspneeds, specific about their own. “Back then,” she admits, struggling with the decaying spectre of late postmodernism that haunts the novel, “I interpreted Trevor’s sadism as a satire of actual sadism.” So this will be less a year of unconsciousness than an orderly retreat “under the black veil of Ambien”, an organised effacement of the self. Her wish is that after some “good American sleep” she will come out the other side into a new life. By the time she wakes, she hopes, even her apartment will have transformed “into a paradise of realised dreams” - although when she tries to imagine that, the best she can do is “a cheesy mural of a rainbow ... a set of dentures in a glass”, the view fast-forwarded to the assisted living facility at the end of a nightmare.One of the other pleasures of reading Moshfegh is her relentless savagery. All this is delivered as comic – it is comic – but it’s not exactly funny, though of course we laugh. Some light relief is provided by the sleeper’s bulimic friend Reva, whose dialogue is scripted from a self-help manual, and by Dr Tuttle, the cartoon psychiatrist whose willingness to prescribe makes the year of recuperation possible. Dr Tuttle, a half-mad croaker in the tradition of William Burroughs, wears a neck brace and a white sleeveless nightgown to work and maintains the half-ironical paranoid patter of a 1960s cartoon psychopomp. Her office is rank with the smell of cat piss, her prescription pad always at the ready – Ativan to Zyprexa via Neuroproxin, Seconal, Promaxatine, primidone, Nyquil Seroquel, lithium, Xanax and all the rest. It’s clear that the majority of these substances are real enough: until you reach “Infermiterol”, at which point, though you’re fairly certain it’s made up, readerly confidence weakens and you begin to wonder if the medication is real and the doctor herself a hallucination – not so much the text’s, as your own. The narrator, who has similar doubts, is nevertheless ready to pick and mix. “The goal for most days was to get to a point where I could drift off easily, and come to without being startled. My thoughts were banal. My pulse was casual.”Dr Tuttle’s laid-back lunacy provides the only alternative in the text to the arctic self-centredness of everyone else – including that of the narrator, whose retreat is both enabled by and an expression of privilege. Contemporary privilege is, in this context, relief from the responsibility to acknowledge the existence of others. The dissociation of Moshfegh’s characters - their freedom from the need to make human contact, their constant emotional abandonment of one another during interactions as familiar as sex or childrearing - comes over as genuinely vile, but also as inadvertent, less willed than evidence of a baked-in incompetence on a cultural scale. While we’re laughing, we feel disgust. It’s a combination that makes for diamond-hard entertainment: halfway through, though, the reader begins to hope that My Year of Rest and Relaxation will wake up, collect itself and begin to move in some new direction.By then it has established the zoology of a well-funded New York in the moment of supernatural narcissism prior to 911 it has been viciously and decisively witty and it has demonstrated the author’s intellectual and emotional bona fides: now it needs to wake from its own dream and offer conclusions. When it does, almost as an afterthought, the shock is profound and disorienting.M John Harrison’s You Should Come With Me Now is published by Comma. • My Year of Rest and Relaxation is published by Jonathan Cape.

With hindsight his sexing up of Jane Austen may look questionable, even pervy but you could hardly complain about a version that put women at its centre – compare its nuanced Elizabeth and its, er, unforgettable Mrs Bennet with its colourless Darcy and Mr B – and did wonders for the Austen brand: after it (and the superb Emma update Clueless, in the same year) came Bridget Jones, biopics, Hollywood stars doing Regency English and a general freeing up of how the novels were read and reworked. Reaction is bound to be more mixed to the news that Davies will be rejigging Jane again with a TV version of the unfinished Sanditon. Twenty-three years on, “appropriation” is taboo for many, and assigning female authors (the Brontës, Du Maurier, non-Poirot Christie) to female screenwriters is pretty much de rigueur where it was radical and fresh in 1995 to have a man departing from the ladylike style of previous telly Austen, it’s a woman’s take on a male-written, male-led novel series (Debbie Horsfield’s Poldark) that’s the trendsetting costume drama in 2018. Hardly helping his cause, Davies (who turns 82 in September) licked his lips in the press release at getting his hands on a novel – whose heroine, Charlotte, is the guest of the founder of a Sussex resort – featuring such attractions as “quite a bit of nude bathing” (the latter conceivably by the novel’s visiting group of schoolgirls).And an Austen fragment seems a peculiar departure anyway for the ace adapter, whose recent projects – War and Peace, Les Misérables, A Suitable Boy, John Updike’s Rabbit saga – have all been male whoppers. The case for the defence? If there is one, it’s that Davies was ahead of the game in putting fiction by women on screen – not just Austen, but George Eliot, Elizabeth Gaskell, Winifred Holtby and Sarah Waters – and the ITVPBS Sanditon represents an autumnal circling back to this 90s00s period after his “big books by blokes” phase. Either that, or he just likes novels where young women predominate, preferably in revealing Regency frocks."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f40d505d620911cdcbd9b724728f96cc6ae8203/0_268_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bcc89a1d4fa274ef384c8243d43d5b02","title":"rupert murdoch ups his offer for takeover of sky to 24bn","story":"21st Century Fox intensifies bidding war, trumping Comcast’s bid of £22bn Rupert Murdoch has upped his offer for Sky to £24.5bn, trumping the offer tabled by rival Comcast and intensifying the bidding war for the broadcaster.The bid is a significant increase on the £12.50 a share, or £22bn valuation, offer made by rival Comcast.

They’ve exploded in popularity this year, riding the wave of trends like declining car ownership and increasing preference for renting rather than owning outright.These transport systems are quickly becoming ubiquitous – but what role can they play in the cities of tomorrow? The update to Citymapper offers an insight only if the kinks can be worked out – and it’s both more and less transformative than we might hope.Floating transport has obvious appeal to investors, especially those sore to have missed out on the Uber gravy train. Venture capitalists’ enthusiasm to jump on the next big thing in transport is the best explanation for the astounding US $300m (£226m) raised by scooter company Bird, at a valuation of $1.7bn, last month. That was matched this week by Uber and Google’s investment in Bird competitor Lime at a $1.1bn valuation, as the company rolls out (sorry) its bright green scooters to Paris, entering Europe for the first timeUnlike precursors such as docked cycle hire, or fixed-parking car hire (think Zipcar), the initial outlay is very small. There’s no need to build docks or pay cities for permanent parking spaces, and while demand remains high, the numbers are good – really, really good.A Bird scooter, for instance, will conservatively gross about $10 a day, according to Bloomberg’s Brad Stone. That’s five short rides, give or take. The scooter needs to be recharged – a job done by gig economy contractors who are paid $5 per recharged scooter – so the net profit per day is $5. With those figures, a $300 scooter with $50 worth of modifications including the GPS tracker and locking mechanisms, then pays for itself in two months.But simply being profitable doesn’t necessarily mean floating transport is good for a city, and the growth of the sector has been a bumpy ride. A big problem is that pavement is a shared space, and a limited resource. The overcrowding problems San Francisco has seen with Bird scooters are mirrored in London by Ofo bikes – a model where users abandon their vehicles wherever they want inevitably results in pavements littered with out-of-service rides.That can be annoying, unsightly or actively dangerous, depending on the circumstances. In London, parents have complained of having to push prams onto the road to get round piles of bikes, while wheelchair users in LA can find a previously accessible route blocked by a wayward scooters.While floating transport is free from many of the regulatory burdens faced by previous transport startups, it’s not immune. Electric scooters, for instance, can’t easily expand to the UK, because they aren’t legal to use on the road or the pavement. Dockless cycle hire faces similar trouble in Australia, where helmets are required by law.Citymapper is betting, though, that despite hurdles on a regional level, this is the future globally. The app currently has a slim level of integration with most floating transport providers – inidual bikes, cars and scooters will appear on the map, along with information like charge level. But they aren’t yet seamlessly combined with the company’s flagship multi-modal journey planner.When that does happen, as Citymapper has said, the services will be presented like any other mode of transport. If it’s quicker to hop on an Ofo bike and cycle to the tube than it is to wait for a bus, it will show as an option.But the company’s mock-up of how it might look in the app– showing a notional journey from transport-deprived Stoke Newington, in north-east London – conceals some of the potential flaws of floating transport. It’s easy enough to plan a journey that begins with a three-minute walk to a bike and ends with 30 minutes on the tube, but it’s somewhat harder to plan your return trip. Will the bike still be there? Or would you have been better off taking an entirely different route in the first place? (That’s not a hypothetical concern – it has happened to me a few times. It’s worse still when you arrive at a bike you’d intended to use to find it still there but not actually working, because it hasn’t yet been reported and removed from the map.)Floating transport also faces similar problems to those that docked cycle hire discovered in its early years: iniduals’ movement through cities is highly correlated. Rush hour is the obvious example, but other trends become clear if you spend long enough staring at data visualisations of where, say, London’s Santander bikes are at any given time. Try to find a docking space outside Hackney’s Victoria Park at 1pm on a sunny summer Saturday, and eight hours later, you’ll have just as hard a time trying to find a bike to get home with.Now imagine trying to solve that problem without docks where would-be renters can at least wait in the hope that a bike will be dropped off.Many floating transport providers have realised these potential pitfalls, and are taking steps to address them. Some bike providers, for instance, have followed the lead of London’s cycle hire network, and now collect bikes left in out-of-the-way places and drop them near transport hubs. Jump, an e-bike provider now owned by Uber, lets users “preorder” bikes, renting them in advance (and still paying by the minute) to ensure they’re there when they need them.And of course, smart transport planners play their own part. If we could give ourselves over fully to Citymapper and its ilk, religiously following instructions to the letter even on journeys which we think we know, then the app could merrily reroute as and when the circumstances on the ground change, erting users towards bikes that have suddenly appeared for rent, or telling them to hop on a bus if someone’s beaten you to a scooter.But ultimately, floating transport is going to have to learn another lesson that conventional transportation bodies have taken to heart: flexible may be fun, but cities run on reliable.Follow  Cities on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to join the discussion, and explore our archive here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0af18644225f1acb8923b110408d1a884c399c0c/0_91_4892_2935/master/4892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0deebf057d075d1fab9c31d9a067b06e","title":"the guardian view on the nato summit europe must come together","story":"James Comey, the former FBI director, said of Donald Trump that he bore more resemblance to a mob boss than a democratic politician. In Mr Comey’s experience Mr Trump was a leader who demanded loyalty oaths, wanted absolute control, traded in lies and insisted on an us-versus-them worldview. Unfortunately these traits\u0026nbspwill undoubtedly be on display when the US president arrives at the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation summit in Brussels tomorrow.It is these kinds of actions that make Mr Trump so dangerous. The Nato alliance has helped mould the modern world and ushered in a democratic, liberal world order characterised by open trade and open societies, which after the collapse of the Soviet Union needed only to be lightly defended. This in turn contributed greatly to American peace and prosperity. A perception that the burdens are unequally shared is not new. It is almost as old as the alliance itself. Barack Obama worried that other nations did not act for themselves, waiting instead for Washington to lead. Mr Obama could be criticised for sermonising, but he was being straight. He saw that the defence of the multilateral rules-based order against jihadist terror, Russian adventurism and Chinese intimidation was essential. But it required other nations to shoulder their responsibilities. This seems fair. By contrast Mr Trump wrongly sees the US being disadvantaged, not advantaged, by the current global order. His tactics are to tear down this order rather than build it up.Nato’s top brass will have their work cut out. The US president prefers the argument of power to the power of argument. He thinks little of humiliating allies over the Iran nuclear deal or snubbing them over the Paris climate change pact or infuriating them with tariffs. This could lead to anarchy, as nations conclude that they are freer to act with impunity. With rising powers such as China, it might end in confrontation. The US president’s description of Nato as being “as bad as Nafta” at the last G7 summit is not a good sign. The twin pillars of Europe’s place in the world are law-based global order and the transatlantic alliance. Mr Trump will find to his cost that Europeans cannot choose between them. Order cannot be imposed it needs to be accepted. Mr Trump likes to think of politics as business, but he won’t strike good, lasting deals with allies – and enemies – without rules that everyone plays by."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/82bacba330eb9ef9923aa479a9f95464dd5e69e6/0_62_3000_1801/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10088b53e93793fb8aeef937ffd79547","title":"america left alexandria ocasio cortez new york primary","story":"Even at first sight it is exhilarating. The overthrow of one of the most mainstream and senior Democrats in Congress by a 28-year-old Democratic socialist with a radical programme and one tenth of his funding is, you might think, interesting enough.But since Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez beat Joe Crowley in the Democratic primary in New York’s 14th district (meaning she will almost certainly enter Congress in November), I’ve been interviewing some of the people who lit the fuse that caused this detonation. What has emerged is just how marginal and improbable their movement was when it began, and how quickly it is now gaining momentum. A revolution has begun in America, and it is time we understood what it means.While the effort to find and run insurgent candidates arose from the Bernie Sanders campaign in 2016, the handful of young people who launched this movement struck out entirely on their own. They had no resources and no political standing. Neither Sanders nor any others in the old guard were prepared to support them or\u0026nbspendorse the candidates they found.In a way, this tiny group, Brand New Congress, which evolved into the Justice Democrats, marginalised itself. It wanted nothing to do with a traditional left it saw as being obsessed with positioning. It wanted to escape the shadow of people who seemed stuck in the 1980s, who didn’t take environmental issues seriously or understand the need to challenge structural racism and gender inequality, or to reach millennials trapped in terrible housing and miserable non-jobs. They were mocked, ignored and dismissed as well-intentioned but hopeless idealists. One of them told me how he was literally patted on the head by an older Democrat.At first, it was chaotic. Most of the volunteers they recruited had little or no experience. Some turned out to\u0026nbspbe wonderful, others less so. Their original aim was to\u0026nbspfind 400 candidates to challenge both Democratic and Republican incumbents. They sought bartenders, factory workers, small-business people, community organisers, teachers, nurses – ideally people who had never held public office before. While Democratic candidates are usually chosen on the grounds of how much money they can raise, the Justice Democrats looked for people who could not be seduced\u0026nbspby big funders. They reasoned that if the people they met had served their communities instead of themselves, they were unlikely to sell out once they were elected.They found plenty of brilliant potential recruits, butithout mainstream support they didn’t have the credibility required to convince hundreds of people to give up their lives for an improbable cause. They managed to persuade a few dozen, however, and among them was Ocasio-Cortez. They phoned her, invited her to dinner, and asked her to attend a meeting in Kentucky with other potential candidates, in the hope that they would inspire each other to run. She took her time and toured the 14th district before she agreed.She was, as we have seen, a fantastic candidate: determined, indefatigable, brilliant at explaining complex issues simply and directly. Alexandra Rojas, the campaigns director of Justice Democrats, tells me: “She has a way of making issues that others see as radical seem simple, straightforward and pragmatic.” Everyone I spoke to remarked on her grace and stability, and how she calmly absorbed the dramas that surrounded her bid. Extraordinary local campaigners combined traditional fieldwork with the big organising tactics developed during the Sanders campaign: using proliferating networks of volunteers to fill the jobs usually reserved for staffers.Remarkable as she is, there are others like her. Cori Bush in Missouri, Jess King in Pennsylvania and Kerri Evelyn Harris in Delaware are just a few of those now fighting for Democratic nominations or seats while renouncing big money, relying instead on the enthusiasm of the communities they hope to serve.The Justice Democrats are not expecting all these candidates to win, but hope for a few spectacular victories at the congressional elections in 2018 and 2020, not only replacing corporate, money-tainted Democrats, but flipping a couple of Republican districts as well (look out, for example, for the campaigns by Brent Welder and James Thompson in Kansas). As soon as such people take their seats in Congress, Saikat Chakrabarti, one of the core organisers, tells me the aim is to “legislate the hell out of everything, like the Republicans do … proposing the boldest, biggest ideas on day one”. By 2022, using the momentum gained from a few strategic victories, they hope to run a full slate of new or re-energised candidates. The aim is to create a genuinely populist Democratic party, which neutralises Trump’s brutal demagoguery and speaks to people across the political spectrum who have been alienated by the corruption and drift of mainstream politics.Thanks in part to the supreme court’s disastrous Citizens United ruling, which removed the caps on political spending by lobbyists, US politics is dominated by billionaires and corporations, buying the candidates and policies they want. They can’t be outspent, but they can be outmanoeuvred, by recruiting incorruptible people who can speak past the money. Eventually, the Justice Democrats hope, there will be enough strong and inspiring people in Congress to overthrow this ruling and purge the institutional corruption from US politics.So far, the Democratic party has reacted in two distinct ways. Some senior figures, such as Nancy Pelosi and Tammy Duckworth, dismiss the significance of what Ocasio-Cortez has achieved. Others, such as Kirsten Gillibrand, have suddenly switched positions in response to her victory, echoing her call, for example, for the abolition of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, which has been separating children from their parents on the Mexican border. Both are forms of self-preservation, but if more revolutionary candidates win their races, the second variety is likely to prevail.By understanding how the great reversal in New York happened, we can begin to understand what this movement of outsiders might achieve.

When people meet the glances of others, smile and know exactly what they are thinking. When strangers, merry and giddy, connect on the trains that usually symbolise an urban dystopia. When young Britons of many complexions sport England shirts and look as though they had won a modest bet.Sure, there was over-exuberance: “Two world wars and two world cups,” was one mindless chant as my train circuited east London.

They will claim this, was the lament. But they can’t.Because there is nothing about that team, with its youth and vigour and ersity and modernity, that would give nationalists any succour. What can they credibly say about a team born of the contemporary Britain they so despise, with its thoughtful, dignified manager, its melding of young men whose lineages originate far and wide – not least the Windrush generation grandchildren? What’s pleasing about the England campaign so far is that it is a project that looks ahead. How can it be claimed by reactionary Brexiters whose only navigation tool is the rear-view mirror?England may not prevail tonight but already they have given us a moment. And isn’t that something for the government to think about? It can’t mandate bonhomie, but it can think again about the power of sport to create moments when a erse society finds common cause. And then it can start funding grassroots sport properly through the public purse on the basis that it yields public gain. It can take a hard line to ensure that events that drive a national mood and conversation are accessible to all, not just to those with pockets deep enough to view them via satellite dish or premium cable.It can think seriously about how and where and why those communal moments occur and what might be done to have more of them. A erse nation is a boon in the modern world. It is a fact of life. But it throws up challenges. Homogeneity is a thing of the past.

Which is a shame because our culture loves romantic love. It’s an idea that pervades pop music, novels, TV and film. Somewhere out there our perfect match is waiting to meet us, so the theory goes. But maybe love isn’t really about The One. Maybe the early films of Richard Curtis don’t have all the answers.So what is love, actually? There are many answers to this question, says the anthropologist Anna Machin, but let’s start with an evolutionary explanation. Basically, love helps a species to cooperate. “We need to cooperate to survive, to subsist, to learn, to reproduce and to raise our children,” she says. “Romantic and parental love is essentially the neurochemical reward for cooperating, which is cognitively quite difficult.” It’s a kind of biological bribery, in other words.Love is the basis of animal attachment, distinct from lust or sex drive. But forget about the myth of love at first sight, Machin says. “There is lust at first sight. When someone experiences lust, their amygdala – the ancient, central part of the brain responsible for emotion – is releasing the neurochemicals dopamine and oxytocin. Dopamine is a general reward chemical, which makes you feel euphoric, warm and motivated to form a relationship with someone. Oxytocin works to lower your inhibitions to forming a relationship.” This attraction, Machin explains, is triggered by physical signs of a good mate, such as an ideal 0.7 waist-hip ratio in women or a highly symmetrical face.The neurochemical processes of love are more complex, and last longer than lust. As well as the amygdala, love involves the neocortex – the part of the brain responsible for social cognition. “That’s where all the trust, empathy, planning ahead and trying to coordinate your life with the person you’re in love with sits,” says Machin.During love, the brain is flooded with an opiate called beta-endorphin. “Beta-endorphin is addictive,” Machin says, “so when you’re in love with someone, you are addicted to the release of beta-endorphin you receive when you interact with them. When you’re away from them, you go into a kind of withdrawal. As a consequence you go back and get another hit.”Our experiences of love are influenced by factors beyond spontaneous emotion. Jess Carbino, a sociologist who works for the dating app Bumble, says the way we seek love is complex, but it’s “a romantic myth” to call it random. “People are very deliberate about finding love,” she says. “When we are looking for romantic partners, for example, people are very realistic about who they look for in the dating market, based on their own physical attractiveness.”Carbino reckons this dating market has always existed in some form the advent of online dating apps just made it more visible. “In theory, prior to the emergence of online dating, people were speculating about what the market was because they could only see a fraction of it. Now you’re embedded in a variety of markets online – not just your work market or your religious market, but every market available within a geographic radius within the age and gender you’re looking for.”It is these differing expectations and experiences that can cause relationships to fail, says Kathrine Bejanyan, a relationship consultant . “Where I see the biggest problem is not necessarily people falling in love, it’s sustaining it,” she explains. These clashes can stem from our family upbringing, for instance. “Say you grew up in a family where love was shown through giving gifts when you got a good grade, that person experienced gift-giving as an expression as love. Another person with a different upbringing might understand love and how to receive it differently.”From a theological perspective, says Werner Jeanrond, a Catholic theologian at Oxford University, “love invites us to a much deeper way of seeing”. Jeanrond says all forms of love are united and defined “by the challenge of otherness” (the “other” being the opposite of the self). Jeanrond argues that love involves engaging with otherness in at least four ways. “There is the other human being, in an intersubjective relationship. Then there is our relationship to the cosmos or the universe or nature. Then there is the question of God or ultimate reality – how can you relate to the radical other? And most problematic is our relationship to ourselves – can I love me?”The opposite of love is therefore not hatred but indifference, Jeanrond says. “I think people see that wrongly. Hatred is a warped love, but it is still interested and obsessed with the other. Indifference is the opposite of love because they don’t even see the other.”As Jeanrond points out, love is relative, erse and not always conspicuous. It has countless definitions, depending on who you ask. But perhaps the real mystery is how these definitions fit together.• Alfie Packham is the editor of  Students"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f772e2f2dd00bce087ff80e76352cb2625d14c9/0_0_1190_793/master/1190.jpg?w=1140\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=45f5b246ae94202020c43db3dd93399e 1140w","title":"croatia world cup semi finals masters improvisation england","story":"As Zlatko Dalic’s side face England in the World Cup last four with no system for developing players at home, is it chaos that makes them good footballers?As Croatia won the coin toss before the penalty shootout against Russia in the World Cup quarter-final, Luka Modric, their captain, shouted across the pitch to his goalkeeper, Danijel Subasic: “Are we gonna go first?”Giving Subasic the chance to save a penalty first could conceivably have handed Croatia an edge. But that is not the point here. The point is that they got all that way, to a quarter-final of a World Cup, and to a second consecutive shootout without a plan.These players got to the defining moment of their international careers without knowing what to do in that situation. Compared with England’s thorough preparation for their shootout against Colombia, Croatia’s seems a joke.“Penalties are always a lottery you never know what will happen,” the Croatia manager, Zlatko Dalic, said after the win against Denmark. “The day before, we shot two series of them, although it wasn’t my intention to practise penalties because we always expect to solve everything within 90 minutes.”In some countries the manager might be criticised or even mocked for that kind of approach but in Croatia few seemed to care. “We went through, everything is great,” Subasic said, summing up the general mood before adding the old “lottery” shtick himself. And of course he got away with it, because that is the culture – no one should question you as long as you are winning those who do are denounced for “ruining the atmosphere”.But it was also symptomatic of a more general decision-making and preparation process in Croatian football. There is no long-term or medium-term plan, no blueprint, no established system. Croatians are masters of improvisation.People often ask how it is possible for a nation of only four million to produce so many class footballers. A proper answer, apart from the esoteric clichés of natural predeterminism or genetic predisposition, has never been offered by anyone. Sure, there are some good youth coaches – obviously, given all the talent developed in recent years – but there is no general programme in place that systematically educates or distributes young players across the country. Very few new stadiums have been built or properly renovated in the past three decades and the same goes for training grounds. The facilities almost everywhere are basic, at best a lot of pitches are awful, the clubs struggling to make ends meet.For years Croatia’s youth national teams depended heavily on the output of one club’s programme. Lavishly funded by the city, the Dinamo Zagreb academy could afford to have the best (and the most) coaches and broaden its catchment area throughout the country, and beyond. Thanks to Dinamo’s massive influence in the Croatian football federation, their youngsters have been almost automatically called up for Croatia – at one point two years ago, the under-17 team had 11 out of 11 players from Dinamo in their starting lineup – and only recently has their monopoly started to be broken up. Other clubs are slowly catching up, particularly Dinamo’s arch rivals, Hajduk Split, who are revamping their academy.Dinamo have also had Lokomotiva – their feeder club to all intents and purposes – allowed to play in the top ision against all competitive logic. Six players from the current World Cup squad have played at Lokomotiva at some point, gaining valuable first-team experience at top national club level after graduating from the academy.Still, there is no system, no plan. Dinamo have for years manically fired and hired coaches, changing their approach to youth development almost every time and Croatia did the same. Dinamo have sacked their head coach 17 times in the past 13 years – during which time they have won 12 league titles. The last three Croatia managers who lost their jobs – Igor Stimac, Niko Kovac and Ante Cacic – did so just before decisive matches in qualifying.The current incumbent, Dalic, was appointed only 48 hours before the final group game in Ukraine, which Croatia had to win in order to reach the play-offs. He met his players at Zagreb airport before flying to Kiev.All this time the federation’s investment in infrastructure and grassroots football has been down to a bare minimum, their vision non-existent. A couple of years ago they commissioned Romeo Jozak, their technical director at the time, to put together a long-term plan for the development of Croatian football, very much like what Michel Sablon has done for Belgium. Jozak was fired weeks before presenting his plan.Strategy, logic and order play little part in Croatian football. And some would suggest that ethos – or lack of it – translates to the pitch as well. How else can you explain that a team with some of the best midfielders at this tournament is refusing to take control of the midfield in matches?Against Russia, Croatia played 109 long balls and, although they were clearly the better team, made things hard for themselves by not playing to their strengths. Consequently they had to rely on another “lottery” to progress.Could it be, however, that these cheeky and resourceful Croatians, in fact thrive on chaos and lack of organisation? Being used to improvisation from a young age, maybe they have accepted it as part of their mentality and now cannot succeed in any other way as a group? It is a tempting theory – although, of course, maybe they were just plain lucky."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/271f90b7eb5b63abe18839d825dac3982a2c5037/0_71_4719_2833/master/4719.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0828920b66f3e728914b69d06aa5866d","title":"england excited nervous world cup semi final croatia moscow","story":"Much has been said about this new England side but, if they can beat Croatia on Wednesday to reach the World Cup final, they would probably take even that in their strideThe last time England had this kind of rare opportunity Bobby Robson was being driven to the point of distraction by the footballer whom Gianni Agnelli, the president of Juventus, described during that run to the 1990 World Cup semi-finals as “a dog of war with the face of a child”.Paul Gascoigne had, among other episodes, contributed to Bryan Robson’s absence because of a drunken prank in which a bed landed on the captain’s toe (achilles trouble, was the official line). Gascoigne broke curfews as a habit, spooked Bobby Robson into thinking he had fallen off a balcony and come to an arrangement with the hotel barman that, when he ordered a milkshake, it was in fact Baileys.But most of all he had played football beautifully. “You do realise you’ll be playing against the best midfielder in the world?” his manager asked him before that famous night in Turin. “No,” Gazza replied, “he is.” Then the game started and he made a point of nutmegging Lothar Matthäus, captain of West Germany.Did you see Dele Alli this week reminiscing about the time he did the same to Luka Modric? Perhaps you thought he sounded a little overconfident to be talking of such a thing. But it was actually quite reassuring, from an English perspective, to be in Alli’s company and see, close-up, how confident he was at a time when this bunch of players, more than ever, need to show they have moved on since the days when Fabio Capello said the England shirt “weighed heavily” on their shoulders.Already that process is well under way and Gareth Southgate gives the impression he has freed himself of some of his own demons. One story he told after his team’s arrival in Moscow related to how, for more than 20 years, he could barely bring himself to listen to Three Lions because it brought back painful memories of his missed penalty in the Euro 96 semi-final. “I would just walk out of the room,” he said. “It is an anthem and it has followed the team for a long time but that has involved some difficult moments as well.”Two more wins for England and Southgate might even catch himself humming a tune he used to hate. And, once again, it was remarkable how relaxed everyone inside the England camp appeared to be. For those of us who have travelled with this team around Russia from day one, and not detected even a flicker of apprehension, it has been like that since the start. Heck, they even began their latest training session with a game of catch, using a rubber chicken rather than a ball. “A bit of fun to get them moving,” Southgate explained.The serious business takes place in the Luzhniki Stadium on Wednesday to find out whether his players will be returning to Moscow on Sunday for the day of their lives.Yet Southgate is correct when he says it would come as a surprise if the sense of occasion got to any of his players. Harry Kane, for one, gives the impression he is immune to stagefright when there are glories to be had and a Golden Boot glistening in the distance. Kieran Trippier is one of the players of the tournament. Alli is not faking it when he says he has never felt nervous before any football match in his life. And that is just the Spurs boys. Alli’s take – “excited, not nervous” – summed it up neatly.Nor did Southgate seem in the slightest bit uptight as he told a story, with more of that self‑deprecating humour, about what he makes of superstitions in football. “I’ll tell you a story about me and superstitions. When I was managing Middlesbrough we had a game at Reading and I was under a bit of pressure. I’d forgotten my socks so I went to the kit man and I borrowed a pair of black goalkeeping socks. When we won the staff made this big thing about my ‘lucky socks’, saying I had to wear them next game. I thought: ‘Hmm, shall I wear those socks? No, it’s ridiculous.’ Well, we lost the next game. Then, on the Tuesday, we were playing again and I thought: ‘Well, I’d better put the socks on’ and we won 2-0.”Brilliant! So did he still wear these lucky socks? Southgate had not finished his story. “Then I went upstairs and got sacked. So really, from that moment, superstitions have rather gone out the window.” Classic Gareth.To put the Croatia story into context, the entire population of their country (4m) is a third of that of the city in which the game will be played. England have suffered before, of course, because of Luka Modric’s expertise on the ball. Indeed, before the ordeal against Iceland at Euro 2016 the most harrowing England game of the 21st century was arguably against Croatia, with Steve McClaren watching beneath an umbrella as his team lost 3-2 and failed to qualify for Euro 2008. The pitch that night was soaked and rutted but Modric passed the ball as though he was playing on a bowling green. He has done likewise for the past decade and part of the battle for England, inevitably, will be to subdue the Real Madrid player.‘Equally we’re looking at how we can hurt them,” Southgate countered. “What are the areas we can exploit? Bloody hell, we played Nuneaton Borough in the cup once and thought their centre‑forward was Eusébio because we’d built him up that much in the pre‑match briefing. You can overdo the information for players. The lads know these players but we have good defensive organisation. We don’t have to shift from what we’ve been doing.”He sounded like a man who fully believed in his own team. “We’re enjoying the journey,” Southgate said. “We came here to enjoy our football and we’ve made several pieces of history already: our biggest win in the tournament, our first knockout win for 12 years, our first quarter‑final win for even longer. We keep looking to break the barriers down. It’s been an enjoyable journey. We want to keep it going.”The alternative is that England end up in the third-versus-fourth play-off in St Petersburg on Saturday and going through the motions of a game that, frankly, feels like an irrelevance. “It is one of the curiosities of the World Cup that they should have such a match,” Peter Shilton, England’s goalkeeper in 1990, once said. “The players don’t want it and it has little interest for the supporters. The last thing you want to do is stay to play a meaningless match.” Nobody, however, forgets a World Cup final. As Southgate said, the players should not need a team talk."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f9e8355577ad2299b900c1cf1372efe06d47a1f4/0_124_4107_2464/master/4107.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=55b6156d401170734143e957c8d87bc6","title":"football manchester city sign riyad mahrez leicester city","story":"• Long-term target signs five-year contract at Etihad• Mahrez: ‘City are redefining the English game’Manchester City have signed Riyad Mahrez from Leicester, the 27-year-old winger costing a club record £60m that could rise to £75m with add-ons.Mahrez, who has signed a five-year contract and will wear the No 26 shirt, is Pep Guardiola’s first signing of the summer, with the manager having targeted a wide forward and defensive midfielder in this transfer window.Mahrez, who was a key player in Leicester’s 2016 title-winning side, told Manchester City’s website: “I am so pleased to have joined City, a side playing great football under Pep Guardiola.

What can the team’s approach teach us all about facing fear and failure?This week, the England midfielder Dele Alli was asked if he was nervous about the big tests up ahead: first, of course, the team’s semi-final against Croatia on Wednesday. “Excited, not nervous,” he replied. His apparent happiness and confidence reflected an England team that seems transformed from previous incarnations. Where once it was stuffed with entitled, surly stars, burdened with the weight of history and the pressure of expectations, it now comes across as a hungry, humble team, playing with lightness and joy.“We’ve spoken to the players about writing their own stories,” said the manager, Gareth Southgate, after the team beat Colombia in an unprecedentedly victorious (for England) penalty shootout. “Tonight they showed they don’t have to conform to what’s gone before. They have created their own history … We always have to believe in what is possible in life and not be hindered by history or expectations.”The team appears in a better place psychologically than it has for generations. Much of the credit has gone to Southgate, but also to Pippa Grange, the team psychologist, who has been working behind the scenes. “She’s an amazing person,” Alli said on Monday. “Everyone listens to her when she talks.”Grange was appointed by the FA as its head of people and team development in November last year, given the job of building resilience while confronting the pressures and psychodramas faced by previous England squads. The FA has said it searched globally for the right person for the job, but Grange, like most of the young players, isn’t an obvious superstar in her field there is no self-promoting social media presence or bestselling self-development books.She wrote in 2013 that being a woman in a male team environment “is a constant navigation, for everyone. I have no interest in being one of the lads and I don’t quite fit in the ‘nurturing mother figure’ category in terms of the leadership work I do. I would be professionally ineffective if I remained in the background, psychologically safe with minimal voice, and I am not here to be the centre of attention as some form of entertainment. I don’t want to be completely separate because that would make me inaccessible and probably be a lonely place to operate from.”The midfielder Eric Dier said: “I think a lot of the work that we’ve done with her has been prior to the tournament starting, over the last six or seven months.” This has reportedly included getting the players to sit down together in small groups to share their life experiences and anxieties, and to reveal intimate truths about their character and what drives them. The point, Southgate has said, is to build trust, “making them closer, with a better understanding of each other”.The England football team has focused on the mental side of the game before, most prominently with the psychiatrist Steve Peters, who was recruited before the 2014 World Cup. What is new is the extent to which psychology has been embraced (prior to Grange’s appointment, the performance consultancy Lane 4 was working with the FA on psychological tactics). Access to Peters, it was reported, was offered to the players only if they felt they needed it – and not many would have admitted to wanting help.“The whole group must buy into the idea that the sports psychologist has come with a specific set of skills and practices that are really worthwhile,” says Andy Lane, the professor of sport and learning at the University of Wolverhampton. “A recent turnaround in professional soccer is the preparedness to use sports science in an integrated way. It’s that acceptance by the whole group that gives one professional the chance to be effective.” Much of that culture shift will have been down to Southgate, who has shown his support for Grange, whom he clearly respects. “She is a strong and important addition to the team,” the manager said in May.Grange is a fan of inspirational quotes, from Oscar Wilde to Nelson Mandela to Michael Jordan some adorn the training gym walls (“Success isn’t given, it’s earned,” reads one). She is also said to encourage the players to get off their phones and play games with each other – including one in the hotel pool with inflatable unicorns after the win against Tunisia in the group stages and she is said to dislike social media, which she expects the players to use wisely. Southgate hasn’t banned social media – unlike previous managers, he hasn’t appeared to ban anything – but has apparently taken Grange’s thoughts on board. While he acknowledged it was good for the players to engage with fans, he added: “Personally, I’m not sure there’s value to reading comments that come in. It comes back to: what creates pressure, or what creates misery in your life?”Michael Caulfield, a sport psychologist and the co-director of the consultancy Sporting Edge, says Southgate, with whom he worked at Middlesbrough, has a leadership style “built on incredible levels of trust between him and his players and staff. He was determined to convince the team there was nothing to fear from playing in the World Cup for England, whereas in the past people were nervous or fearful. He was determined to change that mindset from one of fear to one of adventure. That’s the biggest thing he’s done.”When someone is under a moment of extreme pressure, using a tactic such as mental cues can be helpful, says Kate Hays, the head of psychology at the English Institute of Sport. “People will have cue words that will bring them back into focus on the task at hand – for some, they could be emotional cues for others, it could be technically focused. It’s just one or two words that can get people to focus on the right thing.”Southgate, who has experienced his own disappointments – that missed penalty at the semi-finals of Euro 96, and his managerial career at Middlesbrough ending in relegation – has said as much: “I have learned from things that have gone wrong and had to pick myself up … Because of those failures, I feel it gives you the freedom of being able to say, ‘How might we be the best possible team?’ and not be afraid of what goes wrong – because whatever goes wrong we can deal with, as I have lived through it.”Grange has no fear of failure either. She has written: “I’d like to turn this unhealthy preoccupation with success on its head and put it on the record that I think failure is really useful. For without failure we cannot progress longer, higher or faster. It’s a funny paradox – our successes are achieved through trying, and trying most often ends in failure. Every day in our general lives and our sporting lives we will win some and lose some it’s just part of the way life should be. It could be missing out on a promotion, being pipped at the line in a running race or bombing out in an exam – it doesn’t matter – the important lesson is to learn from our failures, reassess, rethink, move forward (sometimes in a different direction) and keep those dreams and goals alive.”Kevin George, the author of Soccology, who works with clubs and coaches on performance, also says that respecting the inidual qualities and personalities of your players (or your employees) is key. “To instil confidence in one player might be to give them freedom, so they know you trust them,” he says. “For somebody else, it might be a lot of praise. For a group of people, you have to tap into who they are inidually, but as a group, give them the belief that you trust them.” Singling people out for praise in a group setting can be tricky, he adds. “People can think: ‘That person’s a favourite, I’m not a favourite.’ It is tough.” Southgate doesn’t play favourites everyone feels as if they have a chance.The era of hard-talking, tyrannical managers is over – both on and off the pitch. “Football, which I love and work in, is really bad at talking,” says Caulfield. “It does instructing and telling off but it doesn’t do talking and listening and empathy that well. It sounds a bit fluffy but that’s the world in which we now live, and the world in which these players have grown up.” Southgate, he says, realised early in his coaching career that instilling fear wasn’t going to work. “We all need a telling-off now and then – and he’s good at that, by the way – but you’ll get far more from putting your faith in people than you will anything else. People had this lazy opinion that he’s too ‘nice’ and they see kindness as weakness, but it’s the most unbelievable strength if you use it in the right way.”As for nerves, it is a mistake to think it is essential or even desirable to eliminate them – from sport or from life. Caulfield says they can be “wonderful. They keep you alive and make you realise something important is about to happen. If you discuss what the nerves mean to you and how you deal with them, then they don’t become a threat to you. They become this wonderful cortisol that runs through your veins and you deal with the problem, and then you rest afterwards.” With or without an inflatable unicorn.• Don’t fear failure. “Part of what it takes to be courageous is overcoming the constant battle between the desire for what we want and the fear of failure. Most of us don’t expose ourselves because we are fearful,” writes Grange.• Reframe emotions: you’re not “nervous”, you’re “excited” a penalty shootoutjob interviewimportant speech is not something to dread, it’s an “opportunity”.• Positive thinking is unhelpful if you’re simply fantasising about achieving an Oscarthe World Cupa fuller social life.

Remove the creases from your St George’s Cross jester’s hat. Prepare to launch a pint of lukewarm lager towards the ceiling. England are ready to go again.On Wednesday night Gareth Southgate’s team will walk out at the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow to play England’s first World Cup semi-final in 28 years. Their opponents Croatia are ranked six places lower by Fifa. For Southgate and his players a moment of rare sporting crisis awaits.If the last few days have been marked by a feeling of gathering English hysteria, not to mention booze-sodden escapism as the rest of the country energetically falls to bits, then it is worth noting these moments don’t come around very often.The last time England got this far was Italia 90, when Margaret Thatcher was still in power, Jeremy Corbyn was in court for not paying the poll tax and England fans in Turin had to phone long distance from a call-box to have any idea what was going on back home.Should they get past Croatia Southgate’s players will return to Moscow on Sunday for what would be England’s first world Cup final since 1966 and all that: an event so jealously seared into popular culture – the Empire Stadium, Nobby dancing, Bobby Moore wiping his hands before shaking the Queen’s white glove – it seems almost an act of heresy to think about matching it.Win or lose the most remarkable part of England’s run in Russia is the sense of shared public affection. Through four weeks in Russia, from Volgograd to Samara, the players have emerged as a hugely likeable crew and a flattering reflection of the country at large – clever, diligent, funny, and agreeably erse in their backgrounds.Plus of course there is Southgate, who in the last few weeks has seemed at times like the only person left in charge of anything who looks like he actually knows what he’s doing.On Tuesday afternoon it was standing room only for the manager’s last public appearance before the final, the air in the Luzhniki press room thick with excitement, event-glamour and the effects of four weeks on the road with minimal laundry opportunities.Cameras whirred, necks craned. Somebody fell over at the back. And finally there he was, the great Gareth. And yes it is just Gareth now: role model, dreamboat and all-round sun king of Russia 2018. Gareth wasn’t wearing his waistcoat here, or his “sleeveless suit staple” as one newswire report put it at the weekend, ever-fearful of using the same word twice.With the sleeveless suit staple rested Gareth was casual in a black and blue sports top, drawing a hush as an urgent first question was posed from the floor about the rubber chicken England’s players had been pictured chucking around in training. “It was jut a bit of fun,” Gareth explained, as three hundred pairs of fingers whirred at his every prompt.Nobody expected any of this. Perhaps that’s why it feels so glorious. England weren’t supposed to win a penalty shootout or get to the last four of a World Cup. We weren’t supposed to adore the players, presented for so long as a coterie of gloweringly entitled star athletes. Southgate wasn’t even supposed to be England manager, stepping up from the youth teams when Sam Allardyce was sacked after a newspaper sting that revealed little of interest beyond the fact the England manager had sat in a restaurant drinking a pint of wine.Southgate was given a humiliating four-match trial period. His first public words in the job were an apology. And in his early days he still resembled a slightly doomed supply teacher who listens and makes the class like him but still gets home to find his pockets have been filled with custard.He has has a different kind of light around him now, all assured alpha energy and quiet charisma. Gareth made a mild joke about not remembering 1966. In the front row people tittered and flushed and held their hand to their throat.Finally Southgate said the stuff he says so well, about how there has been some ision at home but hopefully football can bring people together. And about how energised the players are by the sheer level of enthusiasm, joy – and let’s face it, slight mania – back home.The reaction in England can be a startling spectacle from the other end of the telescope. In Moscow there is little hysteria and few England fans at time of writing. You can walk for an hour now and not see any real sign of a World Cup taking place. This is a city that seethes with life, but which has a reserve about these things.England are probably favourites to make it to the final from here. Croatia have better players in many areas. Luka Modric is the classiest player left in the tournament, but he’s 32 now and has slogged through extra time in the two preceding rounds. England are fresh, energetic and a team in harmony with itself.There is a giddiness to all this, the feeling of uncharted territory in so many ways, not least a fear of when this is all over and it is necessary once again to return to the so-called real world. For now England in Moscow promises more of the same, more shared joy and agony, more beer in the air, the uplifting spectacle of a team and a manager for once punching up, achieving above the sum of its parts, and close now to a moment of genuinely rare sporting history."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a44c24413a3af07f3bc5bfefb6731d82729e88f/0_29_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea9990eca3019e088787387a9538b5a2","title":"why the nation fell for gareth southgate","story":"Pick a moment. There have been so many from which to choose in this unexpectedly joyous World Cup. Harry Kane’s stoppage-time winner against Tunisia. Jordan Pickford’s penalty save against Colombia. Eric Dier’s winning shootout spot kick moments later. Harry Maguire’s towering header in the quarter-final. Kyle Walker and Jesse Lingard dancing like idiots in front of the fans.But there is one that sticks out above all others. One so iconic it could be eclipsed only by Kane lifting the trophy in Moscow on Sunday. It came after England had just won its first ever penalty shootout in a World Cup. Having congratulated his own players, the England manager, Gareth Southgate, took the time to seek out Mateus Uribe, the Colombian player whose miss had set up the victory, and put an arm round him in consolation.This wasn’t just a random act of sensitivity and compassion – though these qualities are sufficiently uncommon, not just in English football but football the world over, to have made them remarkable in themselves. It was one of empathy. It was Southgate’s missed penalty against Germany that had been England’s downfall in the 1996 European Championship. He knew what it felt like to be the man to dash a nation’s dreams. To have been the man who ended up as the fall guy in a Pizza Hut advert. His arm round Uribe’s shoulder wasn’t a casual, passing gesture: it was one that spoke of a deep personal understanding.Even more than that, though, it was a moment of grace. Life is a messy business that offers few obvious chances at redemption. Failures and disappointments are generally rewritten or absorbed into lives that somehow muddle on as best they can. Southgate was granted a Hollywood sense of closure. The opportunity to channel his own experience of despair into one of triumph for his team, in front of a global audience of roughly a billion people. From zero to hero.As Dier’s penalty went in, England went noisily bonkers. What the country had learned from the 22 years of pain since last winning a penalty shootout (against Spain in Euro 96) was that the right reaction was to shout loudly, get pissed or drive around the streets leaning on the horn. What Southgate had learned from the whole experience was a basic sense of decency. That night he showed a nation how to behave. Small wonder that the few remaining people who weren’t already a bit in love with the England manager collapsed happily into his embrace at that moment.It was never intended to be this way, though. After all, it had been Sam Allardyce entrusted with the job of England manager after the country’s disastrous showing in the 2016 Euros. Then he was accused of offering businessmen advice on how to “get around” the rules on players’ transfers and using his role for financial advantage – Allardyce continues to deny the allegations. Given England’s performance in Russia, we should profoundly thank the Daily  for the investigation. Southgate, in charge of the England Under-21 team at the time, was a hastily appointed replacement and dismissively referred to as the “caretaker manager”.No one expected much of Southgate. Not even the Football Association, whose chairman Greg Dyke said in 2016 that English football was in such a desperate state that no one should dream of any real success until the 2022 World Cup, at the earliest. Southgate, notorious for missing a penalty and being sacked as manager of Middlesbrough, was just there as a stopgap. Expendable collateral damage in the seemingly futile search for English football’s lost soul.Even in the runup to this World Cup, the expectations remained at rock bottom. Normally in the buildup to a major tournament, the media quickly reaches fever pitch with unrealistic hype about how the team could finally end X years of hurt, only for the headlines to become increasingly bitter – with the manager and players turned into laughing stocks when the dreams go unrealised.This time, nothing. Nada. It was almost as if everyone was fed up with football. The manner in which Russia had become the host nation still stank, fans were advised to stay away due to threats of violence and Putin’s repressive regime and no one – even in jest – seriously expected England to have a prayer. After decades of lost hope, pragmatic despair had set in. This was a tournament to which we already knew the ending. England would do well to make it out of the group stages. And, if they did, they would lose on penalties in the first round of the knockout matches. It was written in the stars.All of which suited Southgate just fine. He had never been one of the headline-grabbing egomaniacs who have dominated football for much of the past 30 years. He knows there is more to life than the game and has created the space for himself to spend plenty of time with his wife, Alison, and their two children, Mia and Flynn. So, he was more than happy to slip under the radar and set about creating a team in his own image.In the past, England has seemed like a team in name only. A two-tier collection of so-called stars, such as David Beckham and Wayne Rooney, with random iniduals making up the numbers. No wonder they struggled. Southgate has made a virtue of a necessity – England is, thankfully, completely out of big-ego players right now – and picked a squad where Harry Kane is the only player to even be the biggest name at his Premier League club. And even he looks like someone who is simply thrilled to be part of the England setup and not someone who is doing his country a favour.Southgate is blessed with the rare gift – in football, especially – of emotional intelligence. That is what makes him emblematic of a modern, outward-looking man. He trusts his players. He encourages them to take responsibility for their own actions. He helps them to tell their own stories. To be known both to themselves and those around them.All year, left-back Danny Rose has been suffering from a depression which he had kept to himself after picking up an injury: Southgate helped him come to terms with it by going public (“England has been my salvation and I can’t thank the manager and the medical staff enough,” he told the press). It was as close to therapy as football gets. By acknowledging the possibility of failure, he has made success more likely. The ball of fear that had hung heavily over the English game has been lifted.Better still, Southgate leads by example. He doesn’t just talk the talk, he walks the walk. He believes in the importance of family and encouraged Fabian Delph to return home for the birth of his child. The player missed the team’s winning match against Colombia, but was back in time to come on as a subsitute in Saturday’s quarter-final against Sweden. A World Cup may come around again, but to be present at the birth of your child is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Southgate is an open book and takes responsibility for his own actions. Previous managers might have thrown a strop and blamed somebody else when a sheet of paper, which appeared to contain some tactical notes, found its way into the hands of the press before the Panama game. Southgate took the hit, said the media were just doing their job and moved on. What could have slipped into the familiar them-and-us siege mentality between the players and the outside world was instead instantly defused.Everyone in the squad knows their place and understands their role within it. Fielding a near-second-strength team for the group match against Belgium was an act of insight and inspiration. Not because losing guaranteed England a place in what looked to be the easier side of the draw, but because it offered clarity to the rest of the squad. They knew they had been given a chance to make their claim for a place in the regular starting 11, but they hadn’t been good enough to take it. Southgate had demonstrated his even-handedness and that he didn’t have favourites. Too often in tournaments, the reserve players can become disaffected and undermine the unity of the whole squad. Now, there is a genuine sense of togetherness. Success may breed its own success, but it was Southgate who lit the spark.And it’s not just a team that Southgate has inspired. It is England as a whole. At a time when the cabinet is fighting like rats in a sack, and trust in the political class to act in the best interests of the country rather than their own party is at an all-time low, Southgate has shown what it is to have integrity. To stand up and be counted.When a large number of people in the country are obsessed with who is cheating on whom on Love Island, he has demonstrated that you can act with humanity and decency towards others. He has shown us who we could be. A better us. A nation that can look triumph and disaster in the face and treat them both the same. (Though also a nation that is getting decidedly used to dealing with the triumph and would rather not have to think of the disaster for a while yet, thanks.) Football may be coming home, but Gareth and his team get to stay in Russia for another week yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc038325e70b43b83765294a655645fc5a47164c/202_165_2384_1430/master/2384.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d15d4847b1343fc9138246b02ec8ad94","title":"croatia england where world cup semi final won or lost","story":"The big decision Zlatko Dalic has to make lies in midfield. Does he play Luka Modric and Ivan Rakitic deep with Andrej Kramaric in front of them (Fig 1), or does he do what he did against Argentina and Denmark and bring in a more orthodox holding midfielder?The former has the advantage of offering more direct support for Mario Mandzukic so there is somebody to pick up the second ball when he wins knockdowns or to capitalise when he pulls wide and crosses, as Kramaric did against Russia. Modric and Rakitic can then try to control possession and the tempo from deep in midfield. The danger for Croatia is that Modric ends up too deep, unable to exert the sort of influence he did against Argentina, too tied up with trying to stifle Dele\u0026nbspAlli to hurt England.The other option is to bring in Marcelo Brozovic (Fig 2), or perhaps Milan Badelj. That liberates Modric and Rakitic – although Rakitic spent much of that Argentina game tracking Lionel Messi – and poses a problem for England by placing two men in Jordan Henderson’s zone.That would mean Alli having to drop off, assuming England maintain the same triangle in midfield rather than bringing in Eric Dier to play alongside Henderson, or, perhaps, England could rely on one of the back three to step up to offer support at the back of midfield. That would still leave them with two men against a lone Croatia centre-forward, which would have the advantage of Alli and Jesse Lingard overmanning in transition against a single holding midfielder.That said, England do have the advantage of Kyle\u0026nbspWalker, who plays at full-back for his club, playing on the right of the three central defenders, so if Trippier is caught upfield, he should be comfortable pushing across to cover. And there is the possibility of using a Croatian strength against them if Trippier drives past Perisic, the left-back Ivan Strinic can be left isolated. (Fig 3) The situation is reminiscent of what happened when the sides met in Zagreb in September 2008 – there Rakitic was the attacking left-sided Croatian who left his full-back Danijel Pranjic exposed, leading to Theo Walcott’s only international hat-trick and a 4-1 England win.England have scored five of their 11 goals from set plays and two of their penalties have resulted from fouls on Harry Kane conceded in the mêlée England’s corner routine produces. The focus on corners has been Gareth Southgate’s indisputable triumph, a recognition of a way a national manager can make a tangible difference in the relatively short time available to him.The basic set-up is straightforward enough: a line of four players at the edge of the box, one of whom stands still as the ball is delivered while the others scatter, rather like a queue in a Tesco  suddenly realising two additional checkouts are about to be opened. Not only does the static player plus his marker serve as a barrier to help create channels for Kane and Harry Maguire but the flurry of movement seems to provoke opponents into making panicky grabs at English shirts.Queueing while pointing out foreigners committing infractions of etiquette, of course, has been an English strength for years Southgate’s genius has been to weaponise it.Denmark, meanwhile, scored against them from a long throw into the box and Iceland’s Sverrir Ingi Ingason headed against the bar from a corner in the group stage.England’s prowess from set plays can also have knock-on benefits if defenders become so anxious at the prospect of conceding a set play that it makes them, in open play, reluctant to concede corners. A moment’s hesitation, or an over-ambitious attempt to play out from the back could present England with\u0026nbspopportunities.Both England and Croatia needed penalties to progress from their last-16 ties, with Croatia then becoming only the second team in World Cup history to win multiple shootouts in the same tournament (either side in Croatia’s last-16 match would have matched the achievement of Argentina in 1990, as Russia had knocked Spain out via the same method in their previous game). Winning games on penalties, though, tends not to be a sign of long-term health. Excluding finals, there have been 28 penalty shootouts in World Cup history: only eight of the victors have gone on to win their next game within 120 minutes, and one of those was playing a side that had also progressed by means of penalties.Modric has looked in danger of resurrecting a World Cup tradition of the most technically gifted players failing from the spot (Socrates, Michel Platini, Dragan Stojkovic, Diego Maradona, Chris Waddle …). He saw his kick saved in extra time against Denmark and his two penalties in shootouts have both been unconvincing. His effort against Denmark was nervous, straight down the middle and only just avoided the trailing foot of the goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel, while against Russia Igor Akinfeev reached a shot that was nowhere near the corner but was able only to push it on to the post from where it cannoned in. He is not a taker to be relied upon.Amid all the euphoria, it is perhaps worth remembering that the only teams England have actually beaten in this\u0026nbspWorld Cup are Tunisia, Panama and Sweden. Although England’s defence coped well against Radamel\u0026nbspFalcao, they were undone by Yerry Mina from\u0026nbspthat late Colombia corner.It is never wise to read too much into one moment in\u0026nbspone game but, if that hinted at a vulnerability to an\u0026nbspaerial threat at the back, it is one Croatia’s Mario Mandzukic is ideally suited to take advantage of. The 32-year-old Juventus forward has won 17 of\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbsp30 aerial duels he has been involved in at this World Cup. Assuming he is fully fit – he limped through the final\u0026nbspminutes of the quarter-final – he poses an aggressive\u0026nbspand mobile threat."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/18f0b34451486dec71bacee0433c8b14897fd9f4/0_141_3840_2304/master/3840.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7394f67f58b64286e9a6dfcb16cc291","title":"france into the final as destiny calls for england world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/14729d5fb051983bcb2bb65b652c1d213da73609/0_0_3930_2359/master/3930.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=deef767f3e8396887b30d347bb1e3b30","title":"cristiano ronaldo 100m juventus real madrid transfer","story":"To pay such a sum for a player surely past his peak seems a risk but the Italian champions have not made many mistakes latelyCristiano Ronaldo described it in matter-of-fact terms as “the moment to begin a new cycle”. In Italy the headline writers went a little bigger as they hailed Juventus’s capture of the Portugal forward as “the deal of the century”.Even the club’s most optimistic supporters might not have dreamed such a thing possible at the start of this summer. A five-times Ballon d’Or winner coming to Turin? No Serie A player had even finished among the top three vote winners for that award since Kaká won it in 2007.So much has changed in the intervening years. The prestige of Spanish football waxed just as Italian football waned. When the Milan owner, Silvio Berlusconi, shared his “dream” of signing Ronaldo at the start of this decade, the player responded with a politician’s turn of phrase, saying that Serie A was “not the league I like the most”.Juventus were only just returning to the forefront of the domestic game. Dumped into Serie B in 2006 for their part in the Calciopoli scandal, they took six years to become champions of Italy once more. They have not looked back since, claiming seven consecutive league titles and four straight domestic doubles, as well as reaching the final of the Champions League in two of the past four years.Such sustained success is no accident. Juventus developed a business plan and followed through, from the construction of Serie A’s first modern, club-owned stadium in 2010 to their rebranding with a new, social media-friendly logo last year.Above all, though, they have made superlative moves in the transfer market. Year after year Juventus have found value where others missed it. Andrea Pirlo, Sami Khedira and Dani Alves joined on free transfers. Carlos Tevez cost an initial €9m. Paul Pogba was signed and then flipped back to Manchester United four years later for a roughly €70m profit (once Mino Raiola’s agent’s fees had been deducted).On the surface that might seem like an impossible indulgence for a club that is expected to report a small loss on its accounts for the past season. The reality might be the exact opposite.For all their impressive growth in recent years, the concern for Juventus has always been that they would be limited by the simple fact of competing in a league whose international brand continues to lag behind those of La Liga and the Premier League.Despite reaching the Champions League final in 2017 the club are still ranked only 10th in Deloitte’s Money League, with revenues less than two-thirds the size of Manchester United, Real Madrid or Barcelona.The signing of Ronaldo is designed to change that. You might even say that Juventus are taking a page out of Madrid’s own play book. There were plenty who scoffed at the Spanish club’s €37m outlay on David Beckham in the summer of 2003. Florentino Pérez knew he was getting a steal for a player who would bring far more than that into his club’s coffers.Ronaldo had already transformed Juventus’s finances before he even agreed terms. As rumours of his impending arrival increased in recent days, the club’s share price soared. The newspaper Secolo XIX noted on Thursday that the club’s market valuation had risen from €665m to €815m – enough (notionally) to cover the player’s transfer fee. After a dip, those numbers have continued to rise.And while Ronaldo is older now than Beckham was then, he is also a more impactful player. Ronaldo might be slowing down but he still scored 44 goals last season, including two goals and an assist against Juventus in their own stadium in the quarter-finals of the Champions League.Do we even need to ask how he will fit into this Juventus side? Massimiliano Allegri is an arch-pragmatist who has adapted his team countless times already during his four years in charge, maintaining his team’s domestic dominance through the departures of Tevez, Pogba, Leonardo Bonucci and many more besides."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b449efd9206cb6a53f5c924aa7a7be8e1096580/0_118_5000_3001/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f127b487fbc366e96cf5f71ac968fc0","title":"world cup 2018 france into the final plus croatia v england buildup live","story":"A few more headlines as France wakes up to a stonking hangover and the prospect of a World Cup final:This frame, in particular, really got me in David Squires latest cartoon.“They’re redefining the English game and I wanted to be a part of it.” Not Gareth Southgate and his backroom staff, but rather Manchester City under Pep Guardiola. That’s the view of Riyad Mahrez at least, who has put pen to paper on a deal at the Etihad.In other news, you may have heard a certain transfer has gone through. Ronaldo to Juve for silly money. Still, the Old Lady of Turin has not made many mistakes lately, writes Paolo Bandini as he assesses the “deal of the century”.Just going back to the ‘p’ word for a moment – Croatia’s exertions, both mental and physical, in their quarter-final shootout win over Russia could yet come back to bite them. At least that’s what England will be hoping after Zlatko Dalic admitted his team were tired.“We’ve played five difficult games, they’ve taken their toll. We’re tired but there can be no excuses. We’ve come to the semi-final. We’re here to play football, enjoy ourselves and give our all. We do not want to say we are fatigued. We have not been exhausted. There is still opportunity for us to exhaust ourselves.”After a quiet game by his standards against Sweden, what can England expect from their captain Harry Kane against Croatia? It’s not just about goals though – just ask Olivier Giroud, or even better read this from a woman who knows a thing or two about being a world-class striker, Marta.“People often ask me what the secret to being a good goalscorer is but there is not just one thing that makes someone a brilliant and consistent striker. You need a bit of everything. You need technique and positional awareness you need to be able to read the game and be quick. To be great, you need all of these things.”The Croatia manager, Zlatko Dalicwe, reckons his side “always expect to solve everything within 90 minutes”, which is great news for anyone of a nervous disposition, yet the prospect of another penalty shootout looms large over the game in Moscow, as it does in any game in the knockout phase between two evenly matched sides. Thankfully, England have Sir Jordan Pickford in their ranks, but Croatians will be equally comforted by Danijel Subasic. Here’s Aleksandar Holiga on the Croatia keeper:Football is just a game, 22 people kicking an inflated bag around, hopefully having a bit of fun along the way. Winning, losing, who cares? It’s about taking part, taking enjoyment out of the game. But then again, it can be so much more than that. And the World Cup tends to remind us of this on a quadrennial basis. For England, certainly, this tournament has become something more than a game. Here’s Hugh Muir on that:“Oh, to be in England  Now that April’s there,” wrote Browning, but he might have looked at that again after last weekend and decided it could bear revision. “Oh, to be in England’s capital as Gareth Southgate’s team march nonchalantly into the World Cup semi-finals,” perhaps. When people meet the glances of others, smile and know exactly what they are thinking. When strangers, merry and giddy, connect on the trains that usually symbolise an urban dystopia. When young Britons of many complexions sport England shirts and look as though they had won a modest bet.This is so hot off the virtual press, I haven’t had time to read it yet, but since it’s from Jonathan Wilson, one can assume it’s essential reading ahead of The Big Match:If the England players aren’t nervous, the same cannot be said for the majority of those who will watch on through inevitably laced fingers in Russia and back home. That people appear to be allowing themselves to dream only heightens those nerves. Here’s Barney Ronay on a a moment that nobody really expected.If the last few days have been marked by a feeling of gathering English hysteria, not to mention booze-sodden escapism as the rest of the country energetically falls to bits, then it is worth noting these moments don’t come around very often.Time to cast forward now, to today’s second semi-final. A lovely scene-setter from Daniel Taylor in Moscow:The focus of Courtois’ ire – rather amusingly his Chelsea teammate Giroud – is coming in for a bit of stick after a fairly anodyne performance – and another game without a goal. That’s over seven hours of play without scoring or, indeed, even a shot on target. The Stéphane Guivarc’h of a new generation.And another! “I prefer to lose with this Belgium than win with this France.”Eden Hazard has been at it too, telling Belgian newspaper Het Nieuwsblad: “But they do defend strongly and are very efficient. We have not found their weak point. That little moment of magic needed to score was not there. We have seen a fantastic Belgian team and have been eliminated by a team that was more solid than us.”A case of sour grapes in the Belgium camp? Speaking of their French conquerors, Thibaut Courtois told the Belgian website Sporza: “Their striker plays 30 metres from his own goal.” Oof. And there’s more: “It’s a pity and frustrating, I prefer to lose to a team like Brazil, who want to play football at least. France are no better than us, they do not play football, but they do have a lot of strength.”Some of those French celebrations turned a bit ugly earlier. This from Reuters:The partying was marred by clashes between riot police and mobs on the iconic Champs Elysees avenue. Live TV images showed bare-chested men hurling plastic crowd-control barriers and other missiles at the armed officers, who charged back. In the southern city of Nice, more than two dozen fans were hurt when the detonation of firecrackers triggered a brief stampede near the seafront. After a France game, it’s always good to have a look at how L’Équipe sees things. “Head in the stars” blazes its front page today. “Thanks to a headed goal from Samuel Umtiti, France can dream of a second World Cup title, 20 years after their first star in 1998.”The paper, which is notoriously sensible with its player ratings, awarded France an average of 7, to Belgium’s 5.1. Umtiti, Raphael Varane and Hugo Lloris got 8s, while Belgium goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois stood out with an 8 too. Eden Hazard (6), Romelu Lukaku (4) and Mousa Dembélé (3) didn’t fare as well.And just to rehash the Tintin theme – France “walked on De Bruyne”:One can only imagine how Belgium’s players are feeling at the moment (and how theirTrevor Steven knows all about playing a World Cup semi-final though. He was there in Turin in 1990, and reckons it was “like an out-of-body experience”. The former gives Jamie Jackson some further interesting insight into the agony being so close, yet so far.Snozmusket writes below the line: “Asterix, not Asterisk?” Good point. (*)* this is an asterisk. This is Asterix.Meanwhile, this is a great thread of France’s World Cup finalists as kids. Special shout out to Giroud’s hair, which is beautifully lustrous.What of Belgium? Their so-called golden generation has failed to deliver the goods once again. When can the promise of becoming world beaters be dismissed? You could make a pretty strong argument for, in Belgium’s case, that moment to be now after they came up blank against France and lost a match for the first time in 25 outings. As David Hytner at the St Petersburg Stadium writes:“This was Belgium’s big opportunity the moment to make history by reaching a first World Cup final. For many years the squad have been tracked by talk of a golden generation and several members of Martínez’s squad had made it plain that they were here to lift the trophy. Nothing else. But in the end, they were stifled and the manager did not have the answers.”Redemption is a word on the minds of Deschamps et al. Or rather la rédemption. The pain of Euro 2016, when they lost to Cristiano Ronaldo’s Portugal in the final, still lingers around the camp like the smell of a particularly fruity Brie de Meaux. Deschamps says he is keen to devour it, and never see it regurgitated again (or words to that effect). “I was there two years ago with my staff,” Deschamps said. “It was so painful we really want to taste the victory tonight. It’s not nothing to win the semi-final of the World Cup after losing the final of the Euro. It’s sport, we have this privilege to give happiness to the French people and the public.”Here’s some blurb from the pod crew: “Max and co discuss France becoming the first finalist of the 2018 World Cup, a Thibaut Courtois post-match meltdown, England’s hopes, dreams and fears, Cristiano Ronaldo’s move and Welsh nightmares.” Do yourselves a favour and have a listen.Allez les Blues! A decades-old debate has finally been settled by way of a fairly important football match in Saint Petersburg: Asterix is officially better than Tintin. And the upshot of that particular little revelation is that France are in the World Cup final, at the expense of their cousins to the north-east, Belgium.A tricolour-hued crowd collectively lost their merde on the Champs-Elysee after the 1-0 win in predictable shades of ‘98. Perhaps it was fitting then, that the match-winner was the Cameroon-born defender Samuel Umtiti. Didier Deschamps, who as a player was part of that Black-Blanc-Beur side, will now seek to emulate one of his predecessors, Aimé Jacquet, and complete his mission against the winner of another fairly important football match later today – that between Croatia and England.Ah, yes, that small matter. Bus shelters across England are bracing themselves with a nation set to spontaneously combust should Gareth Southgate’s side manage to reach a first World Cup final since 1966. The tension is mounting, the pressure building. What could go wrong?Anyway, stick with us as the buildup properly commences (aware we’ve been building up to this ever since the final whistle tooted in Samara, but this time we really mean it).

Spoon the dressing over the fish, letting it trickle down into the flesh through the score lines.Place the fish under the grill, about 20cm from the heat, and leave to cook for about 8 minutes, watching carefully.Remove the peel and white pith from 2 oranges with a very sharp knife and slice the fruit thinly. Slice open a pomegranate and pull out the seeds, then toss them with the slices of orange and their juice. Tear 20 small mint leaves to pieces – or chop them roughly – then fold them through the fruit.When the mackerel is cooked, its skin a mixture of shining silver, burnished gold and black bits caught in the heat, remove it and serve with the orange and pomegranate salad. Serves 2.If you have time, let the mackerel sit for a while in the sumac dressing before you grill it. Keep an eye on the fish’s progress, basting it from time to time with any dressing that may trickle off the fish as it cooks. Be brave, let the skin blacken in places. The reward is deliciously smoky flesh.You could cook the fish in fillets rather than whole. Cook them skin side up and brush regularly with the dressing as they cook. If the piquant flavour of ground sumac isn’t your thing, then it’s worth trying za’atar instead."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d6bbe487110072ce5960de29bd2551d5ae7d5f8e/0_50_800_480/master/800.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0e3c9a479fd9b3dfbab836294d5cdbdf","title":"as big as your head giant avocado arrives in australia","story":"The ‘Avozilla’, which is being farmed in Queensland, weighs more than a kilo and is expected to sell for $12 eachThey look like an avocado and taste like an avocado. The only difference from the avocados you know? These ones are about the size of your head.The Avozilla, as it has been dubbed, has arrived in Australia. Weighing an average of 1.2kg, the fruits are about four times the size of regular avocados and are expected to sell for $12 each. “There’s certainly a shock factor when you pick one up and they’re as big as your head,” farmer Ian Groves told  Australia. Originating from South Africa, the Avozilla reached Britain in 2013. But the Groves family, which has grown tropical and exotic fruits in central Queensland since 1957, are the first to bring the variety to Australia. Groves said the fruit tasted similar to their regular-sized equivalent but were slightly softer to spread. “I love them. We eat them at home all the time,” he said. Groves said the first harvest was being sent to grocers in Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Perth. “There is a nursery we buy different trees off and when we were planting a bunch of avocados 10 years ago they gave us one as a trial,” he said. “And after about four or five years, we tried a few of the fruit and thought we’d give them a go. So we planted a small block of about just under 400 trees. They’re coming up to about four years and this is their first production.”Though they would be perfect for the increasing number of cafes and restaurants serving up hundreds of plates of smashed avo on toast each day, Groves predicted the variety was likely to remain a novelty because the trees were “light producers”. The family are likely to be the only growers of the novelty fruit for some time, having got in years before their competition. Farms cannot plant the variety without gaining permission and paying royalties to the South African company that owns the rights. “A friend of ours is planting 2000 trees in Bundaberg probably this year,” Groves said. “So we’re four years ahead of him. But I don’t know if growers will jump on board, they are such niche market.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5314d474312373eaa74c445bf2833410c67b85f5/0_293_4900_2941/master/4900.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23d22bfbc3cce3375403f4845eb6d0c3","title":"bbc to reveal list showing increase in high paid women","story":"Corporation claims significant step in addressing gender imbalance but critics are wary The BBC is set to claim a significant boost in the number of women making its list of top-earning on-air stars – and will reveal star salaries to within a few thousand pounds of their actual pay.The gender disparity in pay at the corporation sparked widespread criticism not least from more than 40 of its own high-profile female presenters, including Clare Balding, Fiona Bruce and Emily Maitlis.Last year, it faced a major backlash after revealing that only a third of its 96 top earners were women and that the top seven are all men, with Chris Evans the best-paid of the corporation’s big names on at least £2.2m.All companies and some public sector bodies in Great Britain, except Northern Ireland, with more than 250 employees had to\u0026nbspreport their gender pay gap to the Government Equalities Office. All companies were due to report by 4 April 2018.Commonly known as the average, the mean is calculated by adding up the wages of all employees and iding that figure by the number of employees. The mean gender pay gap is the difference between mean male pay and mean female pay.The median gap is the difference between the employee in the middle of the range of male wages and the employee in the middle of the range of female wages. Typically the median is the more representative figure, because the mean can be skewed by a handful of highly paid employees.On Wednesday, the BBC will reveal that the pay of its top stars will include more women and fewer men. In addition, it will publish an unprecedented level of detail about star salaries, increasing transparency by reporting pay in £10,000 bands. The corporation currently reports star pay in £50,000 pay bands.“The BBC already publishes more information than any other media organisation, but this year we will be going even further,” said a BBC source, before the publication of the corporation’s annual report for the year to March on Wednesday. “There will be more women in the list, and fewer men than the previous year.”The BBC will also publish details of which programmes’ stars work on to justify their salaries to “ensure that more informed comparisons can be made”.The corporation also intends to publish a table setting out levels of pay to its top male and female stars as a group – not iniduals – in its current financial year to show the “real progress” it has made in boosting underpaid female stars and big name male presenters and talent taking pay cuts.After the resignation of former China editor Carrie Gracie over unfair pay, some of the corporation’s best-paid male presenters – including John Humphrys, Jeremy Vine, Huw Edwards, Nick Robinson and Jon Sopel – agreed to salary cuts. Gracie settled her dispute with the corporation last month.“The job is not done, but we are making good progress,” said a BBC source.However, critics will argue that the BBC has, if anything, become less transparent since spinning off its TV production arm, which makes shows including EastEnders and Strictly Come Dancing and merging it with BBC Worldwide. Top earners including Claudia Winkleman, the corporation’s best paid female star, DIY SOS presenter Nick Knowles and actors from EastEnders, Casualty and Holby City will disappear from this year’s list.At least 35 of the 96 stars on last year’s list could fail to appear because programmes they were paid for in the past year are now produced by the new merged entity, BBC Studios, which is now classed as a commercial entity and will not have to publish how much it pays people.Last year’s list also caused criticism due to some of the high-profile names that were not included. The list only counted remuneration that the BBC determined had been paid directly from the BBC licence fee. This meant it does not include payments to staff through independent production companies that make programmes for the BBC, or payments from BBC Worldwide.As a result, the list still does not include stars such as Sherlock’s Benedict Cumberbatch, Question Time’s David Dimbleby, Have I Got News For You’s Ian Hislop, Sir David Attenborough or Alan Sugar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d87a449d4b2537bcc243dd917f8606bbf0f3d4fc/42_16_3145_1888/master/3145.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=721c27be1c1a566d27b5bf89ceef1d31","title":"russia 2018 world cup england guardian support","story":"Our senior sports writer Barney Ronay explains how you can help keep the ’s football coverage in playHere we are then.

From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted.

But he warned: “We need clarity for these negotiations to move forward for the time is very short.”Barnier said he had never been shown how Brexit provided added value when the world faced challenges from terrorism and climate change to migration, poverty and financial instability.“It will be clear, crystal clear at the end of this negotiation that the best situation, the best relationship with the EU, will be to remain a member,” he said.Barnier added: “No deal is the worst solution for everybody. It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU. I’m not working for that deal, I’m working for a deal.”Barnier’s comments come after days of upheaval in the UK, since Theresa May’s attempt to bind her cabinet to an agreed approach to the Brexit negotiations triggered the resignations of the Brexit secretary, David Davis, and foreign secretary, Boris Johnson.Johnson used his resignation letter on Monday to claim that the UK was “headed for the status of a colony” under May’s soft Brexit plans, which would keep closer ties to the European Union than hardline Conservatives want.Asked if May’s weakened position put negotiations at risk, Barnier said: “To be sincere, I don’t want to make any comment on domestic and national policy in the UK. I have met many people with different views. I have listened to everyone and will continue to do so. But as EU negotiator I will negotiate only with the British government … so our next negotiations will be next Monday with the British delegation appointed by Mrs May.”He said the detailed UK proposals would be assessed in the light of the EU’s clear position on the inisible four freedoms of movement of people, goods, services and capital. The EU is ready to start negotiating on free trade and customs agreements with the UK, he said.“If it is well understood, these principles, which are the foundation of our union, we would start a constructive discussion, with the UK on two aspects of the negotiation, a free trade agreement and a customs arrangement. The solution will, however, have to be workable and realistic, it should not lead to red tape and cost for citizens and businesses.”A draft withdrawal agreement was signed in March, with several areas signed off including the Brexit bill most but not all issues relating to EU citizens and some issues relating to Ireland, including the common travel area. The UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019. There is an October deadline to reach a withdrawal agreement and the latest round of negotiations is due to take place next week – with the new Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, replacing Davis at the table.May is facing the risk of a confidence vote from rebellious Conservative MPs and the mood of political chaos will be further complicated by the arrival of Donald Trump in the UK on Thursday for a visit which will be punctuated by protests.Leaving the White House on Tuesday for his flight to Europe, Trump described Johnson as “a good friend” and said the UK was “in somewhat turmoil”.Trump is almost entirely avoiding London during his trip, which will include a Windsor Castle meeting with the Queen and talks with May at the Chequers retreat where, last week, she failed to unite her cabinet around her Brexit plan.During a trip to Scotland in 2016, Trump hailed the Brexit vote as a “great thing” and said the people of the UK had “taken back their country”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/30b2d1a5487d862c48923cb58faf2ca964903446/0_78_2047_1228/master/2047.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=801eb66fec60538a2bd80a8a9c9e8fd1","title":"theresa may cabinet new brexit power bases must unite","story":"Prime minister’s Chequers plan depends on keeping the competing factions happyTheresa May has reshuffled her cabinet after a series of high-profile resignations over her Brexit plans, but faces a tough task trying to unite the competing power bases. When Theresa May brought her full cabinet to the Chequers summit last Friday, it was a statement of intent that a hard Brexit, which jeopardised UK businesses’ supply chains and the unity of the UK over the border in Northern Ireland, had no majority among her ministers. One of the most urgent voices in recent weeks has been Greg Clark, the business secretary, who made the case not only for frictionless movement of goods but on the need for a mobility framework for UK workers to be able to fulfil overseas service contracts. Others who have urged such an approach include the chancellor, Philip Hammond, Karen Bradley, the Northern Ireland secretary, and David Gauke, the justice secretary.This powerful new group is comprised of remainers and leavers, but ones who have decided their best trajectory is staunch loyalty to the prime minister. What links many of them is their ambition. Most powerful among them is the environment secretary, Michael Gove, a leading light of the leave campaign who is one of the cabinet’s leading Eurosceptics. But he has publicly backed the Chequers’ deal and urged colleagues to accept it, coming out to bat for May on the airwaves on Sunday. Jeremy Hunt, the new foreign secretary, is a former remainer but now born-again Brexiter who was also dispatched by No 10 to give the media response to David Davis’s resignation. Two new members of the cabinet fall into this category. Dominic Raab, Davis’s replacement, a cerebral Brexiter given a big promotion by May, said he was looking forward to “unflinchingly” implementing the Chequers plan as Brexit secretary. Geoffrey Cox, the new attorney general, spoke forcefully as a converted leaver in favour of the plan at the 1922 committee of backbench MPs – and got his promotion just hours later.Chris Grayling, the transport secretary, and Sajid Javid, the home secretary, are also in this mix – both made it clear to Boris Johnson ahead of the Chequers’ summit that they did not want to seen as part of his faction. This group is prepared to back May for now, but probably only as long as she does not come under serious threat.There remain inside the cabinet some Brexiter members with serious reservations about the Chequers deal, but who have decided to back the agreed plan. Among them are the leader of the House of Commons, Andrea Leadsom, and the work and pensions secretary, Esther McVey, who both spoke privately about their dissatisfaction with the deal at Chequers, as well as the international development secretary, Penny Mordaunt, and Liam Fox, the international trade secretary. Fox was given personal assurances by No 10 ahead of the summit, which seemed to at least temporarily assuage his fears about the impact of the plan on striking trade deals.Publicly, the group has been supportive even through the resignations, while also underlining areas where they say they cannot accept any further concessions during negotiations with the EU.“I judge this by our red lines as Brexiteers,” Leadsom said. “Are we leaving the EU? Are we taking back control? Are we leaving the customs union and the single market? Will we get rid of free movement? And we will do all of those things.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fe73444d5fb214c7d4c5c83984dc432ee6743cd6/0_120_2980_1788/master/2980.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10d20e607833adf24478746a69b21399","title":"england women cricket odi series win new zealand derby","story":"England Women easily sealed their series win against New Zealand, winning the second one-day international by 123 runs to take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series.The player of the match Tammy Beaumont continued her incredible run of form, top-scoring with 67, while another clinical all-round performance from England’s bowlers ensured their opponents fell embarrassingly short of the target, bowled out for 118 in 38\u0026nbspovers as Sophie Ecclestone and Katie George finished with three wickets apiece.“It is really great to get the series win,” Beaumont said. “I’m having a lot\u0026nbspof fun – I think that’s why I’m batting well at the minute. Our bowling\u0026nbspunit\u0026nbsphas been exceptional the entire summer – we’ve played on some belting wickets for batting and\u0026nbspour bowlers have stepped up every\u0026nbspsingle time.”It was the 19-year-old left-armer George who set up the New Zealand collapse, removing Sophie Devine and Amy Satterthwaite in successive overs to leave New Zealand 26 for two in the fifth. While the full toss that Devine sent into the hands of Amy Jones at cover was not one for the highlights’ reel, the ball that got Satterthwaite certainly was, seaming into the left-hander to hit the top of her off stump.By the time George struck again in the 30th over, her off-cutter breaking through the defences of Lea Tahuhu, the game was all over bar the shouting. In between times the New Zealand batting line-up had looked frankly bewildered against the spinners, Ecclestone’s first six-over spell yielding two wickets for seven runs. Of all New Zealand’s batting collapses on what is turning into proving a miserable tour of England, this was probably the worst.The captain, Suzie Bates, said her side had “let themselves down”. She added: “We couldn’t get any partnerships together. We prepared well but there are no excuses for the way we have performed so far. We have to look at what we are doing and find a way to get better.”Earlier, England had themselves been wobbling at 57 for two before Beaumont took control of the innings, demonstrating impeccable footwork as she took on the spinners, sending Leigh Kasperek’s third delivery of the day over the top of the umpire’s head on her way to a 76-ball 67.Nat Sciver, with whom Beaumont shared a 57-run partnership, also continued her return to form with a half-century of her own, her first in ODIs since the World Cup final last July. “Nat and I put on a brilliant performance,” Beaumont said. “It is all about having a bit of a vibe with your partner.”Beaumont was eventually dismissed leg-before by Jess Watkin – a third umpire review to ascertain whether the off-spinner had overstepped failing to save the England batsman – while Sciver fell to a breathtaking one-handed catch from Bates, snatched out of mid-air at mid-off. But, while neither could push on to a big score, on a slow pitch their runs ultimately proved plenty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c79aca8f085eb341ef409641d31854fc134ef465/0_360_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d62b16e9f7c99f8254642060b04a424","title":"fernando gaviria wins tour de france stage four cycling","story":"Fernando Gaviria took his second win in the 2018 Tour de France, winning stage four from La Baule to Sarzeau in Brittany by outsprinting Peter Sagan at the climax of a four-kilometre straight leading to the line. The Colombian’s victory came in the home town of the local mayor and UCI president, David Lappartient, whose war of words with Team Sky’s principal, David Brailsford, escalated on Tuesday as Brailsford was accused of insulting France.On Sunday Brailsford told the  that Lappartient had the mentality of a “local French mayor” and to become more presidential the Frenchman had “got some work to do”.On Tuesday, asked to respond to Brailsford’s comments in the aftermath of the Chris Froome salbutamol case, the Frenchman initially said he “didn’t really want to reply” but quickly warmed to the task. “The last person who called me a ‘Breton mayor’ didn’t have much luck. It was Brian Cookson,” he said referring to the former UCI president he ousted in an election last autumn.On the road the atmosphere seemed less volatile, with Team Sky’s Geraint Thomas suggesting the fans were less hostile, before admitting that it was “hard to tell a ‘boo’ from a ‘Froome’.”If the booing has subsided, the crashes continue. A pile-up five kilometres from the finish split the bunch and left Rigoberto Urán, second in last year’s Tour, frantically chasing with his teammates, although Gaviria’s compatriot did eventually rejoin the main field.The day’s breakaway of four riders, two Frenchmen, Jérôme Cousin and Anthony Perez, and the Belgians Dimitri Claeys and Guillaume Van Keirsbulck mirrored the nationalities in the first World Cup semi-final. But as the foursome closed on the finish line in Sarzeau their chances of bringing a stage win home looked doomed.Fifty kilometres from the finish a crash among the pursuers stalled the peloton’s effort and allowed the quartet to move further ahead. However, once the Quickstep team of the sprinter Gaviria, who claimed the first yellow jersey of the 2018 Tour, moved to the front of the field their chances of staying away were over.For the first time Mark Cavendish was present at the stage finale but his hunt for stage wins goes on. In past years the straight, slightly uphill run to the line would have been ideally suited to the Manx rider but he failed to add to his stage victories.“So are we really surprised that we’re not lining up like the Quickstep team? Well, right now we can’t,” he added. “Then you hope for luck, but luck in the Tour comes and goes. But it’s wrong to say that Mark doesn’t have the form. Once we see him sprinting, then we can judge his form. We can’t judge it yet.”At the back of the peloton the American rider Lawson Craddock maintained his lonely progress, racing most of the stage 100 metres behind the main field, to guard against another fall on the broken scapula that is hampering his progress.Although the Texan has a black eye and intense pain in a shoulder he is continuing. “Two opinions matter,” his team manager, Jonathan Vaughters, said. “The doctor’s and the rider’s. If he’s safe to race, and the doctor says it’s OK, we leave it up to the rider.”Education First say Craddock is managing his pain with a combination or paracetamol and Ibuprofen. Asssuming their rider survives until Sunday, Craddock will then have to race over 21.7km of cracked and ruptured cobbled roads, known as the ‘Hell of the North’, in the stage to Roubaix. “That will be the hard one,” Vaughters added. “The pain will have had to subside a lot for him to be able to survive that day.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b794827b3187e079b25bfda8598444b34d76858/187_0_5625_3375/master/5625.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b54ac34cab3a15fbac75d59a61cd46b","title":"microsoft launches smaller cheaper surface go to rival the ipad","story":"New 10in Windows 10 tablet is half the cost of Surface Pro, aimed at Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks but running OfficeMicrosoft has unveiled its direct challenge to Apple’s iPad, the cheaper, smaller and lighter Surface Go 2-in-1 Windows 10 tablet.The Surface Go resembles other models of Microsoft’s successful Surface tablet range, but has a smaller 10in screen, is 8.3mm thick and only weighs 522g. But the biggest difference is the price: the Surface Go starts at £380 in the UK and $399 in the US, which is half the price of the cheapest Surface Pro tablet.Panos Panay, chief product officer for Microsoft, said: “Surface Go is small and mighty, giving you the performance you need to be productive.“When we designed this device, we had to ask ourselves what people want and need from a 10” Surface. The answers seem obvious – lightweight, productive, and accessible to more people.”Unlike the more powerful Surface Pro tablet, the Surface Go has Intel’s seventh-generation Intel Pentium Gold, which Microsoft says balances power consumption with performance, for a battery life of nine hours.The Surface Go has Microsoft’s high-resolution PixelSense screen technology, including support for the Surface Pen stylus, with its full 4,096 levels of pressure sensitivity and very low latency. The tablet also has its own version of the detachable keyboard from the Surface Pro, and the built-in kickstand that supports up to 165-degrees of angle.The new tablet is also the first to have both USB-C and Microsoft’s Surface Connector, following the introduction of USB-C to the Surface Book 2 in December. The Surface Go also has a microSD card slot, a headphone socket and Microsoft’s Windows Hello facial recognition camera for unlocking the device. It runs in Windows 10 S mode out of the box but can be switched to regular Windows 10 at any time.While questions remain around customer demand for a lower-power Windows machine from Microsoft, experts were broadly positive about the introduction of a cheaper Surface device, saying that it made Microsoft’s offerings more competitive with Apple’s iPad and Google’s Chromebooks, which have found success in the education market.“Microsoft is getting more aggressive with the Surface portfolio. It’s a logical move to make the Surface concept more accessible,” said Geoff Blaber, from CCS Insight. “There is a question mark on power and performance relative to the iPad. The Surface Go is a prime candidate for Arm-based chips from Qualcomm to provide an experience much closer to iPad in terms of battery life. While this design cycle missed that opportunity I’d fully expect future products to go down that road.” “The Surface Go is an excellent proposition. ‘Built for Office 365’ is a nice way of saying - it is not your mainstream laptop (and it shouldn’t be),” said Rushabh Doshi, mobility analyst at Canalys. “Definitely gunning for the value-conscious iPad Pro aspirers. And will be interesting to see if it can make a dent in education.”The Surface Go will be able to pre-order with either 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage or 8GB and 128GB from today in the UK, US and several other countries shipping on 6 August. A version with 4G LTE broadband will be available later in the year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/856284cf29c77f652dfc7554a03585851b9c8c79/0_52_2040_1224/master/2040.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5d316911a0b6ea34f18768cfcb79d7dd","title":"bold as bauhaus how the legendary schools lost typefaces were recreated in pictures","story":"Experts have trawled the archives at the renowned German school of design, to create a series of fonts from fragments of typeface treasures by original Bauhaus students.

Swimming is a different way to appreciate the beauty of the area it’s a view that you’re not sharing with anyone else because you’re on your own out there.My perfect spot is Crummock Water, in the north-west lakes. It takes a bit of effort to get to but is surrounded by mountains. The water is very accessible, so it’s suitable for beginners, but it’s also very quiet. You do get busy spots, normally around car parks, but within five or 10 minutes’ walk you can find your own little secluded bay. I was there at 6.45 this morning and it was mirror flat with the sun coming up over the hills. It was fantastic. The Barn Tea Rooms at New House Farm, near Crummock, is a quaint place to go for a coffee or hot chocolate afterwards.I set up my swim-guiding business in December 2016 and demand is growing. When you swim in a lake or river you can’t take anything into the water with you. There are very few experiences like that where you can have such detachment from your everyday life.• Suzanna leads wild swims across the Lakes for all abilities, suzannaswims Daniel StartThe Brecon Beacons provide a Narnia of pools, lakes and rivers an enchanted land I have paddled, swum and explored since I was a child. Coed-y-Rhaiadr, the “waterfall woods”, are carved out by the Mellte and Nedd rivers where they meet a band of soft limestone coral. There are canyons to snorkel through, waterfalls to climb behind and emerald pools, such as Lady Falls, hidden in a great moss-and-fern amphitheatre. Bushwhack up to Einion Gam, a narrow, roaring cascade – it’s one of the tallest falls in Wales but is rarely visited. The New Inn in Ystradfellte is a cosy place to warm up afterwards, with roasts and a bunkhouse.To the east, around Blaenavon, Keeper’s Pond (Pen-ffordd-goch) is a natural infinity pool with mountain views. From here follow Hill’s Tramroad to the Blorenge Punchbowl, a forested cwm with a secret lake and an island to swim to. They’re both close to the highest inn in Wales, the Lamb \u0026amp Fox at Pwll Du, with roaring fires, live music and a wild-west feel. For something gentler, the River Usk cuts a meandering course past charming villages and twisted yews with idyllic beaches all the way. My favourite is at Llangynidr, where the river runs rocky with rapids. Explore downstream to find beautiful swimming at Crickhowell.• Daniel Start is the author of Wild Guide: Wales (Wild Things Publishing, £16.99)Alexandra HeminsleyI came to river swimming as someone who had learned my stroke in the sea. The first river I swam was not far from my home town of Brighton – the Arun, from Ford down to Littlehampton. I spent the first few minutes lost in a sensory wonderland. There was none of the noise of crashing waves that I had become accustomed to in the sea, nor was I rocked from side to side by tidal swells. Instead, I felt the river’s gentle motion take me through the countryside and with it down to the beach.The water is greener than I have ever seen in the sea, the colour and opacity of a piece of glass. Nor does it taste of briny tang – only the hint of “mint and mud”, as Virginia Woolf called it. It is silty, but fresh, like spirulina.As the river approaches the sea, its banks are high, its curves wide and slow. The swimmer, often surrounded by swans at this point, sees the world as a cygnet might: drifting softly by, protected but enjoying the view. The Arun is the second fastest tidal river in the UK, unmistakably so once you near Littlehampton beach. It felt like the very best of flying dreams, when you need only put your arms out and feel yourself carried aloft by the elements. When I can’t sleep, I relive that swim.• Alexandra Heminsley is author of Leap In: A Woman, Some Waves and the Will to Swim (Hutchinson, £12.99)I’m based in Glenmore in the Cairngorms national park and I try to swim every day of the year, even if it means breaking the ice. There are two lochs within a mile of where I live, so I’ll usually go for a swim in one of those.Loch Morlich is the bigger of the two and it’s accessible by road. It’s quite big and they do loads of water sports there. It has a really nice long beach and the water takes a long time to become deep, so you can wade in easily and get acclimatised. There’s also the Red Squirrel café where you can get your hot chocolate and bacon roll after your swim. The other one is Lochan Uaine. It means “Green Lake” in Gaelic and it’s this amazing jade colour. The folklore is that it’s because the fairies wash their clothes in it, but I think it’s something to do with the minerals in the water.Lochan Uaine is a mile’s walk on a good track from Glenmore. It’s a popular place for walkers, but not everyone goes for a swim. I don’t know why… They’re missing out. The lake is surrounded by a proper Caledonian pine forest, so you might see squirrels – and on one side there’s a huge scree slope.• Calum MacLean is an outdoor instructor and broadcaster who makes vlogs and videos on swimming for the Scottish Gaelic channel BBC AlbaThere’s something really grounding, but also a bit OTT, about wild swimming. It resets you. I travel a lot for work so now I just look up the nearest lake, river, puddle, where I can go wild swimming whenever I’m away.For the last couple of years I’ve done the Hay Festival. In my work I’m often communicating, public facing, trying to make people feel comfortable, so going off on my own and keeping my mouth shut for a bit is a real pleasure. I’d heard about the River Wye so I got up early and walked through the woods to this place called the Warren. It was beautiful, really serene, and the water was green and still. These are the things you start to notice with cold-water swimming: it’s quite animalistic, you notice nature’s colours. I really enjoyed it, but then I had a bit of fear wash over me because I was on my own and I was like: I don’t really know if there are electric eels in here! I did it again this year, but this time I took my colleagues with me. Wild swimming has changed my life. When you’re just this tiny little thing flitting around in a big lake, it gives you a real sense of perspective.• Gemma Cairney is a TV and radio presenter and the author of Hometown Tales: South Coast (Weidenfeld \u0026amp Nicolson, £9.99) and Open: a Toolkit For How Magic \u0026amp Messed Up Life Can Be (Macmillan, £12.99)Kate RewA Devon girl born and bred, I have enjoyed the swimming holes of the West Country since I was a child. My favourite places at the moment are family-orientated: my two boys (five and six) love Farleigh and District Swimming Club, one of the country’s last river swimming clubs, on the River Frome near Trowbridge, where they can jump in, wade with small fish in the shallows around the weir and attempt to get their open-water long-distance badge. It’s a very English kind of river: mellow green water, kingfishers, mayflies, mating damselflies, giant shags on floating branches… and cream teas at the farm next door. With a sunbathing field to spread out picnics and BBQs, it’s a delight.Also near my current home in Somerset is Warleigh Weir in the River Avon. It is massively popular, to the extent the Canal and River Trust has put up signs giving swimmers risk information, rather than trying to scare them off. The River Dart in Devon has myriad dipping and swimming spots. Spitchwick Common on Dartmoor suits children well with space for a picnic and ball games. There are river pools and natural water slides nearby, and deeper water on the far side.• Kate Rew is founder of the Outdoor Swimming Society.

There is no justification for such action,” he said in a statement.On Wednesday, China responded to the proposed tariffs, which would be on top of two other rounds by saying “irrational US actions” were hurting the world as well as the US. Officials said China would seek support from the international community to resist “trade hegemony.” “China is shocked by US’ behaviour. In order to safeguard the core interests of the country and the people, China will have to fight back as usual,” China’s ministry of commerce said in a statement. In Beijing, Li Chenggang, assistant minister at the ministry, said at a forum in Beijing that the latest US proposals interfered with the globalisation of the world economy and that China’s support for a multilateral trade system would not change.China has repeatedly said it is more prepared for a trade war than the US. An English-language editorial in the state-run China Daily said, “If Trump launches an all-out trade war, the US economy and society may not be able to withstand the impact of countermeasures from China and other economies.”Yet Chinese investors and companies have been worried about a trade war between the world’s two largest economies. Ahead of the tariffs implemented last week, the Shanghai Composite had fallen to a two-year low.The new round of tariffs would not go into effect for another two months, leaving time for public comments. Ma Jun, a former economist at China’s central bank, told Xinhua, “There are still all kinds of uncertainty over whether the tariffs will be imposed and on what products.”Donald Trump has said he might ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods – roughly the total amount of US imports from China last year. There are currently no signs of talks between the two sides.Some US business groups and senior lawmakers criticised the latest action on Tuesday, with Senate finance committee chairman Orrin Hatch, a Republican, saying it “appears reckless and is not a targeted approach”.Chinese officials had promised to retaliate with tariffs on US imports, like soybeans, sorghum, autos, whiskey, and other products.\u0026nbspChinese policymakers promised the tariffs would have minimal impact, shaving 0.2 percentage points off of GDP. The ministry of commerce pledged to help affected Chinese companies.Chinese investors and businesses are nervous. Chinese exporters say they have already been hit by a strengthening yuan that has made their goods more expensive.\u0026nbspThe country’s main index, the Shanghai Composite Index, dipped to more than a two-year low in the week the first tariffs were implemented.Donald Trump has said he may ultimately impose tariffs on more than $500bn worth of Chinese goods – roughly the total amount of US imports from China in 2017.The US chamber of commerce, which has supported Trump’s tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulation of businesses, also criticised the administration’s move. “Tariffs are taxes, plain and simple. Imposing taxes on another $200bn worth of products will raise the costs of everyday goods for American families, farmers, ranchers, workers, and job creators. It will also result in retaliatory tariffs, further hurting American workers,” a chamber spokeswoman said. The Retail Industry Leaders Association, a lobby group representing the largest US retailers, said: “The president has broken his promise to bring maximum pain on China, minimum pain on consumers.” “American families are the ones being punished. Consumers, businesses and the American jobs dependent on trade, are left in the crosshairs of an escalating global trade war,” said Hun Quach, the head of international trade policy for the group."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a4f6d20c35c5df461a9f08a1b86884ff3000c55e/0_310_4998_3000/master/4998.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fc89ed7607117ff78cdbb0f205746567","title":"rump trudeau meeting nato summit tariffs clash","story":"Three-quarters of Canada’s trade and millions of jobs could be riding on the allies avoiding a repeat of their frosty G7 meetingThe last time the two North American leaders crossed paths, they started off with a warm handshake. But within hours Donald Trump had lashed out at Justin Trudeau, calling the Canadian prime minister “meek and mild” and accusing him of dishonesty. On Wednesday Trudeau and Trump will again meet at the Nato summit in Brussels, for the first time since the last month’s ill-tempered G7 gathering in Quebec.While they have spoken by phone since then, there’s little to suggest tensions have abated. This month, Canada launched tit-for-tat tariffs against the Americans in the first volley of a trade war between longstanding allies, while on Tuesday Trudeau asserted that Canada had no intention of meeting Trump’s demands that it meet Nato’s benchmark for defence spending.“We’ve got ourselves in a knife fight with a real estate billionaire and we’re not equipped for that,” said John Higginbotham, a senior fellow at Ottawa’s Carleton University and the Centre for International Governance Innovation. “Relations are at as negative a time as I have ever seen, and I’ve been involved in Canada-US relations for about 40 years.”Domestic politics is fuelling some of this confrontation, said Higginbotham, describing Trump’s attacks on Canada and Trudeau as “raw meat” for his Republican base.But Trudeau has also benefited from the clash, with a recent poll suggesting that the majority of Canadians approved of Trudeau’s assertion after the G7 that Canada “will not be pushed around” by the US on trade, despite Trump citing the remarks as the source of his anger. While the Brussels summit will focus on Nato, every interaction between Trump and Trudeau will be interpreted in the context of the tense renegotiations of Nafta, said Dan Ujczo, an Ohio-based trade lawyer with Dickinson Wright.“We can ill afford a bad moment at the Nato summit between Prime Minister Trudeau and President Trump,” said Ujczo. “We don’t need any awkward handshakes or snubs or anything like that.”When it comes to Nafta, much is at stake for Canada the agreement underpins the three-quarters of Canada’s exports that go to the US and roughly 2.5m Canadian jobs that depend on American trade. The Bank of Canada warned earlier this year that uncertainty over Nafta has dampened business investment in Canada.“I really hope Prime Minister Trudeau resists the temptation to join in with European allies and elsewhere to scold the United States,” said Ujczo. “Because we predict that this is going to be a pretty heated atmosphere.”Canada’s approach to the Trump administration to date has sought to strike a balance between pursuing a constructive approach to negotiations while also defending Canadian interests, said Roland Paris, a University of Ottawa professor who served as foreign policy adviser to Trudeau during the prime minister’s first months in office.“It’s obviously difficult with such an irascible partner in the White House, who can launch off on Twitter attacks seemingly without provocation,” he said. “I think that every country in the world is trying to figure out how to manage this unpredictable man.”Canada’s approach to the Trump administration, which has also included an outreach campaign to a wide-ranging network for political and industry contacts, continues to be the right one, he argued. “It’s not just a matter of a charm offensive and win him over and secure a deal – and then it hasn’t happened so it has failed – it’s a matter of managing a very complicated and difficult situation that is changing,” he said. “And the current situation is not good for Canada, but preventing it from getting worse should be the priority.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3c07c113570cc43cb51914349564d1580a94f199/0_137_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbcfb88c449a507d9e1e225d93db9a38","title":"somalia the rise of mogadishu artists music activists","story":"A new wave of artists, activists and entrepreneurs are trying to improve Somalia’s capital cityThe surprising sounds of a late evening in Mogadishu: surf on the beach, laughs of revellers, clinking of cups and glasses, oaths of harassed waiters and the soft melodies of the oud of Aweys Kabanle.Kabanle, a 45-year-old former dressmaker turned musician, is playing traditional Somali music at the luxury Mogadishu Beach View hotel at the city’s Lido to a smartly dressed audience in one of the world’s most dangerous cities.“This is Mogadishu. We laugh and sing. We play music. Music is for peace so we no longer live in fear,” Kabanle says, sipping a cappuccino.There are few cities with contrasts as stark as those of Mogadishu. Swollen by hundreds of thousands of people displaced by famine, drought and conflict in rural areas, its outlying districts resemble a vast refugee camp. Authorities are incompetent, corrupt or simply absent.It is seven years since the Islamic militants of al-Shabaab withdrew but many streets bear the scars of more than two decades of incessant warfare.Mogadishu’s inhabitants have long been known for their resilience, but a new wave of activists, entrepreneurs and artists are now trying to improve their city.Two years ago, Kabanle survived an al-Shabaab gun attack and suicide car bombing close to where he now performs every evening. The attack left at least 10 dead, including three of Aweys’s friends. The oud player was forced to jump over the wall of the hotel where he was playing to escape.“For several months following, there was no show,” he says. “People were unwilling to come back but I was committed to come here again. I started the first night by myself alone playing music and resumed hosting the show. Thanks be to God, people got confidence and now they are coming back for my show.”Despite the ongoing violence in the Somali capital, the economy is growing, hundreds of expatriates are returning from the west or African nations, scores of colleges are opening to cater for the young population and there is growing investment from the diaspora. Estate agents thrive: a two-storey house can cost nearly £100,000. Mogadishu has hosted a TEDx conference.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@theAhmed Hassan Sheikh decided to return to Mogadishu from Kenya a year and a half ago. He started his own arts company inside the fortified Mogadishu airport complex, where thousands of diplomats, United Nations staff and regional troops from the African Union stabilisation force are based.There is no shortage of demand for Sheikh’s paintings.“I do not need to fight with a gun. I have a powerful pen with which I draw my feelings. I believe through it I can bring change. I can make Mogadishu peaceful,” the 48-year-old artist says.His paintings call for young people to take up pens and books instead of arms, to warn against illegal migration and its devastating effects on Somali families.Other drawings recall life in old Mogadishu before the civil war, a time when the city was known as the most beautiful city in Africa. “When people see my artworks of former Mogadishu and how it used to be like, they appreciate how peaceful and prosperous Mogadishu was,” Ahmed says.Then there is Ubaxa Caasimadda (Flowers of the City), a group of students who, 18 months ago, set out to smarten scruffy city streets and mark roads to increase public safety. They started with the safest roads such as those near the presidential palace, because some had already received death threats from al-Shabaab.“When we started, we did not even know what will come out. It was just, go and do and then see. We knew the dangers we were facing but we took that risk,” says Amira Mahad Abdulle, a 24-year-old university student.Abdulle wears a burqa to conceal her identity and does not respond to phone calls from unknown people for her safety. “There are a lot of threats coming in but I try to stay safe. I do not fear. I want to serve Mogadishu,” she says.The group decided to act “because nobody else was willing to do it” and the government in Mogadishu is focused on fighting al-Shabaab. “We could not sit behind and wait for someone else to do this for the people of Mogadishu. We are the youth of this country and we decided to stand up for it,” Abdulle says.So far the group has painted dozens of zebra crossings and have planted flowers on pavements. “We are committed. We were born in Mogadishu and we want to help our city become developed, beautiful and safe like other cities in the world,” Isse Hassan Ibrahim, a 23-year-old typographic graduate, says.Though his best friend, a government employee, was assassinated by al-Shabaab last year, Ibrahim never stopped working as a volunteer in Mogadishu. “When my friend was killed, I got scared but I decided not to quit. I want to help my people and my capital city,” Ibrahim says. “We now have new youth groups joining us from other cities.”In the last 18 months, US and Somali forces have intensified the battle against al-Shabab, though without achieving decisive success. Last week US officials said a new airstrike killed 14 militants. Though the increased military activity has weakened the extremists, it also led to more civilian casualties.Kabanle believes his country will soon be at peace. “Somalia is no longer a war zone. It is a love zone,” he says, pointing to a group of young men and women sitting on the warm white sand of Mogadishu’s beach.This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems.

Over Munster and south Leinster top temperatures will reach 21-23 degrees. Winds will be light northeasterly and moderate near coasts.Thursday will have sunny spells and be mostly dry, with just a few showers likely. Temperatures will reach 18-23 degrees in light northerly or variable breezes.Friday will be another mostly dry day, with some sunny spells, but a few showers are still likely. Temperatures will reach the low to mid-20s in light variable breezes.Temperatures are forecast to reach 24 degrees on Saturday, which is likely to start mostly dry, with sunny spells or hazy sunshine cloud will increase from the west, with scattered showers spreading eastwards later and overnight. Winds will become light to moderate southwest to westerly.Sunday will be somewhat cloudier, with outbreaks of showery rain in light to moderate southwesterly winds.But Irish Water has warned that it may still need to restrict supplies for the rest of the year executives at the utility company met on Monday to discuss the possibility of imposing further limits in addition to the introduction of a national hosepipe ban.The vast majority of the country officially entered a state of absolute drought last week, with no rainfall recorded at 24 out of 25 weather stations over a two-week period.Amid the drought, Ulster Bank announced it would set up a €15 million fund, from which farmers affected by the weather can apply for credit. Applications for the fund open on Monday, July 16th.Farmers facing cash flow problems due to higher feed costs and fodder shortages, as a result of the extreme weather, can apply to the fund.Dublin Fire Brigade have warned motorists to avoid parking their cars directly over grass, as there is a risk the exhaust pipe could ignite the dry vegetation.A spokesman for the fire service cautioned motorists: “Your car’s exhaust pipe gets extremely hot and can cause dry grass to catch fire.” There has been one report of a car exhaust pipe starting a fire on a grass verge it was parked on in Wexford, which destroyed the car, the spokesman said.Meanwhile, Air Corps helicopters have been deployed across the Border to assist fire fighters in Northern Ireland who are tackling a gorse fire two miles from the Border, in the Slieve Gullion area of Co Armagh.The involvement of the Defence Forces was welcomed by Doug Beattie, Ulster Unionist Party MLA for Upper Bann, who tweeted his thanks to the Air Corps, describing their role as “neighbours being neighbourly”.Two helicopters were involved following a request from the Northern Ireland Fire Service. One helicopter is capable of dropping 1,200 litres of water per run over the area, and the second helicopter assisted directing operations.This was the first time the Air Corps had helped a fire-fighting operation in Northern Ireland, said a spokesman for the Defence Forces.Air Corps units have “assisted in cross-Border operations during severe weather occurrences, providing helicopter cargo slinging operations to drop fodder to livestock in isolated areas”, the spokesman said.Helicopter units have assisted on search and rescue missions across the Border in the past as well.Taoiseach Leo Varadkar tweeted it was “good to see the Irish Air Corps helping a neighbour”, adding that units were on standby for any further requests for assistance.Minister of State for Defence Paul Kehoe said it was a “great example” of the Defence Forces working with their Northern Irish counterparts, “to protect communities”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3560472.1531257344!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"newgrange digs are expected to reveal an extraordinary find","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMatthew and Geraldine Stout lead the dig at Newgrange. Photograph: Seamus Farrelly The first research excavations at Newgrange, Co Meath in more than 30 years have begun, after a geophysical survey showed what could prove to be an “extraordinary monument”.The find at the world heritage site has been described as “the most definite, complex and ordered feature ever seen in a geophysical survey in Ireland”, according to DCU medieval historian and archaeologist Dr Matthew Stout who is leading the dig with his wife, Boyne Valley archaeologist Dr Geraldine Stout. The four-week excavations began last week and it may be another week before the team of 18 archaeologists uncover anything of real significance. “It was a lot deeper than we expected, about a metre down,” Dr Matthew Stout said. A survey conducted in 2015 by geophysicist Joanna Leigh, to investigate the feasibility of renovating the old tourist office at Newgrange, clearly identified the substantial site at the back of Newgrange Farm.It suggested numerous large pits, forming two parallel sets extending over 75m, indicating an ancient processional way to Newgrange. The entrance way and perpendicular pits form a passage or corridor, which ends precisely due south of the entrance to Newgrange passage tomb. “It is a huge monument,” said Dr Stout, suggesting “a Neolithic communal routeway”.Ms Leigh has speculated that the site is associated with the passage tombs and is ritual in nature. “It’s the most impressive geophysical underground site that I’ve ever seen,” said Dr Stout after the first week of excavations. “It shows four even rows of pits and ditches and is an extraordinary feature.”It’s the first set of excavations since the 1980s at Newgrange and has been funded with a grant from the Royal Irish Academy with the support of the Redhouse family land owners, the OPW, DCU and Notre Dame University in the US.

Video: Parliamentlive.tv\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTheresa May departs following a cabinet meeting at number 10 Downing Street in London on Tuesday. Photograph: Luke MacGregorBloombergBritish prime minister Theresa May moved to reassert her authority on Tuesday after two top cabinet members quit and launched broadsides against her Brexit plans, winning support from many of her ministers including a leading eurosceptic.Ms May said she had chaired a “productive” meeting of her government, unswayed by the resignations of foreign secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit negotiator David Davis that rocked the government on Monday.Among those rallying around the prime minister was environment minister Michael Gove - a prominent campaigner to exit the European Union alongside Johnson for the 2016 referendum - who said he would not follow suit by resigning.However, the vice-chairs of the Conservative Party, MPs Ben Bradley and Maria Caulfield, resigned their posts on Tuesday because of their opposition to Ms May’s current policy on Brexit.“I fully understand and appreciate the great many challenges you face in delivering on Brexit, not least the balancing act in the House of Commons that constrains your freedom,” Mr Bradley wrote in his resignation later. “However I have come to the conclusion that I cannot in good faith be a spokesman for the party or for Government on this issue, and I cannot with any sincerity defend this course to my electorate, 71 per cent of whom voted to leave the European Union.”With less than nine months until Britain is due to leave the bloc, Ms May is sticking to her plan for a “business friendly” Brexit.She looks set on facing down a rebellion in her Conservative Party, where hardline Brexit supporters are livid over her plans to negotiate “a free trade area for goods” with the EU. One described accepting EU rules as “the ultimate betrayal”.Above a picture of her cabinet, including her new foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt and Brexit minister Dominic Raab after a mini-reshuffle late on Monday, Ms May wrote on her twitter feed: “Productive Cabinet meeting this morning - looking ahead to a busy week.”Her spokesman said she had welcomed the new members of her cabinet and they had discussed the publication of a white paper policy document on Britain’s future ties with the EU and stepping up preparations for any no-deal outcome to the negotiations with Brussels. Other ministers described the meeting as “very good”.“I think it is right that the cabinet backs the prime minister and speaks with one voice and if people don’t do that then they have to go,” justice secretary David Gauke told BBC radio.Ms May must now move quickly to try to win the EU’s support for her Brexit proposal to unblock talks. These have all but stalled because of her reticence of show her cards until now for fear of angering one of the two main factions of her party.German chancellor Angela Merkel arrives in London later on Tuesday for a meeting with May and other leaders to discuss the Western Balkans.The British leader may have stilled the waters over a possible leadership contest, but some Conservative Brexit supporters are still incensed over what they see as her decision to break her promise for a clean break with the EU.“It is the ultimate betrayal of our democracy and people’s belief in it. It’s not even an accidental betrayal, it was planned and plotted well in advance,” said Conservative politician Andrew Bridgen.“Never have so many campaigned for so long and so hard for so little,” he said.But while many Brexit campaigners were still hoping for a vote of confidence to oust Ms May, it is unlikely that they have the numbers. They also are in a minority in parliament to try to change any deal that is agreed with the EU.At a meeting with Conservative politicians on Monday, she was cheered and applauded by many, having warned them that internal squabbling could pave the way for socialist opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn to take power instead.Ms May’s proposals for a future EU relationship after Britain departs from the bloc next March had taken two years of internal government wrangling to agree. But within 48 hours Davis had quit and Johnson followed. The Daily  newspaper ran a photograph on Tuesday of him, pen poised, resigning as foreign minister. Three junior ministers also quit their posts.“Brexit should be about opportunity and hope,” Mr Johnson said in a scathing resignation letter that was echoed in headlines in a number of Britain’s national newspapers. “That dream is dying, suffocated by needless self-doubt.”Meanwhile, US president Donald Trump has said the UK is in turmoil and suggested that his meeting with Russian president Vladimir Putin would be the easiest of his trip to Europe to see Nato leaders and Ms May.Speaking as he boarded Marine One, Mr Trump said: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“So I have Nato, I have the UK — that’s a situation with turmoil. And I have Putin. Frankly, Putin may be the easiest of all.”On his trip to Europe, he added: “It’s going to be an interesting time in the UK and an interesting time at Nato. We will work it out and all countries will be happy.“We do have a lot of allies. But we cannot be taken advantage of. We’re being taken advantage of by the European Union. We spend 75 per cent on Nato and frankly, it helps them more than it helps us.”–ReutersPress AssociationDeal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the March 29th deadline fast approaches.

This will help ensure that more informed comparisons can be made.”However, the BBC’s insistence that it is being transparent over salaries is marred by the fact that the list is already out-of-date. It covers the financial year to April 2018, but many presenters have had pay increases or cuts in recent months. Their current salaries will not be disclosed for another year.The BBC will hide current earnings in a separate table grouping presenters anonymously in £50,000 bands, rather than publishing inidual salaries.Around one-third of the stars who appeared on last year’s list will be absent because they salaries are paid via BBC Studios, which was spun off last year as a commercial entity. Strictly Come Dancing, Countryfile, Antiques Roadshow, Casualty and EastEnders all fall within the Studios remit.In 2017, two-thirds of presenters earning £150,000 or more were men:BBC\u0026#039s star salaries: Where the money is spentInsiders said there will  be more women on the list this year and fewer men. Sarah Montague and Emily Maitlis are expected to appear for the first time, after their exclusion last year highlighted the corporation’s gender pay gap.Some men are also thought to have received a pay boost, including Justin Webb, who until recently was the lowest paid member of the Today team. Although his salary last year was £150,000-199,999, a portion of that was for other BBC output. Sarah Montague’s Today salary was £133,000, and Webb earned less than her.Webb later asked why another Today colleague, Nick Robinson, was “paid £100,000 or so a year more than me essentially to do the same job”.2017 BBC salaries list: the biggest surprisesThe BBC’s famous names are braced for the fallout when their salaries are made public as part of the corporation’s annual report.One household name told the  last week that the list amounts to “a National Trolling Festival where we all get pummelled over our salaries”, and said the £10,000 bands were “the latest humiliation”.Lord Hall, the director-general, will today reaffirm his pledge to eliminate the gender pay gap by 2020. The gap has fallen from 9.3 per cent to 7.6 per cent in the past year.England World Cup excitement hits fever pitch as nation gears up for Croatia semi-finalThailand cave rescue: Water pumps failed just after last boy escaped  Meet the seven British ers playing leading roles in the Thai cave rescue missionRussian supermodel Natalia Vodianova - who will bring World Cup trophy on to pitch - is cheering on EnglandChurches meet in coffee shops to reinvigorate congregationsFans celebrate in Paris as France reach World Cup finalLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowComment: The Archers’ Lear-like struggle feels like it is just the beginning of Act One\u0026#39Hooyah!

Tasks designed to measure eye-to-hand coordination involved steering, taking aim and tracking objects on a computer screen.In one task, the children had to hit a moving object with an on-screen bat, which researchers said tapped into a fundamental cognitive ability - how the brain predicts the movement of objects through time and space.Those with better hand-eye coodination tended to have higher academic attainment, the study found.Better hand-eye coordination could lead to improved grades at school, study findsThose who performed best at the “steering task” in particular were on average nine months ahead of classmates who struggled.However, while interceptive timing skills tended to be linked to ability in maths, it did not influence reading and writing development.Mark Mon-Williams, professor of cognitive psychology at the University of Leeds, said: “The results show that eye-to-hand co-ordination and interceptive timing are robust predictors of how well young children will perform at school.“The current thinking among psychologists is that the neural circuitry used to build up a child’s understanding of their external environment, the way they orientate themselves spatially and understand their world is also used to process numbers and more abstract thinking.“It also raises the question: should schools be identifying those children who are seen as clumsy or not so well coordinated and giving them extra support?”The study, published in the peer-review journal Psychological Science, was conducted at Lilycroft Primary School in Bradford, West Yorkshire, which has remodelled its reception, indoor and outdoor areas to include a space where children can develop motor skills and coordination.  England World Cup excitement hits fever pitch as nation gears up for Croatia semi-finalThailand cave rescue: Water pumps failed just after last boy escaped  Meet the seven British ers playing leading roles in the Thai cave rescue missionRussian supermodel Natalia Vodianova - who will bring World Cup trophy on to pitch - is cheering on EnglandChurches meet in coffee shops to reinvigorate congregationsFans celebrate in Paris as France reach World Cup finalLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowComment: The Archers’ Lear-like struggle feels like it is just the beginning of Act One\u0026#39Hooyah!

Their scale and breadth show that the Church is feeling confident about its future.”FAQ | What is the General Synod?On Monday the church’s governing body General Synod, which finished meeting on Tuesday, heard that it had experienced its first drop in levels of planned giving in half a century. Members raised concerns that millennials were not donating in the same way that previous generations had done. Church of EnglandEngland World Cup excitement hits fever pitch as nation gears up for Croatia semi-finalThailand cave rescue: Water pumps failed just after last boy escaped  Meet the seven British ers playing leading roles in the Thai cave rescue missionRussian supermodel Natalia Vodianova - who will bring World Cup trophy on to pitch - is cheering on EnglandFans celebrate in Paris as France reach World Cup finalLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on now\u0026#39Hooyah!

Samjiyon County is close to Mount Paektu, a dormant volcano that has been co-opted by the regime to serve as a symbol of the ruling Kim dynasty.Kim Jong-un was inspecting a potato farm at the time of Mike Pompeo\u0026#39s visitAccording to official accounts, Kim Jong-il, the second leader of the nation and Mr Kim’s father, was born in a hut on the flanks of the mountain while his father, Kim Il-sung, lead partisan attacks against the occupying Japanese. Other records indicate he was born in a refugee camp in eastern Russia. As well as a deliberate snub to Mr Pompeo, Mr Kim’s visit was significant because he chose to demonstrate North Korea’s resilience in the face of US-led sanctions on his regime. Equally, he chose to visit an area adjacent to China, which once again appears to be extending economic support to Pyongyang. Please review our commenting policyEngland World Cup excitement hits fever pitch as nation gears up for Croatia semi-finalThailand cave rescue: Water pumps failed just after last boy escaped  Meet the seven British ers playing leading roles in the Thai cave rescue missionRussian supermodel Natalia Vodianova - who will bring World Cup trophy on to pitch - is cheering on EnglandChurches meet in coffee shops to reinvigorate congregationsFans celebrate in Paris as France reach World Cup finalLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on now\u0026#39Hooyah!

But nude bathing? That will be a first.Andrew Davies, the screenwriter responsible for Colin Darcy’s memorable lake scene in Pride and Prejudice, is tackling Austen once more and this time wet shirts will be surplus to requirements.He is adapting and completing Sanditon, the novel that Austen left unfinished on her death in 1817.“Jane Austen managed to write only a fragment of her last novel before she died - but what a fragment!” Davies said.“Sanditon tells the story of the transformation of a sleepy fishing village into a fashionable seaside resort, with a spirited young heroine, a couple of entrepreneurial brothers, some dodgy financial dealings, a West Indian heiress, and quite a bit of nude bathing.”Davies has previously revealed that he wanted Firth’s Mr Darcy to emerge naked from the lake in the 1995 Pride and Prejudice adaptation. “The wet shirt scene was supposed to be a total male frontal nudity scene, because that’s how men went bathing in those days,” he has said.That is historically accurate, according to Dr Chloe Wigston Smith, of the University of York’s department of English and Related Literature. She said: “Research has suggested that fashionable bathers were drawn to the sea in ‘bathing machines’ - a small hut on wheels - where they would change out of their clothes.“Men at the time had the privilege of bathing naked in seas, rivers and ponds, but nearly all women would have worn some form of bathing outfit.”ITV will broadcast Sanditon as an eight-part series next year. Austen produced only 12 chapters before succumbing to illness at the age of 41.The heroine, Charlotte Heywood, befriends a couple, the Parkers, who have a carriage accident near her home. Mr Parker is a developer intent on turning Sanditon into a chic destination, and Charlotte goes to stay with the family on the Sussex coast.Characters include Miss Lambe, described as “a young West Indian of large fortune, in delicate health”, who is discussed but not glimpsed in the existing chapters.Austen introduces Mr Parker’s brother, Sidney, late in the novel - he is “very good-looking, with a decided air of ease and fashion, and a lively countenance” - and no romance has developed by the time she put down her pen, but Davies has created one in order to give the story a middle and an end.Critics are ided on whether the chapters were an early or final draft. Prof John Mullan, head of English Literature at University College London and author of What Matters in Jane Austen?, said: “Sanditon as a story is promising, but it does not have the dazzling, mischievous prose of her completed novels, in which there is hardly a dud sentence.“Some people think that is because she was ill and her powers were ebbing.“But to me it seems to be absolutely not finished. Maybe this is what a Jane Austen novel looks like when she starts it. It seems impossible that she wasn’t going to put it through the mill of her genius.”England World Cup excitement hits fever pitch as nation gears up for Croatia semi-finalThailand cave rescue: Water pumps failed just after last boy escaped  Meet the seven British ers playing leading roles in the Thai cave rescue missionRussian supermodel Natalia Vodianova - who will bring World Cup trophy on to pitch - is cheering on EnglandChurches meet in coffee shops to reinvigorate congregationsFans celebrate in Paris as France reach World Cup finalLondon theatre: the best plays and shows on nowComment: The Archers’ Lear-like struggle feels like it is just the beginning of Act One\u0026#39Hooyah!

In an effort to stay one step ahead of its rivals, Snapchat\u0026nbsphas consistently pioneered new features for its messaging app, such as self-destructing messages, augmented reality capabilities and the Story format.Similar versions of these features have routinely been picked up by Snapchat\u0027s\u0026nbsprivals, with Facebook deploying several of the functionalities to its stable of messaging services and apps.Earlier this year, Snapchat\u0026nbspCEO Evan Spiegel spoke out about allegations that Facebook consistently copied the app\u0027s most popular features, saying he wished the internet giant would also copy his firm\u0027s values.\u0026nbspReferring to the data scandal surrounding Facebook, in which personal information of 87 million users was exploited by a third party for the purpose of political profiling, Mr Spiegel said:\u0026nbspWe would really appreciate it if they copied our data protection practices also.Snapchat above Times Square in New York March 12, 2015 (REUTERSLucas Jackson)Rumours of the unreleased feature come as Snapchat unveils Lens Explorer, a major new feature that allows users to search for thousands of augmented reality Lenses built by people through the\u0026nbspLens Studio app that was launched last year.The messaging app claims to have the world\u0027s most engaged and creative AR platform, with over 70 million Snapchat\u0026nbspusers engaging with them each day.We\u0027re excited by the loyalty, creativity, and variety of experiences we\u0027re seeing from the Lens Studio community to date and are committed to continuing to invest in the platform, making AR creation accessible to anyone and bringing more and more erse experiences to Snapchatters, a spokesperson for the firm said.\u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Conditions are such that detainees suffer mental health problems which sometimes lead to\u0026nbspsuicide attempts, according to the charity.Thousands of innocent asylum seekers –\u0026nbspoften fleeing war and torture – are detained each year and\u0026nbsplocked up indefinitely\u0026nbspwith no support, the charity warned.In the first intervention of its kind by a major charity, the Red Cross calls for significant reforms including a 28-day limit on detention. It found cases of asylum-seekers being detained for as long as two years and seven months.Home Office separating scores of children from parentsHome Office makes almost £100m profit from children\u0027s citizenship feesHome Office separating scores of children from parentsFive of the 26 detainees interviewed\u0026nbspfor the report had attempted suicide while they were detained, and\u0026nbspjust 25\u0026nbspof them\u0026nbspsaid they had been given no access to mental health\u0026nbspsupport services.Pregnant women continue to be “needlessly detained” in breach of the Home Office’s own guidance –\u0026nbspwith 47 pregnant women detained in the year to June 2017.The charity said the\u0026nbsp“overly onerous and traumatic” experience of attending immigration reporting centres\u0026nbsp– which many are required to do every every two weeks – should be overhauled by banning the practice of detaining people when they turn up.Mike Adamson, chief executive of the British Red Cross, said: “Most of the people in the UK asylum process have fled conflict or persecution to find a place of safety. They have already experienced more trauma and anguish than the rest of us could possibly imagine.“The threat of detention without notice hangs over many people going through the asylum process in the UK.\u0026nbspOur research shows that not knowing whether this week will be the week they are detained again, can make the process of having to report regularly extremely distressing.“This can exacerbate existing mental health issues and mean people never truly feel free.”Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said the Red Cross report was a “damning indictment” of how the government treats migrants and refugees.“We know from the Windrush scandal that people are wrongly detained,” she said.\u0026nbsp“Some suffer indefinite detention without legal representation. The government needs to introduce some humanity into the immigration system,” she said.Figures obtained by the Red Cross through freedom of information requests show that of 14,733 asylum seekers who left detention in 2016, nearly half (42 per cent) had been detained for between 29 days and six months, with 10 per cent held for more than four months.The charity recommends that the Home Office allows people to live in their communities while their immigration cases are resolved by replacing the systems of detention and reporting with end-to-end, community-based alternatives.The Home Office told The Independent it had noted the recommendations from the report and was also carefully considering the contents of the Stephen Shaw review into the needs of vulnerable detainees, which is set to be published this month.The warnings come amid mounting criticism of the UK’s immigration detention system, which currently holds around 26,500 people each year and around 2,500 at any given time. Britain is the only EU country without a statutory time limit for the detention of migrants.Recent figures obtained by The Independent revealed at least one person a day needs medical treatment for self-harming in removal centres, while the prisons watchdog described conditions in the centres as “prison-like”.In May the Home Office came under fire\u0026nbspwhen it emerged that proven torture victims were also being detained.Inspectors from HMI Prisons joined growing calls for a time limit, warning of a “deep level of emotional distress” and rising number of suicides, and noting that 50 per cent of detainees were eventually “released back into the community”.UK news in picturesSerena Williams celebrates after winning against Camila Giorgi during their women\u0027s singles quarter-final match on the eighth day of Wimbledon.

What has swayed me over the last two years to fully back the Brexit vision is the immense opportunities that are available from global trade, and for the ability for Britain to be an outward looking nation in control of our own destiny once again.Fresh Brexit referendum necessary if MPs cannot agree, Watson suggestsWhat Dominic Raab needs to do to avoid Brexit disasterBoris may think he’s Churchill but Brexiteers don’t own patriotismFarage threatens Ukip return unless Brexit put ‘back on track’“I fear that this agreement at Chequers damages those opportunities that being tied to EU regulations, and the EU tying our hands when seeking to make new trade agreements, will be the worst of all worlds if we do not deliver Brexit in spirit as well as in name, then we are handing Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No10.”Lewes MP Ms Caulfield\u0026nbspalso\u0026nbspstood down from her role as Tory vice-chair for women, warning that the direction of travel did “not fully embrace the opportunities that Brexit can provide”.Ms Caulfield said in her letter to the PM: “The policy may assuage vested interests, but the voters will find out and their representatives will be found out. This policy will be bad for our country and bad for the party.\u0026nbsp“The direct consequences of that will be prime minister Corbyn.”Her appointment to a prominent women’s role\u0026nbspdrew criticism from campaigners, as the former nurse is a vocal pro-life campaigner,\u0026nbspwho led efforts to prevent changes to strict abortion laws.People’s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealPeople’s Vote march – demanding vote on final Brexit dealA young protestor shouts as she takes part in the People’s Vote demonstration against BrexitGina Miller and Caroline LucasTens of thousands of people march through LondonDemonstrators at the People’s Vote March‘Two months too young to decide on my future’A young girl joins in the marchAn EU flag is draped across the statue of Winston Chruchill in Parliament SquareVince Cable MP, Pro-EU campaigner Gina Miller, Tony Robinson and Caroline Lucas MP join with crowdsCrowds gather on Pall MallA man resembling Britain’s Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, joins EU supportersPeople gather in Trafalgar SquarePro-EU campaigner Gina Miller and Tony RobinsonEU supporters, calling on the government to give Britons a vote on the final Brexit deal, participate in the ‘People’s Vote’ marchConservative chairman Brandon Lewis said: “Maria Caulfield and Ben Bradley have worked hard since the start of the year to promote women and young people on behalf of the Conservative Party.

It would be a huge economic problem for the UK and also for the EU.

The tie had explosive potential. England would face the host nation of a tournament boycotted by its own government. Russia would face the declared enemy the focus of four\u0026nbspmonths of relentless propaganda on state TV. It would have been an existential showdown.\u0026nbspTwo missed penalties later, Wednesday’s semi-final tie was turned on its head. Russians had a new dilemma: Croatia\u0026nbspor England?\u0026nbspThe choice is not as straightforward as it might seem. Yes, Britain is not\u0026nbspflavour of the month. But Russia’s relations with their fellow Slavs are far from simple.\u0026nbspTheir complexity was underlined with a leaked video showing Croatian defender Domagoj Vida performing a populist, pro-Ukrainian greeting. That video earned him a FIFA censure.\u0026nbsp“The Vida incident has changed things for many Russians,” says Anton Prokudin, 21, a customer at the hipster Pivbar bar on the Garden Ring Road in central Moscow. “He should have kept quiet.”\u0026nbspThe student says some of his friends have switched from supporting Croatia. He has decided to stick to Modric and Co – a “footballing” decision. The Croats are “better, more determined” than the English they performed wonders against Argentina.\u0026nbspOthers in the bar said they would support England. Tensions were for politicians and the media, said Sergei Petrov, 32. He was a fan of all things English – the music, the football, the humour. “Sport should be outside of politics,” agrees his wife, Maria Petrova, 28.\u0026nbspEngland\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finals16 England\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finalsHere we take a look at the route that has taken Gareth Southgate\u0027s side to the last four.A Harry Kane double got England off to a winning start, although they needed an injury-time winner from the Tottenham front man. A strong start from England was rewarded by Kane\u0027s close-range finish from a corner after only 11 minutes, but Kyle Walker\u0027s handball gifted Ferjani Sassi the chance to equalise from the spot before half-time. England probed without success for the second 45 minutes until, a minute into added-time, Kane\u0027s far post header following another corner sealed victory.Southgate\u0027s side turned on the style against the ill-disciplined minnows, who were 5-0 down by half-time. Panama could not live with England\u0027s strength at set-pieces, which led to John Stones heading the opener and Kane adding number two with a penalty. Jesse Lingard curled in the best of the bunch for number three before another Stones header and another Kane penalty put England in dreamland. Kane completed his hat-trick with a deflection he knew nothing about before Felipe Baloy\u0027s late consolation.Both sides fielded second-string sides, having already qualified for the knockout stages and in the knowledge that finishing second in the group was likely to offer a more favourable route to the final. Adnan Januzaj\u0027s brilliant solo goal won the match for Belgium.56 Colombia 1 England 1 (England won 4-3 on penalties) - Last 16, Moscow, July 3England won a World Cup penalty shootout for the first time as Jordan Pickford\u0027s save from Carlos Bacca and Eric Dier\u0027s cool spot-kick sealed a dramatic victory. Colombia, without star man James Rodriguez through injury, adopted rough-house tactics but Southgate\u0027s side kept their cool and went ahead through a second-half Kane penalty. They then recovered from conceding a last-gasp equaliser to Yerry Mina, and from Jordan Henderson missing first in the shootout, to win their first knockout game at a major tournament in 12 years.Southgate\u0027s side turned in their best performance of the tournament to see off a team who had kept three clean sheets in four games and contributed to Germany\u0027s early elimination. Harry Maguire\u0027s thumping first-half header got England up and running, with Dele Alli nodding home the second, but Pickford was again the star of the show with a couple of quite brilliant saves.16 England\u0027s route to the World Cup semi-finalsHere we take a look at the route that has taken Gareth Southgate\u0027s side to the last four.A Harry Kane double got England off to a winning start, although they needed an injury-time winner from the Tottenham front man.

A man in a tight black and brown laminated shirt answers only one question – “Croatia” – before returning to drink vodka with his friend.\u0026nbspOthers refused to give their full names.\u0026nbsp“The English are all clowns,” says “Alexander”, 63, a former submariner, who is drinking vodka and beer chasers with fellow military man Vladimir Afanasiev, 66.\u0026nbsp“And don’t get me going on Boris Johnson,” he says. “You won’t like it.”\u0026nbspHis friend Mr Afanasiev said England had never done Russia any favours: “You couldn’t call England a prostitute, that would be impolite. But they do go with whoever they want.” \u0026nbspBoth men would be supporting Croatia at Luzhniki stadium on Wednesday, they said. There was no contest.\u0026nbspThe Croats “may have been Nazis in the Second World War”, says Alexander, but they will always be “closer to the Russian spirit” than the English.From the moment Russia lost on penalties, nationalistic commentators have zoomed in on the Croatian Second World War stance. Some have even drawn a direct line from that to Vida’s pro-Ukrainian video.\u0026nbspBut it is another military campaign – the Yugoslavian wars of the 1990s – that will likely have a larger effect on Russian allegiances on Wednesday.\u0026nbspRussia’s ultras fostered close links with their Serbian counterparts during those years – and a corresponding animosity towards the Croats. T-shirts proclaiming “Kosovo je Srbija” are popular among the Russian ultras crowd. The Serbian question is one of few that unites the movement.\u0026nbsp“Eighty eight\u0026nbspper cent of Russians will be for England,” declares “Mikhail”, a barman at a central Moscow bar associated with footballs’ ultras. “No one is bothered about Skripal, Johnson or politics. The thing that really matters are the links we have with our Serbian friends.”He reveals a tattoo of Dinamo Moscow: “There’s room for only one Dinamo here. No Zagreb. Never.”\u0026nbspWhen Nato embarked on the 1998-9 Kosovo campaign, it was football fan groups who took the lead in organising aggressive pickets of Western embassies. The American embassy came under particular attack, pelted by paint and all kinds of projectiles over several days.Fan leader Alexander Shprygin, considered close to Russian ultras, was one one of the main organisers. He recalls how football fans would ring one another throughout the night to get the numbers together. They then joined forces with nationalist politician Vladimir Zhirinovsky.\u0026nbsp“It was a small, closed world, but somehow, there were enough of us to cause trouble,” he tells The Independent. “We went to every embassy: the French, the British, the Germans, and to the Americans.”\u0026nbspCome Wednesday, England may well find themselves the beneficiaries of additional support from the most unusual of places.\u0026nbsp“The Croats should be an opponent in principle, even if that means supporting the English for a match,” says Mr Shprygin.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Frontex runs an operation off the coast of Italy that works closely with the local coast guard.The EU missions have helped rescue thousands of refugees\u0026nbspat sea, all of whom were disembarked in Italy. Spokespeople at Frontex and Sophia did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Italy has so far refused to take back any migrants stopped at the German border.“Before receiving even one asylum seeker from another European country, we want to see a precise commitment – giving the timetable, costs, means, men and resources –\u0026nbspon how the EU plans to help us defend our external borders,” Mr Salvini said last week.Aid groups and United Nations’ agencies on Friday asked Italy open its ports to rescue ships because the policy could have a high human cost. More migrants could die at sea, or they could be trapped indefinitely in inhumane detention centres, they said.On Sunday, Mr Salvini said the previous government had agreed to welcome migrants rescued by ships participating in the EU sea missions.Mr Salvini said: “With our government, the music has changed and will change”.This comes after a rescue boat carrying 60 refugees arrived in Barcelona last week after being turned away by Italy and Malta.The mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, came to the ship’s rescue when she, with permission from the Spanish government, told the crew of the vessel that it could dock.\u0026nbspThe boat, which was said to have had five women, a nine-year-old and four teenagers on board, was turned away by Mr Salvini.He said the rescue boat “can forget about arriving in an Italian port” and then suggested the boat should dock in Malta which he claimed was the nearest port.Additional reporting by ReutersEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

All French parties are entitled to money in proportion to the number of votes it receives.The party, which recently changed its name from National Front to National Rally in an attempt to distance itself from racist and antisemitic associations, has long suffered from financial problems.In 2014 it took a loan from a Russian bank, saying it had been refused credit in France.

Mass deportations of illegal immigrants? Jawohl!And don’t mention the #RefugeesWelcome hashtag.What a change of heart. Merkel’s solution to the refugee crisis of 2015 was to dismantle Germany’s borders.No elected politician in modern history has ever acted with such monumental, breath-taking arrogance.Merkel’s grandiose virtue signalling unleashed mass, mostly economic migration that continues to this day.More than a million refugees poured into Germany in 2015 alone. They were almost exclusively young men because the old, the sick and children — the most vulnerable refugees and those most deserving of a helping hand — can’t walk the length of the Balkans.Anyone who had doubts about promoting limitless uncontrolled migration was silenced by Merkel’s smug catchphrase, “Wir schaffen das!” — We can do this!But Germany, and Europe, will pay the price for Angela Merkel’s apocalyptic arrogance long after she is pushing up edelweiss.Merkel’s career is on its knees because she permanently changed Germany without ever consulting the German people to see if her policy of the unmanaged migration of one million-plus young males from a totally different culture was actually WHAT THEY WANTED.Merkel never even thought about the wishes of the German people. We hear a lot about the rise of “populism” everywhere from Trump’s America to the new, vehemently anti-EU coalition government in Italy.But there is no great mystery about the rise of anti- establishment sentiment. For decades haughty politicians have viewed their own people with unbridled, undisguised, unapologetic contempt.Now, all over the Western world, they are paying the price.Theresa May should carefully study the fall of Angela Merkel. Whatever the polls might say, few would weep to see May departing Downing Street.It seems increasingly likely, from what we’re hearing out of Chequers, that this prime minister would far prefer to cuddle up to the crumbling EU empire rather than break free and strike trade deals with the US, Australia, Canada, India and China.But if we can’t trade with the world then it is not a soft Brexit. It is no bloody Brexit at all.Her job is not to soften our departure from the EU to such a degree that it becomes meaningless.Whatever her personal preferences, Theresa May’s job, and the historic role that falls to her now, is to honour the referendum of 2016, the vote we were solemnly promised was final by our former prime minister, David Cameron.It is not complicated. Don’t do a Merkel.Theresa May has to respect democracy and the will of the British people.And if she doesn’t or she can’t, if May betrays the British people, if she castrates or buggers up Brexit, if she tells 17.4million that they are ignorant racist bigots who should never have had a vote in the first place, then we are going to need a new prime minister.In Merkel’s spectacular fall from power there is a lesson for every leader in the Western world, especially Theresa May.You are not our master. You are our servant. You do not know best. And you ignore the will of your people at your peril.THIS World Cup has been a revelation. Who knew we would still be working up a sweat long after Germany, Argentina, Brazil and Spain had flown home?Who knew that England could win a penalty shoot-out in a World Cup? Then cruise through a quarter-final?And who knew England could only ever really succeed again – and true success means having a team that we love and take pride in – if we returned to having English managers? All jaw-dropping stuff.Now Alicia Aylies – former Miss France and the girlfriend of France’s fleet-footed Kylian Mbappe – proudly poses in a zippy bralet.Seriously, who had ever heard of the zippy bralet until Russia 2018? The shocks just keep on coming.FOR two weeks every year, the British go crazy about tennis.The Australian Open, Roland-Garros in France and the US Open hardly merit a second glance from the British public but Wimbledon is an essential part of our calendar.Yet this year our attention has been distracted by another sporting event in a distant land. The men’s singles final will overlap with the World Cup Final.But quite frankly, who cares?This year we are lukewarm on Wimbledon.So you had to feel for British wildcard Katie Boulter, knocked out in the second round.There is still plenty of time for Henman Hill or Murray Mound to become Boulter’s Bulge or Katie’s Cusp.LONDON Mayor Sadiq Khan is allowing a Donald Trump blimp to float above London during the President’s visit to the UK.No news yet on if Khan has plans to do anything about the gun, knife and acid epidemic on the streets of London.With well over 1,000 stabbings this year, more than fifty of them fatal, crime in London is out of control.But at least we have that Trump balloon, Sadiq.DIEGO MARADONA was pictured grinning happily in an XXL Colombia shirt before their match with England but was apoplectic in defeat.“You have to denounce this,” fumed Maradona.“As the captain of legends, I have to tell Infantino (Fifa President) this cannot be left like this.“This is a fatal mistake for the whole country.”I’m sure it all sounds much better in translation.But you get the gist – “Our headbutting boys were robbed”.Fifa hands Maradona a reported £7,000 to turn up at every match and the fat man issued a grovelling apology for criticising the ref when he reflected that seven grand might possibly slip through his cheating hands.But you can hardly blame Diego Maradona for sticking up for those grappling, nasty, spiteful, penalty-spot-scuffing Colombians.After all, Diego has done his best to single-handedly prop up one of Colombia’s major exports. And that’s nothing to sniff at.YOUNG mum Claire Morrison, 28, was mortified when her six-year-old daughter Eve took her vibrator to school for show-and-tell because Eve thought it was a particularly interesting looking pen.Some parents might prefer to keep quiet about this mishap, but Claire has gone on Facebook to tell the “hilarious” story.“She just said it was her funny pink pen,” chuckles Claire, a hairdresser from Dundee. “Then she said, ‘It must talk because it needs batteries’. So her stepdad and I laughed that off and we have safely stored it away.”It has now been shared 6,000 times.The story. Not the vibrator. Obviously. That wouldn’t be very hygienic.WE can all understand why David and Victoria Beckham would want to put on a public display of loving solidarity on their wedding anniversary.But I can’t help wondering, does Victoria really need to tell David “I love you so much” via her Instagram account and its 21.3million followers? It seems so extravagantly public.Couldn’t she just give him a card?AFTER careful consideration, MEPs in the European Parliament have voted to keep their £3,900-a-month taxpayer-funded (and tax-free) expenses a secret.Blow me down. Nobody saw that one coming.The generous expenses, known as the general expenditure allowance, or GEA, are paid as a lump sum into the MEPs salary, with no records kept, no receipts required and no questions asked. MEPs can spend it all on prostitutes and Ferrero Rocher chocolates if they want.Nobody cares.The GEA costs around £35million a year.And our corrupt continental cousins wonder why we’re leaving.DAVID Cameron received £800,000 to write his memoirs, which have been unexpectedly delayed until next year.Cameron should tell us why he made it legally binding for this country to spend £13billion a year on foreign aid, why he bombed Libya into the failed state it is today and how he blew £9million of public money on his pro-EU leaflet.

Of course, our security interests don’t begin and end at our borders, or even at the edge of Europe.Whether it’s Russia, Syria, Afghanistan or beyond, threats continue to emerge and develop around the world.After we leave the EU we will be free to pursue a truly independent foreign policy but that does not mean we will isolate ourselves from our neighbours.Under our proposals, we will continue to consult and co-operate with our EU partners on global issues.We will work with the EU on sanctions like those recently imposed on Russia, including co-ordinating them where it’s in our interests to do so.Our joint work on defence capability and space will continue. And we will decide where our armed forces and foreign aid could be used alongside the EU.Brexit has never been about turning our backs on Europe, pulling down the shutters and keeping ourselves to ourselves.Since well before the EU existed we have traded with and fought alongside allies around the world, and that won’t end when we leave next March.There’s still a lot of negotiating to be done.

And we’re only at the start of what will be no doubt stormy negotiations for months to come.There remain serious questions about not just the compromise that Theresa May has forced on her Cabinet but on the final deal she plans to sign with Brussels.One, does it genuinely give us the ability to sign free trade deals across the rest of the world, strengthening our links with emerging markets and with the Commonwealth?Two, does it genuinely end freedom of movement, or does the woolly language in Downing Street’s statement still give people the chance to come here on the off-chance they might find a job?Three, can a future Government genuinely seek to diverge further away from the EU in certain areas without Brussels blowing the whole deal up, or charging us a king’s ransom to do so?If the answer to any of those is no, then the Prime Minister will never be forgiven.Not by her party and, as we report today, not by the public either.IT is astonishing that £13,000 of taxpayers’ cash has been dished out to allow a man serving life for murder to indulge his musical passions by staging a rock opera in jail.That’s money taken from the pockets of working families who have to scrimp and save because the taxman milks them at the petrol pump, the checkout till and in their paycheque.Why did the Arts Council think it appropriate to give the fruits of their labour to a monster like Graham Coutts?The law-abiding public deserve so much better.ENGLAND in a World Cup semi-final.

They failed to force Mrs May when they had a chance to prepare for a No Deal Brexit. That failure instantly handed victory to the Remainers and to Brussels.Should we one day choose to make a clean break, we will face harsh “consequences” — what Boris vividly calls “punishment beatings”.But the biggest punishment beating will come from voters.If the Tories don’t care about the 17.4million who want Brexit, they will be made to care.Constitutional lawyer Martin Howe, a Tory QC, warns we are entering “a worst-of-all-worlds black hole Brexit where Britain is stuck ­permanently as a vassal state.”The fragile Tory lead over Labour has just evaporated.

If these then reach fresh water, they can hatch and the cycle begins again.While Schistosomiasis was previously linked to impoverished parts of South America, sub-Saharan Africa where water hygiene is limited, recent outbreaks were reported on the Mediterranean.In 2014,  six people were infected after swimming in the Cavu river, in Corsica.And, according to Professor Hoffmann, global travel and climate change could mean we see parasitic worms continuing to move into parts of Europe and North America.The long-term consequences of increased parasitic worm distributions are difficult to predict, but the harm that infection causes highlights the need for developing control strategies that can mitigate this 21st-century threat to global health.Hoffman and his team are looking into ways to treat and prevent the spread of  parasitic diseases.We’re not at the stage of drug development, but we hope that learning more about the disruption of these proteins could ultimately save lives across the world, he wrote.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But in practice, how does that work given that most sexual encounters are one-on-one with no witnesses?She can still say yes at the time then later pretend she didn’t and falsely accuse him of rape.And equally, he could pretend she had consented when, in fact, she had screamed no.Perhaps we are moving to an era when all young people will feel compelled to temporarily stall a moment of passion so they can film the consenting “yes” on their mobile phones? Or failing that, perhaps have a solicitor present.ACTRESS Paula Williamson wed “Britain’s most violent prisoner” Charles Bronson last November and said she looked forward to him getting out so they could enjoy a normal marriage.Yet just two months later he allegedly attacked the deputy governor of HMP Wakefield and now, just before appearing via video link at Leeds magistrates court, he tried to take his guards hostage in his cell.Hmmmm. Something tells me that – after spending 42 years inside – 65-year-old Charlie boy has become institutionalised and doesn’t actually want to come out, hence the litany of violent episodes that keep him in trouble and constantly embarrass his trusting wife.It gives a whole new meaning to the term blushing bride.NEW research shows that the ability to ward off fear and unhappiness is a skill that improves markedly with age.An American neuroscientist says the reaction of the old and the young to, say, the imminent results of an election were significantly different.That’s because, when you’ve seen a few governments come and go, we of a certain age eventually realise they’re all as useless as each other and whatever we say or do to try to change that has no effect at all.But if it turns out to be a France v England final, I may be heading home sooner than expected.FORMER Radio 1 DJ “Diddy” David Hamilton has weighed in to the #MeToo debate with his recollection of his Seventies heyday, saying: “We didn’t go around forcing ourselves on women.“It sounds conceited to say it but we didn’t have to because a lot of women were forcing themselves on us.”Meanwhile, Kinks frontman Sir Ray Davies reveals: “A world-famous groupie once threw me out because I was too kind.”A reminder, if needed, that not all men are b******s and not all women are innocent victims.And if further proof is required, look no further than some of the predatory females stalking their male prey on Love Island each night.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The driver of the car was a local man in his 60s and we are speaking to him about what happened.It was fortunate the man on the motorbike was wearing a helmet as his head hit the windscreen which smashed.His wife Amal, 40, rushed to hospital to be at his side and he was discharged just two hours later.Firefighters were dispatched to the scene of the accident as a safety precaution.Clooney was pictured stepping off a private jet with wife Amal and twins, Alexander and Ella, in Sardinia at the end of last month.Even earlier in June, Clooney was seen zipping around the island on a scooter with Amal, 40, hugging him tightly.The A-list couple are believed to have brought their parents to the island to help care for the children while George works.Clooney has been working hard on Catch 22, a six-episode mini-series based on the novel by Joseph Heller.In April, the legendary thespian announced he was cutting down his acting role in the Hulu production so he could focus on directing.George and Amal met back in 2013 when Amal attended a party at the Oceans Eleven stars house in Lake Como, Italy.It was from that moment George made it his mission to land Amal, later taking her on their first date at a plush London restaurant.She explained in an interview with Vogue: I was 35 when I met him. It wasn’t obvious that it was going to happen for me. And I wasn’t willing or excited about the idea of getting married or having a family in the absence of that.

which was presented to her by the Air Cadets when she took on patronage in 2015.She also wore a coat by Alexander McQueen, and a hat by Sean Barrett, with Meghan choosing to wear a dress by Dior and a hat by royal milliner Stephen Jones.And in keeping with the traditional blue of the RAF, the Queen wore a royal blue silk coat with a turquoise collar and dress in the same colour, both by Angela Kelly, with a matching hat and a diamond star brooch.The head of the RAF Air Chief Marshal Sir Stephen Hillier said: It is a tremendous coming together of a whole range of RAF capabilities, and a celebration of the quality of our people, and it is that connection between the Royal Air Force and her Majesty the Queen.Later the royals gathered on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to watch a vast array of more than 100 RAF aircraft roar and thunder across the skies of London.In their biggest ever formation, 22 Typhoon jets spelt out the number 100 in the sky - an added surprise for the royals, personnel and the throngs of public spectators who had packed out the streets to watch.The Queen spoke proudly not only as the RAFs Air Commodore-in-Chief, but also as a citizen who remembered the Battle of Britain, and as a daughter whose father King George VI served with the RAF.She said: Presenting the Royal Air Force with a new Queens Colour provides an opportunity to congratulate the service for your remarkable contribution to defence over the last 100 years.KATE Middleton has today worn a spectacular brooch - but it isnt just a fashion accessory.Instead, the large brooch signifies a huge honour, usually bestowed only on Air Cadets themselves.The brooch is said to be the highest honour that a female cadet can achieve.The Duchess of Cambridge had been gifted the beautiful diamond and ruby piece as a gift from the RAF when she became an Honorary Air Commandant in 2015.Tenacity, skill and gallantry have been your hallmarks as you helped safeguard freedom and security in many parts of the world.I remember the Battle of Britain being fought over the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.She also took the Royal Salute at the ceremony as her relatives watched nearby.It was 100 years ago on April 1 1918 that the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service merged to create the RAF -

It’s about celebrities improving their image.”Oh, but what record-breaking names they’d assembled.Robbie, Adele, Elton, Ed Sheeran, Coldplay and Stormzy, were just a few of those who didn’t attend.Blue, Coleen Nolan, Amber Davies, from last year’s Love Island, UB40, Kimberley Walsh and Tony Hadley, on the other hand, were all involved, as was JLS’s Aston Merrygold, right, who said, on behalf of the NHS, he was: “Happy to clear my diary.”So we thank him and whoever covered the shift at Domino’s.Job demarcation, though, among the celebs, was a bit vague. A few just seemed to have backing track duties, like Kimberley Walsh who was given the line “What would you do if I sang out of tune?” (IF?)Some were enrolled for the full, record-breaking, Abbey Road finale, while others went on recruitment drives at UK hospitals, where Tony unearthed “the singing ambulanceman”, and Sara set her sights on Debbie “who’s pouring custard on a spotted Dick” — in the staff canteen, rather than the Infectious Diseases Unit.Eulogies to the great NHS god, though, were compulsory and delivered with a glassy-eyed, lip-quivering intensity that has become a very familiar sight these past few months.Good intentions, as we know, though, pave the road to hell. And so it proved with Wednesday’s Big Singalong Live, which kicked off with a parp of a klaxon, from Ashley, and Sara screaming: “Can we now please break that record.”Perhaps we can put what followed down to the swirling p***storm, in North London, or the lack of practice time — they only had six weeks — but, dear Lord in heaven — Russell Crowe didn’t unleash this much hell in Gladiator.Missed cues, frozen screens, flat voices, Tony Hadley giving it the big ’un, on the Abbey Road zebra crossing, with his “woh-oh ohhhs”.Seven thousand drunk Millwall fans chanting: “You’re going home in a London ambulance” could not have been much less unco-ordinated, but would undoubtedly have delivered an equally powerful message about the NHS.Salvation, though, was on hand in the form of Sara Cox.“The results are in and . . . (drum roll).“We almost made it, but it looks like the weather may have rained on our parade. We didn’t break the record.” A MASTERCLASS in scheduling, editing and continuity, from Channel 5, on Thursday night, that began with the very chirpy announcement: “We’ll find out What Happened to Josef Fritzl after brand new Nando’s, A PERi PERi Big Success . . . ”Which isn’t the first thing I associate Josef with, to be perfectly honest with you.

And if you are a pioneer, you know all about worry.If something has been done before, you know it\u0027s possible. If you don\u0027t know something is possible, you worry about it.I\u0027m about to embark on a swim with significant risks and consequences - financial, reputational and environmental. So there hasn\u0027t been a night in the last month that I haven\u0027t woken up.A few nights ago I was using the worry hours to plan, and remembered something Mike Tyson once said: \"Everyone\u0027s got a plan until they get punched in the mouth.\" I have a plan to try and swim 10km per day. But when I swim into my first bloom of jellyfish, that plan will become flexible.I know that I\u0027m going to get sunburnt. I\u0027m going to be frozen, I\u0027m going to be stung, and I\u0027m going to become mentally and physically exhausted. Have I done too much preparation, or not enough?What if we get the tides wrong, get caught in a counter eddy and find ourselves going backwards? This is a notoriously dangerous coastline, with the shipwrecks to prove it.Did I mention that half my expedition team is new, and half has no sailing experience?Admiral Stockdale was an American pilot who was shot down in Vietnam and spent eight years in a POW camp. He said that the people who survived had two important qualities.First, they always believed they would be freed. Second - and this is the paradox - they had no optimism. Because the people who did have optimism - the people who hoped they would be free by Easter, then by Thanksgiving, then by Christmas, and had those hopes dashed over and over again - those people didn\u0027t survive. The people who survived were the ones who confronted the brutal reality of their situation.I have to face some brutal facts when I look at the chart of our 560km swim route. This is the longest swim anyone has ever done, adhering to Channel Rules in water this low temperature. I honestly don\u0027t know how I\u0027m going to do this. But I do believe I\u0027ll see the white cliffs of Dover. So that\u0027s the paradox that\u0027s going through my mind.The swimming is only part of the challenge. We\u0027ve also had to co-ordinate with sponsors, raise funds for the expedition, recruit the right people for the team, and deal with the media... all the while juggling private lives with unexpected domestic crises. As if all that wasn\u0027t enough, after six months of campaign planning and preparation, we learned that Donald Trump is coming to London on the day I start swimming. We certainly hadn\u0027t planned on such a big media story distracting from our message.Because the message is the reason I am doing this swim. The truth is we are failing our oceans. And it\u0027s only through bold and courageous action that we\u0027re going to be able to protect them properly. \"Piecemeal\" protection is not going to safeguard our seas. We need an enormous shift in business and government and the public to be able to do this.There are challenges ahead. But as English Channel crossing pioneer Captain Webb said, nothing great is ever easy.I\u0027ll keep that in mind as I strike out for Dover."},{"url":null,"title":"new health secretary matt hancock","story":"NewsNew Health Secretary Matt Hancock accepted £32,000 from boss of think tank that wants to scrap the NHSMr Hancock, 39, has accepted nine donations worth from pal Neil Record, chairman of the pro-privatisation Institute of Economic Affairs, according to official records\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew GregoryPolitical Editor22:58, 10 JUL 2018Updated08:01, 11 JUL 2018NewsHealth Secretary Matt Hancock accepted £32,000 over nine payments from an anti-NHS pal (Image: Getty Images Europe)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has accepted \u0026pound32,000 from the chairman of a think-tank which wants to scrap the NHS. He also took \u0026pound5,000 from the director of a private nursing firm which supplies agency workers to the health service. The donations will raise questions about the 39-year-old’s commitment to the NHS and could embroil him in a conflict of interest row. Theresa May promoted Mr Hancock from Culture Secretary to Health Secretary on Monday after predecessor Jeremy Hunt replaced Boris Johnson as Foreign Secretary. Shadow Health Minister Justin Madders said: “The NHS is our national treasure so it’s a disgrace that Theresa May has appointed a health secretary with links to organisations that want to break it up and sell it off.” Mr Hancock has accepted nine donations worth \u0026pound32,000 from Neil Record, chairman of the Institute of Economic Affairs, official records show. Mr Record, 65, was appointed chair in 2015 after seven years on its board.  The IEA’s head of health and welfare, Dr Kristian Niemietz, has called for the NHS to be privatised and replaced with a private insurance-based system.  Last week, on the 70th birthday of the NHS, the IEA described the service as an “international laggard”, adding that “it  is time to look to the social health insurance systems in Europe”.  Mr Hancock also accepted \u0026pound5,000 in March 2015 from Gurdev Dadral, the director of private nursing agency Swiis, a Mirror investigation found. Mr Dadral could not be reached for comment. There is no suggestion Mr Hancock has broken any rules. But Mr Madders said: “The new Health Secretary must urgently explain whether he still has links with private healthcare firms. “Our NHS is not for sale.” The Department of Health declined to comment tonight. A Government source did not deny the donations had been made but said any suggestion Mr Hancock was contemplating privatising or abolishing the NHS was “wholly wrong”.

We missed Harry Maguire’s opening goal, but we made it back in time to see Dele Alli head us into tomorrow night’s semi-final in Moscow.  The boys were so happy I thought they would burst. They were screaming, jumping on the sofas and hugging each other so much anyone would have thought they were in the winning team. What made the moment so poignant for me was the fact that Joshua’s friends are all from such diverse backgrounds – Ghana, India, Ireland, Spain, Portugal, England –and they were all united behind the national team. I was surprised to get WhatsApp messages from family in America telling me they are backing England all the way. And later that evening driving past an England fan waving a huge St George’s Flag in South London, my aunty insisted on rolling down the car window and shouting, “Come on, England” in her loudest Accra accent and beeping my car horn. “Yeah!” he screamed back.   This talented England team under manager Gareth Southgate have brought the country together in a way I’ve never seen before.  It made me think back to when I was my son’s age. Would I, aged 12, in the late 1980s ever have sat down with my friends to cheer on the England football team? No I wouldn’t.  Growing up in South London, I feared English football fans and the English flag they brandished so menacingly. The St George’s Cross was hijacked by extreme nationalist groups such as the BNP and National Front which used it as their emblem.  For me, my family and friends it signified that, to many people in this country, we weren’t welcome. My memory of English fans then was as drunken, rampaging yobs who felt it was acceptable to hurl vile racist abuse at their own players.  John Barnes has spoken about the abuse he faced on the pitch. The former England player, who had a banana thrown at him during a 1988 FA Cup tie at Everton, said: “Any black player of my generation had it. In 1984 with England in Brazil, I had it with the National Front. There wasn’t a game in the Eighties when you didn’t get racial abuse as a black player.”  "},{"url":null,"title":"ex rugby league star facing","story":"NewsEx-rugby league star facing jail after knocking child, 15, unconscious for \u0027bullying his son\u0027Vila Matautia, 48, reportedly threatened the boy by saying: \"If I find you\u0027ve done anything again I will cut you.\"\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByNeil Docking06:19, 11 JUL 2018NewsFormer Rugby player Vila Matautia outside Liverpool Crown Court.

Vila Matautia, 48, is believed to have launched the vicious attack after accusing the teen of bullying his young son, the Liverpool Echo reports.  The ex-Samoa international is a former St. Helen\u0027s prop who enjoyed a glittering career at the top of the sport - winning numerous titles during the 1990s and 2000s. Yesterday, Matautia admitted a sustained attack on a 15-year-old victim at Liverpool Crown Court. Matautia claimed he battered the child, who cannot be named for legal reasons, because he had been bullying his son.  Before he pleaded guilty to assault causing actual bodily harm, his barrister, Tom Watson, requested a Goodyear indication from Judge Steven Everett. This is an indication of the likely maximum sentence an offender will receive if they plead guilty - a legal deal that can prevent a trial from taking place. In response, Judge Everett asked prosecutors to outline the incident, which happened at around 4.35pm, on December 4 last year. Simon Duncan, prosecuting, said the victim was stood with friends behind the Golden Lion pub in Church Road in Rainford. He received a Snapchat message, purportedly from Matautia\u0027s son\u0027s account, asking where he was, but did not respond. Matautia walked down the side of the pub towards him and the boy, who did not know who Matautia was, asked are you alright? Mr Duncan said: The defendant didn\u0027t reply and just walked up to him and punched him in the face with his right hand. The punch knocked him, he said, unconscious at that point, however, he regained consciousness to some degree and was aware that the defendant had continued to punch him around five times. The boy said Matautia stood over him and said you\u0027re a bully and when he asked what he had done, replied: If I find you\u0027ve done anything again I will cut you.

Spain is widely known to be a safe country to enjoy a summer trip to. But while most visits are problem free, recently there have been a few incidents that could cause tourists to worry. Football fans have committed public order offences during the World Cup and there was a recent shooting in Benidorm, reports the Liverpool Echo . Here is a list of things the Government is warning people to look out for to ensure a safe trip. Street crime Holiday goers should be alert to the existence of street crime, especially thieves using distraction techniques. Thieves often work in teams of two or more people and tend to target money and passports.  Don’t carry all your valuables in one place, and remember to keep a photocopy or scanned copy of your passport somewhere safe. Many people have their passports stolen while passing through airports, either on arrival in or departure from Spain. Take extra care to guard passports, money and personal belongings when collecting or checking in luggage at the airport, and while arranging car hire. There has been an increase in the number of thefts from hire cars. Remove all valuables from the vehicle when you park or store items out of sight. In some city centres and resorts, thieves posing as police officers may approach tourists and ask to see their wallets for identification purposes. If this happens to you, establish that the officers are genuine and if necessary show some other form of ID.  Genuine police officers don’t ask to see wallets or purses. In any emergency, call 112. To report a crime, including stolen property and lost or stolen passports, visit the nearest Policia Nacional, regional police (Ertzaintza in the Basque Country, Mossos d’Esquadra in Catalonia, and Policia Foral in Navarre) or Guardia Civil Station to file a police report (denuncia). While in Spain, you can also call a dedicated English-speaking police line on +34 90 210 2112.  World Cup Following public order incidents after televised England matches in Benidorm, fans watching England\u0027s semi final clash with Croatia are being advised to xercise caution around the vicinity of Rinc\u0026oacuten Loix. If you’re in the area, you should follow the instructions and advice of the local authorities strict controls on drinking alcohol in the street are in force and anti-social behaviour may lead to prosecution. Attacks Personal attacks, including sexual assaults, are rare but they do occur, and are often carried out by other British nationals. Be alert to the possibility of ‘date rape’ drugs and other drugs including ‘GHB’ and liquid ecstasy. Buy your own drinks and keep sight of them at all times to make sure they aren’t spiked.  Burglaries There has been an increase in reports of burglaries in areas with holiday accommodation and residential areas in major cities. Make sure your accommodation has adequate security measures in place and lock all doors and windows at night or when you aren’t in.  Driving When driving, be wary of approaches by bogus police officers in plain clothes travelling in unmarked cars. In all traffic-related matters, police officers will be in uniform, and all police officers, including those in plain clothes, carry official ID. Unmarked police vehicles have a flashing electronic sign on the rear window which reads Polic\u0026iacutea (Police) or Guardia Civil (Civil Guard), and normally have blue flashing lights. Genuine police officers will only ask you to show them your documents and will not ask for your bag or wallet/purse. If in any doubt, you should talk through the car window and contact the Civil Guard on 062 or Police on 112 and ask them to confirm that the registration number of the vehicle corresponds to an official police vehicle.  Also be aware of ‘highway pirates’ who target foreign-registered and hire cars, especially those towing caravans. Some will (forcefully) try to make you stop, claiming there is something wrong with your car or that you have damaged theirs. If you decide to stop to check the condition of your/their vehicle, stop in a public area with lights like a service station, and be extremely wary of anyone offering help. Only use officially registered or licensed taxis. Lottery scams There have been reports of lottery scams in Spain. A person receives what appears to be official notification from the Spanish Inland Revenue office (Hacienda) that they’ve won the Spanish lottery and should deposit money in a bank account to receive their winnings. It’s likely to be a scam if you haven’t entered a lottery, you’re asked to pay anything up-front and the contact telephone number is for a mobile phone.  Balcony falls There have been a number of very serious accidents (some fatal) as a result of falls from balconies. Many of these incidents have involved British nationals under the influence of drink or drugs. Your travel insurance may not cover you for incidents that take place while you’re under the influence of drink or drugs. Some local councils will impose fines to those caught behaving irresponsibly on balconies or practising ‘balconing’.  Outdoor activities Take care when swimming in the sea as some beaches, especially around Spanish Islands, may have strong undercurrents. Most of them have a flag system but before swimming, make sure you understand the system and follow any warnings (a red flag means you mustn’t enter the water). You should take extra care if there are no life-guards, flags or signs and follow local advice if jellyfish are present. You should avoid swimming at beaches that are close to rivers and don’t dive into unknown water as hidden rocks or shallow depths can cause serious injury or death. Take care when walking along unmanned beaches close to the water’s edge as some waves can be of an unpredictable size and come in further than expected with strong undertows. Further tips can be found on ABTA’s swim safe pages.  Take extra care when planning a hike or walk to check local weather reports for warnings of extreme heat or cold temperatures. The Catalonia region has started billing negligent climbers, skiers and other adventurers who have to be rescued. Crossing between Spain and Gibraltar Spanish border checks can cause delays when crossing between Spain and Gibraltar. There is no charge to enter or leave Gibraltar. Don’t hand over money if you’re approached by anyone claiming that there is a charge. Road travel Driving rules and customs are different from those in the UK and the accident rate is higher, especially on motorways. You must carry two red warning triangles which should be placed, in the event of an accident or breakdown, in front of and behind the vehicle. You must have a spare wheel and the tools to change it. If at any time you have to leave your vehicle due to an accident or breakdown or while waiting for the arrival of the emergency services, you must wear a reflective vest or you may face a heavy fine.

And according to a study, 42% of us have also slept with bedroom windows wide open during the last two weeks. The study was carried out by a British mattress brand, in a bid to discover more about the UK’s sleeping habits during this unusual stretch of warm tempreatures. The poll found that most people have switched their duvet for something lighter for a more comfortable night’s rest and one in five have slept apart from their partner at least once to try and stay cool.  www.Ergoflex asked a total of 2,133 about their sleep patterns since the June 25 when the heatwave really began. The overwhelming majority, 88%, of the people taking part in the survey said that they had lost sleep due to the heatwave. And when asked to estimate how much they had lost since the start of June, the average answer was revealed to be 45 minutes per night, per person 10 hours and 30 minutes in total. More than two fifths of the respondents taking part in the poll confessed that they had slept with their bedroom windows wide open for the majority of nights over the past two weeks, posing a risk to home security. Steve Willis from www.Ergoflex said: “As much as we all love the fact that we’re actually getting a proper summer for a change, there’s no hiding the fact that this country just isn’t cut out for lasting hot weather and it’s clear that our sleep suffers badly as a result.

The nightmare homes are being featured now after the sordid conditions that Catherine Purcell, 68, was kept in became public for the first time.  Shocking photos showing how Ms Purcell lived were part of a trial against her husband and daughter.  The court heard how Catherine died in a cesspit of her own faeces and bodily fluid which chemically destroyed her mattress and bed base, reports the Liverpool Echo.  Husband John Purcell, 72, and daughter Catherine Purcell junior, 35, were cleared of her manslaughter on July 5, at Liverpool Crown Court.  However they were found guilty of neglecting the disabled great-gran, who died while being eaten alive. A High Court judge handed him 18 months in prison, and Catherine Purcell jnr 12 months in prison, both suspended for two years. Graphic images showed the conditions of her home in the Merseyside town of Kirkby. But the Purcell\u0027s rancid property is just one of a number of house of horrors on Merseyside. Here is a look inside six other Merseyside homes and what officials were met with when their doors were opened.  Children forced to live in squalor  These graphic photos reveal a Wirral house of horrors where two children were forced to live in squalor. The alcoholic parents of the children, aged just three and six, were convicted of neglect in 2015 after police uncovered the faeces-littered hovel. The graphic photos reveal soiled linen, pillows and mattresses, dirty dishes piled high in the grubby kitchen and floors covered in rubbish.  Police were appalled after finding a bucket of stale urine in the kitchen, as well as what appeared to be faeces in an upstairs bedroom. Soiled nappies were left lying around the house and stale food had created a haven for germs to breed. The children were taken away from their parents, who cannot be named, after the intervention of social services. Describing the home as filthy and appalling, Judge Dennis Watson, QC, said: This was not something that occurred over night. This was something that developed and became the norm over a period of some months.  Real life Shameless family  This is the home of Ormskirk\u0027s real-life Shameless family who used their bath as a toilet. David Fyles was booted out of his council home in Lea Crescent in 2016 after town hall officers uncovered the house of horrors.  A bath was being used as a makeshift lavatory, because the actual toilet was blocked up with rubbish and mouldy food and piles of rubbish were strewn throughout the three-bedroom home. Doors were smashed off their hinges and neighbours reported how foul smells from the property emanated across the town\u0027s Scott Estate.  Rotting corpse found upstairs  A rotting corpse was discovered in a squalid Merseyside home from hell by health officers who joked: Have you got a dead body upstairs? Police and council officials were called to the house in Knowsley after locals raised concerns because the windows were covered in dead flies. They entered the rancid home to be confronted by an overbearing stench and saw an upstairs doorway surrounded by thousands of the insects.  The body of a man, the son of the homeowners, was found upstairs. Police arrested his sister and his parents on suspicion of concealing a body but charges were never brought. His sister, a mum-of-two, was later convicted of neglect as her two young children frequently stayed at her parents’ hovel home and were“exposed to risk of illness”. The woman was handed an 18-month community order.  Judge Stephen Everett said the punishment would have been sterner had police delays not impeded the case. He added: We will never know in the days or weeks following your brother’s death why nobody did anything.    Terrified dogs left in \u0027unbelievable conditions\u0027   Four dogs, one with a broken leg, were found in a sweltering property in Upton. Woody along with his brother, Duncan, and parents, Patch and Lucy, were found in conditions RSCPA inspector Anthony Joynes described as a house of horrors. The dogs were seized by the RSPCA after concerns were raised over their welfare.    The house had oil heaters turned on full blast, had no carpets, holes in the floor and was cluttered with piles of clothing.   Playground for rats and flies  A Toxteth man hoarded so much junk that his house became a playground for rats and flies. Bill Berry, 55, could not move around his house which was filled to the brim with years of takeaway boxes, newspapers and rubbish. He was eventually unable to get upstairs so ended up sleeping on the sofa. Bill told the ECHO about his ordeal after beating his disorder with help from Liverpool Housing Trust (LHT). He told how his hoarding began after he suffered with depression from being bullied and unhappy at work.   Dogs left to die in agony  Owner Andrew Davies failed to tell anyone her ‘Labradoodle’ cross-breeds, named Koda and Hachi, were in her former property, in Walton, after she moved in with her mum and sister. RSPCA Inspector Helen Smith, called to the house by the landlord on August 8, 2016, was confronted by a grim scene. She found the bodies of the dogs, who were brothers, decomposing in the kitchen of the filthy property – next to empty water bowls.

He was moaning about Britain\u0027s racially diverse society before stating the England football team \u0027doesn\u0027t represent him\u0027. He told the Daily Mirror\u0027s Associate Editor Kevin Maguire, who was hosting the talk show, In fact, it represents everything I\u0027m against.  Shockingly the man said: When you are talking about the subject of race, it goes a lot deeper than skin colour. If you turn the average black man instantly white, you\u0027d still be able to recognise him as a black man. That\u0027s about race, not colour. But Kevin was not standing for the man\u0027s rant.  What\u0027s wrong with you? he asked. So do you want England to lose today? And after Ian replied yes, Kevin added: What, because you\u0027re so obsessed by race and your bigotry, and your prejudice is so poisonous you want England to lose? I just hate seeing my country destroyed by multiracialism and anything that represents multiracialism, Ian replied.  Kevin gave Ian some advice before ending the conversation. I\u0027d just go and make yourself a nice cup of tea, take it into a darkened room, get a bag of frozen peas from the freezer and put them on your head, and just reflect on what you\u0027re saying. The England team, who play in the World Cup semi-final tomorrow night against Croatia, have been widely praised.

You embody the energy which characterises this amazing country. “I have the greatest confidence the friendship, collaboration and mutual understanding that our two countries have built up over the years will endure and it will grow. “I will finish by drawing on the words of President Higgins during his extraordinarily successful visit to the UK in 2014 for which we still remember with admiration. He quoted the traditional Irish saying ‘We live in each other’s shadows. We shield each other and rely on each other for shelter.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"meghan markles visit dublin five","story":"NewsMeghan Markle\u0027s visit to Dublin five years ago was for a very different reason - and involved €2 drinksWill Meghan take Harry back to Dicey\u0027s Garden where she promoted €2 drink in 2013?

But it\u0027s not the first time the former actress has visited the area - and in 2013 she appeared to enjoy quite the trip to promote \u0026pound1.77 drinks. Five years ago, when Meghan and Harry were not even aware of each other\u0027s existence, she was starring in the American drama series, Suits, as character Rachel Zane. And along with pals she visited Dublin\u0027s Dicey\u0027s Garden, which describes itself as the most popular venue this side of town, and boasts drinks for just €2 (\u0026pound1.77). She posted to her fans: Dublin, you are beyond lovely. Having the best day and excited for a night @diceysgarden and @krystlenightclub xoxo.  The now Duchess of Sussex then continued the evening at Krystle nightclub, overlooking Dicey\u0027s Garden. But it\u0027s probably very different to where Meghan will be visiting during this week\u0027s trip. Dicey\u0027s Garden has mixed reviews, as well as a 3.5 rating on Trip Advisor, with 35 per cent rating it \u0027excellent\u0027, while 23 per cent branding it \u0027terrible.\u0027 I would recommend to wear shoes you don’t mind getting ruined as you stick to the floor, one reviewer wrote last month. Another added two weeks ago: The state of bathrooms was horrific, all blocked and staff didn’t seem to care when I complained about it. Most toilets blocked throughout the whole evening despite receptionist’s promises that maintenance staff was on the way.  However, in contrast one woman said: Great place! The place was amazing, great vibe and very nice architecture. Music not too bad either! Ps. They have drinks for 2€ and free entry before 7pm. And back in 2013 Meghan seemed to be in agreement. Following her trip this week the tweet has resurfaced and fans are loving it. Meghan has since deleted her Twitter account, but a number of replies to the original tweet are still on the social media platform, which seemingly verify it as genuine. One fan said: Can we all take a moment for the fact that the last time Meghan Markle was in Dublin she was slinging €2 drinks in Diceys. Never forget. Will Meghan take Harry back to reminisce with a €2 cocktail? Probably not if their packed agenda is anything to go by.  The trip signals the start of their first overseas trip as a married couple, and the Duchess emerged wearing an outfit by her designer of the moment, Givenchy. Waiting to greet the royal couple today were Britain\u0027s Ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett and his partner Agnieszka Kepka. The newlyweds will get a taste of Irish life and learn more about Ireland\u0027s rich history. They will also attend a summer garden party at the British Ambassador Robin Barnett\u0027s residence, where they will meet people from across Ireland\u0027s arts, sports, military and social enterprise sectors.  Their Royal Highnesses will attend the Gaelic sports festival at the Gaelic Athletic Association\u0027s home of Croke Park and head to Trinity College, where they will see the Book of Kells, one of Ireland\u0027s greatest cultural treasures - not to mention it\u0027s tipped as one of the best things to see and do in Dublin .

Like distraught dad Kevin Webster, I too had never heard of the deadly disease until my daughter Lola developed the condition at just two days old, and our world was turned upside down. I’d had the perfect pregnancy and everything seemed to be going to plan, including going into labour on my due date. The hospital I was supposed to have her at was full, so in a no-room-at-the-inn-style drama, my midwife had to ring round to find a hospital that could take us. We made it to the delivery suite at Fairfield General Hospital in Bury, Greater Manchester with only 30 minutes to spare before Lola arrived into the world – a perfectly healthy 7lb 1oz bundle of joy. But two days later, I knew there was something terribly wrong with my baby.  She was burning up and yelped in pain like a little cat when I picked her up. Worried, I asked one of the doctors to look at her, but he tried to reassure me saying I had probably just over-wrapped her and she had colic. But, as a second-time mum, I knew instinctively he was wrong. My one-year-old, Gracie (now 13) had suffered from colic, and this was different. Lola wasn’t too hot because I had her wrapped up – she definitely had a temperature.  So, when a junior doctor popped into our room, I told her my fears and demanded a second opinion. Thank God I did. She got a more senior doctor to take a look and he immediately ordered a lumbar puncture. I remember asking him if he thought my baby had meningitis , and the horror when he said yes. It was like someone had stabbed me in the heart. They scooped my baby from my arms and took her away for the painful procedure to see what was making her ill. At that age, babies are too young for pain relief. Instead, a nurse drip-fed her sugar water to distract her as a doctor drew fluid from her spinal column to test for infection.  I was alone on the maternity ward, desperately trying to phone my husband while listening to other mums coo over their healthy babies. It was the longest hour of my life. Lola was admitted to the special care baby unit, where doctors pumped her tiny veins with antibiotics and antiviral drugs to fight the infection, while they desperately tried to pinpoint what it was. Some of the drugs were so strong I had to sign consent forms and was warned that they may leave her with permanent hearing problems. But I didn’t care – I wanted them to do whatever it took to save my baby’s life. Test after test came back negative – the doctors couldn’t find out what was making Lola so sick. So they just continued with the drugs, as I spent every waking hour at her bedside. As the veins in her tiny hands gave up, they started using the veins in her feet. When they had used all those, they then wanted to use the veins in her head. I refused, and sat for hours holding the tiny cannula into her foot to deliver the last scraps of antibiotic. When they wanted to put another needle into her stomach to take a urine sample, I held her over a tiny potty for hours until she passed water. I didn’t want my baby to have any more needles put into her unless it was really necessary. Our priest came to the hospital to bless Lola. He offered to christen her there and then in case she didn’t make it but we declined, refusing to believe that our baby would die.

The Duke of Sussex didn\u0027t seem to mind that he was offending the heir to the throne as he spoke in front of dozens gathered at Glencairn. Prince Charles recently visited Cork and this week Harry and wife Meghan have embarked on their first official overseas royal engagement as a married couple. They will spend two days following a packed itinerary exploring Ireland\u0027s capital. And the pair could not stop smiling as they stepped out hand-in-hand for the evening occasion.   Meghan wore a stunning black sleeveless dress by New Zealand designer Emilia Wickstead, her third outfit of the day. She also swapped her chic bun up-do for loose curls.  She opted for black stiletto pump heels by Aquazzura Deneuve which retail for $750. And to finish the look she held a Givenchy black satin clutch. Before Harry began his speech, the couple sipped on champagne. He started by saying how grateful they were for the warm welcome they had received in Ireland and gushed about his family\u0027s love of the country. As well as throwing in a few jokes, the one that got onlookers laughing the most was about Harry\u0027s father, Charles.

So we are very grateful for you for joining us here this evening as well. And also very nice to know he didn’t bore you senseless, added Harry which left guests giggling, and will no doubt leave his father smiling as well. Harry followed by saying: “My father was telling us just last week how much he had enjoyed his recent visit and said that each of his visits over the years holds a special place in his memory. “My grandmother the Queen also spoke of her own visit in 2011 and the fantastic welcome that she too received.

Ace O’Driscoll said: “I asked him ‘so, is football coming home?’ “But he refused to say it. “I think he just said he isn’t as confident as everyone else about England winning tomorrow. “He said he won’t say it because he doesn’t want to jinx it.”   Cheeky Harry also made a dig at the Prince of Wales as he stood on stage with Meghan by his side, while thanking the audience for attending.

He thanked the newlyweds for making the trip to Ireland as their first official overseas trip, adding: “We thank you. Perhaps there is romance in our summer air.”  The trip is the latest in a series of foreign visits the royal family have made to EU member states in the wake of Brexit , as part of a “charm offensive” to renew relationships with countries as Britain prepares for Brexit.   Glencairn House is the official residence of the British Ambassador to Ireland and has been the home to successive ambassadors since the 1950s. The house is located in the southern suburbs of Dublin, on the Murphystown Road in the Leopardstown area.

Ellie Campbell, who was in her first year of studying psychology, headed out for the evening with a group of friends from her halls of residence on Friday, January 26, an inquest heard.  The group from Canterbury Christ Church University visited a number of bars, including a Wetherspoon pub and The Jolly Sailor before moving onto Club Chemistry.  An inquest into the teenager’s death held at Archbishop’s Palace yesterday heard how Ellie went outside the nightclub at around 1.30am on January 27 and told her friend she wanted to leave, reports KentLive .  The 18-year-old, originally from Basildon in Essex, then returned to her accommodation at St George’s Centre at around 2am.  Det Sgt Nicky Holland-Day said: “She said she was not feeling very well and was going back to the halls. “She had drank a mojito pitcher and four double vodkas through the night. She was described as sobering up but a bit down. “Ellie had her friend’s phone in her bag. They tried to call her but couldn’t hear if the call connected because of the noise in the club. “The girls would normally go home together so this was unusual.” DS Holland-Day explained how Ellie had greeted one of the security guards at the halls with a hug instead of her “usual fist bump” but they noticed “nothing to alert them”. Ellie’s friend arrived back at the halls at around 2.30am and knocked on her fourth floor room door to retrieve her phone but there was no answer and it was locked. The friend fetched security and they gained access to the room where Ellie was found hanging in the shower room. Eight paramedics rushed to the scene to help Ellie before she was taken to the William Harvey Hospital in Ashford in a critical condition. Sadly, a CT scan later revealed that her brain activity was “incompatible with life” and the heartbreaking decision to remove her support was made.

DS Holland-Day added: “There was no note and no indication she was considering suicide. Her mood had changed from a bubbly one to a sombre one. “But I am unable to determine why this popular young girl would end her life. It’s devastating. “The case is unusual.

Talitha Beales, 19, started screaming hysterically one year ago today when she saw the infant - umbilical cord still attached - on the concrete floor of a bus shelter in Towyn, in north Wales. The mother of the baby never came forward despite repeated appeals by North Wales Police and Conwy county council, reports the Daily Post . The little girl was put into foster care and Talitha, who does not even know her name, thinks about her every day.  Talitha has revealed how much she’d love to know she is doing after admitting she and her family were told nothing about the child’s progress after she was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. The 19-year-old said: “After the baby was taken away in the ambulance, we never saw her again. “We were desperate for information about how she was doing. We just wanted to know she was OK. “My dad really wanted to go in and see her, even just to give her a teddy, but we weren’t allowed. “I’d love to know her first name and that she’s in a happy home. “I do think about her a lot. “I’m just glad we found her when we did because she came very close to dying.”  Talitha was being driven home to Stoke-on-Trent after spending time in North Wales with her dad, Daniel Braxton when she made the grim discovery. She said: “I remember every detail about the day like it was yesterday. “It’s something I will never forget. “As dad drove past the bus stop, I saw the baby covered in blood, it still had the umbilical cord attached and I thought it was dead. “I told my dad to stop the car, he thought it was a prank and carried on, but I started screaming my head off hysterically until he stopped and turned back. “I stayed in the car because I didn’t want to look. My dad was reluctant at first, he thought it was a doll or a sick joke until he realised it was a real baby. “She was cold and lifeless and my dad ran to get a dressing gown from the car to wrap around her after calling for help.  “The ambulance and police came and taped the area off. “We have always wondered about her ever since.” Speaking to the Daily Post at the time, Daniel said: “She (the baby) was a fair size, I’d say probably around the seven pound mark. “She was not tiny, but definitely newborn as she still had the umbilical cord on. “I gave her a few hard rubs on her chest to see if there was any life in her, and at that point she gave a big gasp and opened her eyes.” He added: “As I waited for the ambulance I was just cuddling her, telling her everything was going to be all right.

Bernd Grotsch, 47, was found dead at his home in the heart of the jungle on the notorious island of Koh Tao on June 17. The German had recently returned to the island \u0027to tie up some loose ends\u0027 with his 20-year-old motorbike rental business. His family, who described him as \u0027fit\u0027 and \u0027healthy\u0027, claim authorities told them he died of “heart failure” or had been “bitten by a snake”. But they say they haven\u0027t received an autopsy report and believe there is something more sinister behind his death.  The family, from Ingolstadt, Germany, have also complained about his body being sent to the same Bangkok hospital that carried out botched reports on the bodies of Hannah Witheridge and David Miller. The pair were murdered on the same island in 2014. Experts across the world slammed the DNA testing done by the hospital at the time - amid claims it was tampered with in order to scapegoat two Burmese workers currently on death row over the killings. Mr Grotsch\u0027s cousin Christina told The Sun the were no explanation for the death of the dad at his home in Mae Haad. She said: He was fit, healthy and happy. We do not trust the authorities in Thailand, especially since there are some oddities.  To date, no autopsy results have been obtained, only vague explanations and conjectures about an alleged deadly bite by a poisonous snake. Or heart and circulatory failure, without further evidence. Christina claimed the family were initially told Mr Grotsch\u0027s body had been returned to the mainland in Surat Thani. But when they checked again it was still in a temple on Koh Tao. They allegedly put pressure on the German Embassy in Bangkok, and eventually the body was moved three days later. They family had wanted forensic scientist Dr Pornthip Rojanasunand to perform the autopsy as she is seen worldwide as a respected independent forensic physician, according to the newspaper.  However, his body was instead taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine, which is where the bodies of Miss Witheridge and Mr Miller were taken. Wealthy entrepreneur Mr Grotsch had moved to the island two decades ago, but left in 2016. He started another business on the island of Koh Phayam, before returning earlier this year to tie up loose ends. He had recently split from wife and Koh Tao native, Oey, with whom he has a seven-year-old daughter, Bene. Mr Grotsch is the tenth known foreigner to die in suspicious circumstances on the \u0027death island\u0027 in just six years. Below, we look at the previous cases. 2012 Brit Ben Harrington , 32, died on the island after his motorbike apparently crashed into an electricity pylon.  His mother Pat Harrington did not accept the explanation by Thai police and has spent years fighting for information from the Thai authorities about her son\u0027s death, including submitting Freedom of Information requests to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Mrs Harrington said she is suspicious of the explanation and had to fight to prevent his body being quickly cremated: [Thai authorities] wanted to cremate Ben the next day, but I screamed and shouted and it was stopped. I had awful problems getting anyone on the phone at first. 2014 Brits Hannah Witheridge and David Miller were murdered as they walked back to their hotel rooms in September 2014. Hannah, 23, from Hemsby, Norfolk, and David Miller, 24, from Jersey, were found dead on Koh Tao on September 15.  Post-mortem examinations showed that the young backpackers, who had met on the island while staying at the same hotel, both suffered head wounds and that Hannah had been raped. Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo were sentenced to death for the killings. But although David\u0027s family called the verdict \u0027justice\u0027, the trial of the two Burmese migrant workers was plagued by accusations of human rights abuses. Nick Pearson , 25, from Derby, was found floating in the sea on New Year\u0027s Day 2014.  His parents believe he was murdered - despite police claims he fell 50ft and drowned. The 25-year-old\u0027s mum Tracey told a documentary about the island she would warn parents not to allow their children to travel to the island. 2015 Christina Annesley , 23, died on the island in January 2015 after apparently mixing antibiotics she was taking for a chest infection with alcohol. But the British holidaymaker\u0027s parents slammed Thai authorities for failing to investigate the death.  Christina, from Orpington, South East London, died shortly after arriving on Koh Tao. Her dad Boyne said a toxicology report was not carried out. Frenchman Dimitri Povse , 29, was found hanged in a bungalow on the island on New Year\u0027s Day 2015 and his death was ruled as suicide despite his hands being tied behind his back. Associate Professor Charnkanit Krittiya Suriyamanee, a criminologist and lecturer at the faculty of social science and humanities of Mahidol University, said he doubted the suicide theory citing some irrelevant evidences, according to Chiangrai Times .  He said that the victim had been drunk to the extent that he was unable to control himself, he would not have been able to tie himself up so tightly that he died of suffocation. He also noted several other odd finds. 2016 Luke Miller, a bricklayer from the Isle of Wight, was found dead in a swimming pool at the Sunset Bar at Sairee Beach on January 8 2016, with an inquest earlier this month finding no evidence he was murdered. He was discovered floating in the water by a member of hotel staff, with his death coming just days after a tragic final Facebook post on New Year\u0027s Eve, in which he said: Can honestly say this new year I am living the dream.  Thai police said a post-mortem examination showed he drowned. But, his sister Maria and the family told the BBC they would not rely on what Thai police said as there was still speculation over the circumstances surrounding the death - and that they had received \u0027different versions\u0027 of what might have happened. 2017 Belgian Elise Dallemagne was found dead and half-eaten by lizards having apparently hanged herself on the island - an explanation rejected by her family. The young backpacker had been living at a yoga and tantra retreat, which neighboured the party island of Koh Phangan, in between travelling round Asia, for two years. She was part of the sect of the Sathya Sai Baba cult movement, and lived with a self-proclaimed guru, and left Koh Phangan on April 17 to return home.  Elise then used a fake name of Elise Dubuis to check into the Triple B Bungalows next to Mae Head Pier on Koh Tao as she travelled via the island on a ferry bound for Chumphon province on her route back to capital Bangkok. But an unexplained fire that evening burned down three bamboo huts - including the one Elise had been staying in. Elise fled 2.5km to through the jungle to Tanote Bay and took a room at the Poseidon Resort where she booked another ticket for Bangkok leaving on April 24. Eight days later when locals living near the island\u0027s idyllic Tanote Bay became suspicious of a monitor lizard going back and fourth into the jungle they discovered Elise\u0027s half-eaten body on May 27 among rocks behind the Tanote Family Bay Resort.

The Duchess of Sussex and husband Prince Harry are in Dublin for their first foreign trip as a married couple.  But just hours into their two-day visit they ran into a spot of bother.  Irish politician Catherine Noone posted on Facebook suggesting Meghan had agreed with the country\u0027s recent referendum result in favour of legalising abortion.  The senator said: A pleasure to meet Prince Harry and the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. The Duchess and I had a chat about the recent referendum result - she watched with interest and was pleased to see the result.  The comments suggest that Meghan may have broken royal protocol by expressing political opinon. Since the 17th century, members of the British monarchy have been banned from doing just that, which includes voting. From an early age, former Suits star Meghan was politically active. Aged just 11 she successfully campaigned to have a washing detergent advert\u0027s sexist language changed. She also said in 2016 she would move to Canada if misogynistic Donald Trump was elected US president.    Senator Noone\u0027s comments were quickly removed and a later tweet simply read: A pleasure to meet Prince Harry \u0026amp the Duchess of Sussex at the British Ambassador\u0027s Residence this evening. Posting a screenshot of her first post, Luke Silke tweeted: The Queen will be cross! He added that Prince Harry is in for an almighty dressing down when they go home.  Daily Mirror royal correspondent Russell Myers tweeted: Astonishing candidness from @  senatornoone  The senator, who chaired the parliamentary committee on abortion, replied: I clarified - it was a very benign chat, she expressed no political opinion.

Sara Zagidullina, 17, was attacked by Aleksandra Dulesova and three other young women when they discovered she was seeing a boy identified only as “Igor”, according to police. The shocking ordeal began when the perpetrators broke into Sara\u0027s home, reportedly shaving her head, then forcing her to perform oral sex on them before taking turns urinating on her. After dragging the naked young woman to the bathroom, they allegedly turned the water as hot as possible, inserting the shower hose into her vagina.  Shakira Pellow: \u0027Awful\u0027 final picture of schoolgirl in hospital bed her family want you to see   Police say the ordeal, which lasted for hours, could have killed Sara, who was left in agony on the bathroom floor, while the attackers ransacked her home, stealing money, a laptop and a mobile phone as well as other valuables. Using her last bit of strength, the victim managed to raise the alarm, and was rushed to hospital. There, doctors sadly confirmed that her womb had been badly damaged by the hot water and that she was now sterile.  The incident happened in central Russia\u0027s Perm Krai region in the town of Gubakha after Igor allegedly dumped 17-year-old Aleksandra after she told him she was pregnant. He is then believed to have started a new relationship with Sara, who knew nothing about his past until she was confronted by the angry ex. Aleksandra reportedly warned her victim with the ominous phrase: Leave us alone or I will kill and bury you!  She then gathered her friends Kristina Poyarkova, 16, Maria Sheputaeva, 16, and Anastasia Voronchikhina, 20, allegedly bursting into the victim’s flat where they subjected her to the terrifying torture ordeal. Three of the attackers have been arrested and taken into custody, while Aleksandra is under house arrest due to her pregnancy. The four suspects filmed Sara\u0027s torture on their phones and police have found the video, according to reports. All have been charged with sexual abuse and torture of a minor committed by a gang and could face up to 15 years in prison if found guilty.

He was always the same nice lad.“I think that was one of the strengths of the Dundee team that won the championship – we were all good friends. There were no cliques in the dressing-room and none of us let our success go to our heads.“I remember when Alan was at Spurs and I was manager at Hearts, we played them in a friendly. He was a big star, but he was exactly the same as he was when we were at Dens.”“Gillie” scored a club record 169 goals in 190 appearances in dark blue and, after leaving for London in 1964, went on to earn similar legendary status at White Hart Lane, where he formed lethal striking partnerships with Jimmy Greaves and Martin Chivers. None of that came as a surprise to Seith, who rates him as one of the best ever.He said: “Alan was exceptional and a great header of the ball. His timing in the air was the thing and when he jumped he seemed to hang in the air. We knew that if we could get the ball to his head he would score goals.“At Dundee he had a fine partnership with Alan Cousin and he would have been the first to say Alan Cousin’s donkey work was responsible for him scoring as many goals as he did.“With Alan, though, it was not just about his heading, he had two very good feet as well. In fact, I was never sure whether he was left or right-footed.“He had the knack of being in the right place at the right time. He always seems to know where to be, that’s why he scored so many goals.”Former Dundee director and long-time friend, Dave Forbes, also paid tribute. Organiser of a number of events down the years to honour the 1961/62 team, he knew Gillie well.He said: “I knew he wasn’t well and I’m just glad it all seems to have been quite quick and he didn’t suffer for too long.”Particularly after spending 10 years in the limelight at Spurs, where he was dubbed the King of White Hart Lane, Gilzean was famous for valuing his privacy.For a long time after he retired, the native of Coupar Angus did not make many public appearances but, over the past decade or so, was a familiar figure at White Hart Lane on match days and made regular visits back to Dundee.“Gillie was a private man, but he was a gentleman.“I remember when we were organising Dundee’s centenary celebrations he was a big help,” added Forbes.“I am proud, honoured and privileged to have known him as a good friend.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/5b44846f6daa4-752x564.jpg ","title":"bbc radio 4 listening project broadcasts from dundee this week","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA radio project which is collecting stories from the public is being hosted by the city’s Verdant Works all this weekThe award-winning former jute mill at West Henderson’s Wynd, now a popular visitor attraction, is temporarily home to BBC Radio 4’s The Listening Project from 10am-5pm until Friday and local residents are being invited to stop off and make their own contributions.A mobile unit is parked at Verdant Works, where the public can share their stories on life, moments, memories and people – whatever they choose.By taking part they will also be creating history.

I love being able to tell the customer that the owners actually made the gift they are buying.”When it comes to working in retail Hannah says the most important thing is how you communicate with customers.She said: “The whole concept of the shop is to give customers that personal touch.“The most important part of that is how we interact with our customers.“The first thing you learn when you start work in the shop is everything else stops when a customer comes in and they become the most important thing.“We always say the staff in here love a chat but there is nothing better than a customer saying they have had a great experience in your store.“I really enjoying being able to serve someone well as that is what they will go and tell friends and family about and recommend the store to them.“You have to be approachable when working in retail and confident and comfortable speaking to people.“Confidence is something I have had to work on throughout my career, but it is something I would urge anyone interested in retail to work on too.”Although Hannah climbed up the retail ladder through working in several shops, there are many courses on offer in Dundee.Dundee and Angus College offer several in both retail and retail management.These include Introduction to Fashion Retailing where students get hands-on experience working within the college’s gift shop.HNC Retail sees students gaining a broad knowledge of the retail industry and the skills and qualities required for a diverse range of careers.The college also offers HND Retail Management where students have the opportunity to gain work experience managing and promoting the colleges pop-up shop, Tempus.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"horror as hypodermic needle found in bakery counter at local lidl","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice have launched an investigation after a shocked shopper found part of a hypodermic needle in a supermarket bakery counter.The discovery was made in the Lidl store on Queenswell Road in Forfar on Friday as a customer browsed the self-service baked goods.Lidl, which also has four stores in Dundee – Downfield, Lochee, Stobswell and the city centre – has said it is “extremely concerned” and is supporting the police in its investigation.The customer, who asked not to be named, said: “It was a hypodermic needle – it was found in the amongst the bakery and pizza department – the bit where customers can help themselves to goods.

There’s a lot of chopping and changing.“The main thing is all the new boys that have come in are looking good. Obviously, you miss the guys who were here before and have left but that’s just football, it’s a good change.“And I’ve really enjoyed my time here, bar the end of last season, so I’m delighted to still be here and part of things. Hopefully, I can have a good season.”While it’s still early days, Stanton believes there are signs United can make it third time lucky and win promotion this term.He’s been impressed by the quality of his new team-mates and with the way the side appears to be gelling.“At Brechin the other night we came together well and we moved the ball about pretty nicely considering it was the first game.“We are pretty fit and we’re feeling good. Everyone seems to be fitting in well and that was pleasing.“The manager’s brought in a lot of good players, so it’s exciting and we’re looking forward to the season starting.“It was a good start at Brechin and, hopefully, it will get better.”Today the Tangerines were in action in a closed-door friendly at their St Andrews training base and a week today sees the Betfred Cup kick off with a group tie against Arbroath at Tannadice.While the league is the priority, Stanton’s looking forward to that.“It’s only a few weeks until the league starts up and I’m really looking forward to it.“We’ve got the Betfred Cup starting next week and that’s good. Almost all the teams use it as part of their pre-season but we want to do well.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/07/PA-34720510-846x564.jpg ","title":"today first of harry potter reading sessions at dundee book shop","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFans of Harry Potter will be able to enjoy a “wizard event” at a Dundee book shop this week.Waterstones will be holding the first of its reading group sessions in its Commercial Street store today.Participants will talk about the first instalment in the popular JK Rowling series, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.They will also discuss both the book and the film adaption.There will also be a selection of new children’s books available to talk about.The session will run for one hour from 11am.

its other store at the Inverness Retail Park.It is not known whether another retailer is lined up to take over the vacant unit but one city business leader described the loss of the store from the city centre as a blow.A spokeswoman for Argos confirmed its Eastgate Centre would close this month although she declined to specify the reasons behind the closure.\"All colleagues were offered the opportunity to redeploy to our other store in Inverness, which is less than a mile away,\" she said.It is understood the store will close its doors on July 10 (Tuesday).Stewart Nicol, chief executive of Inverness Chamber of Commerce, recalled the retailer had moved several times in the city centre before settling into the Eastgate unit.\"It\u0027 an undoubted blow to the city centre in that it is closing,\" he said. \"It is good that it is staying in the city but it is that whole debate about out-of-town versus the city centre.\"It is quite clear that all High Streets and even shopping centres are under extreme pressure because of internet shopping and the way people choose to shop. There are consequences of the way we shop.\"I think the challenge is to maintain a city centre which is an attractive place to visit and socialise and purchase things.\"Mr Nicol said \"an awful lot of hard work\" remained.\"It is a hard task but I think if the public and private sector work together we can do that,\" he said. \"We need to maximise all the opportunities that there are and the Reinvent The City Centre campaign has highlighted that over many months.\"It is about making the city centre a really positive place to visit whether it is for the shops or socialising or meeting

It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 8:35

is.Her bones were found in a coffin many were convinced contained Simon Fraser 11th Lord Lovat, the last man to be beheaded in Britain in 1747 for supporting Bonnie Prince Charlie and the Jacobite cause.Although official accounts stated the 80-year-old peer, nicknamed the Old Fox, was buried at the Tower of London, the clan always maintained supporters had intercepted his body and spirited it back to his homeland.But a forensic investigation led by renowned forensic anthropologist Dame Professor Sue Black sent out shockwaves earlier this year when it was discovered the remains were those of an unknown 25-year-old woman plus four others, including a child.They will all be reinterred in the crypt on Thursday, August 23 during a service attended by Lovat Fraser family members and others

dignity and include prayers for the dead led by Father Maximilian Nwosu of St Mary\u0027 RC Church in Beauly. Her son will also play a lament on Lovat Fraser pipes.But Mrs Fraser acknowledged the mystery surrounding the headless skeleton remained as they still did not know who the woman was or why she was missing her head.\"That is life,\" she reflected. \"How many things in life get closure?

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"exciting shinty at the macaulay sixes","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 22/06/18, 8:15 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowNo fewer than 29 youth shinty teams travelled to Oban\u0026#8217s Mossfield Park for the annual Macaulay six-a-side competition.The winners of the main competition for P7 and under were Inverlochy, who defeated Taynuilt 1-0 in the final with Taynuilt taking the Oban Celtic Shield.The Alastair Campbell Shield for P5 and under was won by Braxi Boys from Inverlochy who defeated Bute in a very exciting final after extra time by one penalty to nil.The Macaulay Development trophy was won by Rockfield Rapids.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"scrum for burgers","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 30/06/18, 7:47 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe Mid Argyll Rugby Club had its annual end-of-season barbeque and awards ceremony at the Ropework park on Sunday June 24.The kids from P4/5 and P6/7 that played a big part in winning the league and runners up in P4/5 also received medals.Of the primary six and sevens, player of the year went to Murray MacDonald, most improved player of the year went to Aileen Barr, the coaches award went to Campbell Shaw and best newcomer went to Rhys Coffield.Of the younger kids of primary four and five, the player of the year award went to Arran Martin most improved player of the year went to Fergus Bennet the coaches award went to Jorja and Jemma MacDonald and best newcomer went to Logan Cinnamond.On top of their awards, all the kids were also given a new training top sponsored by Jewsons.The players also clubbed together to get all the coaches a gift each.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"inverarays sale of the summer gets underway","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 02/07/18, 6:37 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe famous Inveraray summer sale has started.On Monday June 25, Inveraray’s parish church hall opened its doors, brimming with exquisite odds and ends.Ornaments, sports equipment and anything else you can think of can be found at the church for a fair price.Volunteer Wilma Wood said: \u0026#8216Anyone looking for something in particular can give us a shout.

The pair were steady, neat and quick all day and broke the timing beam on stage eight, Bishop\u0026#8217s Glen, to complete the rally in 23rd overall and third in class four.Everything finally came together and the car and crew got the result they deserve. The collective sigh of relief could be heard in body shops and garages all across the land, with annual leave in  most of them on hold until Douglas\u0026#8217s result came in.Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker were out in the mighty Peugeot 106 once more and were having a decent day, with a few hairy moments when the intercom wasn\u0026#8217t working (or so Duncan tells it) and unfortunately breaking a gearbox mount which, though fixed between stages, saw them over their time limit and out of the rally.Mull ace Ally Currie and his Oban co-driver Grant MacNiven continued to chase the bigger more powerful machinery in his 150bhp Fiesta and was sitting third in the 2WD section when a problem that they had been experiencing for most of the day became worse \u0026#8211 and the passenger side front wheel decided to part company on the approach to the start line of stage seven.The family duo of Cara and Donald MacNeill made a welcome return to the stages, in new machinery this time, debuting their Subaru Impreza and bringing it home in one piece in 31st overall and second in class nine.Mull\u0026#8217s James Campbell and Claire Tilley also got their Mitsubishi Evo to the finish and will be happy with the result.The event was won by Kilmarnock\u0026#8217s Andrew Gallagher with Jane Nicol on the notes in the CobbleShop Ford Focus WRC.The next rally action for Argyll is the Mach 1 Stages on the weekend of July 14/15 at Machrihanish.\u0026nbspPICS:Photographs by West Coast PhotosAlly Currie and Grant MacNiven blasted it while their Fiesta was still on four wheels. no_a27ArgyllRally01no_a27ArgyllRally02Overall Winners Andrew Gallagher and Jane Nicol in their Ford Focus. no_a27ArgyllRally03Donald MacNeill from Furnace and Cara MacNeill, Glasgow, make light work of the hairpin in their Subaru.  no_a27ArgyllRally04James Campbell and Claire Tilley from Mull in their Mitsubishi. no_a27ArgyllRally05Kicking up dust in their Peogeot 106 are Lochgilphead team Duncan MacLean and Ian Parker. no_a27ArgyllRally06\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"tv company seeks argyll adventurers","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 11:20 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowCould you travel to The Far East without stepping on a plane?If so, a television production company is looking for you.Studio Lambert, the company behind Gogglebox, is seeking folk from Argyll to take part in a trans-global race for a cash prize.Flightless is described as an \u0026#8216ambitious real-world adventure series\u0026#8217.

I am still receiving many justifiable complaints about the terrible condition of Mansefield Road in Port Ellen and the hospital road in Bowmore. With long overdue road works going on across Islay and the rest of the Kintyre and Islands ward, it\u0026#8217s only fair these roads are not ignored.The poor condition of the Bruichladdich toilets continues to be raised by local residents.Since contacting the appropriate department I have been informed repairs and maintenance are planned for them.While checking on the progress of pothole repairs I had previously requested, I noticed some of the recent street light repairs leave a lot to be desired. While a quick fix is better than nothing, many of these short-term fixes need to be looked at again.I have been speaking to the BT Openreach staff across Islay who are expanding our island\u0026#8217s internet capabilities. I have contacted BT to make sure recent issues with phone lines in some local households are not a result of the broadband upgrades.There has been progress with local housing associations after pointing out many of their tenants are having trouble with mould in their housing. Measures are now being implemented to to rectify the problem. I was happy to hear Argyll Community Housing Association has fixed gate latches on four of its houses at Cnoc Na Faire in Port Ellen after I raised this with them a few weeks ago.I met with environment, development and infrastructure committee member councillor Gary Mulvaney about Kintyre and Islands\u0026#8217 crumbling infrastructure, alongside our growing industrial output with the success of distilleries on Islay and Jura.Later that day I spoke directly to my constituents in Tarbert after a number of locals \u0026#8211 some business owners \u0026#8211 contacted me about the recent flood of sewage on Harbour Street as a result of blocked drains. Scottish Water were coming under fire from locals because of its slow progress on the matter.I made my anger about the poor conditions in Tarbert very clear when I contacted Scottish Water. A long-term solution to needs to be put in place.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Scottish Water is asking customers to use water wisely in their daily activities to help maintain supplies during the current hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer use has increased significantly.In some areas, there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of use and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce use wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their use and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible and use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.More advice on using water wisely is online at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or call 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer, Chief Operating Officer, Scottish Water.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"riverside fun day sparkles in the sun","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 06/07/18, 9:44 amLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThe sun shone on the Riverside in Lochgilphead for a day of fun.Mid Argyll Community Pool and Riverside Rascals nursery hosted the family day on Sunday July 1, featuring a variety of colourful craft and charity stalls.The unmistakeable aroma of barbecue wafted across the car park from Riverside Rascals nursery, which opened its doors to the public for the occasion, complete with children\u0026#8217s activities.MACPool lifeguards were on hand to keep an eye on the youngsters in the pedal boats while the sunshine glistened across the splashing fun.PICS:Four-year-old Kaiden Abel from Lochgilphead has fun splashing in the inflatable outdoor pool. 06_a27RiversideFun01Kyra Robertson, aged 11, from Cairnbaan, tries to hook a duck on the MS centre stand \u0026#8211 and it\u0026#8217s not as easy as it looks. 06_a27RiversideFun04On the MS Centre Mid Argyll stall were Maggie Dodd and centre manager Karen McCurry. 06_a27RiversideFun07Mary Stewart of the Loch Awe Pottery helps sisters Abby and Chloe McCallum, from Glasgow, to decorate their pottery. 06_a27RiversideFun08Cathleen MacDonald was there with her Woolly Bobbins textile-base crafts. 06_a27RiversideFun09Alongside Cathleen was her mum Margaret Davidson, who creates soft toys under the name Twisted Yarn.

The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12468674.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_240218grant_07JPG.jpg","title":"maybole super school one step","story":"NewsMaybole super-school is one step closer to being builtCouncillors have approved the results of a public consultation in the town that will see a 1400-pupil campus erected at Carrick Academy.\u0026nbspShareByStuart Wilson15:27, 10 JUL 2018NewsNew Carrick Academy artist impression (Image: Copyright Unknown)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA \u0026pound42million super-school has taken a step closer to being built in Maybole.

St Cuthbert’s Primary – where parents responding to the consultation issued a rejection of the move – would also relocate but operate as a stand-alone school. A bid for funding will now be made to the Scottish Government.

Nicola, 28-year-old classical singer married 30-year-old shipbuilding engineer John Hunter. The pair now live in Shawlands, Glasgow, but were both originally from Ayr. One Friday night back in 2009 John walked in to Harley’s Pub in Ayr to wish his cousin a happy birthday, and his sister told him to say hello to Nicola – her workmate at the time. “Nobody knows if it was the brown eyes, the sweet perfume or the six pints, three vodkas and the shot of Midori that caused him to steal my cardigan but steal it he did,” joked Nicola. She added: “A few days later, cardigan in hand, John returned it to H Samuel where I worked at the time. And that moment was the beginning of something special.” Since then both have enjoyed years of happiness and in October 2016 – seven years after meeting – John asked Nicola to marry him at Loch Lomond.  John and Nicola tied the knot on Thursday, June 7, at The Cruin at Loch Lomond. The couple said: “It was relaxing, elegant and absolutely perfect. “We can’t thank the staff enough. The weather, setting and scenery were breath-taking.” The bride wore a Vera Wang dress from David’s Bridal, Braehead, the bridesmaids also wearing gowns from David’s Bridal. The kilts were the Spirit of Lochearn tartan from Kilts 4 U. The wedding party consisted of Best man Mark Cosgrove, Groomsmen Niall Carney, Paddy McCurdie and Ryan Glass (nephew, aged 8), Maid of honour sister Jennifer Cassells, Bridesmaids Laura Dickson, Heather Armstrong and Aimee Trainer, Groom’s parents John Hunter and Hazel Hunter and the Bride’s parents Brian Cassells and Julie Cassells. The pair are currently celebrating being newlyweds in Bangkok, Thailand, and will be heading to Koh Samui, Thailand, then on to the Atlantis in Dubai.  3D Cakes created the couples wedding cake.

Bids of \u0026pound1.5million are being sought for Enterkine House, perched above Annbank. The luxury four-star retreat, which boasts 74 acres of land, employs around 50 staff. Kirk House and Steading, a six-bedroom farmhouse currently used as overspill accommodation for the hotel, is also included. Agents Christie \u0026amp Co and Galbraith said the plot offered “potential for development under a new owner”. It follows a long-running noise battle at the hotel which saw bosses spend \u0026pound80,000 soundproofing their wedding marquee. Council chiefs were told that slapping an 11pm curfew on party bands could put the hotel out of business.  But they finally got the all-clear earlier this year and revealed plans to build a permanent structure. However, the hotel is now being offered to the market. Bob Cherry, a partner with Galbraith, said: “The purchaser of Enterkine would find it relatively straightforward to continue the current business, which is well-established, and there are further opportunities for diversification or expansion of the tourism and events facilities on the estate, subject to the necessary consents. “This is a beautiful estate with a thriving hotel business and potential for further development.” Brian Sheldon, of Christie \u0026amp Co, added: “The market for country house hotels such as Enterkine House has vastly improved in recent years. “Its location in South Ayrshire and within such an enviable estate and countryside will attract local, regional and potentially international operators. “Whilst the business is trading well, there is certainly scope for further growth.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"royal troon golf club make","story":"NewsRoyal Troon golf club make generous donation to hospital unitIt follows a charity 18-hole golf event with Troon Portland and Troon Ladies, writes Charlene Bennie.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post15:39, 10 JUL 2018News\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailRoyal Troon Golf Club has made the generous donation of \u0026pound1k to Crosshouse Hospital’s Acute Stroke Unit.

Andrew Power, club captain of Royal Troon, said: “We chose to donate to the Acute Stroke Unit as three of our members were in this unit over the last year and are all now recovering well. The word from them is that they got the best of care and were delighted we chose to donate to the unit” During the event, Stroke and TIA (Transient Ischaemic Attack) information packs were handed out, making it a great opportunity to spread awareness of how to act when someone is suffering from a stroke.  Andrew added: “We had a great day, great weather and we were glad we made a good amount for a good cause. We’d like to say from all at Royal Troon that you (staff at Ward 3E) do a great job and hope this cheque can help out in any way it can”. Senior charge nurse, Christine Sommerville, said: “Patients are admitted from all over Ayrshire to the ASU. Stroke happens with no warning, but with specialised care and input, outcomes are improved. “We are delighted to hear the members are recovering well and that they had a positive experience in the ASU. “On behalf of the ASU team, a big thank you.

That’s the shock ultimatum delivered by warring SNP councillors to their embattled leader. Douglas Campbell has been ordered to regain control of his split ranks during the council’s summer break. It comes as rival camps “fight like rats” to wrestle the council’s power base back on track. A racism storm and failed coup on Councillor Campbell has plunged the SNP into crisis. And the Post understands another plot to oust the leader is now brewing. It follows all SNP group members signing a declaration of support for their under-fire boss just two weeks ago. But a party insider has revealed growing disquiet is threatening to tear the group apart.  Within hours of the public show of support, Cllr Campbell was being placed under increasing pressure to step down of his own accord, rather than face another bruising challenge from within, the Post has learned. A senior source said: “People agreed to fall in line and sign the declaration for the sake of the bigger picture. “But it’s widely accepted that a change is required and this can’t go on. “The group is in a position where people will fight like rats to get what they want. “However, the even bigger concern is trying to keep the administration intact.” Worries over a potential walkout from Labour colleagues has, until now, ensured enough SNP support behind Cllr Campbell. A potential change in the their leadership is thought that have strained relations with administration partners, who have indicated they are happier working with Cllr Campbell.  But the Post understands that Cllr Campbell’s Labour past is forming a big part of the problem for the SNP leader as he battles factions within his new party. And a new warning – issued as councillors left for their summer break – stressed that he must crack the whip among his troubled ranks. The source added: “It was made very clear that if he doesn’t, the matter will be taken out of his hands. “The party is being crucified every week and it cannot be allowed to continue. “Some see Douglas as being far too close to Labour and that is undoubtedly a big issue for him. “Either way, he’s been given the message in clear terms that he needs to get everyone behind him and on the same page.” When asked about the warning, the group’s depute leader, William Grant, insisted: “This is news to me.” Cllr Campbell added: “Cllr Grant responded to your enquiry that ‘This is news to me’ and I have nothing to add.” "},{"url":null,"title":"unpaid-work-for-teenager-who-broke-mans-jaw-after-earlston-7s","story":"A TEENAGER broke a man\u0027s jaw with a punch during an argument after Earlston Rugby Sevens.\nThe victim had arrived at a party in Station Road to pick someone up on the night of May 6.\nHis vehicle was approached by 18-year-old Nathan Rice of Glenburn Avenue, Newtown St Boswells, who started acting in an aggressive manner and tried to get into the vehicle where a woman was sitting.\nThe car owner was returning to the vehicle and told Rice to go away and the pair squared up to each other.\nSelkirk Sheriff Court was told that the pair were pushing each other and then Rice connected with a punch to the left hand side of the face.\nThe pair were swinging punches that were not connecting and eventually they were split up.\nThe court heard that the victim woke up at 11.30am and could not close his mouth, and on attending hospital found he had a broken jaw.\nDefence lawyer Mark Harrower said the hotel worker felt bad about what happened and had not intended to inflict such an injury.\nHe added: \"He is a young man of good character and has learned a valuable lesson of what the consequences can be.\"\nRice pleaded guilty to charges of behavingin a threatening or abusive manner and assault to severe injury.\nSheriff Mark Thorley said: \"No doubt drink played a part in this but at lease you have shown remorse for your actions.\"\nHe was given a 12-months Copmmunity Pay Back order involving 160 hours of unpaid work.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"up-to-50-jobs-created-with-new-home-bargains-store-in-galashiels","story":"UP to 50 jobs are being created with the opening of a new \u0026pound4million Home Bargains store in Galashiels this weekend.\nThe Stirling Street outlet, which is due to be opened on Saturday at 8am, replaces the smaller Channel Street store which closes the day before.\nJoe Morris, operations director at Home Bargains, told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore thrilled to be launching this flagship store in Galashiels and look forward to welcoming customers through the doors.\nThe 25,000 sq ft store, which has previously been a Co-Op and B\u0026ampM, will offer shoppers a range of products, including homewares, health and beauty essentials, sweets, snacks and drinks, as well as fresh and frozen food.\nJoe added: \u0026ldquoStirling Street will be a great location for us and we\u0026rsquore proud to be able to offer local people top-branded goods at exceptionally low prices.\nWith more than four million customers each week, Home Bargains is one of the country\u0026rsquos best-loved discount retailers, stocking top-quality branded goods at low prices.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"feature-peebles-pupils-meditate-their-way-to-mindfulness","story":"IT\u0027S a typical weekday, high school students are lying on the floor of their classroom, eyes closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet.

looks to beat rival suitor Comcast in the battle for the pay TV giant.\nFox\u0026rsquos new offer\u0026nbspfor the 61% of Sky it does not already own values the company at \u0026pound24.5 billion.\nIt said the offer was around 12% higher than the \u0026pound12.50-a-share bid submitted by US cable group Comcast.\nRupert Murdoch, pictured with wife Jerry Hall, has already agreed to sell Fox assets including its Sky stake to Walt Disney (PA)\nFox\u0026rsquos sweetened bid is also around 30.2% higher than its original \u0026pound10.75-a-share bid made in December 2016, which valued the 61% stake at \u0026pound11.7 billion.\nIts move signals that Fox hopes to see off competition from Comcast after a long battle to buy out Sky, which has come under heavy scrutiny from the UK Government and competition watchdogs.\nEarlier this month, then UK culture secretary Matt Hancock said Fox would have to sell off Sky News in order to address media plurality concerns and secure Government approval for the deal.\nFox has already agreed to sell most of its assets \u0026ndash including its current 39% stake in Sky \u0026ndash to Walt Disney.\nIf Fox buys the remaining stake in Sky before completing the Disney deal, Disney would take full ownership of Sky when it closes its own takeover of the Fox assets.\nBut in a further complication to the takeover saga, Comcast has also made an all-cash offer for the Fox assets separate from its offer for Sky.\nComcast is preparing to post details of its \u0026pound12.50-a-share Sky offer documents before a Friday deadline under UK takeover rules.\nOn its higher bid, Fox said: \u0026ldquoAs the founding shareholder of Sky, we have remained deeply committed to bringing these two organisations together to create a world-class business positioned to deliver the very best entertainment experiences well into the future.\n\u0026ldquoWe strongly believe that a combined 21st Century Fox and Sky will be a powerful driver for the continued growth and vibrancy of the UK and broader global creative industries.\nSky shares fell nearly 2% following details of Fox\u0026rsquos raised bid.\nFox is waiting for a final decision from the UK Government on whether to accept its proposals over the sale of Sky News to address concerns over media plurality, given that the Murdoch family also owns News Corp \u0026ndash the publisher of a raft of UK newspapers.\nUnder its plans to offload Sky News to Disney, Fox has pledged to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least \u0026pound100 million a year for 15 years.\nBut if terms of a sale of Sky News cannot be agreed, Mr Hancock has already told Parliament the \u0026ldquoonly effective remedy now would be to block the merger altogether.\nA decision is expected by July 12.\nThe Government has separately cleared Comcast\u0026rsquos bid for Sky.\n(function(i,s,o,g,r,a,m){i[\u0027GoogleAnalyticsObject\u0027]=ri[r]=i[r]||function(){(i[r].q=i[r].q||[]).push(arguments)},i[r].l=1*new

outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit www.asthma.org.uk/safersummerDr Andy Whittamore, Practicing

The Aqualibrium is not where most people want to cross.\u0026#8216People going to and from the Co-op and Tesco want to cross at the junction between them.\u0026#8216Likewise, people going to the harbour from the town centre want to cross at the Royal Hotel.\u0026#8216As it is, as a driver I was unaware the town had any crossings, apart from the pelican crossing in the Main Street. None are marked for drivers.\u0026#8216Is there any point in having them if drivers do not know they are there?\u0026#8216If they are indeed crossings, mark them. All road users need to know what they are in the interest of safety.\u0026#8217Mark Sutherland: \u0026#8216I have on several occasions crossed the road near the Co-op, and due to the speed of some inconsiderate drivers have had narrow misses. As for reporting to the police, this is ridiculous as the police would not really be interested as they have enough to do.\u0026#8216It is obvious if you stand there long enough that several people try to cross and give up or take a chance.\u0026#8216A crossing is required, especially for the elderly and infirm, as they can not make it across as quickly.\u0026#8216Common sense needs to be implemented by the right authorities to ensure that pedestrians can cross safely.\u0026#8217\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"pedestrian crossings","story":"There are also no traditional pedestrian pelican crossings.

supplies during the current period of hot summer weather.Following a sustained dry period without any significant rainfall, customer usage has increased significantly.With the current weather conditions forecast to continue people should take simple but important steps to conserve public water supplies.In some areas there has been a 30 per cent increase in demand for water during the summer and an additional 140 million litres are currently being produced and pushed through the system every day.The situation is being monitored closely and  to manage supplies across the country.This includes deploying additional resources to move water between distribution areas and tankering water to supplement local networks.Some water treatment works and distribution networks are working at near capacity to meet demand.Average reservoir levels are generally normal for this time of year but the current level of usage and continuing dry weather means stocks of stored water available for use are reducing.Try to reduce usage wherever possible.Businesses are also being asked to consider their usage and how they can use water more efficiently.Simple, practical steps include: taking shorter showers, using a watering can rather than a hose to water plants, using a bucket rather than a hose to wash vehicles only washing windscreens/lights instead of the whole vehicle, turning off taps whenever possible, use washing machines and dishwashers fully loaded.Scotland’s public water supply is the lifeblood of the country, for household and business customers and more than 1.3 billion litres is used per day.There is a strong and resilient water distribution network but everyone will need to play their part as Scotland enjoys its hottest and driest summer in many years.To help customers use water wisely, advice is at www.scottishwater/savewaterscotland or by calling 0800 0778778.Peter Farrer,Chief Operating Officer,Scottish

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.

The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.

Councillor McMillan said it had been a great honour to be joined by veterans from East Lothian at the flag-raising ceremony which took place on Monday morning.  He told those in attendance: \"Today is an opportunity to recognise the enormous contribution made by service personnel - past and present - and pay tribute to those who very sadly paid the ultimate sacrifice.  \"This November marks a century since the end of the First World War. A large number of residents left East Lothian in service of their country \u0026ndash many of whom, tragically, would never return.  \"Sadly, in the 100 years since, the world has seen all too many conflicts \u0026ndash some on a large scale, others more confined. In war, and in peacetime, our armed forces have promoted peace and security, confronted terrorism, and delivered aid to those in need.  \"That\u0026rsquos why, as Provost of East Lothian, I value occasions such as Armed Forces Day. A chance to give thanks, remember, reflect and look ahead.\"  Mr McMillan also paid tribute to the role of women in the military and in times of conflict, noting that 2018 was also the 100th anniversary of the first women being given the vote.  He said: \"Women played a significant role in the war effort, taking on work such as farming, transport and munition production, and the perseverance of Suffrage activity subsequently led to women being given the right to vote.  \"For a number of years now women have deservedly been playing a full and active role in our Armed Forces \u0026ndash reflective of the increasingly inclusive society in which we all live and are so keen to protect.\"  Veterans who attended the ceremony on Monday were invited to enjoy refreshments after the event."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7979931.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"scotlands-best-black-pudding-made-in-east-lothian","story":"  When the final of this year\u0026rsquos Scottish Black Pudding Championship was held earlier this month at the Edinburgh New Town Cook School, it was Anderson\u0027s Quality Butchers who came out on top.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.

Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area.

However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.  Organisers say the display shows Musselburgh\u0026rsquos leadership in developing golf and exporting it.  The museum is open on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays from 10.30am to 4pm each day."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8006789.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"coast-road-closed-after-car-overturns","story":"  Police said one person was trapped in a car which has overturned and they have closed the road while work to free them is carried out.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.  The site had long been earmarked for Sainsbury\u0026rsquos after it won a lengthy battle with Tesco to build on the site in 2013."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8009220.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"dunbar-student-heading-off-to-the-olympics-of-tech","story":"  A games development team, made up of students from Abertay University, will take on the best in the world at the Microsoft Imagine Cup in Seattle.  The competition \u0026ndash dubbed the Olympics of Tech \u0026ndash seeks out the most innovative and potentially world-changing software solutions and comes with a first prize of $100,000.  Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.  She said: \u0026ldquoThey are sending the first and second place teams out to Seattle for the competition, which is in the last week in July.  \u0026ldquoIt is quite exciting, I\u0026rsquom just the artist on the team.  \u0026ldquoI do the models and particular effects and textures.  The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.  In April, the team from Abertay University took part in the UK finals of the Microsoft Imagine Cup in London.  A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.  The Abertay team are focusing on making the simulator better before they head to Washington.

The young people would like to re-build the shelter with wider community involvement.  But Kathryn and Douglas Paul, who live at Glasclune Gardens, would prefer to see the shelter demolished.  Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.  The couple told the Courier they had experienced long-standing anti-social behaviour from youngsters who already gather at the shelter.  Mrs Paul said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had bottles thrown into the garden \u0026ndash they are loud and they get up to all sorts. It\u0026rsquos been going on five or six years.

They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.

She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.

A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park.

The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.

In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.  The board agreed to transfer the licence to Mr Hughes, wishing him luck with the venture."},{"url":null,"title":"scottish-open-2018-trophy-tour-finale-at-tranent-school","story":"  Beth Allen, ambassador for ASI and member of the Ladies European and LPGA Tour, was there on the day and attended a special assembly and Q\u0026ampA session with pupils to give more insight into her life as a professional golfer.

A ClubGolf mass participation session was then held over lunchtime to give all children at the school a chance to experience golf, using everything from plastic ClubGolf equipment, professional clubs and golf balls to Scottish Golf inflatable nets.  About 14,000 primary and high school pupils in East Lothian have been visited at their schools as part of the trophies tour in the run-up to the Scottish Open, which takes place from next Thursday (July 12), and the Ladies\u0026rsquo Scottish Open which begins on Thursday, July 26.  Mr Martin said: \u0026ldquoThe trophies tour finale at Sanderson\u0026rsquos Wynd was an amazing day and these children not only got to see the trophies up close but also got to grill a brilliant professional athlete in Beth Allen. It was also fantastic to give them the opportunity to swing a golf club for the first time.  \u0026ldquoI hope that the trophy tour has inspired children across East Lothian to come down to Gullane in July and continue to get involved in golf.

Assembly host Bryden McKinnie, told the Courier, he received news from the Food Assembly UK operators on Friday afternoon that they were no longer operating in the UK.  The assemblies, which started in France, have been operating across the UK for five years.  They provide local hosts with the support to set up a website where local producers can offer their goods for sale and customers can browse online filling a \"shopping basket\" with products from a number of different companies.  They then collect all their shopping at one place on a set evening of the week.  The Haddington Assembly has held weekly collections at the Maitlandfield House Hotel since it began, with a wide range of local suppliers.  More than 1250 people have become members of the assembly in East Lothian but host Bryden said one of the issues to faced was building regular customers to make it sustainable.  He said of the 100 plus members only around 50 shop with any regularity and if the assembly was to continue in another form it was important to understand what stopped the other members from using it.  He said: \"It is difficult to sustain when you do not have a lot of regular shoppers, and this is a common thread among all the UK food assemblies.  \"We are talking to each other and looking at whether we can come up with a new way of operating, the announcement from the Food Assembly came as a shock and has really rocked everyone, but we are looking to the future.\"  The Haddington Food Assembly will stop at the end of this month.  However Mr McKinnie said alternatives would be looked at if it received a boost in its support.  He said: \"During the summer months orders can fall as low as 10 a week which is not sustainable. It really is a case of \"use it or lose it\".\"  A spokesperson for the Food Assembly said no public statement on the withdrawal was being made before the end of August.  She said: \"The announcement has been made to our network of hosts and producers, many of them will communicate to their members when they are ready, and we will do a public communication in August.\""},{"url":null,"title":"talented-teenage-drummer-clara-wilberforce-joins-national-youth-pipe-band-of-scotland","story":"  Clara Wilberforce, who has been playing the snare drum since she was in P6 at King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, has linked up with the National Youth Pipe Band of Scotland\u0026rsquos development band.  That came after a rigorous audition process, which saw the 15-year-old perform to a group of judges.  Proud mum Juliet told the Courier it had been an eventful period from the audition to finding out that Clara had been successful.  She said: \u0026ldquoShe went to the National Piping Centre in Glasgow and she did her audition and she came out and said \u0026lsquoI did so badly, I messed up\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe was so disappointed and I said to her that she was very young.  \u0026ldquoShe was terribly disappointed but I said \u0026lsquonever mind, you are young and will get another chance another year\u0026rsquo.  \u0026ldquoShe had been in tears and she felt she let herself down.  \u0026ldquoWe forgot all about it and then suddenly emails were coming through to her and myself.  \u0026ldquoShe came tearing down the stairs screaming at the top of her voice that she got into the development band.  \u0026ldquoShe was running round the house, up and down the stairs screaming with joy.  Her first event will feature Phil Cunningham and Aly Bain at the Phil and Aly RSNO St Andrew\u0026rsquos Day Concert at the Glasgow Royal Concert Hall on November 25.  Music runs in the family, with older brother Ninian, playing the pipes, while Juliet plays the piano and dad Marcus is a member of Haddington\u0026rsquos Siancio Singers.  Clara, who is in S5 at Knox Academy and studying Higher maths, English, geography and human biology, is also a member of the school\u0026rsquos pipe band as well as Haddington Pipe Band, where she is a senior drummer.  Her mum, who praised the efforts of Davey Barnes, who runs Knox Academy Pipe Band, and Dave Henry, drum teacher, said Clara \u0026ldquoloves the drumming and she had made a number of good friends through music and boosted her confidence.  Alastair Bruce, chairman of Haddington Pipe Band, congratulated Clara, who lives in the town, on the achievement.  The youngster won the band\u0026rsquos Niall Fairgrieve Award in 2014 for most improved drummer and has continued to impress.

Now his son Kit, who lives in Belhaven, has released a new version of the tale which looks at Chris\u0026rsquo 30-year career with the company, its characters and ships.  The company, which provides a link to many of the Scottish islands from the mainland, dates back to 1851 and has become famous for the red and black funnel, complete with the Lion Rampant, on its ships.  Kit said: \u0026ldquoWe self-published it the first time and having, finally, persuaded him to write down all the stories I found a way of getting it published.  \u0026ldquoWe printed about 400 copies and the punchline is, despite him giving a few away, we got enough money back to cover the publication cost.  \u0026ldquoAs far as I know it is sold out \u0026ndash I have got a copy and so do both my sons but I think that is about it.  \u0026ldquoThe reason we published it in the first place was, certainly to us, the highly entertaining stories about MacBrayne.  \u0026ldquoThere was a lot in it about his army service and, after coming back to it after all those years, the reason for publishing it again was just to make sure those reflections on a way of life long gone did not die with him.  Kit \u0026ndash who last year released The Triumph and Tragedy of the Bantams, which focused on a band of \u0026ldquobrave but largely forgotten soldiers \u0026ndash has added his own stories of being a \u0026lsquoMacBrayne Child\u0026rsquo.  He added that his dad was known as the \u0026lsquostoryteller\u0026rsquo in the family and he wanted to make sure the stories were available to a new generation.

The 51-year-old, whose nephew is Scotland rugby star Huw Jones, has driven a taxi for nine years to pay his way through university and has built his own film studio and edit suite at his home in Longniddry.  The dad-of-three said: \u0026ldquoThe TV course has been a brilliant journey.  \u0026ldquoColleagues often ask where I find my energy, and sometimes I have to ask myself the same thing, especially at 4am when I have forgotten to go to bed. Perhaps my endurance and resilience comes from my 12 years as a commando.  \u0026ldquoThere have been sacrifices, the biggest of them being to have had no social life throughout this time, but I am passionate about television and I am now talking to production companies and hoping to make my mark in the documentary genre.  While Matt admits it was \u0026ldquoeasy to feel envious of weekend revellers partying, he said driving taxis allowed him to refine his interview skills for his TV career ahead.  And among those to grace the back seat of his cab over the last nine years have been the likes of Angus Deayton, Ian Lavender, Paul Merton, Alexei Sayle, Ruth Madoc and Steven Berkoff.  Matt, who served with the Royal Marines in Northern Ireland, has already completed a music production with National Museums Scotland for a new exhibition on Scottish pop from the 1950s to present day.

Svetlana Kondakova and Maja Quille, graduates of Edinburgh College of Art, worked on \u0026lsquoMusselburgh Archer\u0026rsquo, a life-size bronze cast of an archer and 12 steel arrows which will create a trail around the town.  In a joint statement, they said: \u0026ldquoWe hope that the artwork will link the heritage of Musselburgh to the modern day, as well as providing an interactive element of activity for both locals and visitors with the trail.  The lifesize figure represents layers of local history including the Roman invasion in AD 80, the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547 and the Musselburgh Silver Arrow, which dates back to 1603 and is claimed to be the oldest sporting trophy in the world still competed for annually.  The artwork will be completed with a series of stainless steel arrows installed at different locations around Musselburgh. They are expected to be installed later this summer and will form a trail around the town to areas of cultural, historical, natural and community significance, supported by a Global Treasure App organised by Musselburgh Area Partnership.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a striking piece of art that represents so many aspects of local history. Residents of Musselburgh and visitors will no doubt appreciate this latest addition to the public art within the community.  Michael Johnson of Nottinghamshire created \u0026lsquoThe Mussel\u0026rsquo with input from local schoolchildren, and its installation was recently highlighted in the Courier.

It said the offer was around 12% higher than the \u0026pound12.50-a-share bid submitted by US cable group Comcast.  Fox\u0026rsquos sweetened bid is also around 30.2% higher than its original \u0026pound10.75-a-share bid made in December 2016, which valued the 61% stake at \u0026pound11.7 billion.  Its move signals that Fox hopes to see off competition from Comcast after a long battle to buy out Sky, which has come under heavy scrutiny from the UK Government and competition watchdogs.  Earlier this month, then UK culture secretary Matt Hancock said Fox would have to sell off Sky News in order to address media plurality concerns and secure Government approval for the deal.  Fox has already agreed to sell most of its assets \u0026ndash including its current 39% stake in Sky \u0026ndash to Walt Disney.  If Fox buys the remaining stake in Sky before completing the Disney deal, Disney would take full ownership of Sky when it closes its own takeover of the Fox assets.  But in a further complication to the takeover saga, Comcast has also made an all-cash offer for the Fox assets separate from its offer for Sky.  Comcast is preparing to post details of its \u0026pound12.50-a-share Sky offer documents before a Friday deadline under UK takeover rules.  On its higher bid, Fox said: \u0026ldquoAs the founding shareholder of Sky, we have remained deeply committed to bringing these two organisations together to create a world-class business positioned to deliver the very best entertainment experiences well into the future.  \u0026ldquoWe strongly believe that a combined 21st Century Fox and Sky will be a powerful driver for the continued growth and vibrancy of the UK and broader global creative industries.  Sky shares fell nearly 2% following details of Fox\u0026rsquos raised bid.  Fox is waiting for a final decision from the UK Government on whether to accept its proposals over the sale of Sky News to address concerns over media plurality, given that the Murdoch family also owns News Corp \u0026ndash the publisher of a raft of UK newspapers.  Under its plans to offload Sky News to Disney, Fox has pledged to provide a Disney-owned Sky News channel with funding of at least \u0026pound100 million a year for 15 years.

The football coach, whose team take on Croatia today for a place in the World Cup final in Russia, has propelled the clothing item without which no three-piece suit would be complete back back into the fashion limelight thanks to his smart appearance on the touchline.\u0026nbsp  And with England fans adopting the garment as their personal talisman in their hunt for football glory, it has now emerged that Mr Southgate\u0027s waistcoat is to be preserved for the nation with The Museum of London announcing plans to acquire one his suits as part of their permanent collection.\u0026nbsp    Joining treasures from around the world, the plan is to display the garment at the museum\u0027s new building in the north of London.\u0026nbsp  Beatrice Behlen, Museum of London Senior Fasion Curator said:\"The Museum of London has a large fashion collection with garments ranging from the 16th century to the present.  \"Our earliest waistcoat dates from the late 17th century, our most recent from 2014.\u0026nbspThis acquisition would be a fantastic addition to our holdings and would come at an exciting time for us while we build the London Collection as we plan the New Museum in West Smithfield.\"  The traditional three piece suit - trousers, jacket and waistcoat - was a key part of British fashion for centuries, with an integral role in men\u0026rsquos wardrobes until the 1960s.\u0026nbsp  However, they have since fallen out of fashion with the rise of a more business-casual look.\u0026nbsp  But the history of the waistcoat actually predates the business suit by several centuries, with the first example, which had sleeves, recorded by the 17th century writer and politician Samuel Pepys.    Samuel Pypes  Pepys, a regular at the royal court, recorded that King Charles II intended to set a new fashion with a \"vest\", which he would wear the next day.  While not quite a vest in the modern sense, the item as a departure from the frock cots popular at the time and is regarded as the first waistcoat.  Ms Behlen, added: \"Waistcoats were born in London in 1666, promoted by King Charles II. The new fashion soon spread and for at least 300 years a three piece suit soon formed a key part of every man\u0026rsquos wardrobe.\u0026nbsp  \"Now Watford-born Gareth Southgate is reviving that London tradition and bringing waistcoats home to the forefront of fashion.\"  Fashions change over time, and during the 1750s the garment was shortened to the length familiar to suit-wearers and sports fans today.  Since then it has been cemented into British culture the waistcoat, although has undergone slight alterations.\u0026nbsp  In the late 1800s it became popular to leave the bottom button undone, a fashion supposedly started by the courtiers who surrounded Edward VII, who was too rotund to do up his.\u0026nbsp  The garment also retains royal connections of a darker sort in Scotland, with Jacobites said to toast the \u0026nbsp\"wee gentleman in the velvet waistcoat\" \u0026nbsp- in reference to moles - because of William of Orange\u0027s death after falling from a horse which had tripped on a molehill.\u0026nbsp    William of Orange  A long-sleeved version of the waistcoat said to have belonged to Bonnie Prince Charlie, was featured by the National Museum of Scotland during last year\u0026rsquos Jacobites exhibition  But before fans of the England team get too carried away with making an icon out of Mr Southgate\u0027s wardrobe it should be remembered that the necktie - which no three piece suit should be without - was invented in Croatia.\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8051855.jpg?type=article-full","title":"catholic-church-calls-for-review-of-orange-order-routes-in-glasgow","story":"  Scotland\u0026rsquos Grand Lodge has already condemned what it called \u0026ldquobigoted actions when Canon Tom White was spat on, abused and threatened during a parade through the city\u0026rsquos east end on Saturday.

He is due to meet with Prof Ponsati before joining the First Minister at her official residence, Bute House in Edinburgh, later in the day.  Prof Ponsati, an academic at St Andrews University, denies the charges against her.  Her legal team, who describe the prosecution as \"politically motivated\" by Spain, says she could face a total sentence of up to 33 years if she is sent there and convicted of the charges, raising fears the 61-year-old could spend the rest of her life in jail.  She faces a four-week hearing scheduled to take place in the summer.  Commenting on President Torra\u0027s visit, Prof Ponsati\u0027s lawyer Aamer Anwar said she \"greatly appreciated\" his support.  \"If extradited Clara Ponsati could face a sentence of up to 33 years in a Spanish prison,\" he said.  \"The prosecutor from the Crown Office acting on behalf of Spain considers an equivalent charge of rebellion can be met in Scotland with a charge of conspiracy to alter the constitution by criminal means and treason.  \"Clara refutes the charges and maintains that she peacefully promoted a referendum, whilst the charges against her are \u0027politically motivated\u0027 and extradition would be unjust, oppressive and incompatible with her human rights.\""},{"url":null,"title":"john-cleese-to-move-to-caribbean-in-november","story":"  The former Monty Python comic said his \u0026ldquoparticular beef is with the British newspapers.

The privately-owned firms operate two service lines from their headquarters in Huntly, comprising the development of private residential homes – mainly in Aberdeenshire – and the provision of design and build contracts for housing associations across the north of Scotland.        Five of the firms’ 14 employees have been made redundant with immediate effect, while the remaining employees have been retained to assist the administrators to realise the companies’ assets, including four sites currently being developed in Peterhead, Burntisland, Keith and Kemnay and Peterhead.Deveron Homes was established in 2002 and the construction arm was incorporated in 2008. In recent years, both businesses encountered challenges and delays on a number of development projects.The resulting additional costs, combined with difficult conditions in the sector and the wider challenges in the Aberdeenshire housing market, left the firms with reduced margins, significant levels of debt and a lack of funding to acquire new sites.Following an assessment of the immediate funding requirement, the directors determined they had no choice but to place both companies into administration to protect the creditors’ position as best as possible.

He will be succeeded by Ian Ross, the former East Sutherland and Edderton Highland councillor.Sir Anthony\u0026rsquos decision to step down ends a long association with the area which started in 1993 when he was appointed as chairman of the then UK Atomic Energy Authority. He later chaired AEA Technology and in 2004 took on the role of leading the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) which was responsible for decommissioning Dounreay.In 2008, the then local MP John Thurso asked Sir Anthony to chair Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership. He took on the role and says it has been \u0026ldquoan honour and a privilege to do it.\u0026ldquoI have enjoyed all my time here in my various jobs, he said. \u0026ldquoI do think the partnership has made a major contribution.\u0026ldquoTen years ago the mood was pretty depressed. People were very gloomy. I would say the mood now has changed and is pretty optimistic, although there are challenges. That will always be the case.\u0026ldquoThe big advantage we have here is that it will be a number of years before Dounreay is closed so we had an opportunity to plan for the future. If it had been a car plant it would have been closed in three months.Sir Anthony highlights positive developments such as the improvements at Scrabster and Wick harbours as well as the pioneering MeyGen tidal energy project and the Beatrice offshore wind farm.The North Coast 500 is also making an impact and bringing economic opportunities to the area. The Nucleus archive across from Wick John O\u0026rsquoGroats Airport is another plus for Caithness, he adds. Sir Anthony played a part in bringing the facility to the county during his time as chairman of the NDA.Engineering and environmental courses at North Highland College UHI can also help regenerate the Caithness economy. \u0026ldquoThere are real opportunities here, he declared.Improving infrastructure and transport links in the far north are key to helping the area\u0026rsquos economy. Good schools and hospitals are another factor.\u0026ldquoI think the partnership has made a real contribution in the last 10 years, Sir Anthony said. \u0026ldquoWe have worked with other agencies to help create around 1000 jobs over that time but we all had to work together to do it. I am very pleased to see progress being made.Sir Anthony feels it is important to make Caithness as \u0026ldquoattractive as possible for people to come and work in the area.\u0026ldquoThere are still issues to be addressed but, overall, I think significant progress has been made. We played a part but it has always been a contributory role. The partnership is an enabler. The Scottish government has said this area could be an example for other places to follow.Sir Anthony says there is an expertise at Dounreay which \u0026ldquoa lot of places would give their eye teeth to have and it could be used to help the local economy.Caithness strengths are its people, their skills and the natural beauty of the place, but access to the area needs to be improved.Asked about any disappointments during his time as chairman of the partnership, he replied: \u0026ldquoI hoped MeyGen would have got the Contract for Difference \u0026ndash it covers an agreement on the price for the electricity generated \u0026ndash from the UK government, but they did not. That was disappointing. They will now have to find another way forward but are looking at opportunities.Sir Anthony decided to retire as he felt 10 years as chairman was long enough. \u0026ldquoI wanted to leave before people wanted me to, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was time for a change.\u0026ldquoI am delighted with the choice of Ian Ross as my successor. I have had discussions with him and would be willing to help him in any way I can.Sir Anthony, who is 80, will keep a watchful eye on what is happening in Caithness and plans to stay active with his many other interests and hobbies. He enjoys opera, and swims five times a week.He started his career as a systems engineer with IBM in 1962 and went on to become its chief executive and chairman.Sir Anthony and his wife Jennie live in London and have a son, Paul, and a daughter, Caroline.Wednesday 11 Jul 2018 8:37 AM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Subsea 7 order hailed as very good news for Caithness","story":"A MULTIMILLION-pound order that has been won by Subsea 7 and will create up to 130 jobs was described yesterday as \u0026ldquovery good news for Caithness.The company has been awarded a contract by Shell for a development at its Penguins field which lies 150 miles north east of Shetland.Subsea 7, which has yards at Wester and Hastigrow, will build two pipeline bundles in Caithness as part of the deal. One is 4.6 kilometres long and the other 2.7 kilometres.They will be used by Shell to develop the potential reserves in the Penguins field.Subsea7\u0026rsquos local site manager, Willie Watt, said: \u0026ldquoWe would be looking to make a start on this project by the autumn of next year and launch in the late spring of 2020.\u0026ldquoThis is very good news for the site and for Caithness. It is a testament to the capabilities of the people and the product that major companies keep coming back to us.The confirmation of the latest contract comes just months after Subsea 7 won an order from Statoil for its Snorre oil and gas field in the Norwegian sector of the North Sea.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

This could run into millions of pounds and put at risk the future viability of the business.The company have also met with local Orkney MSP, Liam McArthur, to express their concerns about the delay.As the start of this month, as Mr Matheson stepped into the shoes of the previous minister for transport Humza Yousaf, it was announced that lack of agreement between the Scottish Government and Pentland Ferries had led to no discounted fares being introduced in Pentland Firth ferry routes, by the Government\u0026#8217s self-set deadline of the end of last month.Andrew Banks, Managing Director and Owner of Pentland Ferries said: “We want these passenger subsidies implemented as soon as possible but we need to be 100 per cent sure that the scheme complies with state aid rules.  We have never had any subsidy from the government and even though this scheme gives money to the passenger, not the operator, the minister has told us that we would be liable for any repayment if at a future date the scheme is deemed illegal. This could run into the millions and could finish us off.“We cannot take that risk and we have a responsibility to our staff, our community and family to make sure the scheme works for everyone. We want to work with the Minister and his team to discuss a way forward so that we can all benefit from reduced fares. This scheme will be fantastic for our business, attracting more visitors to the islands and making it cheaper to travel to the mainland for residents. So we want this unlocked as soon as possible. We welcome the Minister’s willingness to gain a full understanding of the detail and very much hope to be able to meet him in Orkney soon.”The minister, Mr Matheson, was asked for a response to the comments from Pentland Ferries and Mr Banks. At the time he replied, Transport Scotland said the invitation had not yet been received so the minister could not comment.However, Mr Matheson did say: “The Scottish Government remains committed to delivering reduced ferry fares to the Northern Isles. I am conscious that there is a great deal of interest in this issue amongst users of the services. As I begin my new role as Transport Secretary, I want to ensure that I gain a full understanding of the detail — it is already very clear to me that planning to introduce reduced fares on the Northern Isles network has been a complex and challenging piece of work.“As a first step, we will cut fares on the Aberdeen-Lerwick and Kirkwall-Lerwick services from June 30. These reductions will be around 20 per cent for both passengers and cars.“On routes to Orkney, it has been necessary to engage with commercial operators on the Pentland Firth. We set out a very fair and reasonable proposal that would maintain competition, enabling them to protect their existing market share. Unfortunately, not all the commercial operators have felt able to agree to our proposals. This means we cannot currently implement reduced fares on any of the routes to and from Orkney without the risk of legal challenge.“This is both disappointing and frustrating, but I am determined to work through the issue to see what more can be done. I have asked Transport Scotland to undertake some further work to see what measures, if any, we can take. As part of that, we are willing to reopen talks with commercial operators.  I will provide a further update to stakeholders and to Parliament as soon as I can, with a view to bringing the full benefits of the scheme to the people of Orkney and Shetland.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766362.1531165163!/image/image.jpg","title":"nicola sturgeon keen to create scottish public owned energy firm","story":"        The feasibility of a Scottish state-owned energy company is set to be examined.

Tonight, the World Cup semi-final between England and Croatia will attract record-breaking TV audiences, not only in England but in every part of the United Kingdom. For Scots, given our long memories of epic struggles with England on and off the pitch, who will we be supporting?            This has been an unpredictable and enjoyable World Cup, where Russia and Fifa have exceeded my expectations and have delivered a spectacular reminder of what the beautiful game represents. But England’s role in this festival of football, has, for Scots, always to be seen through the prism of history, identity, nationalism/patriotism, politics and yes, the irritating, arrogant and overblown remarks of English football commentators!            But let’s not overlook the major issue in this discussion – Scotland didn’t qualify for Russia. We haven’t qualified for 20 years, so our ambiguity and ambivalence towards England, is understandable in historical terms but irrelevant to our immediate and dire predicament as a declining football nation.England’s progress in the competition has benefitted from a very easy group stage, but no one should underestimate the improvements made under Gareth Southgate. England has done well so far and have never had a better chance to reach the final. If Scots want to support them, that’s okay by me, but I will retain my neutrality and hope that the best team wins, preferably without a penalty shoot-out. You can’t transfer your football loyalties, but you can certainly give praise where it is deserved. We need to learn from other countries, not resent what they are doing. It makes little sense for Scots to adopt the attitude “anyone but England”! Winning the World Cup is the “landing on the moon” moment for any footballer and their country. If Harry Kane is asked next Sunday to step up and accept the trophy as World Champions. What a fantastic achievement that would be and “well done England”.Our football relationship with the “Auld Enemy” goes back a long way. It is now time to recalibrate, move on and focus instead on our own dismal international football performance. This should be the focus of our anger, frustration, and national despair. We have wasted too much emotional energy on England and its football team over the years. Too often in the past our football rivalry has become a vehicle for the worst excesses of being Scottish. At a time of rapid modernisation, political renewal and a new sense of national confidence, there are bigger priorities.READ MORE: Scotland ‘could host World Cup 2030 matches as part of joint UK bid’On a recent visit to Inverness to deliver a talk on Brexit – another product of delusion, nostalgia, and sentiment on the part of England – I stopped to have a cup of coffee on the battlefield on Culloden Moor. This is always a good venue to charge batteries, not in any nostalgic nationalist way, but merely to enjoy a great historic place to reflect, in what is a strangely peaceful part of Scotland.            In 1746 Culloden was the last battle ever fought on British soil. The Jacobites were routed and destroyed by the Hanoverians in the same time it takes to play the first half of a Scottish Premier League game. Accepting a bit of historical license, let’s read Scotland versus England for Jacobites versus Hanoverians. So much historic and emotional capital has been invested in our games with England. This is not to say these historic clashes – with crowds we can now only dream about – didn’t matter. The fixture between Scotland and England was played annually between 1872 and 1983. In the early days of the game, after the SFA was created in 1873, the Scotland vs England match made a great deal of sense. These were the first two countries to form associations. Some of the games were spectacular battles, providing some magnificent football and some of the highest attendances ever seen in world football – ten of the largest attended games, attracted nearly 1.5 million fans at Hampden. But its importance, to Scottish football, was past its sell by date. In my view the Home Championship and the Scotland-England fixture – covering over a century of football – had become a major distraction for a country that needed to invest more in European and International football, direct the patriotism and nationalism of Scotland to bigger ambitions, and call time on a fixture that seemed to be more than just a football match. Defeating the Auld Enemy – not always guaranteed – became an obsession and a major distraction. It made sense for this fixture to be abandoned in 1983. I also enjoyed my own piece of nostalgia that day, thinking back to 1967 when Celtic won the European Cup and Scotland defeated England at Wembley where Jim Baxter tormented the English team, only a year after they had won the World Cup. Football memories are especially precious in a country where we seem to have stopped dreaming about future glory and have instead to content ourselves with arguing about who we should support in Scotland’s absence. We must get the Ghost of England Past off our back.READ MORE: Euphoria to defeat: the untold story of Scotland’s 1978 World Cup            Success can have a spectacular impact. I was enthused and inspired by the reaction of England to their victory over Sweden. Nearly half the population of their country watched on TV, it was party time and a nation celebrated the success of their team. The pride, passion and patriotism of a nation expressed through football was remarkable. But I wanted it to be Scotland. Why were we not there I kept asking myself? We think we have better fans than the English, so what if it had been Scotland clinching a penalty shoot-out or scoring a spectacular last-minute goal, what might our reaction have been?Everyone would have been glued to their TV screens, the country would have come to a standstill, and there would have been an incredible outpouring of national pride and that sense of achievement only success on the world stage can bring. This is the reality that should fire our desire for the transformation of the game in Scotland. Scotland has the potential to be successful. It has nothing to do with the size of population. It has nothing to do with England. It has everything to do with the size of our ambition and the determination to make the national team – both male and female – our number one priority.Our preoccupation with beating England, and on many occasions, hating England, may have been at the expense of investing more emotional capital and national fervour in other directions. Our football, like our politics, has too often seen England as an historical focus for our weaknesses and opprobrium, not our strengths and ambition.For 20 years and five World Cups, we have failed to qualify. We are fading fast from the minds of the international footballing community. This is not acceptable, neither is it inevitable. This crisis is home grown. The founding fathers of this great game must be turning in their graves, as we squander the legacy of the early years, ignore our undoubted football DNA, and replace the golden age of Scottish football, from the 60s to 90s, with decline, lesser ambitions for our national teams and a failure to take responsibility for what we are doing. The advent of devolution and the growth of nationalism have shifted some of our energy, enthusiasm, and passion for the game, away from football and in to politics. The time when nationalism was worn on the back of a football jersey is over. But hopefully we haven’t bought into the idea that the present state of the game is all we can expect. Scotland was a successful footballing nation with a self-belief that created so many legends and beautiful memories. Agonising over England isn’t going to solve our football problems but winning the World Cup might!"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766791.1531292198!/image/image.jpg","title":"maggie chapman scots radicalised by indyref are ditching neo liberalism","story":"        The politics of SNP are, as might be expected from a \u0026#8216national\u0026#8217 party, representative of politics more broadly, both in Scotland and throughout Western Europe. We are at a point of rupture between neo-liberal consensus and several competing programmes for the future.                In 2014, the SNP-led Scottish Government produced a white paper that set out a vision of continuity: an independent Scotland would be slightly better in every regard than a devolved Scotland, but would not be in any way different (we would keep the monarchy, Sterling, the dominant economic model etc). As such, it was a manifestation of the dominant politics of that period: all changes proposed were in continuity with the prevailing system rather than seeking to change it.            It now appears that this was one of the final acts of that period of neo-liberal consensus: the Scottish independence referendum opened up a new, radically different space for politics in which the old certainties had truly melted into air.             A referendum that was supposed to change nothing but the constitutional status of Scotland appears to have changed everything but the constitutional status of Scotland. We have ended up with an ever more energised public making their opinions felt on issues as diverse as fracking and the renewal of local democracy. READ MORE: Nicola Sturgeon: Growth Commission report candid about indy challengesAn SNP Government most comfortable managing a neo-liberal consensus has been pushed into all sorts of uncomfortable positions as the rupture in our politics opens up the earth beneath them.In the last couple of years, I have found Gramsci’s analysis that “the old world is dying, the new world cannot yet be born” becomes truer by the day. And this brings us to the Growth Commission: it is an attempt at reclaiming ideological space, and the commander of this political venture in revanchism is former SNP MSP, Andrew Wilson.It is hard to separate Wilson the author of the Growth Commission from Wilson the PR man at Charlotte Street Partners, whose company’s clients notoriously include the fracking firm, Ineos. In the SNP, as in our politics more generally, we see a contest between the dying ways of the old world and the attempt to create a new world.            We are familiar, whether we know it or not, with the way in which neo-liberalism weaves its story: things that are opinions become truth things that are possible become impossible choices are constrained before the debate has even begun. As Noam Chomsky outlined in The Common Good: “The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.” It is telling, therefore, that Wilson’s attempt to recapture the ideological direction of the independence movement has not been accepted as an unproblematic truth but has been cast into the public realm for debate.The first victory for the radical independence movement has been to deny this report the veneer of being uncontested. That Nicola Sturgeon was unable to accept the report but had to insist that it was “starting a debate” shows how far politics has come since the White Paper in 2014.             READ MORE: Growth Commission is ‘second biggest mistakes of Nicola Sturgeon’s career’It is important that we recognise and claim this victory and use it to start building our own project for an independent Scotland that creates a new world of genuine equality and social justice, and in which we deal with the urgent economic and environmental crises.Predicting what will happen in politics is a mug’s game. But, there is the strong likelihood that there will be an independence referendum soon. We need to take Nicola Sturgeon at her word: the Wilson report must start a debate. The approach we took in the first referendum since devolution charts a course for this. Ideas like Universal Basic Income, the creation of an industrial strategy to create a zero-carbon economy, and the case for a Scottish currency have become widely accepted in the popular imagination. We need to build on these and develop new ideas to shape the debate and make the case for an independent socialist Scotland.            Our focus must be on ways to harness Scotland’s renewable energy industry for social good, and to democratise the economy. The Scottish National Investment Bank should capitalise renewables projects for all public bodies. We should give workers the right to buy their own businesses to be run as cooperatives. We must build new housing to end the housing crisis to be owned through councils and cooperatives. We must find ways to create a publicly owned, zero-carbon public transport system that makes the most of the shift to electric vehicles and automation. And, we must have a debate that brings these ideas and others into the public imagination. I was proud of the role Green ‘Yes’ forces played in helping to create this debate in the referendum four years ago. And I will ensure that it does the same thing in the next referendum.• Maggie Chapman is co-convener of the Scottish Green Party and rector of Aberdeen University.

As the economic, political and cultural power of China grows, the prominence of Chinese is also growing.                 Many cities, including Edinburgh, are training guides and providing signage in Chinese in order to be ‘China ready’. British business is also starting to realise that being ready to trade overseas will in future mean being ready to speak Chinese to China.            But, given the average Brit’s unwillingness to learn any foreign language, it is perhaps unsurprising that there are few confident non-heritage Chinese speakers in Britain and opportunities to learn Chinese in school are limited.             In Scotland, students were first able to sit Chinese exams in 2009, yet in 2017 only 144 did so. We must do better than that.In Edinburgh, we are doing our bit. In partnership between my school and two state schools and with generous funding from the Swire Chinese Language Foundation, we’ve established the Swire Chinese Language Centre Edinburgh (SCLCE) to extend opportunities for pupils to study Mandarin Chinese from primary school to Higher exams.\u2028READ MORE: Boom in Scotland’s Chinese tourism market revealed by Nicola Sturgeon in BeijingIn the past, too many Chinese learning schemes have struggled on account of a lack of long-term commitment. You can’t expect pupils to commit to learning Chinese unless their school can guarantee that they will be able to take at least a Higher in Chinese and that their path through to the examinations will be well resourced and supported by high-quality teachers. That is exactly what the Swire Centre does – and it also provides a rigorous system of leadership and quality-assurance, something that can be difficult to achieve where Chinese teachers are working in isolation and often in part-time roles. In all, the SCLCE can call on five Scottish trained and fully registered teachers and at any one time at least three of those will be teaching in state schools in Edinburgh. In the last academic session, more than 600 pupils across 12 different state schools have benefited from this approach.We’re proud that our latest recruit to SCLCE, Brooke Walker, was recognised by the General Teaching Council for Scotland last month as one of their National Probationers of the Year. Brooke is employed by George Watson’s College but she spent her time during her probationary year in five state schools – two primary and three secondary – where her enthusiasm and passion helped to spread opportunities to learn Chinese where they did not previously exist.READ MORE: Study reveals details of first Chinese citizen who became a Scotsman            Amongst those to benefit most have been pupils facing some huge challenges in their lives and who have previously found foreign language learning unrewarding. Chinese is different and pupils engage with it differently, helped by opportunities to experience elements of Chinese literature, music, dance and cuisine. And soon a fully-funded visit to Beijing that Brooke is helping to lead will expand pupils’ horizons in new and exciting ways.Whatever the future holds it is difficult to imagine that China will not have an influential voice in shaping it. We must do all we can to understand that voice and, what is more, to grasp this opportunity to place a non-European culture at the centre of young people’s educational experience for the first time in our educational history.

The resignations of Boris Johnson and David Davis make the least-damaging form of Brexit more likely, writes First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.                The twin resignations of David Davis and Boris Johnson are the first time in more than 35 years that two UK Cabinet ministers have walked out within the same 24 hours. The last time it happened, the UK was grappling with the Falklands crisis.            That fact alone is a measure of how serious the situation facing the Prime Minister now is.            But the truth is, Monday’s events were always on the cards – it was just a question of when, and which of the Brexiteers would finally break ranks.That it happened within not much more than 48 hours of the Chequers summit, which was finally supposed to have brought unity to a warring cabinet, shows how perilous the position is for Theresa May.Before examining what this means for Brexit, it is worth recounting the fact that we are now more than two years on from the referendum result, but the UK Government has still not published the white paper outlining what it actually wants in leaving the EU. That will finally emerge later this week, unless more unforeseen events delay it further still.But that two-year delay in spelling out any kind of coherent position is simply inexcusable. The truth is that Brexit has always been more about the internal politics of the Tory party than it has been about the national interest.First of all, it was about the Conservatives’ attempt to see off the supposed threat from UKIP, and then, since the referendum, it has been about the ongoing battle of ideological purity within Tory ranks, as many of their MPs have sought to outbid each other in who can call for the most extreme Brexit possible.            READ MORE: Second Brexit vote in 2019 possible, says article 50 authorThe last two years have been, in some ways, the culmination, or at least the latest and perhaps defining chapter, of a 40-year civil war within the Conservative party.But that internal obsession, in putting party interest ahead of the national interest, is a simply unforgiveable abdication of responsibility for any government.The irony is that, for all the talk of Brexit being betrayed, the UK Government is still determined to take the UK as a whole out of the EU, the single market and the customs union. Scotland, of course, voted for none of these things.            I believe the Chequers plan is a step forward in that it appears to offer more realism than we have heard from the UK Government to date, although that may not be saying much. And, of course, we still do not know whether or not as a package it would be acceptable to the EU, in that it still appears to be cherry picking, trying to divide the four freedoms which are the cornerstones of the single market.It is also horrendously complicated and, of course, it excludes provision for services, which account for almost 80 per cent of the Scottish economy, and a similar proportion of the UK economy as a whole. Around a third of our exports are services exports, so while the plan is a step forward from where Theresa May and her Cabinet were a couple of weeks ago, it is nowhere near good enough to protect all our vital economic interests. An extreme Brexit, of the kind threatened by the Tories, also poses a direct threat to Scotland’s long-term economic well-being for many decades to come in the shape of the risk it poses to our working-age population.That threat is one that hangs over the whole of the UK, but the differing demographics of Scotland mean that it is more true of the Scottish economy. Immigration is a subject that may be difficult for politicians to talk about, but it is one that we have a duty to be honest with people about, because the simple fact is that we need to continue to attract the best and the brightest talent from elsewhere. That is an economic imperative for Scotland, but is something that is directly threatened by Brexit.READ MORE: No-deal Brexit ‘would clear Scottish supermarkets of food in two days’            Some commentators have speculated that the events of recent days have raised the prospects of a no-deal Brexit, whereby the UK crashes out of the EU next March with no agreement at all to take its place.However, looking at the arithmetic in the House of Commons, I do not believe there is a parliamentary majority for a no-deal outcome. And I also think that after the Davis and Johnson resignations it is highly questionable whether there is a majority for the Chequers plan as it stands.In my view, the only thing that actually stands a realistic chance of commanding a majority in the House of Commons, as well as being the right thing for the interests of the economy, is continued membership of the single market and customs union. I have been consistent in saying that I do not want to leave the EU, in line with what people in Scotland voted for, but if the UK is to leave then the least worst outcome is one that keeps us in a single market which is around eight times bigger than the UK market alone.That is supported by practically all mainstream economic analysis. And it is significant that in recent days we have started to see more and more businesses speak out about the very real threat which Brexit poses to jobs, investment and living standards right across the UK.There is now a chance, I believe, that the events of this week will help pave the way for the least damaging Brexit. That was not the intention of David Davis or Boris Johnson in resigning, but it may yet be their legacy."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4766914.1531259603!/image/image.jpg","title":"remembering 100 years of the raf s tenacity and gallantry","story":"        The Queen has praised the Royal Air Force for its \u0026#8220tenacity, skill and gallantry\u0026#8221 as she was joined by senior members of the royal family at the centrepiece of events marking the force\u0026#8217s 100th year.                Standing in the forecourt of Buckingham Palace yesterday as she presented the Queen’s Colour to the RAF, the Queen spoke of the “remarkable contribution to defence” over the past 100 years.            A vast array of more than 100 RAF aircraft roared and thundered across the skies of London. The Queen and members of the royal family watched the biggest display of military aircraft in recent memory from the palace balcony.            In their biggest ever formation, 22 Typhoon jets spelt out the number “100” in the sky – an added surprise for the royals, personnel and the public spectators who had packed out the streets to watch.The Queen spoke proudly not only as the RAF’s Air Commodore-in-Chief, but also as a citizen who remembered the Battle of Britain and as a daughter whose father King George VI served with the RAF.She said: “Presenting the Royal Air Force with a new Queen’s Colour provides an opportunity to congratulate the service for your remarkable contribution to defence over the last 100 years.“Tenacity, skill and gallantry have been your hallmarks as you helped safeguard freedom and security in many parts of the world.“I remember the Battle of Britain being fought over the skies above us and we shall never forget the courage and sacrifice of that time.” The Queen also took the Royal Salute at the ceremony as her relatives, including the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, watched nearby.            It was 100 years ago on 1 April 1918 the Royal Flying Corps and the Royal Naval Air Service merged to create the RAF – the world’s first independent air service.At just after 1pm yesterday, Puma and Chinook helicopters began the spectacle. They were followed by aircraft, including a Lancaster, Spitfires, Hurricanes and three F-35 stealth fighter jets.Drawing the spectacle to a close was the Red Arrows, who in traditional aerobatic style streamed red, white and blue smoke down the length of the Mall. The Queen recalled how her father was the first member of her family to qualify as an RAF pilot and served alongside the service’s founder Lord Trenchard.Members of the royal family including the Queen, the Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex earlier attended a service at Westminster Abbey.             More than 2,200 people packed Westminster Abbey, with dignitaries including Prime Minister Theresa May   Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn attending. Charles, William and Harry all chose to wear No 1 RAF uniform to the abbey, with Kate wearing a Dacre Brooch – which was presented to her by the Air Cadets in 2015.She also wore a coat by Alexander McQueen, and a hat by Sean Barrett, with Meghan choosing to wear a dress by Dior and a hat by royal milliner Stephen Jones."},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers. But not causing them.I would venture to suggest that long after life has ceased on  this planet there will still be episodes of change which will also be natural and normal except there won’t be anyone around to grumble, fret or lead campaigns !!\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 19 ","story":"Shetland’s young sports competitors retained their hold on the Stuart Cup at the weekend, with the margin of victory, in the end, being fairly comfortable.\nGoing into the last event of the junior inter-county, the netball, Orkney had to win by 32 points to overhaul the visitors’ lead. Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at. And there are also leather footballs from Cee \u0026amp Jays Intersport for the runners-up.\nSo whether you are a subscriber to the theory that the best players all hung their boots up decades ago, or you believe the standard of today is much better than yesteryear, get your thinking caps on and have a look at the details above.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

This was affectionately branded the \u0026#8220Emmerdale\u0026#8221 farm.\nIn 1998 the firm was one of two which set up in newly opened fish processing units at Gremista, funded by the Lerwick Harbour Trust (now Lerwick Port Authority) and Shetland Enterprise.\nNearly 20 years after that optimistic opening, the storied business is to close its final chapter.\n\u0026#8220We kent it was in the air\u0026#8221, Mr McNab said, \u0026#8220we could see it was in the figures.\u0026#8221\n• More in this week\u0026#8217s print edition of The Shetland Times.\nSeven more private sector jobs gone.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say.

Alley.\nScott Duncan (24), a former Kingussie High School pupil, has just returned from his dream adventure to the United States with a team of fellow meteorologists.\nHe got up close and personal with several tornadoes and massive electric storms during the trip of a lifetime which started on May 19, with the quartet returning on Saturday.\nThe daredevil and talented photographer captured breathtaking snaps of the huge storms as they crossed Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Texas.\nScott told the Strathy: \"The four of us flew out to Tornado Valley in the hope to witness some of the planet\u0027s most extreme weather.\n\"We decided to put our meteorological skills together and chase the storms ourselves.\"\nThe group of Reading University graduates rented a car and travelled 7000 miles over the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an

Even with the introduction of new flights our air connections remain some of the most fragile across these isles.\n\u0026ldquoThe Smith Commission was very clear when it stated that: \u0026lsquothe power to charge tax on air passengers leaving Scottish airports will be devolved to the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government will be free to make its own arrangements regarding the design and collection of any replacement tax\u0026rsquo, yet, as we have seen time and time again with this Government, the arrangements on offer, limits the ability of the Scottish Government to make changes to benefit the Scottish economy.\u0026nbsp\nIn his response to the Highland MP, Mr Jenrick confirmed that his department was willing to work closer with the Scottish Government to find a solution to the problem, recognising the commitment outlined in the Smith Commission.\nResponding after the debate, Mr Hendry said: \u0026ldquoI am glad that the UK Government recognises it has failed to hand over APD in a workable way, and that Airport Departure Tax cannot be implemented by the Scottish Government without a solution to this problem.\n\u0026ldquoI hope that the assurances from Mr Jenrick today, are followed up by meaningful action from the UK Government, to enable the Scottish Government to introduce its reduced Airport Departure Tax, while protecting the Highlands and Islands exemption.\"\nWednesday 11 Jul 2018 8:39 AM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/web-ad-sales-large.jpg","title":"former sabhal mor ostaig chairman","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nFormer Sabhal Mòr Ostaig chair Duncan MacQuarrie was celebrated this week with the first road in the new Kilbeg Village development, Rathad MhicGuaire (MacQuarrie Road) named in his honour during an official ceremony held on Monday.\nThe ceremony was carried out by Kate Forbes MSP and recognised the key role which Mr MacQuarrie has played in the college\u0026#8217s development over many years. Sabhal Mòr Ostaig principal Prof Boyd Robertson said, \u0026#8220This is a richly-deserved honour for Duncan which recognises the hugely important contribution he has made to the development of the college over many years and the vital contribution he has made to the development of the Gaelic language and culture and to the advancement of Gaelic and Gaelic-medium education, both as a teacher and as a former HM Inspector.”\n“Duncan\u0026#8217s critical input to Sabhal Mòr Ostaig’s development in its challenging formative years was marked by his steady stewardship, as a former chairman and his pioneering work, alongside that of his fellow trustees, demonstrated an exemplary vision and commitment without which what is now the National Centre for the Gaelic Language and Culture would not have existed.”\n“For that, all who have benefited from this wonderful and inspiring place, over the intervening years, owe him a great debt of gratitude and it is for that reason we celebrate with him here today. It is fitting therefore that his name will forever be associated with Sabhal Mòr Ostaig and with the development of Kilbeg village, a new sustainable Highland community which places Gaelic language and culture very much at its heart.”\nMs Forbes, extending her own congratulations to Mr McQuarrie, said: “This recognition of Duncan MacQuarrie is well deserved for his years of commitment to the Gaelic language and Sabhal Mòr Ostaig. The opportunities afforded to a new generation of Gaelic speakers are thanks to people like Duncan MacQuarrie who had the sheer determination, vision and love for the language to persevere. \u0026#8220Today, the education, employment and cultural opportunities enable Gaelic speakers to live and work in their preferred language in a way that would not have been possible without Mr MacQuarrie\u0026#8217s efforts.\u0026#8221\nPlans for the next phase of the affordable housing site \u0026#8211 which will soon be submitted for full planning consents \u0026#8211 will be delivered through a creative partnership involving Sabhal Mòr Ostaig the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust, the Highland Council and the private sector and will see the creation of up to 31 units of housing on the site.\nThe units will comprise a range of models and types of tenure, including rent to buy, self-build, housing for the elderly and, affordable for-rent housing.

The change came when my grandmother remarried, and so then the family name became Davis.”\nFor 37 years “MacKenzie country” has been his base, and these days it’s fishing rather than football which is his passion. Yet before making the move north with wife Vi to build the Craigmore Hotel in Gairloch, Harry Davis had enjoyed a remarkable sporting life — recovering from multiple bullet wounds in the Korean War to carve out a glittering football career with Rangers.\nTalk about “dual contracts” may have loomed large over Scottish football in recent months, but here was one ex-professional who really knew what it was like to serve two paymasters.\nA native Fifer, but brought up in Perth, Harry was an emerging talent with East Fife when he signed up as part of his national service to join the Black Watch. He soon found himself in the thick of the bloody, but often forgotten, Korean War where in the midst of conflict he suffered injuries from which it would take him over two years to recover.\nRemarkably, not only did he return to full health, he resumed his football career with gusto — signing for Rangers in 1956. He would enjoy a memorable eight-year spell with the Ibrox club, winning three league titles, two league cups and a Scottish Cup, as well as playing in the first Scottish side to reach a European final.\nA fearsome defender known as the “Iron Man”, he was never one to shirk a tackle on the pitch, and he’s not afraid to offer an opinion off it either — as he documents in a compelling autobiography which recently hit the bookshelves.\nHis is a tale far removed from the anodyne offerings served up by today’s breed of pampered millionaires. Having witnessed and experienced what he did on the battlefield, it’s hardly surprising that Davis had little time for those less appreciative of their sporting talents.\nTake, for example, the Rangers and Scotland great Jim Baxter.\n“I don’t dispute Baxter’s talent — he was a class player, but he wasted it,” he says ruefully. “He got privileges no one else got and it upset a lot of players in the team. He only turned it on once every three games and for the rest of the time, when your backs were to the wall, Baxter was nowhere to be seen.”\nHe describes Willie Waddell, the man who led Rangers to their only European trophy, as a “lucky manager” who had used his position as a sportswriter to undermine predecessor David White — a man Harry Davis had returned to Ibrox to assist.\n\nIT SEEMS CLEAR that wartime experience — and the discipline and work ethic it instilled — would leave a lasting imprint on everything Harry Davis did thereafter. But, ironically, his prowess on the football field might actually have spared him from active service altogether.\nHis military call came just after he had broken into East Fife’s excellent post-war team under Scott Symon — the man who would later bring him to Ibrox. And he adds: “I had a couple of opportunities, one to be a PTI in the army, and the other to take an airborne course.\n“It was all a scam to get you to play in the army team and I turned them all down. I was quite happy to go and thought it was all a bit of an adventure.”\nThat sense of wide-eyed wonder would soon give way to the full-blooded horrors of war, as he found himself fighting off Chinese forces intent on advancing further south on the Korean peninsula.\nHe remembers that many caught in the thick of the fighting were simple conscripts — scarcely prepared for the brutality they would encounter. Indelibly marked in his memory is the image of one desperate soldier running deliberately into enemy fire and to his death.\n“He was away with the birds,” he added. “I tried to stop him, but just at that moment a shell landed on top of our trench — all the hairs on the back of my hand were singed, but we were sheltered and escaped the full impact. But by the time I got up he was off again, and disappeared.\n“I couldn’t do anything about it, but that stayed with me. You can’t blame the guy — he was just a conscript as well.\n“There was always a little bit of ill feeling in that these conscripts were shipped out to the battlefield, yet regular, more experienced soldiers from the Black Watch were left behind in Germany.”\nHarry’s contribution to the war effort ended in the spring of 1953, though to this day he has no idea where the bullets which left him wounded actually came from. Years later, a former colleague contacted him to say he believed he had been responsible.\n“I said to him it might have been him, it might not have been. Who knows? But everyone was in a state of panic, and again we go back to conscripts. I certainly wouldn’t place any blame on him.”\nThe stray bullets had caught him on the back of the foot — fracturing his heel, but mercifully just missing the Achilles tendon. Having also suffered abdominal damage, Harry Davis would spend months recuperating in a Japanese hospital before returning to the UK to continue a slow road to recovery.\nIn the far east a nursing sister from Stornoway would become something of an inspiration, but it is Harry’s biggest regret that on leaving Japan he would never see the woman again.\n“She was marvellous and encouraged me so much through all the operations, the bad nights and bad days,” he added. “I made a point that I would go and see her, and when I built the hotel up here I thought I’d be able to find her. I only knew her as Sister MacKenzie, but she was from Stornoway and I believe she had something to do with the Post Office over there.\n“But then I did hear from one source that she had died — I never got to make contact with her. It’s one of the great disappointments of my lifetime.”\nON HARRY’S RETURN HOME doctors gave him little hope of ever playing top-level football again — sometimes in fairly graphic terms.\n“One doctor at the military hospital in London told me that my only hope was that my bowels were in such a state, defenders were likely to slip on what would come out! It didn’t look very encouraging.”\nYet after being helped back to fitness by David Kinnear — a physiotherapist and former Ibrox player — Harry Davis would eventually get his career back on track.\nHe resumed action for East Fife, and in 1956 got the call from Symon to follow him to Ibrox.\nIn Glasgow, he initially learned the ropes in the reserve side — one of his memorable early encounters bringing him into direct contact with the Celtic legend Charlie Tully, who by this time was at the opposite stage of his career.\nBefore too long Davis would join a first-team pool that included vintage names likes George Young, George Niven, Sammy Baird and Alex Scott, and Rangers lifted the league at the end of his first full season in 1957.\nIn something of a golden era for the Scottish game, Davis regularly played in front of crowds topping the 100,000 mark, and he remembers a vibrant and competitive league where in his first few years the main challenge came from a Hearts team which claimed two league titles.\n“If we had fewer than 40,000 at a game it was a disaster,” he said. “But regularly the crowds were 60-70,000 and for big games the 100,000-mark wasn’t unusual.”\nA degree of European success followed, as Rangers reached the European Cup Winners Cup Final in 1961. There they would be outclassed by a fine Fiorentina side, and tellingly Harry feels the Scots simply refused to heed their continental lesson. Half a century on, and the same basic mistakes continue to be made.\n“They were ahead of us,” he said. “Scott Symon was a great manager, no question, but he didn’t keep up with modern techniques. He still said get the ball to the winger, get the winger up the field and cross it and get the centre forward to head it into the net. That worked in the old days, but it didn’t work when you played these continental teams.”\nAfter winding down his playing career with a season at Partick Thistle, Harry took the manager’s job at the grand old institution of Queens Park. It was a time he enjoyed immensely, though the lure of Ibrox once again tempted him back across the city — this time to hook up with White.\nThat spell in the dugout was to prove less successful than his playing days, with Rangers then in the shadow of Jock Stein’s great Celtic side. Yet some redemption would arrive at Dundee where White and Davis led the Dens Park club to a memorable league cup final triumph over Celtic in 1973. A few months later the pair gained revenge over their old nemesis Waddell, dumping Rangers out of the Scottish Cup at Ibrox.\nDundee would prove to be Harry’s last staging post in football — and thereafter he set his sights on the quiet life in the north west Highlands.\nTHESE DAYS his football involvement is limited to appearing alongside former team-mates at charity fundraisers for the Erskine Trust, for which he is also to donate most of the proceeds from his book. However, he still keeps one eye on developments at Ibrox, even if he struggles to comprehend the team’s recent high-profile fall from grace.\n“The honest answer is that I just don’t know what to make of it all,” he said. “One conclusion is reached one week, and a week later it’s turned around again. But I do believe a number of teams were quite happy to get rid of them because they were strong competition. I don’t think that was right.”\nAsked for his personal highlights in the game, his answer is a simple one.  He just reels off a list of the players he played with, and it reads like a who’s who of greats for fans of the Ibrox club.\n“I joined Rangers and played with George Young, George Niven, Baird, Billy Simpson, Bobby Shearer, Alex Scott, Jim McColl — a great team. And then by the end I had also played with John Greig, Ronnie MacKinnon, Ian MacMillan, Millar, Brand, Baxter and Wilson. How many people can say that?”\nA Scotland cap may have proved elusive — “in those days they only picked 11” — with a place on the reserve list as close as he got to pulling on the dark blue.\nNevertheless, Harry Davis had long since proved his mettle on the international stage — and he still has the scars to prove it.\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/7s.jpg","title":"comhairle must replace barra housing","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nComhairle nan Eilean Siar must replace land they gave away for housing in Castlebay, Barra, because it was meant to be kept in perpetuity for recreational use.\nLast month, Housing Minister Kevin Stewart cut the turf on the Corran Ciosmul development at Horve. However, the six houses are to be built on what was a King George V Playing Field, which was set aside and protected in 1962.\nFor anyone to build on this land they must notify and obtain the consent of Fields in Trust, a charity that acts to protect all KGV land. Even though the comhairle took over the management of the land in 1984 they must still obtain the trust’s consent.\nThe Barra Sports Forum have been pressing the comhairle for years to transfer a piece of derelict land near the Co-op, which is adjacent to the KGV area, for use as an all-weather pitch.\nA spokesman said: “The sports forum urge the comhairle to fulfil their legal and moral obligations to the people of Barra and Vatersay to protect the sports and recreation land in Horve by righting this wrong: firstly, by filing for a change of land use to Fields in Trust from ‘sports and recreation’ to ‘housing’ and secondly, by transferring an equivalent area of land to the KGV playing field in compensation for land lost to housing. Only by doing this will the comhairle avoid the danger of stalling the desperately needed new housing that helps secure the future of our islands.”\nRichard McKeever of Fields in Trust the charity recognised that that “sometimes it may be necessary” to change the use of recreational land.\nHe added: “As part of our protection, we have a responsibility to ensure the local owners and managers of these spaces seek our consent to undertake any changes regarding land ownership, land transactions, erection of buildings and structures \u0026#8211 and that proposed changes fit with the purpose of the protected space and benefit its recreational use. We are currently in constructive dialogue with the council and await their proposals for replacement recreational land of an equal or better standard which will be protected for the local community to enjoy in perpetuity.”\nThe housing development at Corran Ciosmul is being undertaken by the Hebridean Housing Partnership, which has owned the land since 2006.\nKatrina Rowlands, HHP development manager, said: “Due to the nature of how the titles were transferred to HHP, the burden in relation to the Fields in Trust was not recorded therefore the responsibility to meet the Fields in Trust conditions remains with the comhairle. We are aware that the comhairle’s legal team are in discussions with Fields In Trust to resolve the matter.”\nA spokesman for the comhairle said discussion with Fields in Trust were continuing.\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n"}]
