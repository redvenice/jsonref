This year this children in year 7 shall be included and will get their jab from health teams visiting secondary schools, DHSC said.All frontline health and social care workers will also be urged to get their free vaccine. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u0027We have outlined in our flu vaccine plans that those eligible under at risk groups – including diabetes - are to receive a flu vaccine as a priority, and we have secured additional flu vaccines for those who need them.\u0027This is the biggest flu vaccine programme in UK history and healthcare staff will work to vaccinate more than 30 million people, millions more than received it last year.

David and Gladys Wright lived on the then 10-acre property in Phoenix’s Arcadia neighborhood until they died in 1997 and 2008. Family members sold the house after Gladys Wright’s death.A developer bought the house in 2012 with plans to tear it down. Their plans immediately drew an outcry from architects and historical-preservation advocates.It was spared the wrecking ball when another developer bought it with the intent of preserving it.But the new owner’s proposal to expand the home with a garden pavilion and underground museum failed to be realized, partly due to opposition from surrounding residents, and the property found itself on the auctioneer’s block in August.The mid-century contemporary home has spectacular views of the distinctive Camelback Mountain that forms a dramatic backdrop to the Phoenix metropolitan area.It was one of the last homes designed by Frank Lloyd Wright, who died in 1959.Hassett said: “We had several offers over the past few years, but the buyers always wanted to only tear down the house and build all new ones.“The sellers wanted nothing to do with those proposals, as their intention from day one when they purchased it back in 2012 was to make sure the home and its integrity would be preserved as such a historic Frank Lloyd Wright masterpiece should and will be.“These are the perfect buyers for this property, and we are all extremely happy that we were able to put this all together.”Azbigmedia reported that the buyers plan on personally restoring the Wright House including installing a new copper roof which was part of Frank Lloyd Wright’s original plan.It was announced in January that Wright’s architecture school, with students based at Taliesin West and other locations, was to close this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5eba8e80b1296528dae6d6a0efc496971424b3a2/0_0_3500_2399/master/3500.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b07a7cec3aa65ea5ddf5739c184c71d 660w","title":"businesses and customers share your experiences of eat out to help out","story":"We’d like to hear to from staff, owners and customers on how they feel the scheme has beenThe government’s ‘eat out to help out’ scheme has meant more than 64m meals have been claimed since the beginning of August.When introduced, its aim was to incentivise the public to dine at restaurants by allowing customers to claim a half-price discount up to a cost of £10.

Two of the suites will be ready to use in the next two months, earlier than expected. AstraZeneca will pay Oxford Biomedica £50m under the deal.AstraZeneca, which is developing the vaccine with researchers at Oxford University, said its global manufacturing capacity was close to 3bn doses.News of the deal came as AstraZeneca announced on Monday night that it had begun late-stage trials of the vaccine in the US, where it plans to enrol 30,000 adults, as part of a global programme to test the product on 50,000 people.AstraZeneca, along with US company Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech which are also developing a coronavirus vaccine, have said they could have data by October to secure approval from US regulators for emergency use of their respective products.Last week, scientists raised hopes that trials of the Oxford vaccine could have gathered enough data to show whether it works and is safe by the end of the year, before being submitted to UK regulators for approval.Britain’s other big drugmaker, GlaxoSmithKline, is also developing a coronavirus vaccine in partnership with France’s Sanofi Pasteur that is due to go into human testing this month. The UK government has bought millions of doses of both vaccines, along with the one from BioNTech and Pfizer, and another one developed by France’s Valneva.Last month, Russia approved a controversial Covid-19 vaccine – Sputnik V – for widespread use after less than two months of human testing. It said it would push ahead with large-scale manufacture, even though the World Health Organization said the vaccine should not be produced until it had completed phase 3 trials. Those final trials, involving 40,000 people, began last Wednesday. Doctors and teachers will be among the first to be offered the jab on a voluntary basis starting this month while the shot will be mandatory for military personnel.China has several potential coronavirus vaccines in late-stage testing and has been giving one of them to health workers and border officials under “emergency use” since July, according to a senior health official."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bc64d1b061c419b8ab14fb24ed18250d82ab60c/0_170_5120_3074/master/5120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4cf6cbd1fe79c4e7434b974a8ab0d450","title":"uk mortgage covid stamp duty bank of england coronavirus lockdown","story":"Bank of England figures show consumer borrowing up in July as coronavirus lockdown easedMortgage demand increased sharply and consumer borrowing rose for the first time in five months as the UK emerged from its Covid-19 lockdown in July, the Bank of England has said.The latest Threadneedle Street data showed the number of new home loan approvals jumped from 39,900 in June to 66,300 in July.The severity of the lockdown, which led to the closure of estate agents and prevented potential buyers from viewing homes, resulted in the property market coming to a virtual standstill, with the number of mortgage approvals reaching a trough of 9,300 in May.The gradual lifting of restrictions on the economy from May onwards also had an impact on demand for consumer credit, such as overdrafts, unsecured loans and credit card spending.The Bank of England figures showed that after a cumulative repayment of debt between March and June totalling £15.9bn, net borrowing in July of £1.2bn was similar to the average of £1.1bn a month in the 18 months leading up to the lockdown.The Bank of England also found that borrowing by non-financial companies stood at £4bn in July, close to pre-Covid levels, after hitting a peak of £31bn in March.Simon Gammon, a managing partner at Knight Frank Finance, said: “It’s clear from the strength of the recovery that the cut to stamp duty is working as intended and we can expect a sustained period of robust and competitive sales activity.“The future trajectory of the recovery will depend on how many people lose jobs at the end of the furlough scheme. Beyond that, the reduced stamp duty rates are due to end in March, and we’re likely to see a bottleneck of transactions build up in the run-up unless the government opts for an extension.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e6d482bca3fc535cbf4ce96c4ef6d6b9684ec31/0_68_953_572/master/953.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0be043bb6e75a07094a11b994598a2f9","title":"pebble pods and bubble domes six amazing places to wake up in northern ireland","story":"From quirky glampsites to boutique hotels with amazing views, discover the most enticing places to stay in Northern IrelandPebble Pods, Strangford, County DownA relatively new entry to the Northern Ireland glamping scene, but one of the most remarkable, this private location on the shores of Strangford Lough takes pod camping to a new level – and with only three two-person pods, you’ll never find it overcrowded.The glass-and-timber Pebble Pods resemble Hobbit holes, and have a host of amenities, but let’s focus on the most important: a private hot tub, thermal sauna, firepit and barbecue area, providing for year-round luxuriating by the cool waters of one of NI’s most gorgeous loughs.If you’re an active person, there are free bikes and even kayaks to help you explore the area. If you’re feeling more laid back, you can just hit the tub and let the world scurry on by.Lough Erne Resort, County FermanaghIf you’re after absolute luxury, why not go the whole hog? The sprawling, castellated Lough Erne Resort, housed on its own 243-hectare (600-acre) peninsula between the reedy shores of Lower Lough Erne and Castle Hume Lough, just outside Enniskillen, really is the last word in refinement.Starting your day with a choice between the resort’s two world-class golf courses sounds like our kind of dilemma: the Faldo course has been represented globally by local son Rory McIlroy, who holds the course record.For those who don’t have the golf bug, take heart: with an incredible Thai spa, world-class restaurants and access to the 40-mile-long splendour of Lough Erne, you’ll be fine.If it’s good enough to host the not-unpicky G8 summit (as it did in 2013), Lough Erne Resort is sure to satisfy your own exacting standards …And those who are after quality local food won’t need to look further than the resort’s Catalina restaurant, where guests can dine in luxury after a long day of exploring.Larchfield Estate, Lisburn, County AntrimIt’s fair to say Myrtle has been around for a while, seen a few tight squeezes, and is always ready with a warm welcome for her guests. Don’t worry, she’s not an over-friendly local – Myrtle is a lovingly-restored 1952 Saurer Swiss Army truck that now serves as one of Northern Ireland’s most inspiring glamping options at the gorgeous Larchfield Estate.The accommodation is suitably cosy and stylish, equipped with a log-burning stove, sun deck and a sauna housed in its own wooden pod with bucolic views of the surrounding greenery. Rise and shine after a night with Myrtle and set off to explore the 243-hectare (600-acre) estate. Mission accomplished.Killeavy Castle Estate, County ArmaghA gothic flight of fantasy built in 1836, Killeavy Castle is both grand and cosy: it features imposing medieval-style doors and turrets, yet the restored pile makes room for just four luxurious bedrooms within its castellated walls. Wake to the view from any of its 52 windows and you’ll feel like landed gentry.Elsewhere on the estate, the original mill, gatehouse and coach house have all been converted into stylish accommodation. There’s also a high-end spa, all on 142 hectares (350 acres) in the shadow of Slieve Gullion, the tallest mountain in County Armagh.Famed for its locally sourced food, Killeavy Castle Estate provides everything from sublime seven-course tasting menus to a famously good fry-up for breakfast.That’s your morning plans sorted.Palace Street Apartments, Derry-LondonderryPass through the famed city walls at the ornate Bishop’s Gate, then hang a sneaky left, and you’ll find yourself in a barely car-width street lined on one side by the kind of Victorian red brick you’d expect to see in an adaptation of Dickens.It’s also the very fitting home of the Palace Street Apartments, a lovingly restored, three-unit, self-catering gem. Step outside in the morning and you’ll find all of Derry-Londonderry at your feet. Within the confines of the old walled city, you’re only a stroll away from the historic Guildhall (as well-known for its political history as for its appearance in Derry Girls), St Columba’s Cathedral, where the original keys of the city are held, and the Diamond war memorial.That said, dark wood, oiled leather, antique furniture and deep beds come as standard in each apartment, making going outside an optional extra.Finn Lough, County FermanaghA lot has been written about the bubble domes at the eco-conscious Finn Lough resort in Fermanagh, but nothing can prepare you for the experience of waking snug and cosy in a luxury bed, and opening your eyes to see the dawn sky straight above you.These transparent domes offer uninterrupted views of the surrounding nature alongside high-end creature comforts: four-poster beds, ensuite bathrooms, and coffee machines to ease you into the morning the right way.Once you’ve recovered from the majesty of the morning there are woodland trails to explore, on foot or cycle, and a lake to linger by. There’s also a top-tier spa for those who aim simply to “sleep well, be pampered” – and who can blame them, when your bed is this spectacular?Come on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/345c28211f4ca1ea57842a60109e9d76c3d87992/0_116_6242_3745/master/6242.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b59877834e5319eb717de6309ac0365b","title":"surf cycle or hike go wild on northern irelands adventure coast","story":"Where can you hike along a world-heritage coastline, ride an Atlantic wave, then cycle around a puffin colony, all within a few miles of each other? The answer is along Northern Ireland’s Causeway CoastWhether you like to explore on foot, by bike or by water, Northern Ireland’s Causeway Coast could be the most scenic part of the UK you’ve never visited. Yet its natural attractions and ersity of landscapes make it perfect for anyone with an adventurous heart.Here we pick a few of Northern Ireland’s outdoor highlights, though the full range of opportunities extend far beyond what’s mentioned here. The best advice? Book a week and discover the possibilities for yourself.Explore by footAt the tip of Northern Ireland lies its most famous attraction – the Unesco world heritage site of the Giant’s Causeway. And there’s no better way to reach it than on foot, by following an eight-mile section of the Causeway Coast Way. Begin at picturesque Ballintoy Harbour, which Game of Thrones fans will recognise as a setting for the Iron Islands. Then head west along the signed coast path, passing sandy beaches, rock arches and a ruined clifftop castle before finishing at the Giant’s Causeway. The 40,000 interlocking basalt columns provide a fitting finale to one of the best walks in Northern Ireland.For something completely different, head to nearby Glenariff Forest Park. Set within the celebrated Glens of Antrim, the scenery here transports you to another world. Expect numerous waterfalls, wooden walkways deep within river gorges, and long-distance views along chiselled glacial escarpments. Signed hiking circuits of different lengths mean there’s a route for walkers of all abilities.Explore by bikeIf two wheels are your thing, Rathlin Island offers an outing that will remain etched in your memory for years to come. Lying six miles off the coast, the trip begins with a ferry ride from Ballycastle marina. You’ll need to bring your own bike due to Covid-19 restrictions, but the island can be explored in a few hours. The highlight is the eight-mile return trip to its western tip. Here the land ends in sheer cliffs that are home to both a lighthouse and Northern Ireland’s largest breeding seabird colony. There’s no better way to break your ride than descending to the RSPB viewing platform and, if you’re here at the right time of year – between April and August – watching the antics of hundreds of thousands of nesting birds. Regardless of when you visit, the views remain breathtaking all year round, and the sensual assault of sound and smell makes the trip back to the harbour feel positively peaceful.For a longer journey, back on the mainland try the signed cycle route between the Giant’s Causeway and Benone. This 22-mile trip can be completed in either direction, and follows a mixture of public roads and traffic-free paths. The ride takes you through the coastal towns of Portrush, Portstewart and Castlerock, with numerous opportunities to explore sandy beaches or stop for refreshments along the way.Explore by waterAnother great option is to leave the land altogether, and explore the unique coastline from the sea. This is a shore littered with caves, arches, tunnels and cliffs, and the only way to appreciate them fully is from the water.Sea kayaking is a great option, with several local companies providing all the equipment and guidance you need to begin weaving silently between the headlands. Choose from a half-day or full-day excursion, with incredible coastal scenery interspersed by a snack or lunch in some tucked-away cove along the way.If you’d prefer to embrace the waves then there’s the chance to try surfing instead – the neighbouring towns of Portrush and Portstewart are the twin meccas for local surfers. Hire a wetsuit and surfboard from the back of the beach, book into a lesson, then hit the waves. Whether you’re a beginner or a pro, you’re guaranteed a great time, with watery thrills and spills all part of the fun.Novices and experts are also welcomed by the local sailing centres. Take a lesson or join a skippered yacht for a longer adventure, spending anything from an hour to a whole weekend on the water. With the emphasis on guests doing as much of the sailing as possible, it won’t be long before you know your jib from your gybe.Something differentOf course the activities mentioned here just scrape the surface of what’s available, and with a little imagination almost anything is possible. How about a catch-and-sea boat trip, where you start by going sea fishing, then return to watch a professional chef prepare your bounty, garnished by other local delicacies?Or a horse ride, featuring a gentle hack through the glens or an adrenaline-filled canter across the beach? Organised scuba ing, coasteering it’s all here, with countless options to suit all ages and abilities.So what’s keeping you away? The Causeway Coast is a goldmine of activities and opportunities, its charms are just waiting to be discovered.Due to Covid-19 restrictions, the mini-bus tour, bird sanctuary and bike hire are not currently available, for more information visit: rathlincommunity.orghomeCome on over to Northern IrelandPlan your visit to Northern Ireland with everything you need to know about things to do, where to stay and more at irelandnorthern-irelandGet advice about travelling to Northern Ireland, including the latest information on Covid-19 restrictions at nidirect.gov.ukcoronavirus"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9badd696cf7250b942409a58df622affc1797640/0_289_4335_2601/master/4335.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=602a2b8c1e724b8e0c625a814c0ebe58","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.We’d like to hear from teachers and parents about how they are preparing for the reopening of schools, and how they are feeling about it.If you are in Scotland, where schools are already open full-time, we’d also like to hear how it has been so far.We are particularly interested in hearing from parents about whether they will be sending their children back to school, and how they feel about possible fines for not doing so.You can get in touch by filling in the form below, anonymously if you wish.

It comes in ivory and “sky captain” grey. Last month the label dressed model Halima Aden in a custom-made burkini for Sports Illustrated .After the fashion industry has been criticized for its lack of ersity and racism, following the Black Lives Matter protests, the Hilfiger hijab could suggest major fashion brands are stepping forward with inclusive practices. But Hassanah El-Yacoubi, founder of modest fashion brand PFH, says that it also shows market changes rather than cultural ones.“It’s more indicative of an ever growing Muslim consumer culture that is lucrative and thriving more than ever now,” El-Yacoubi said.The Islamic fashion industry is estimated to be worth $88bn by 2025, according to Grand View Research. “I think the timing reflects the need to address a growing desire in the market by consumers – especially millennials and Generation Z – for greater inclusivity from the brands they support,” said Arthur Zaczkiewicz, the executive editor of fashion industry publication Women’s Wear Daily.Research has shown that a younger tranche of consumers are less concerned with “fitting in” and more with making choices that reflect their own values.After years of being “othered” by mainstream fashion, the perception of modest fashion is altering. “I believe we are experiencing a permanent cultural shift instead of a fleeting style that’s in vogue temporarily,” said El-Yacoubi.Zaczkiewicz said: “It’s important to understand that modest fashion is not a trend. It’s how people live.”Yet most observers believe the Hilfiger hijab is only a small step towards a wider acceptance of Muslim dressing.“No matter how mainstream or celebrated modest fashion has become, the reality remains that Islamophobia and anti-Muslim sentiments have been at an all-time high in the US,” said El-Yacoubi.“Since modest fashion is generally perceived to be a phenomenon spearheaded by hijab-donning women, they usually bear the brunt of such beliefs,” said El-Yacoubi.Muslim clothing continues to be a political lightning rod and a sartorial subtext for Islamophobic rhetoric.In July, the German state of Baden-Württemberg banned burqas and niqabs in schools. It followed similar bans in Sri Lanka and Denmark. Other countries that have banned Muslim dress include Latvia, Austria, Bulgaria and Belgium.Last year the French sporting goods label Decathlon dropped plans to sell a sports hijab after politicians’ reaction exposed religious tensions there, again focused on Muslim women’s attire.Still, the launch of the hijab follows on from Hilfiger’s promises to be more inclusive. Last month its parent company PVH announced a program to increase opportunities for people of color people at the company.

In 2017 the government entered a partnership with the ILO to begin to reform its labour system.Guy Ryder, the director general of the ILO, said: “By introducing these significant changes, Qatar has delivered on a commitment, one that will give workers more freedom and protection, and employers more choice.”Yousuf Mohamed Al Othman Fakhroo, the minister of administrative development, labour and social affairs said: “These these new laws mark a major milestone … and will benefit workers, employers and the nation alike.”The new minimum wage of 1,000 riyals (£205) per month will be introduced in six months’ time for existing contracts, replacing the current temporary minimum wage of 750 riyals. It will apply to everyone, including domestic workers. If employers do not provide accommodation or food, they must pay an additional allowance of 800 riyals.Rights groups have welcomed the reforms but said the new laws must be enforced rigorously if workers were to benefit.Amnesty International said Qatar had taken a significant step to protecting migrant workers but that the minimum wage remained too low. “To truly make a difference it will need to be regularly reviewed and progressively increased to secure just and favourable conditions for workers,” said Amnesty’s head of economic and social justice, Steve Cockburn.A worker in Qatar told the  that the price of food had skyrocketed in recent years. “It costs 400 riyals a month just for food these days, even if you are sharing a kitchen with colleagues or eating in a canteen. So it’s very hard for workers on a low salary,” said Chudamani Sapkota, a foreman from Nepal.“If these reforms are implemented in line with the announcements, and migrant workers are genuinely able to change employers, it will be significant,” said James Lynch, a director at migrant rights group, FairSquare. “It would remove a central element of the kafala system, giving workers more ability to determine their own fate if their employers deceive or mistreat them.”Lynch said the main test for the government would be whether it could enforce the minimum wage. A temporary minimum wage was introduced in 2017, but delayed or unpaid wages have remained commonplace. “Qatar has to address this issue urgently and ensure that workers can rely on getting their pay in full every month,” said Lynch.In a report published last week, Human Rights Watch said wage abuse remained persistent and widespread, “including delayed wages, punitive and illegal wage deductions, and, most debilitating yet all too common, months of unpaid wages for long hours of gruelling work”.A spokesperson for Migrant-Rights.org, which campaigns on workers’ rights across the Middle East, said: “We welcome the announcement and recognise the potential for positive impact on the lives of workers in the country … It is critical that these reforms are followed by stringent implementation and prosecution of those who fail to comply.”Despite the latest reforms, Qatar has yet to address a series of other issues facing workers. Hundreds of workers continue to die each year of unknown causes, but the government has failed to commission research into their deaths. Trade unions remain outlawed and the majority of low-wage workers continue to pay illegal recruitment fees to secure their jobs, leaving many in debt bondage."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/931dc0971c1ba5d16e2d482f8c108d52cc10777e/0_0_2126_1420/master/2126.jpg?width=660\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3bec95812429dbd736ab9305d0befe7c 660w","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

This officially marks all of the top white women in pop as problematic. Hate to see it.”Another said: “If you haven’t quite understood cultural appropriation, look at Adele’s last Instagram post. She should go to jail no parole for this.”Writing in the comments section of the Instagram post, a user said: “Bantu knots are NOT to be worn by white people in any context, period.”However, others came to Adele’s defence. David Lammy, the Labour MP for Tottenham and shadow justice secretary, dismissed the allegations of cultural appropriation as “poppycock”.He tweeted: “This humbug totally misses the spirit of Notting Hill Carnival and the tradition of ‘dress up’ or ‘masquerade’ Adele was born and raised in Tottenham she gets it more than most. Thank you Adele. Forget the Haters.”Claudia Webbe, the Labour MP for Leicester East, said: “Carnival is a contested event in which either the usual order of things are overthrown, unhinged and disturbed, or it can reinstitute and reinforce the very order its meant to overthrow. In this sense Adele embraces the spirit of carnival as an event which is qualified to do both.”The singer’s celebrity friends also appeared to approve of the look. The model Naomi Campbell, whose mother was born in Jamaica, commented with two love heart emojis and two pictures of the Jamaican flag.Jamaican musician Popcaan also appeared to be a fan, sharing a fist emoji and a love heart. And the actor Tessa Thompson, who stars in the sci-fi TV series Westworld, commented with a flame emoji.The Notting Hill carnival is an annual event that celebrates black British culture, but this year it moved online due to the coronavirus pandemic. Adele recently shared a snap celebrating “Queen” Beyoncé, following the release of the visual album Black Is King.

The borough now has a higher infection rate than Salford and Bury, where the restrictions will remain in place.Hancock had been warned by Trafford council, its director of public health and its two Labour MPs that it was too early to ease measures covering its 235,000 residents. However, they were overruled by the health secretary. The influential Tory MP Graham Brady, whose constituency includes part of Trafford, had been pushing for the area to be removed from the restrictions.Andrew Western, the Labour leader of Trafford council, demanded an urgent explanation on Monday: “It would be common courtesy when you’re overruling the local authority, the director of public health and the vast majority of local politicians, to explain the reasons why – particularly because we’re now seeing the spike in cases we thought we may do.“Nobody has bothered to explain it or give any justification whatsoever. We have to explain that decision to our residents. How can we have confidence in it if they have not bothered to tell us the reasons why?”Restrictions will also be lifted from Wednesday in Bolton, Stockport, parts of Bradford, Calderdale and Kirklees in West Yorkshire and Burnley and Hyndburn in Lancashire. A ban on households mixing remains in place in Oldham, Pendle and Blackburn – which have the highest coronavirus infection rates in England – and in the city of Leicester. A ban on two households mixing indoors remains in place in Manchester, Salford, Rochdale, Bury, Tameside and Preston.In Bradford, nine wards in two Tory constituencies will see restrictions eased in line with the rest of England from Wednesday while the city’s remaining 23 wards – mostly represented by Labour MPs – will remain under local lockdown despite recording few recent Covid-19 cases.Bradford’s three Labour MPs and its council leader accused Hancock of “playing politics” with the restrictions, and warned that removing inidual wards would be “unenforceable” and confusing for residents.It is understood that the city’s local outbreak control board, comprised of its most senior health officials, had also cautioned against this approach in a meeting with Bradford’s five MPs last week.The council and Labour MPs had asked for the whole of Bradford to be lifted out of the restrictions, with targeted interventions in areas with a higher number of cases. However, the two Conservative MPs – Philip Davies and Robbie Moore – advocated a more localised approach.Judith Cummins, the MP for Bradford South, said on Monday she had written to the health secretary urging him to publish the scientific evidence behind his decision. She said: “In these difficult times it’s imperative that the secretary of state for health and social care not only act with political neutrality in determining these matters, but importantly he should also be seen to act without political bias.”Two other West Yorkshire council areas, Calderdale and Kirklees, have also been carved up, with neighbourhoods in two Tory-voting constituencies removed from the restrictions from Wednesday.Tim Swift, the Labour leader of Calderdale council, said it had agreed as a compromise to measures being eased in part of the borough, but added: “Looking at the proposals across the north it seems that this is a political decision to appease Tory MPs rather than something that is led by clear scientific evidence.“I would now challenge the government to publish the scientific advice which underpins the decision they have taken.”The Department of Health and Social Care said it was “regrettable” that some councils and MPs had not been able to come to a consensus on the appropriate measures for their area.It said it welcomed the “constructive and collaborative” approach taken by many local authorities and that it would continue to work with all bodies in the areas “where this has not yet been possible”, adding: “We are prepared to take decisive action to stop outbreaks to save lives and will remove restrictions as soon as they are no longer necessary.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67ec84e74c4d3f0eb4f002ff62058356ad26279b/0_0_2560_1535/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2a23abb65d1854424e8f22a580b77222","title":"little room for manoeuvre as uk covid cases rise say experts","story":"Weekend jump and reopening of schools could mean there are some difficult decisions aheadThe UK is at risk of a new surge of coronavirus infections, experts have said, as schools and universities reopen their doors and cold weather drives people inside.On Sunday the government reported 1,715 new cases, the highest daily number since 4 June and the highest number for a weekend day since mid-May. On Monday 1,406 new cases were reported. Numbers collected over the weekend are often lower than those for other days of the week owing to lower levels of testing and reporting delays.Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said Sunday’s figure was “quite a big jump”. He said data for the rest of the week would be needed to get a clear idea of the scale of any uptick, but the figures tied in to a broader trend of an increase in infections in the UK since early July.Prof Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said: “What it clearly demonstrates is we’re in a position where case numbers are going up. So we don’t have much room for manoeuvre.” Ferguson said the reopening of schools could lead to a further rise. “I think that will pose more stress and is likely to lead to a somewhat fast increase in case numbers. And then at that point there will be a need to make potentially some difficult decisions to get on top of it,” he said.“We do need to have a system in place to respond to those outbreaks, to implement rapid testing in schools, and measures to control spread.”While some have suggested the rise in infections could largely be explained by increased testing, Hunter said the figures told a different story. “You can’t explain it all by the amount of testing,” he said. In the first seven days in July, 232 tests were done for every positive case reported, and in mid-August it was only about 164 tests per positive case, although in recent weeks the figures appear to have stabilisedOther data reveals a similar trend. Office for National Statistics figures suggest there was an increase in infections in England during July, and that it appears to have levelled off in recent weeks.Pagel said: “Even if all the new cases were in hotspots, they are hotspots because transmission is increasing a lot in those areas. That represents spread of Covid.”Ferguson said the rise was expected given the relaxation of lockdown measures, adding that local measures would continue to be needed where outbreaks occur, as has already been seen in Leicester and Greater Manchester.The situation is not yet as severe as in many countries in Europe. Spain, Italy and France are all experiencing large rises in cases, leading to concerns about lockdown easing. Again, experts have said an increase in testing does not fully explain these rises. Pagel said she was surprised the UK had not seen more infections, given the situation in Europe, but there were a number of possible explanations. “We are still doing way more home working than the rest of the continent, and we are also much less likely to go out still,” she said.Ferguson agreed. “We have relaxed lockdown less than those countries, and later, and actually now our testing system is close to being the equal of Germany’s and it’s probably a slightly better position than France.”Pagel said there should be checks on cafes and restaurants in the UK for measures such as social distancing, as well as on whether people returning from abroad were quarantining if instructed to do so. “We have policies that we are not actually enforcing.” She said the government’s new drive to reduce home working was “a really bad idea”.Prof Rowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said upticks in infections were more likely to be spotted when case numbers were low, but the increase in the proportion of tests coming back positive was of concern.“We know that because we are relaxing restrictions in the broad for various reasons – schools are going back, universities are going back – we will get sparks,” he said. “It is whether or not test and trace is working well enough to stamp those out quickly.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e27f754b139f4f234b72d7a7e6c4f3f0dc5bb330/0_559_4032_2419/master/4032.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2424be8e890a64527e2bccf818425bfc","title":"marcus rashford takes aim at child food poverty with new taskforce","story":"Manchester United forward outlines plans to build on free school meals victory in letter to MPsThree months after he forced a government U-turn on summer holiday school meal vouchers, Marcus Rashford has set his sights on a bigger target: the end of child food poverty in Britain.After MPs scrambled to line up behind the charismatic young Manchester United footballer and political activist, it is now the turn of the food industry.In a letter to MPs released on Tuesday morning, Rashford unveiled a “child food poverty taskforce” he has formed with brands including Aldi, Tesco, Deliveroo and Kellogg’s, set out three major new policy goals, and issued a rallying cry for long-lasting change.“Food poverty is contributing to social unrest,” he wrote, reflecting on a series of recent meetings with families in need of the same support he counted on as a child. He described “watching a young boy keeping it together whilst his mother sobbed alongside him, feeling like he has to step up to protect his family and alleviate some of that worry. He was nine years old.”“I know that feeling,” he wrote. “I remember the sound of my mum crying herself to sleep to this day, having worked a 14-hour shift, unsure how she was going to make ends meet. That was my reality.”The ambitious plan that Rashford sets out calls on the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, to fund the implementation of three key policy recommendations from the national food strategy, a government-commissioned report highlighting huge economic and health inequalities, which will be aggravated by the coronavirus crisis. The proposals are backed by Aldi, Co-op, Deliveroo, Iceland, Kellogg’s, Sainsbury’s, Tesco, Waitrose, and the charities FareShare and the Food Foundation.“Mothers and fathers are raising respectful, eloquent young men and women, who, in reality, are part of a system that will not allow them the opportunity to win and succeed,” Rashford wrote. “Add school closures, redundancies and furloughs into the equation and we have an issue that could negatively impact generations to come. It all starts with stability around access to food.”While the food strategy – written by Leon founder Henry Dimbleby – was commissioned by the government, ministers have not yet said they will act on its recommendations. The three points highlighted by Rashford are the expansion of free school meals to every child whose family is on universal credit, an expansion of holiday provision to all children on free school meals, and a significant boost to the value of Healthy Start vouchers for families with young children.The footballer, who is working in partnership with FareShare and the Food Foundation, said in his letter that the progress made by his previous victory on free school meals “was only ever going to support this issue in the short-term”. And he said a recent visit to the Evelyn Community Store in Deptford, south-east London had redoubled his commitment to the cause.“I spoke to a mother recently who, along with her two young sons, is currently living off three slices of bread a day – soaking them in hot water and adding sugar, hoping that the porridge consistency might better sustain the hunger of her one-year old child,” he wrote. “This is the true reality of England in 2020.”Rashford is understood to have devoted much of his brief off-season to his work on food poverty – visiting food banks, working to create his new coalition with the food industry, and calling his co-workers on the project for updates as often as four times a day.Shortly after his visit to the Evelyn Community Store, he convened a Zoom call with supermarket leaders to agree the taskforce plan. As well as backing the national food strategy goals, members of the group agreed to use their social media platforms to share the stories of some of those facing food poverty to raise public awareness of the issue.One of those on the call told the : “He’s formidable. This is obviously the right thing to do, but I think for some people, it doesn’t hurt that you don’t want to get on the wrong side of Marcus Rashford.”Henry Dimbleby said that the three recommendations endorsed in Rashford’s letter were chosen because “we need pace, and we need it to be deliverable – these are things which exist and which we can ramp up”.“To be well-nourished is the foundation of opportunity,” he added. “Any government serious about levelling up will ensure the most disadvantaged children have access to food.” He pointed to growing evidence of a new crisis in food poverty for young people brought about by coronavirus, with the number of people using food banks doubling in just a few months and the vast majority of new users being young people with dependent children.Natasha Ricketts, a volunteer at the Evelyn Community Store – which is supplied with food by FareShare– described Rashford as “an absolutely lovely guy. It’s massive, for a young guy to take on such a big task. He’s very humble, very down-to-earth, and it wasn’t that long ago that he was one of those kids himself.”Dimbleby agreed that Rashford had a vital role. “Having people whose own lived experiences inform their work lead the way is just so important,” he said. “Behind the scenes he’s doing all sorts of things he’s not even talking about.”Ricketts warned that it was not yet clear whether politicians and business would commit to following his lead in the long term. “But if not, they will have to answer why,” she said. “And that is the power of his voice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9f415079bb055cf566b444679f336a9dc0273699/0_0_3740_2245/master/3740.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f554e5923df0dcf251d46e3918c94a9a","title":"caleb ewan lays down marker and eyes more tour de france wins","story":"The Australian, who won stage three in Sisteron, has an eye on a seat at the head of the sprinting tableCaleb Ewan arrived at this Tour de France a different man compared to the one who made a commanding debut last year, when under stress that he later reflected on as unhealthy. Then, the Australian needed more than a week to work up to his career first stage win, but he has taken just a few days to notch his maiden victory of this campaign.Ewan won stage three of the 2020 Tour by pipping Irish champion and race debutant Sam Bennett (Deceuninck-Quick-Step) and Italian champion Giacomo Nizzolo (NTT) in a bunch sprint on Monday. The performance was a display of physical and mental fortitude from Ewan, who is intent on finishing what has been described as one of the hardest Tours in modern cycling in a bid to win again on the Champs-Élysées – an unofficial world championship for sprinters. Unlike Deceuninck-Quick-Step and NTT, who were clearly assembled at the front of the bunch with 16km to go, Ewan’s Lotto Soudal team were not visible until they moved up with 8.7km remaining. It was smart, given the headwind finish and that Lotto Soudal has lost two men. The 26-year-old Ewan likewise bided his time in the frenzied run to the line.“In the last kilometre I was literally too far forward, so I dropped back into the wheels,” Ewan said. “That gave me some time to rest the legs a little bit before the final lead-out. Coming from behind was a bit of a risk but I found my way through the barrier and I came with a lot of speed. In the end it worked out perfectly.” Ewan’s Tour last year was a coming of age tale. When asked in October to recall his debut, Ewan spoke of winning the Bay Crits in Victoria as a teenager when he was likened by an overzealous Australian media to Mark Cavendish and linked with a race he had only watched on TV. Ewan shouldered that expectation for the years that followed, and it compounded when former team Mitchelton-Scott reneged on sending him to the 2018 Tour. In 2019 he succeeded legendary sprinter Andre Greipel at Lotto Soudal and his infant daughter, born six weeks premature, was still in hospital when he left for the Grand Départ. “There was so much stress I guess leading into the Tour, it wasn’t healthy I don’t think,” Ewan said. “When I finished the Tour, it was the biggest relief of my life.”Fast-forward to 2020 and the story is not about verification or validation, rather a ferocious but considerate competitor, who has an eye on a seat at the head of the table. Ewan’s lead-up to this year’s Tour has not been without challenges – not least having to reset after an almost five-month competition shutdown due to a global pandemic. The eight-time Grand Tour stage winner is based in Monaco and lockdown protocols there prevented him from training outside for a stint. Also, the peloton had just four weeks of race conditioning from when the revised and condensed season resumed on 1 August to when the Tour left Nice under a cloud of virus-related uncertainty on Saturday. Yet it has not penetrated his composure. Ewan entered the Tour with an understated but clear surety in his own ability to not only compete but also stake a claim as the best sprinter in the WorldTour by season’s end. He is aiming to finish the Tour and less than two weeks later start the Giro d’Italia, where every marquee sprinter is slated to be. Ewan is not brash like some predecessors in claiming he is the best, especially in one of the most competitive and populated sprint fields seen for a long time, but his focus on quality victories over quantity is testament to the aim. When asked at the outset of the Tour how many stages he believed he could win – a stock standard question that nearly every sprinter responds to with a diplomatic “one and then we’ll see” – Ewan left it open. “The goal is to always win a stage, but you know it’s a hard question because if I go to this Tour de France now and if I’m the fifth best sprinter here and I win one stage then I’m going to be happy,” he said. “But if I’m the best sprinter here and I only win one stage and I miss out on four or five then I’m going to be unhappy. It depends on how I’m going compared to the other sprinters. If I’m going really good, then I want to come away with as many stages as possible.”Ewan won three stages on debut and has counted six opportunities, two now gone, to repeat if not improve on that feat.

The 28-year-old did not make it easy on himself, committing 41 unforced errors and eight double faults to fall to 0-3 lifetime against Djokovic.With the win the Serbian, who won his fourth title of the year at the Western \u0026amp Southern Open on Saturday, improved to 24-0 on the season.Afterwards Djokovic said: “Do I want to keep the streak going? Of course I do. But am I thinking about it as a priority every single day? No. But it’s there, it’s an additional motivation for me and it fuels me to play even stronger and even better and play to the right intensity in every match.”Having familiarised himself with Flushing Meadows’ unusually quiet environment during his victory in the Western \u0026amp Southern Open last week, Djokovic evidently did not lack for motivation in the way he set about his task.And despite some moments of frustration, the Serb will have been satisfied with another valuable workout as he gives chase for what would be an 18th grand slam title, and a fourth at Flushing Meadows alone.“The intensity was there, definitely,” said Djokovic. “I played really well in the first set, but in the second I lost my focus and kind of got stressed out a couple of times and screamed, so that’s obviously still there despite the empty stadium.“But this is what I bring to the court, I bring a lot of intensity and energy and sometimes my reactions are not always positive but I try to bounce back.”Next up for Djokovic is a second-round meeting with Briton Edmund, who defeated Alexander Bublik in four sets earlier in the day. Edmund immediately set his sights on Djokovic, whom he beat in three sets at the 2018 Madrid Open, sayinbg: “It’s a match for me that I’ve got nothing to lose.“I have the experience of beating him but he has also beaten me a bunch of times. He’s a top player and the type of player who is tough to break down.”The British No2 dropped the first set and was also on the verge of losing the third as Bublik served to go back in front. But Edmund rallied, breaking Bublik then reeling off eight more games in succession to wrap up an ultimately convincing 2-6, 7-5, 7-5, 6-0 success.Reflecting on his sluggish start, Edmund told Amazon Prime: “It could only get better really. There wasn’t anything I did right and I was annoyed – I needed to force myself to get going.”With the two other members of the sport’s Big Three – Roger Federer and Rafa Nadal – not playing at the tournament, Djokovic is a heavy favourite to hoist the trophy and pull within one grand slam title of Nadal (19) and two of Federer (20)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16084e661a73e8451a516817d1f32f0eb38e188f/0_305_4104_2463/master/4104.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=fd7bad8cbcd4753be5029741256999ef","title":"samsung galaxy watch 3 review the new king of android smartwatches screen battery","story":"Great design, screen, performance, battery and health-tracking, with long support and sustainabilitySamsung’s latest, the Galaxy Watch 3, is an all-round refinement of its previous excellent smartwatch efforts – slimmer, lighter and with a larger screen.The £399 Galaxy Watch 3 comes in two sizes (41mm or 45mm), two colours and with or without 4G, aiming to be the Apple Watch of Android, here reviewed in black with a 45mm case. It sits alongside the smaller, fitness-focused Galaxy Watch Active 2 and works with any brand of Android with access to the Google Play Store as well as an iPhone running iOS 9 or newer.The Watch 3 takes the design of 2018’s Galaxy Watch – there was no number two – and slims down its stainless steel body in all dimensions while adding a larger screen. The result is a thin, attractive traditional-looking circular watch that’s only 11.1mm thick and 53.8g in weight.The 1.4in screen is large, crisp and bright. It copes well with low and bright light, adjusting brightness accordingly, including a super-bright outdoors mode that comes on automatically. You can set the screen to be on all the time with a large array of attractive watch faces available, most of which are customisable. There are thousands more in the Galaxy Store, too.The rotating bezel around the screen acts as a jog controller for navigating the interface. Two buttons take care of back and apps functions. Press and hold the top apps button to activate Samsung Pay and the bottom back button to activate Bixby or your choice of app. Double press the bottom button to see recently used apps.The Watch 3 is water resistant to 50 metres, the screen is covered in scratch-resistant Gorilla Glass DX and the straps are standard 20mm or 22mm bands with quick-release pins. It ships with a high-quality leather strap that is much more supple and nicer than those that come with most watches.Samsung has used the same in-house Exynos 9110 processor in all of its recent smartwatches to great effect, including Watch 3. It has slightly more RAM at 1GB and double the storage at 8GB compared with the Watch Active 2 but performs very similarly.The interface is slick, snappy and lag-free. Screens and widgets whizz by as fast as you can turn the bezel. It is very close to the performance you get out of Apple Watch and far, far better than any Wear OS watch.Samsung uses its own operating system on its smartwatches called Tizen, here in its latest form with One UI 2.0. The firm offers software updates for its smartwatches for extended periods, which has resulted in watches four years old or more receiving updates recently and bodes well for the Watch 3.Tizen is based around a rotary interface, taking full advantage of that rotating bezel and circular screen, but it can also be swiped and tapped with fingers on the screen.It operates exactly the same as the Galaxy Watch Active 2 with minor improvements and slicker animations. Notifications appear as tiles to the left of the watch face and can be tapped to expand, actioned or replied to from your wrist. Widgets for various things are to the right.Swipe down from the top for quick settings or press the apps button for a list of apps. There are only a handful of good third-party apps, but they include Strava and some other fitness tracking apps, plus Spotify with offline music downloads and playback.The Watch 3 has Samsung Pay for contactless payments, which works well if a little clunkier than Google Pay, but UK bank support is limited. I use a Curve card, which is supported by Samsung Pay, to bind my unsupported bank cards and use them through it. Samsung recently launched its own version of the Curve card called Samsung Pay Card, too.Bixby is Samsung’s smart voice assistant. It works fine for simple tasks such as setting timers and other bits but can be a bit slow to activate and understand what you have said. It is more reliable than the previous version but is still the least polished bit of the Watch 3.Samsung Health has the same comprehensive health and fitness tracking features as it does on the Watch Active 2. It is one of the most complete suites of general health and fitness related monitoring on a smartwatch, including sleep tracking with blood oxygenation, stress and heart health, rivalling that from Apple and far better than Wear OS or rivals.Running tracking has new dynamics analysis, giving you a breakdown of your form, including asymmetry, foot contact time, flight time, regularity, vertical motion and stiffness. I’m not sure they will convince hard-core runners but it’s an interesting feature to have. Vo2 Max – a fairly common measure of cardiorespiratory fitness – matched my long-term readings from various Garmin devices on first run, which bodes well.The one negative is that it’s difficult to see when the watch has a GPS lock when preparing for a run, as it just tells you to set off. That resulted in it missing out on 200 metres of a run compared with a Garmin Fenix 6 Pro Solar.The Watch 3 has the hardware to perform an echocardiogram (ECG) and to monitor blood pressure but it has yet to be activated in the UK pending regulatory approval, which was recently granted in the US.For comparison, the Galaxy Watch Active 2 has an RRP of £269, the Fossil Gen 5 costs £279, the Fitbit Versa 2 costs £199.99 and the Apple Watch Series 5 costs £399.The Samsung Galaxy Watch 3 is the best smartwatch for Android by some margin, taking the crown from the already excellent Watch Active 2.It combines a slim, light and attractive traditional watch design with the excellent rotating bezel controller, a slick software experience, solid battery life and a bright, crisp and gorgeous always-on screen.Its health-tracking features are up there with the best. Notification handling on Android is good. There is an enormous selection of watch faces and while third-party apps are slim on the ground, they do include some key ones such as Spotify and Strava.Samsung offers long-term software support, the watch is repairable and the battery can be replaced if needed. But the Watch 3 isn’t perfect. Bixby still isn’t great, Samsung Pay support is limited in the UK and while it has the hardware to support them, the ECG or blood pressure functions are still pending approval.I also wouldn’t wholly recommend using one with an iPhone as there are significant limitations compared with an Apple Watch of a similar price.It is relatively expensive but if you want a great smartwatch for your Android phone, the Galaxy Watch 3 is it. If you want something cheaper, the Watch Active 2 is almost as good.Pros: slim and attractive traditional watch design, big and bright screen, bezel control, slick performance, solid battery life, excellent fitness and health tracking, 50-metre water resistance, standard 20mm22mm straps, long software support, battery can be replaced, cross platform.Cons: few UK banks support Samsung Pay, Bixby is weak, cannot display animated images in smart camera notifications, limited functionality with an iPhone, cannot use ECGblood pressure yet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/da3e2b50b960ea61af264a8d06d780958e1fdbae/0_0_945_567/master/945.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c2fd777f1945db804f9663a3bc112ce9","title":"georgia state university covid 19 low income students","story":"Most of Georgia State’s students come from low-income backgrounds hard-hit by the pandemic. The school could serve as a model for others nationwideIf anywhere was going to take a pummeling from the coronavirus, you’d think it would be a place like Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta.Georgia State is not a glamorous flagship university – that would be the University of Georgia in Athens, the spiritual home of the Bulldogs, REM and the B-52s. It’s more of a workhorse public institution, with a large population of students who come from low-income households and have to work at least one paying job outside their studies to make ends meet.How? The answer is that Georgia State is a special sort of university, one that, for the past decade, has overturned received wisdom about the viability of lower-income, minority, and first-generation students. It has proven that such students do not fail because they are not capable they fail because, at most universities, the bureaucracy throws obstacles in their way instead of helping them fulfill their potential.Georgia State is committed to helping them. Relying in part on big data, the university has learned to pinpoint problems and intervene early to redirect students heading down the wrong path. Sometimes that intervention involves rewriting schedules so students can take core requirements when they need them sometimes it means redesigning an intro course so students can learn at their own pace in front of a computer instead of getting lost in a large lecture hall.The university’s academic advisers don’t just sit back and wait for students to come in they are there from day one to guide each of them and respond any time the university’s computer system registers an alert – because of a bad grade in an important class, say, or an unexplained absence, or a delay in registering for the next semester.The upshot of these and many other innovations is that Georgia State has become both singularly successful – it has erased all achievement gaps based on race or class – and also singularly resilient. When the Covid-19 crisis erupted, Georgia State was able to rely on many of the systems it had set up over the past decade to steer its undergraduates away from disaster. Drop-out and failure rates this spring were down from the previous year. And while there wasn’t an actual graduation stage to cross, the number of students receiving a diploma was higher than ever.Nothing about closing campus and moving classes online was easy – Tim Renick, Georgia State’s student success guru, describes his job these days as looking for “hidden positives amidst all the really dark clouds” – but the university knew how to anticipate who was in trouble and how best to help them, because this was what it was doing already.When the federal government gave Georgia State $26 million in emergency financial aid under the Cares Act, the university knew how to distribute it, because some years earlier it had established a system of micro-grants for deserving students who found themselves a few hundred dollars short of their tuition bills.The way the grants work, students do not have to apply for anything Georgia State monitors their university accounts, uses data to assess their need and their academic performance, and then clears their debt. Using the same system, Georgia State was able to disburse 22,000 Cares Act grants in amounts ranging from $200 to $2,000 within 24 hours of receiving the money from Washington.Other universities initiated cumbersome application procedures or – worse – gave the same amount to every student. Georgia State, by contrast, was confident the money was going where it was most needed and knew, too, how much to hold back so students who landed in unexpected trouble over the following days and weeks could submit electronic receipts – for a car repair, or a hospital visit, or a rent payment that couldn’t wait – and get reimbursed.The university’s proactive academic advising system has proven similarly useful. In the first two weeks of remote learning, advisors were able to identify more than 8,000 students who either were not logging on or weren’t performing as expected. Some needed laptops or iPads, which the university was able to provide. Others were overwhelmed and needed financial or psychological guidance.Samantha Lapier, an academic adviser, said that throughout the spring and summer she heard at least twice a day from students who had depended on cheap university housing and subsidized food and were now sleeping on friends’ couches or in homeless shelters and going to bed hungry. “It’s the hardest thing to hear,” Lapier said.The university can’t resolve every problem, but it can prioritize. A few years ago, Georgia State introduced an artificial intelligence chatbot to answer incoming students’ questions about their financial aid paperwork, and now it is using the same technology to address the housing problem. When housing staff first asked who needed help with shelter, they received 2,000 replies within eight minutes and were able to improvise solutions for at least some of the neediest students.In this and other ways, the pandemic has proven to be less of an existential crisis for Georgia State than a moment of truth – the ultimate stress test of the interventionist model it has established. If the university passes the test, then the model will become compelling, if not irresistible, to other public colleges with large low-income populations which, up to now, have been reluctant to take the same bold steps.Most academic institutions are cautious by nature, but the pandemic – and the financial crunch that has only just begun – is making the status quo increasingly untenable.While many American universities struggle with high drop-out rates and gaping achievement gaps, Georgia State has shown how to eliminate both, while at the same time greatly increasing the number of lower-income students it admits and boosting its overall graduation rate.A minority student from a mediocre high school and a poor family is now just as likely to cross the Georgia State graduation stage as a child of wealth and white privilege – a singular achievement. In the wake of the George Floyd killing in Minneapolis and the widespread calls for a national reckoning on race, it is also striking that Georgia State, once a segregated whites-only commuter school, boasts one of the country’s most erse residential campuses and graduates more African Americans each year than any other university.Most of those universities, shockingly, are not designed to serve the needs of their undergraduate students. But the pandemic and the ensuing challenges might just shake them into realizing that they have to. College presidents, deans, and faculty chairs now understand that if they keep going down the same path, they risk seeing their undergraduate numbers melt away altogether, because students are already leery of paying top dollar for a remote education and they aren’t going to tolerate one that also dooms close to half of them to failure.Georgia State’s last big moment of truth came in the wake of the last economic crisis, in 2008, when state funding was being slashed and the university understood it had to cling to as much revenue as possible from tuition fees and student grants.Every public university in the country was facing a similar dilemma, and most of them chose to do what universities have most often done: they took advantage of the fact that people who can’t find a job tend to apply to college in larger numbers and raised their admissions criteria in the hope that a better-quality crop of students would last longer and graduate at a higher rate.Georgia State, by contrast, concluded that there was nothing wrong with its students – they were dropping out largely for financial, not academic, reasons – and there was little mileage in seeking to become more exclusive because it could never compete with either the University of Georgia or with Georgia Tech, whose campus sits 15 blocks away.At the time, the decision to take on more low-income and minority students was considered a bold, even a foolhardy choice, and Tim Renick, Georgia State’s head of student success, had to argue his case in the face of vigorous internal opposition.Things look rather different now. First, the Georgia State model offers proof of concept, with reams of data to back up the effectiveness of its programs. Second, over the past decade, student success has gone from “something nobody talked about, to something everybody talked about”, in the words of Hilary Pennington of the Ford Foundation.Third, the pandemic is dramatically altering the landscape of higher education to the detriment of boutique private colleges and in favor of large public urban institutions. The appeal of Georgia State is no longer just to lower-income students looking for a toehold and a pathway to the middle class, although that remains crucial. Students of all kinds are now questioning the value of going to a $70,000-a-year college out of state, with or without financial aid, when institutions like Georgia State provide excellent undergraduate teaching at a fraction of the cost. Enrollment in downtown Atlanta has hit a record high of 54,000 students as a consequence.“Of the realities available, Georgia State’s is a pretty good one,” said Allison Calhoun-Brown, Georgia State’s vice-president for student engagement. “Sixty-five percent of our students live within an hour of us, and now they don’t have to deal with the Atlanta traffic to come to class. We’ve already seen anecdotal evidence that kids who were going out of state this fall are opting for schools that are closer. We are going to be cost-effective for many families.”If Keenan Robinson had been one year further along in his studies when the pandemic hit, he would have been on the verge of graduating by now and all but assured of a job. Robinson is majoring in respiratory therapy – a highly marketable skill in the age of Covid. As it is, his life and routine, like everyone else’s, fell apart in a big hurry.Robinson had been going to class on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays and doing clinical work at an Atlanta children’s hospital on Tuesdays and Thursdays. Then everything was canceled, and he was given just a couple of days to clear out of university housing and move back home with his parents. “I went from doing a lot to doing not that much,” he said.The turnaround, though, came soon enough. He had an administrative job in the university advisement office, which he was able to keep because the advisers shifted their sessions online without missing a beat. His professors, meanwhile, went a step further. They recorded lectures and seminars that Keenan and his fellow students could watch at any time, and sent additional videos and reading material to make up for the fact that they were no longer meeting in person. “We ended up with more material than previous classes have had,” he said. “The professors said: do not stress yourself out. We’ll give you what you need.”This fall, Keenan will have to learn how to operate a mechanical ventilator, and the expectation is that he and his fellow students will meet in a large lecture hall with masks, if not also protective clothing from head to foot, in groups of no more than 10.It will be much the same story across campus. Georgia State is holding most classes remotely, making exceptions only for lab classes that cannot be taught offsite. While that will ensure the university does not suffer a debacle like the beginning of term at the University of North Carolina, it also raises an important question. How will the incoming freshman class adapt to the Georgia State model if they never leave their homes?Usually, those freshmen are grouped in “learning communities” of twenty-five students studying similar things. Usually, they meet their advisers in person, are introduced to students just a little older than themselves, and have an opportunity to join student groups.All these things can be replicated online, but it won’t be the same – and nobody is pretending it will be. “We’re trying to give students some sense of community, and of the resources available to them,” Renick said. “But we’re also running a university offsite that looks nothing like the one we’ve run for the past 20 years.”The outcome of this latest, unwanted experiment will be crucial. If Georgia State can hold steady and continue to lift students under extraordinary pressure – and, in the wake of the George Floyd protests, continue to deliver racial equity – it could point the way for much of the higher education world.“The circumstances are horrid, they’re not good at all,” Renick added, “but … all these systems we had in place are the exact systems that were needed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0b308079c51d14f1b1930f8fc44e25b56031ab2e/843_932_2919_1751/master/2919.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d67fbf79cb5e8152e5a03d95dcac15f1","title":"suv conquered america climate change emissions","story":"Exclusive new emissions analysis shows how much more dangerous for the climate SUVs are than smaller vehicles, and how embedded they have become in our livesby  Oliver Milman in New YorkThey are the hulking cars that have conquered the world. Spreading from the heartlands of the US to a new generation of eager buyers in China to dominate even the twisting, narrow streets of Europe, the sports utility vehicle, or SUV, has bludgeoned its way to automobile supremacy with a heady mix of convenience and marketing muscle.The rise of the SUV as the world’s pre-eminent car has been so rapid that the consequences of this new status – the altered patterns of urban life, air quality, pedestrian safety, where to park the things – are still coming into focus.But it’s increasingly clear that SUVs’ most profound impact is playing out within the climate crisis, where their surging popularity is producing a vast new source of planet-cooking emissions.Last year, the International Energy Agency made a finding that stunned even its own researchers. SUVs were the second largest cause of the global rise in carbon dioxide emissions over the past decade, eclipsing all shipping, aviation, heavy industry and even trucks, usually the only vehicles to loom larger than them on the road.Each year, SUVs belch out 700 megatonnes of CO2, about the entire output of the UK and Netherlands combined. If all SUV drivers banded together to form their own country, it would rank as the seventh largest emitter in the world.Climate activists may hurl themselves in the path of new oil pipelines and ladle enough guilt on to flying that flygskam, or “flight shame”, has spread from Sweden around the world but a mammoth, and growing, cause of the climate crisis has crept up almost unnoticed around us.“The global rise of SUVs is challenging efforts to reduce emissions,” Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA, admitted.Combining the weight of an adult rhinoceros and the aerodynamics of a refrigerator, SUVs require more energy to move around than smaller cars and therefore emit more CO2, overshadowing the car industry’s climate gains from fuel efficiency improvements and the nascent electric vehicle market.Emissions analysis commissioned by the  illustrate, for the first time in detail, how much worse for the climate SUVs are than smaller vehicles, and how they have helped transform our cities.“To avert the worst of the climate catastrophe, the transport sector needs to be completely decarbonized,” said Sebastian Castellanos, a researcher at the New Urban Mobility Alliance who calculated the emissions. “With the explosion in SUV sales, we are moving even farther away from our goal of decarbonizing the sector.”This global phenomenon has its roots and impetus in the US, where in the 1980s the car industry carved out a new category called the “sport-utility vehicle”, a sort of mash-up between a truck, a minivan and the traditional American family car. After successfully lobbying lawmakers to class these vehicles as light trucks rather than cars, binding SUVs to less stringent fuel efficiency standards, the industry set about slotting them into almost every arena of American life.Once a workhorse that lugged tools around or was used for bumpy off-road driving, the SUV morphed into the default option for families puttering around suburbia and even for people in the cores of densely populated cities. The look and cost of SUVs stretched to suit all tastes – the 1984 Jeep Cherokee, a boxy, spartan offering considered the first SUV, has spawned successors ranging from the compact Kia Sportage to the sporty Mercedes ML.The industry found that American drivers enjoy the lofty seating position of SUVs, as well as the capacity and the comforting feel of security their bulk provides, even if half of all journeys taken in the US are mundane trips of under three miles to run errands rather than high-octane adventures in the Rocky Mountains. For many Americans, SUVs invoke alluring qualities of fortitude and independence.“Pretty much everyone wants one now,” said Stephanie Brinley, principal automotive analyst at IHS Markit. “The family car is now a utility vehicle and not a sedan. Millennials like them, baby boomers like them. Americans like to take all of their stuff with them and automakers figured this out.”Marketing for SUVs is now so broad it no longer seems jarring to see ads of a beefy car-truck zooming around urban streets to take its occupant to a yoga class or to grab a coffee. Ford was so thrilled with its recent relaunch of the Bronco, a model infamous for being driven by OJ Simpson as he was chased by a phalanx of police cars in 1994, that it rolled out an eight-part podcast series in celebration.“Car companies looked at things that people value, such as macho-ness, ruggedness and protection of the family, and leveraged that,” said Harvey Miller, professor and director of the Center for Urban and Regional Analysis at Ohio State University. “These SUVs are named after mountains and other places you’ll never go to. They created a market that pushes our buttons.”As Bloomberg’s Nat Bullard noted in a recent tweet: “We don’t buy cars here. We buy big cars built on truck bodies, and we buy trucks and drive them like cars.” The US is now indisputably an SUV nation, a transformation that has had profound consequences for American cities as well as the global climate.To Miller, SUVs are a monument to a broader American failure that has seen pedestrians and cyclists forsaken for endless miles of road building, with non-car users forced to push what he calls “beg buttons” to pause traffic to enter roads that should be egalitarian public spaces. SUVs, according to Miller, not only bring a stew of pollution and an element of fear to those attempting to traverse roads on foot or bike, they are fundamentally inefficient. “You are taking a 200lb package, a human, and wrapping it in a 6,000lb shipping container,” he said. “For some reason we think that is a good way to move through a city. If Amazon used that rationale it would be out of business in a week.”Alarm has also been raised over the safety of SUVs, given that during accidents their elevated stature tends to strike pedestrians and cyclists on the upper torso and then crushes them under the wheels. “They are killing machines,” said Miller. “They cause a lot of damage to the global climate, to air quality and to the people they hit. SUVs are terrible for cities and neighborhoods, they serve no purpose there. You don’t need them to run to the store to buy a gallon of milk.”Taming SUV emissions will largely come down to fuel efficiency improvements and a significant shift to electric versions. Firms including Nissan, General Motors and, of course, Tesla have started to roll out electric SUVs, nudging the driving range up to 300 miles without a charge. But the challenge is steep – today, only about one in every 100 vehicles sold in the US is electric, recharging stations are still sparse and the price of oil – and therefore gasoline at the pump – has recently plummeted to record lows.A deeper-rooted reform would involve a reimagining of US towns and cities as places largely without cars, a previously unthinkable scenario before the pandemic emptied streets and saw outdoor diners, skateboarders and strolling couples take their place on the reclaimed tarmac. The crisis of 2020 has given Americans a glimpse of a different sort of urban life, one more readily associated with Amsterdam or Venice, although there is little sign the clamor for SUVs is weakening.“Most Americans can’t imagine anything else other than highways and crappy public transit. It’s all they’ve ever seen,” said Miller. “Now that SUVs are here they are difficult to unwind but if we want sustainable, healthy cities we have to do it.”“The dominance of SUVs is only going to stretch,” said Brinley. “We will just see them as the norm.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d32fcdf0c4283afc8b53e7a57aa4939634a77a36/0_185_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3852255ee3f8eeed02b65c058ca0662","title":"coronavirus selfish covidiots on tui flight to uk from greek island criticised","story":"Tui launches investigation after almost 200 passengers told to isolate after outbreakA flight from the Greek island of Zante was “full of selfish ‘covidiots’ and an inept crew”, according to a passenger among the almost 200 onboard who have been told to self-isolate after a coronavirus outbreak.Tui said it had launched an investigation after 16 people tested positive for Covid-19 linked to its flight to Cardiff on 25 August, including seven passengers who were infectious or potentially infectious on the plane.Stephanie Whitfield said on Monday that many of her fellow passengers were not wearing face coverings correctly and seemed to “disregard the rules”.“Lots of the people were wearing the masks underneath their noses or even underneath their chins,” she told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. “They were taking the masks off to talk to friends and they were going up and down the aisles to talk to their friends without their masks on.”Whitfield said she noticed a crew member ask one woman to put her mask on but “the vast majority” of passengers were not reminded of the rules. Face coverings are required to be worn at airports and on flights unless a passenger has a medical condition that makes them exempt.“There was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn’t say anything to him,” she said.Whitfield said she was not surprised to hear about the outbreak on the flight and that she and her husband had since developed mild symptoms and were self-isolating. She added: “The flight was full of selfish ‘covidiots’ and an inept crew who couldn’t care less.”Tui said it was concerned to hear Whitfield’s claims and a full investigation was under way. It added: “The safety and wellbeing of passengers and crew is our highest priority and we operate all flights line with European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) guidelines.”Dr Gwen Lowe, a consultant in communicable disease control for Public Health Wales, said there had been about 30 confirmed coronavirus cases in Wales in the last week of people who had returned from Zante and that she was expecting the number to rise.She said the confirmed cases had included people staying at different hotels and returning on different flights. Officials are in the process of reaching all 193 people who were on Tui flight 6215 to Cardiff on 25 August.Lowe said face coverings “may help” stop the spread of the virus but that they were an “informal measure” that were difficult for airlines to police.Last week, Plymouth city council said up to 30 teenagers in the area could have contracted coronavirus after they flew back from Zante, with 11 members of the group – aged about 18 and 19 – having tested positive.Greece is not on the list of countries for which travellers face quarantine restrictions coming into the UK. But the Foreign Office said on Friday that local restrictions had been tightened on Zante, with stricter limits on large gatherings, large groups in restaurants and late-night food openings.There were reports on Monday of Zante hospital being deluged with requests for Covid-19 tests as it became increasingly clear the island was experiencing a sharp rise in cases. Most people were being turned away and instructed to self-isolate, local reports said, adding that at least two doctors at the hospital had been diagnosed with the virus.The situation in the party resort of Laganas, a draw for young Britons, was described as “especially worrying” by the island’s local MP Dionysios Aktipis, who said the government’s recent decision to tighten restrictions was inevitable.Additional reporting by Helena Smith in Athens "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a56e9be877329339bbc57430e15671106ff7c697/0_140_3000_1799/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=804bd8ba6ba9e0c392802bc32c6a769c","title":"coronavirus live news who says states cant pretend pandemic is over french cases rise 50 in august","story":"Russia’s coronavirus case tally passed the 1 million mark on Tuesday as schools and educational institutions reopened across the world’s largest country with new mandatory safety precautions in place. Russia has the fourth highest case tally in the world after the United States, Brazil and India, according to Johns Hopkins University, which has been tracking the virus since it was discovered.But officials say more than 800,000 people have recovered from the disease, and that with just over 17,000 deaths, the death toll is lower than in many other European countries. The coronavirus crisis centre said on Tuesday that the overall case tally stood at 1,000,048 after 4,729 new infections were reported. It said 123 new deaths had been confirmed in the last 24 hours, taking the official death toll to 17,299. President Vladimir Putin, in a nationwide TV address, told school children and students to observe virus safety rules. It is mandatory for teachers to wear masks in schools in Moscow, which has been harder hit by the virus than other parts of Russia. Teachers are allowed to take off their masks in classrooms when teaching however, provided they keep a safe distance from children. Moscow school children are not required to wear masks in schools. But traditional ceremonies at the start of the school year were cancelled on Tuesday and the use of different classrooms will be limited to reduce infection risks. “I’m not afraid of Covid of course, but I follow restrictions,” Daniil Ivanenko, a 9th-grade student, told Reuters TV at his school in western Moscow on Tuesday. Russia said that 167,044 people are currently infected with the virus. Hello everyone. I am taking on the ’s live feed bringing you all the updates around Covid-19 globally. Please do get in touch if you want to share any comments or news tips with me. Thanks in advance. Poland is banning direct flights from 44 countries including Spain, Israel and Romania in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus in the central European country, the government said on Tuesday.The US, Malta, Montenegro, Mexico, Brasil, Argentina and India are also on the list of countries, but local media reported that Russia and China had been removed from it.The ban comes in tomorrow (Wednesday) and follows measures to reintroduce restrictions on public life in the worst affected parts of the country, as the government tries to tackle the spread of the virus without resorting to a complete lockdown.Poles are, however, allowed to fly to and from any country they want if they choose indirect flights through countries that are not on the list, such as Germany.Poland, a country of 38 million, has officially registered 67,922 Covid-19 infections and more than 2,000 people have died from the virus. On Tuesday, 550 new infections were registered, according to health ministry data.Israeli children went back to school on Tuesday despite a high coronavirus infection rate, the threat of a teachers’ strike and a last-minute decision to keep pupils from more than 20 towns at home.Sitting at a tiny table with first graders wearing face masks, Israel’s prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, did not wear a face covering as he grinned despite the tumultuous start to the academic year.Hours earlier, the government announced schools and nurseries in 23 towns would not reopen due to their high coronavirus infection rates.The postponements are a coup for Israel’s coronavirus tsar, Ronni Gamzu, who last month warned Israel could “tear apart all that we have achieved” if schools are reopened too hastily.After Israel’s initial coronavirus lockdown, pupils returned to the classroom in May and dozens of schools were subsequently shut as positive cases sprung up. The guidelines for September remain strict, with an emphasis on small classes and more distance learning for older children, but the coronavirus figures are now far worse than May.The latest figures show more than 2,100 positive test results registered over 24 hours, with 19 deaths on Tuesday, out of a population of 9 million.While teachers went back to the classroom, they are threatening to strike within days. They are pushing for their colleagues to be allowed to stay at home on full pay if they are in a high risk category for contracting coronavirus. AstraZeneca has expanded an agreement with Oxford Biomedica to scale up production of its potential Covid-19 vaccine, my colleague Julia Kollewe reports.Under the supply agreement, the Oxford-based cell and gene therapy firm said it would produce tens of millions of doses of AstraZeneca’s potential vaccine, AZD1222, for 18 months, which could be extended by a further 18 months into 2023. Read the full story here:Spain, usually the world’s second-most visited country after France with 80 million visitors a year, welcomed just 2.5 million foreigners in the normally brisk holiday month of July, Spain’s National Statistics Institute said.The number of new coronavirus cases in Ukraine will continue to rise in September and could reach 3,000 a day by the end of this month, prime minister Denys Shmygal said on Tuesday.Ukraine reported 2,088 cases on Tuesday and 2,141 on Monday. Last week, the daily number of confirmed coronavirus cases jumped to a record 2,481.The increase comes after Ukraine last week imposed a temporary ban on most foreigners from entering the country until 28 September and extended lockdown measures until the end of October to contain a recent spike in cases.The country has reported a total of 123,303 infections and 2,605 deaths from the virus. The total number of coronavirus cases in Russia passed 1 million on Tuesday after 4,729 new infections were reported.That brought the country’s total tally to 1,000,048. Russia’s coronavirus crisis centre said 123 new deaths had been confirmed in the last 24 hours.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Germany increased by 1,218 to 243,599, data from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for infectious diseases showed on Tuesday.The death toll rose by four to 9,302.Good morning from Greater Manchester in England’s north. I’m Helen Pidd and I will be looking after this blog for a few hours today. Here is what has happened over the past eight hours on our Covid-riddled planet:Hungary has decided to let tourists from its three eastern European neighbours, Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, enter the country with a fresh negative coronavirus test, it said late on Monday, just as a lockdown on its borders took effect.Last week, Hungary said it would close its borders to foreigners from Tuesday to curb a rise in coronavirus cases. Returning Hungarian citizens can avoid a 14-day quarantine only if they provide two negative Covid tests.However, after talks with the Czech prime minister, Andrej Babiš, on Monday, the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orbán, agreed to let Czech visitors who have already booked holidays in Hungary for September enter the country, the foreign ministry said.The easing was subsequently extended to Poland and Slovakia, the ministry said in a statement. Visitors coming to Hungary have to produce a negative Covid test not older than five days, which Budapest says represents sufficient safety guarantees.As of Monday, Hungary had reported 6,139 coronavirus cases with 615 deaths. The number of new cases has surged in recent days, just as Hungary prepared to start the school year.World Health Organization director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has taken issue with the opinion that high death rates from Covid-19 are not a major concern if it is mainly the elderly dying with the disease.Accepting someone to die because of age is moral bankruptcy at its highest, and we shouldn’t allow our society to behave this way.The WHO chief urged governments around the world to engage with people demonstrating against Covid-19 curbs and listen to their concerns, but stressed protesters needed to understand the virus was dangerous.Tedros said it was important to “listen to what people are asking, what people are saying … we should engage in an honest dialogue”.But he stressed demonstrators have a responsibility to ensure protests are safe.“The virus is real. It is dangerous. It moves fast and it kills. We have to do everything to protect ourselves and to protect others.”Hong Kong began a mass coronavirus testing programme Tuesday overshadowed by fears that China is using the scheme to harvest DNA, while the number of infections in the US surpassed 6m.The voluntary initiative is offering free tests to millions of Hong Kongers as authorities worldwide continue efforts to stamp out an illness that has killed almost 850,000 and infected more than 25 million.But it comes as populations are increasingly wary of coronavirus curbs and distrust grows in governments’ handling of the pandemic, with protesters taking to the streets in a number of major cities in recent days.German demonstrators against mask rules and other restrictions tried to storm parliament in the biggest of several European protests over the weekend.Suspicions about government intentions have done much to undermine the testing programme in Hong Kong, where disillusionment with officials has been fuelled by China’s crushing of the city’s democracy movement.The scheme is part of an attempt to stamp out a third wave of infections in the densely populated finance hub that began in late June and saw the city reimpose economically painful social distancing measures.But the programme has been hampered by a limited response due to the involvement of mainland Chinese testing firms and doctors - and swirling public fears of the harvesting of data and DNA.Since registration began on Saturday, 510,000 people have signed up to take the free tests. Health experts advising the government however have said as many as 5 million people might need to be tested for the scheme to end the current wave.I reported earlier that India had added nearly 2m cases to its coronavirus case load in August … we now have today’s figures and the country has added a further 69,921 new infections on Tuesday, the lowest daily jump in six days, taking its overall total to 3.69m infections. This is based on more than 1m tests.The country has had the single highest daily total of new cases for more than three weeks, according to a Reuters tally.The death toll rose by 819 on Tuesday to 65,288.How Covid-19 is impacting people’s dreams is the subject of a study being run by a cross-disciplinary team of academics from Australia, the UK and Finland.“Pandemic dreams” are already the subject of a book of essays from Harvard research Deirdre Barrett, alongside reams of popular audience articles and social media posts.“Certainly there were different lines of evidence that inspired this project,” says Dr Jennifer Windt, a senior research fellow in philosophy at Monash University, who will be working on the project alongside researchers from the University of Cambridge in England and Finland’s University of Turku. “People seem to be reporting weird dreams, but also generally they seem to be reporting that they’re dreaming more … and unfortunately often having more negatively toned dreams and nightmares. So that was part of it.”Participants in the “Covid on Mind” study, which will be anonymous, will keep a dream log and undertake a “daily mind-wandering task” over a period of two weeks.But first, they will be asked to complete a wellbeing questionnaire that examines their mental state, and “concerns related to coronavirus specifically” to give the researchers “some measure of how people are doing, how concerned they are about the virus, and changes related to the virus in their everyday lives”.The cross-disciplinary project involves cognitive neuroscientists, psychologists and sleep and dream researchers, many of whom study how dreams reflect people’s mental states while awake. “We have people on the team who’ve done a lot of work on emotion and dreams … the pandemic seems to be an ideal opportunity to study that,” says Widnt.She says there is already a body of research that suggests “negatively toned” dreams are associated with issues like anxiety and depression, and wonders, “Could changes in dreams be a marker to help identify people with mental health issues?”“We’re not interested in interpreting the dreams in any sense,” she explains. “This is really a quite different approach that tries to get objective numbers … It’s really about quantifying changes in emotion, and relating them to measures of waking thought and emotion.”Other researchers will be investigating the number of social interactions people report, both in their dreams and mind-wandering tasks. “Dreaming has been proposed to have a possibly evolutionary function in fine-tuning social skills,” she says. “We know that many of our interactions have gone virtual … does that have an impact on how people dream?”“Dream bizarreness”, which Windt describes as “a technical word for all of the different ways in which dreams can be weird”, will also be a focus for Melbourne-based PhD student Manuela Kirberg.In order to quantify how bizarre, social, positive or negative a dream is, independent raters read through dream reports and score them using established criteria. They rate the occurrence of “emotion terms” and “social content”. Any comments that do not form part of a dream’s description – for instance the dreamer’s own interpretation – are discarded, and raters talk to each other to ensure there is “sufficient agreement” in how they are scoring the dreams. “You need a lot of patience and sticktoitiveness to do that scoring, as well as training,” Windt says. “A lot of dreams are pretty mundane.”The researchers are currently recruiting volunteers for the study – and anyone over the age of 18 who lives in the UK, Australia or Finland can participate. The study will be open for up to 12 months. The resulting dataset will feature well over 1,000 dreams and daydreams.Windt is particularly curious about the dreams and mind-wandering of people in lockdown. “It’s obviously horrible what’s happening in Melbourne,” she says. But, “I do think it is a particularly interesting period to get people involved … How do their dreams relate to the changing outer circumstance?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e66f6d28bf81d0d5eab2b741d33f876a47989a57/0_190_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b1a944fa0f03af0198b867b253f6bac0","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates pupils head back to school as mps return to work","story":"Schools minister Nick Gibb says decision to come soon Gavin Williamson to face MPs following exams fiasco while holidays are over for some pupilsSky News has broadcast a clip of Boris Johnson addressing cabinet at the start of today’s meeting. It was standard Johnson boosterism. He said:People are going back to the office in huge numbers across our country, and quite right too.And, of course, we know that there is still going to be more of this disease, this wretched Covid, still to come, and although we know there’ll be more outbreaks, we’re also absolutely confident that we are going to be able to deal with those outbreaks, and bit by bit this incredible country is getting back on its feet.It is not clear yet what evidence there is to support Johnson’s claim that people are returning to the office “in huge numbers”. Last week there were multiple reports (eg here and here) saying the opposite. I’m back in the  office in the House of Commons for the first time since March, but the roads were quiet and the pavements relatively empty as I came into Westminster. If people are embracing commuting in large numbers in London, I didn’t spot it.Boris Johnson is chairing a socially distanced cabinet meeting today in the Locarno Suite in the Foreign Office. It might not be as cosy as the Downing Street cabinet room, but it’s a great setting for pictures.The UK manufacturing sector expanded at the fastest rate for over six years in August, as companies restarted operations following the pandemic, my colleague Graeme Wearden reports in his business live blog. But firms are still cutting staff. There are more details here.Here is Dominic Cummings, Boris Johnson’s chief adviser, arriving for work at No 10 this morning with his colleague Cleo Watson. Like the defence secretary, Ben Wallace, (see 10.03am), he seems to be taking a relatively relaxed approach to social distancing guidance.As Alex Wickham reports in the Politico London Playbook briefing, Cummings and his staff are moving into a new office in the Cabinet Office. But, according to Wickham, there have been teething problems.The fabled “NASA-style” control room needs work, according to an official who says it actually resembles an “underwhelming” large open plan whitewashed modern office, “like a call centre” ... The ultimate aim is to have a series of TV screens and projectors on the walls beaming in extremely detailed live data on coronavirus numbers from private tech companies, then eventually stats on how the government’s “Project Speed” infrastructure programmes are progressing. Which does sound kinda cool, but unfortunately for a project titled Speed, they are yet to be installed. A Whitehall “Thick Of It” fan tells Playbook it’s currently more like “DoSAC season 1” than Apollo 11.In the Commons we’ve got an urgent question for Matt Hancock, the health secretary, on coronavirus at 3.30pm. And then there will be a statement from Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, covering exams and school reopening, starting probably around 4.15pm.UPDATE: The coronavirus UQ has been updated to a statement, Labour whips reports.There is not much difference between a UQ and a ministerial statement. Both involve a minister taking questions from MPs on a particular topic. But a statement takes place when a government department voluntarily offers one, while a UQ involves a minister being obliged to answer a question approved by the Speaker. Ministerial statements also tend to last a bit longer (a full hour).Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, was filmed by Sky News shaking hands with a colleague on his way into Downing Street this morning. It is not known yet who he was greeting, but from the clip it seemed to be someone he knew and was pleased to see – but perhaps not someone from his household or support bubble, which would make this a breach of social distancing guidance.During his morning interview round Nick Gibb, the schools minister for England, confirmed that school exams could be delayed next year to allow more time for catch-up teaching. (See 8.21am and 8.36am.) Gibb’s boss, the education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said the same thing in a comment that provided today’s  splash. Williamson said:Ofqual will continue to work with the education sector and other stakeholders on whether there should be a short delay to the GCSE, A- and AS-level exam timetable in 2021, with the aim of creating more teaching time.According to the , “allies” of Williamson (ie Williamson himself, or his aides, speaking on background), said that if exams were delayed, they would start in June or early July, instead of May, but they would not run into the summer holidays.If exams are delayed, Labour will be able to chalk this up as a minor win because the shadow education secretary, Kate Green, was calling for exactly this at the weekend. (Perhaps she was just proposing the inevitable, but pushing at an open door is a sensible and entirely legitimate opposition tactic.)Good morning. I’m Andrew Sparrow, taking over from Kevin Rawlinson. I’m back from my summer break, and I hope you’ve all managed a decent holiday too.For the last few months Politics Live has been functioning as the ’s UK coronavirus blog, because there is so much overlap between politics and coronavirus, and that will continue for the time being. Generally we will be mainly focusing on coronavirus developments, but non-coronavirus politics will get covered too, and some of the time that might take precedence.Here is the agenda for the day.9.30am: Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, and other thinktank experts give evidence to the Commons Treasury committee about tax after coronavirus.10am: Tony Abbott, the former Australian prime minister being lined up for a role as a UK trade envoy, gives a speech to the Policy Exchange thinktank. Later, at 3pm, he will give evidence to the Commons foreign affairs committee.After 2pm: Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minster, makes a statement to the Scottish parliament about her government’s programme for 2020-21.2.30pm: Matt Hancock, the health and social care secretary, takes questions in the Commons as MPs sit for the first time after the summer recess.After 3.30pm: Gavin Williamson, the education secretary, is expected to make a statement to MPs. Hancock and Priti Patel, the home secretary, may also give Commons statements.Asked about a teachers’ survey suggesting that the average pupil is three months behind where they should be with their learning, Gibb said it showed the importance of children being back in school. He told Today:The important thing now is that young people are back in school, back being taught by their teachers.Over the lockdown period, schools worked hugely, very hard to make sure there was work for students to do, online lessons and so on. But ... it is always harder, even for the most hard-working student at home, to learn as effectively in that environment as opposed to being at school with your teacher.He also defended the level of access to technology during the schools shutdown after the same survey suggested a quarter of pupils did not have access to a computer or tablet at home.Schools didn’t just rely on online lessons, they also had other work sent home and so on. But we did procure one of the biggest procurement of computers in this country – over 200,000 computers were bought on a global market and given over to schools.And we’ve also acquired a further reserve of over 100,000 computers for areas of the country with local restrictions in place, should that happen.Here’s a little more on Gibb’s assertion that the time needed for exam marking and the university admissions process is being considered as part of any decision on pushing next year’s summer exam season back. He told Today:The issues are not simple. We have to take into account the other nations in the UK which also use the GCSEs and A-levels in their term dates you have to take into account the time for marking, making sure results are delivered on a certain date for university admissions and so on.Pushed on whether an answer would come by October, Gibb said:It will be very soon because we know schools need to know the answer to this question and we have been working on it since mid-June.Gibb has said any pupil with coronavirus symptoms will be sent home from school to be tested, telling BBC Breakfast:I would urge parents to send their children back to school to help them to catch up on the lost education that they will inevitably have suffered during the lockdown period, and schools are doing everything they can to make sure that their pupils and their staff are safe.Asked what will happen if a child gets a cough or a cold, Gibb said:If a child is showing the symptoms of coronavirus then they will be asked to return home, to go home, and then the family asked to have a test.If that test proves positive, then the school will take advice from the local health protection teams and that will involve tracing all the children and adults that that child will have come across, and those people then will be asked to self-isolate.And then, if it is the advice of the local health protection team, a mobile testing unit will go into the school as well to test more young people.But he refused to commit to routine testing of teachers, pupils and parents, claiming that the scientific advice given to the government suggested testing was effective where people had symptoms.A decision on whether or not to delay next year’s GCSE and A-level exams will be made soon, Gibb has added. Perhaps seeking to avoid any eventual decision being seen as yet another U-turn, he stressed that ministers have been considering the issue since mid-June.Speaking to BBC Radio 4’s Today programme, Gibb refused to commit to giving teachers and pupils clarity by October, but did say that officials were looking at oral examinations in foreign languages and practicals in science as they try to “reduce the burden of assessment so there’s more time for teaching”.We’ll make a decision as soon as we can. We have to also take into account the other nations in the UK that use the GCSEs and A-levels, to take into account their issues as well, but we will be making a decision, with the regulator and the exam boards, very soon.The schools minister Nick Gibb has said he would be “delighted” to meet the footballer Marcus Rashford to discuss his campaign to tackle child food poverty. Gibb told BBC Breakfast:I’d be delighted to meet Marcus Rashford. We are looking at all the policy suggestions that he has put forward in his letter to make sure that they do deliver on our shared objective, which is alleviating the kind of poverty that he talks about.When Rashford first launched his campaign, Downing Street rejected it and ministers were sent out to publicly defend the government’s position. The following day, as public support for Rashford grew, the prime minister claimed to have only just learned of it and performed an embarrassing U-turn.Now, MPs are scrambling to line up behind the charismatic young Manchester United footballer and political activist.In a letter to MPs released on Tuesday morning, Rashford unveiled a “child food poverty taskforce” he has formed with brands including Aldi, Tesco, Deliveroo and Kellogg’s set out three major new policy goals and issued a rallying cry for long-lasting change.“Food poverty is contributing to social unrest,” he wrote, reflecting on a series of recent meetings with families in need of the same support he depended on as a child. He described “watching a young boy keeping it together whilst his mother sobbed alongside him, feeling like he has to step up to protect his family and alleviate some of that worry.

That was my reality.”As many as 50,000 people in the capital’s retail sector face losing their jobs due to the lack of visitors, according to the Tory MP for Cities of London and Westminster, Nickie Aiken.She said the loss of international visitors had seriously affected London’s economy, telling BBC Radio 4’s Today programme:Almost half of the £10bn annual spend in the West End is from overseas travellers, and then the lack of office workers who have not been back at their desks since March, that has a huge effect on the overall turnover of West End shops and hospitality.Aiken said she suspected a “huge falloff in confidence” regarding the perceived safety of public transport was partly behind the drop in shoppers, adding:We’ve got to get that back, we’ve got to get businesses, the mayor of London and government to work together to provide that confidence to get people back in.Hello and welcome to the ’s UK live blog. I’ll be taking you through the next few hours, before handing over to the usual custodian, Andrew Sparrow.That provides yet more evidence to support the claim that the UK’s approach to dealing with the pandemic has disproportionately hit the less well-off.The news came as the embattled education secretary, Gavin Williamson, said next year’s GCSE and A-level exams might have to be delayed to give students more time to study the syllabus. Williamson has been clinging on to his job after the exams fiasco, during which the government performed several embarrassing U-turns that caused severe disruption to people’s lives.There is intense speculation that Portugal is to be taken back off the UK’s safe travel list – just a week after it was added – as the Iberian nation reported 21.1 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 30 August passing the threshold often applied by the UK government of 20 per 100,000.The decision, not due before Thursday, would mean yet more upheaval for travellers, who were told they would not have to self-isolate on return from Portugal from 22 August.All of this faces the government as MPs return to the Commons after recess.

Photograph: Alan BetsonTeachers with underlying health issues, who are worried about the risks of returning to teach children and young adults, need further reassurance that all possible measures are being taken to ensure their safety, the Association of Secondary Teachers (ASTI) has said. Speaking on Monday as hundreds of primary and secondary schools around the country reopened their doors to students for the first time in nearly six months, ASTI president Ann Piggott warned that many educators remained deeply concerned about the spread of Covid-19 in school settings. A recent snapshot survey carried out by the teachers’ union found a quarter of secondary schools didn’t have warm water while more than eight out of 10 had poor ventilation, she said. The union has also heard of teachers correcting copy books and eating lunches in their cars in recent days because staff rooms were no longer available, she added. “Teachers want to be back in school but we need to ensure funding so that buildings can cope with changes while students who must stay home have access to wifi and a computer. Teachers now have to move from room to room and they’re telling us they want a Perspex screen around their desk. We would also like to see temperature checks and fast-tracked testing in schools.”Some teachers remained very worried about their health, said Ms Piggott who has spoken to cancer survivors and one teacher who had a lung removed. “Teachers who are in very high-risk groups are in some cases being forced back into work without clarification on support from the HSE,” she said. Early retirementTeachers’ Union of Ireland (TUI) general secretary Michael Gillespie said some older teachers, who under normal circumstances would have remained in their jobs a few more years, were retiring early rather than risking contracting the virus. Those with vulnerable family members at home were also concerned about carrying Covid-19 from the school to their loved ones, he added. Mr Gillespie said he expected “lots of teething problems” over the coming weeks as schools adjust to new practices and he hoped to see rapid Covid-19 testing introduced for teachers as soon as possible. However, he said he had “huge confidence” in young people’s awareness of the gravity of the health situation. Pairic Clerkin, chief executive of the Irish Primary Principals’ Network (IPPN), said feedback from members in recent days revealed “a great relief” that schools were back open. Mr Clerkin paid tribute to the principals who gave up their summer holidays to ensure schools were ready for the students’ return. Asked to comment on social media reports of large crowds of parents and students gathering at school gates for drop-off and pick-up, Mr Clerkin said schools needed a few days to settle into a routine but the vast majority of parents were “very aware and supportive” of social distancing measures and the use of face coverings. Hugh Cronin, principal of St Catherine’s National School in Ballymoe, Co Cork, said he had received “100 per cent positive feedback” from parents and staff since the school reopened last Thursday, describing the opening as “a joyous occasion”.Mr Cronin, who worked 12-14 hour days through the summer to ensure the primary school was ready for its 116 students, said the start of the school year “actually felt like getting my summer holidays”. “Work was relentless before that,” he told The . “We’ve all been learning from this and it comes down to mutual respect. It’s been a huge cultural change for the school but the children have accepted it straight away. It’s been about keeping the lines of communication open. We want to be sure our staff feel safe and comfortable in the school too.” "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4337370.1598257474!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the secret teacher i m genuinely petrified we aren t properly prepared","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t’I want to go back to work, and yet I’m genuinely petrified that we aren’t adequately prepared.’ Photograph: iStock Opening night is almost upon us and we have not had a single rehearsal.The stage directions have been around for a few weeks and we hear that huge work has been done on the set. A few people have even been in to see it and one of them was very impressed by what she saw. Less so by what she experienced, however, as “it was all just too normal”.I have avoided going in as these precious remaining days of leisure won’t come around again for some time. I’m genuinely keen to be back in the physical classroom with students who have had their longest gap ever from it since they first started school. Perhaps I’m näive, but I would like to think that we will all have a new-found appreciation for how (relative!) physical proximity enriches the teaching and learning experience.So I want to go back to work, and yet I’m genuinely petrified that we aren’t adequately prepared. Nobody seems to have considered the importance of the choreography in this show, or that for the movement around the set to go smoothly, regular rehearsals are a must.I’ve been involved in lots of shows during my career, and I find that a good start is to bring the cast together in small groups to ensure that each one knows what it is doing. Blocking ensures that each inidual element works well before the different scenes and movements are let loose on each other.According to our plans to reopen, the small groups will number in excess of 200 iniduals per day – apologies, per half-day. It looks as though the early, last-minute, technical and dress rehearsals are all to happen within a few short hours – and only ever for a proportion of the cast and crew at any one time. What could possibly go wrong?What I hear from politicians is that we are going back no matter what. What I’m reading in print and online tells me that school leaders are doing their best and falling into distinct categories. The group I would like to pay active tribute to here is that of the engaged, willing and innovative school management teams. They are finding ways to make it work, but not being given any room for manoeuvre around the universal simultaneous start. What is commendable is their vision that schools staying open is the most important thing. In the current reality, as others are pushing it, the warning that comes to mind is “marry in haste, repent at leisure”. Sensible plans for a blended learning approach are being rejected, despite all the work done during the spring term to equip us so well for this.What has teachers under strain is the lack of rehearsals, coupled with little or no evidence of empathy. Teachers risk being the real casualty here, and I do not say that lightly. Teachers have too many questions and genuine concerns, but what we are being fed is a script of messages such as “how gamely the nurses, doctors, guards and so on stepped up – so why can’t you?” We can, as it happens, but what we are saying is too easily reported as unwillingness.What makes our job different is that when we step back into the arena, we will be alone in a room with minors. That category of society has not once been addressed by political leaders to explain the valid concerns being expressed about their (lack of) understanding of how serious this is. Kilkee on August bank holiday weekend and Salthill a few weeks earlier come to mind.Furthermore, the conditions in which we will function at school are out of line with what is permissible elsewhere in society. We teachers are ideally placed to know what this could all look like in reality and yet we are told that it is necessary for the mental health of our young people, and so teachers must step up. Under this pressure our own mental health quietly deteriorates.When schools closed there were fewer cases in the country than there are now. The Tánaiste said recently that it is inevitable that clusters will emerge in schools. Where is the plan for how to proceed when this happens? I say when, because in the absence of a clear and coherent message to the minors we will interact with, in conditions that do not adhere to public health guidelines, it’s surely almost a given that some school or other will have to deal with it before very long.As we approach opening night, feeling nervous and under-rehearsed, please spare teachers a thought. And do what you can to ensure that the children you send to school have some grasp of how serious the situation is. That isn’t a teacher’s job – no shirking of responsibilities here: it isn’t our job because it is blatantly obvious that they need to know it before they get to us. There is a lot at stake here and there’s an eager audience waiting.An audience? Yes, the whole country. Having been deprived of music festivals, football matches, theatres, concerts and a multitude of other events, all eyes are on the one and only venue that has a licence to let hundreds in. It’s a packed house too, because the reopening of schools isn’t just the biggest show in town, it’s the only one."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"A speed limit is fairer than a fuel tax, which affects the less well-off to a greater degreeThe teenager elicits hope, admiration and even awe in people many times her ageDismantling of protections \u0026lsquois making it harder for future administrations to use science\u0026rsquo"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: A new survey brings arresting confirmations of declineThe by-the-wind sailor\u0026rsquos sworn foe, the violet sea snail, floats upside-down alongside itMichael Viney: North Atlantic\u0026rsquos top predator now shares island with 13 other speciesMichael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalities"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343632.1598942935!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"new list of names for storms in ireland uk and netherlands announced","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSwimmers enjoying the swell in Dublin Bay during Storm Francis at the end of August.

On Wednesday, the heavy rain will continue in the east but conditions will become drier in western counties. This dry weather will extend eastwards through the morning with most rain due to have cleared by lunchtime. The wet weather will return to the northwest during the afternoon and evening, with highest temperatures ranging between 17 to 21 degrees Celsius. Temperatures will drop slightly to between 17 and 18 degrees on Thursday with continued showers and some sunny spells. Friday and Saturday will also see sunny spells and showers, with most of the wet weather in the west, according to the forecaster.The latest indicators suggest a ridge of high pressure will build on Sunday bringing mainly dry weather, said Met Éireann. There are currently no weather warnings in place but Met Éireann did issue a small craft marine warning at 5am on Tuesday with southerly winds occasionally reaching force 6 or higher. A series of weather warnings were issued in August when Storm Francis and Storm Ellen hit the country leaving nearly 200,000 homes and businesses without power. The storms also resulted in flooding in many parts with Co Cork particularly badly hit. Met Éireann said at the time that the arrival of storms in August was unusual but not unprecedented, noting that Hurricane Charlie hit the country at the same time of year in 1986. Storm Aiden will be the first storm to blow across Ireland and the UK this winter, according to the latest list of storm names announced by Met Éireann, the UK Met Office and the Dutch national weather forecasting service on Tuesday.

File photograph: The At least 55 cases of Covid-19 in August have been linked to some form of sporting activity, the Department of Health has said.The Health Protection Surveillance Centre, which monitors outbreaks of the virus, says those who have been infected have had 365 close contacts, with each case generating an average of 6.6 close contacts.Public health officials last night ruled out any immediate lifting of the ban on spectators at sporting events, which was imposed in mid-August. Acting chief medical officer Dr Ronan Glynn said the focus for now was on making the reopening of schools work over the next few weeks, after which other measures would be examined.The GAA, which believes the measure will force spectators indoors to more risky environments, has asked officials to present the underlying evidence.Although no meeting has taken place between the GAA and the National Public Health Emergency Team, Dr Glynn said he was happy to meet all sporting bodies.Meanwhile, Cabinet is expected today to sign off on a plan to supply free flu vaccines to more than two million people.However, the delivery to Ireland of flu jabs is being delayed due to problems relating to Covid-19.Doses for 1.4 million adults will be made available from mid-September. For the first time, a mass vaccination of 600,000 children is planned, but this will not start until mid- to late October, it is understood. This is close to the recommended timeline of within two weeks of the annual flu season.With new figures showing Ireland’s incidence of Covid-19 higher than in Sweden, the UK, Germany and 14 other European countries, Dr Glynn defended public health emergency team’s response in recent months.With 30.6 cases per 100,000 population over the last fortnight, the incidence of the disease in Ireland is up to 12 times higher than it was two months ago, according to figures from the European Centre for Disease Control.However, Dr Glynn denied that public health officials had “taken their eye off the ball” and put the surge down to an “explosive” and “unusual” growth in clusters with “significant knock-on effects”.He admitted there were “some delays” in testing large clusters in Co Kildare but said these issue were being addressed and “lessons have been learned”. Ireland was “there with the best countries in Europe with testing”, he insisted.Businesses in Co Kildare yesterday welcomed the Government’s decision to lift restrictions imposed on the county last month following a steep rise in cases, initially linked to outbreaks in local meat processing plants.‘Apparent stabilisation’The decision was made despite Kildare still having the highest incidence of any county in the Republic, although the trend is downwards.A further 53 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported by public health emergency team on Monday evening, and no new deaths. Dublin accounted for 25 of the new cases and Limerick for 11.Dr Glynn said it was too early to read anything into the improvement seen in recent days but added that he was heartened by the “apparent stabilisation” in numbers.Any review of the green list of countries from which travellers do not have to quarantine on arriving in Ireland, is a matter for Government, he said.The public health emergency team has undertaken an internal review of its operations, according to Dr Glynn, and its role would be reviewed externally as part of the Government’s planned framework for tackling the disease.The US yesterday surpassed six million cases of Covid-19, including one million new infections in the past month.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Heavy rain expected on Tuesday night and WednesdayCar failed to remain at crash site on Dublin\u0026rsquos North Wall Quay, garda\u0026iacute sayCoverings should cover the wearer\u0026rsquos nose and go under their chinSaidhbh\u0026iacuten among storm names suggested by members of the publicThose who have been infected have had 365 close contacts, according to health watchdogBowel, cervical and breast checks way behind due to Covid-19 restrictionsSchool reopening has been \u0026lsquoa joyous occasion\u0026rsquo says Cork national school principalGovernment has not yet been decided whether to submit one or two namesThird-level capacity to be increased in response to Covid-19 pandemicAsthma Society of Ireland says ban has resulted in more than 350 fewer annual deaths\u0026lsquoA lot of businesses have closed...there is a lot of derelict buildings around\u0026rsquoSimon Coveney, Maire\u0026aacuted McGuinness and Frances Fitzgerald comment on EU Commissioner roleOrder requires Facebook to provide Lisa McGowan with details on account holdersFamily of children with Covid-like symptoms must self-isolate ahead of test results, public health officials sayGarda\u0026iacute investigating cause of blaze at four-bedroom propertyPublic health officials concerned about alcohol and congregating in queues at venuesHigh Court hears that refusal of grades to 17-year-old is \u0026lsquounjust and discriminatory\u0026rsquoAccused (17) charged with murder of Azzam Raguragai (18) at Finsbury Park in DundrumStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4343264.1598906496!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"party leaders to meet again today to nominate replacement for phil hogan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMEP Mairead McGuinness: Sources in Brussels said Ms McGuinness is highly thought-of by European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

Some Ministers believe that the request for two names is an infringement on national governments’ right to select their nominee, though others think that not complying with the request is a high-risk strategy which could result in a job of lesser importance for the eventual nominee.However, sources acknowledge that the chances of retaining the trade portfolio are slim. There were discussions on the nomination on Monday between Dublin and the commission, it is understood.SoundingsEarlier, MEP and former minister for justice Frances Fitzgerald entered the race to replace Mr Hogan, confirming on Monday morning that she was interested in the post, and acknowledging that it was a “difficult decision” for the Government. She has taken soundings in Dublin in recent days, it is understood.Ms Fitzgerald’s confirmation of her interest brings to three the list of supposed Fine Gael candidates, with Mr Coveney and the MEP Mairead McGuinness.Sources in Brussels said Ms McGuinness – a vice-president of the European Parliament and strong contender for the next presidency of the parliament – is highly thought-of by Ms von der Leyen.Meanwhile, Taoiseach Micheál Martin is also likely to nominate a new minister for agriculture this week to replace Dara Calleary, who resigned in the wake of the revelations about the Oireachtas golf dinner.FrontrunnerParty sources say Donegal TD Charlie McConalogue is the frontrunner to replace Mr Calleary. Mr McConalogue was agriculture spokesman in the last Dáil, and has served as a Junior Minister in the Department of Justice since July.If appointed, Mr McConalogue will become the third agriculture minister to hold the office since the formation of the Government at the end of June. Prior to the resignation of Mr Calleary, Offaly TD Barry Cowen resigned after a controversy surrounding a drink-driving ban from 2016.Elsewhere, the Cabinet will on Tuesday discuss a proposal to expand the free flu vaccine for the coming season, with the Government anxious to minimise the risks of a second wave of Covid-19 occurring at the same time as the flu surge."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"People encouraged to practice \u0026lsquoa bit of smiling with the eyes\u0026rsquo as masks made mandatoryQuick vote expected to maximise influence of outgoing prime minister and his alliesAs Abe quits he will be remembered more as a caretaker PM than a radical reformerAbe tells shocked nation that return of bowel condition means he cannot continueItinerary of three-week visit by investigators fuels concern over China\u0026rsquos co-operationBrenton Tarrant killed 51 Muslim worshippers at two mosques in New Zealand last yearLong-serving president already general secretary of the party and head of the militaryTed Hui and Lam Cheuk-ting detained as part of crackdown under new security lawVictims and relatives seek life without parole for man who killed 51 in 2019 attackResearchers say man had no Covid-19 symptoms the second time, suggesting immune system kept virus somewhat in checkLocals and police search the debris after five-storey structure crumbles in MahadLuon Sovath, who has spent decades fighting for human rights, was the victim of a vicious smear campaign this summerFears that country teetering on edge of major outbreak supported by data on rise in daily casesWhite supremacist killed 51 worshippers at two New Zealand mosques in March 2019Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Jared Kushner urges Palestinians not to be \u0026lsquostuck in the past\u0026rsquo during visit to finalise pactMustapha Adib must satisfy international donors and also deal with warring campsMustapha Adib faces task of rebuilding public trust after decades of failed political leadershipHouses were built on private Palestinian lands in unauthorised West Bank outpostMike Pompeo\u0026rsquos tour of the Middle East failed to gain support for normalising ties with IsraelOne-time revolutionary Shia movement now a status quo party opposing popular protestsMore than 2,200 cases reported in 24 hours as number of infections surges to 365,606Netanyahu says now is not the time to drag the country into an unwanted fourth electionSaudi minister says \u0026lsquopeace must be achieved\u0026rsquo on the basis of international agreementsOne found guilty, three acquitted in UN-backed tribunal into killing of former Lebanese PMCourt rules there is no proof Syria was involved in Hariri\u0026rsquos assassinationFour low-ranking members of the Shia Muslim Hezbollah political party are accused of killing the former prime minister and 21 others in a massive bombing in 2005Two countries taking steps towards normal relations with telephone links and flightsPutin suggestion came after Trump said he would trigger a \u0026lsquosnapback\u0026rsquo of sanctionsAs inquiry into Beirut blast gets under way, rescue of country not ruling class urgedThursday\u0026rsquos announcement underlines split in Arab world on Palestinian questionIsraeli right wing furious over decision to drop plans for annexation of parts of the occupied West BankDire condition of Libyan migrant detention centres condemned by human rights groupsCountries to open diplomatic relations for first time and Palestine accuses UAE of selling outAgreement between the two countries described as \u0026lsquoa complete sellout\u0026rsquo of PalestiniansStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4332116.1597668041!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"inside joe biden s race of a lifetime to be us president","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate Joe Biden: Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"flu jabs likely delayed december people","story":"Millions of flu jabs may not be offered until close to Christmas, despite fears of an NHS winter crisis, The  can reveal.Ministers have promised “the biggest flu vaccination programme in history” in a bid to ensure the NHS can cope if it is hit by a “double whammy” of flu and Covid this winter.They pledged to expand the programme to half the population, with healthy over 50s offered a jab, as well as pensioners, those with underlying health conditions, and young children.But now patients have been told it is likely that they will have to wait until December for the jab - despite the fact the flu season may well start earlier, and amid fears of a second wave of Covid.The vaccination programme is due to start this month, with the most vulnerable patients prioritised first. Government guidance, seen by The , says services aim to “extend the vaccine programme in November and December to include the 50-64 year old age group, subject to vaccine supply”.Patients within this age group - including those with underlying conditions such as type two diabetes - have now been told that it is is “likely” that vaccinations for such patients will not even start until December. The government guidance goes on to suggests that flu jabs may not be offered to healthy patients aged 50 to 64 at all. It says only that for this group, the vaccinations “might” be offered - “following prioritisation of other eligible groups and subject to vaccine supply.The Royal College of GPs on Monday night urged the Government to provide assurances about whether there are actually sufficient vaccines to provide an expanded programme. One diabetes patient, aged 63, received a text message from Bounds Green Group Practice in North London, this weekend, stating: “The government have increased the age range of those entitled to the flu vaccination to include those of 50 years and over. Due to availability of vaccines, the vaccinations for this group will likely commence in December.”The message also ordered patients not to ring the surgery to make any enquiries about the matter “as this places additional pressure on our phone lines”.The patient, from Haringey, said she was fearful that by the time the practice gave her a jab it would be too far into the flu season to protect her. “Because I have an underlying condition which makes me vulnerable to Covid and I fall in the new plus-50 age category I thought I was eligible for a flu vaccination on two grounds,” she said. “I was pretty surprised to receive a text message from my practice saying that ‘due to availability of vaccines’, vaccinations ‘will likely commence in December’”.NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said that patients with diabetes should have been among those who were prioritised for jabs, under the Government’s guidance.Dr Jonathan Leach, Honorary Secretary for the Royal College of GPs, said it was essential that those in the highest risk groups received their vaccinations.But he said the RCGP was seeking assurances from Government that there is sufficient supply of the vaccine to expand the programme to cover healthy people below the age of 64.Dr Leach said: “For the extra cohort of patients included in the expanded flu programme, for example 50-64-year-olds, we have asked for assurance from the Government that there is enough supply of vaccines to go around. “If there is not enough supply, GPs, our teams and the public need to know, so that patients’ expectations can be managed – and we need clear guidance as to who we should prioritise for a flu jab, outside of those patients most at risk.”A DHSC spokesman said there was high demand internationally for procuring flu vaccines, but said the Government had procured additional supplies for the expanded programme, and intended to roll it out to those aged 50 to 64. He said:  “We have outlined in our flu vaccine plans that those eligible under at risk groups – including diabetes - are to receive a flu vaccine as a priority, and we have secured additional flu vaccines for those who need them. This is the biggest flu vaccine programme in UK history and healthcare staff will work to vaccinate more than 30 million people, millions more than received it last year. “An NHS spokesman said: “GPs are expected to follow the government’s guidance that people with diabetes should be offered the flu vaccination as part of the national programme beginning this month.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"german far right seizes moment coronavirus fatigue sets","story":"Scenes of angry protestors attempting to storm the Reichstag this weekend have left Germany in a degree of shock, and raised questions over whether a growing mood of discontent over coronavirus restrictions is being exploited by the far-Right.The protests which brought 38,000 people onto the streets of Berlin at the weekend were billed as a peaceful demonstration against the coronavirus policy of Angela Merkel’s government. But it was the images of a few hundred violent protestors attempting to force their way into the German parliament that came to encapsulate the day.They were carrying the flags of the “Reich Citizens” — a far-Right movement that refuses to accept the fall of the pre-war German Empire — and according to disturbing reports on Monday, at least one was armed with a handgun.It is hard to overstate the symbolism of an attack on the Reichstag — which went up in flames at the start of Nazi rule in 1933, stood abandoned by the Berlin Wall during the Cold War ision of Germany, and rose phoenix-like to become the seat of the Bundestag after reunification.“Reich flags and a far-Right rabble in front of the German Bundestag are an unbearable attack on the heart of our democracy. We will never accept that, ” Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the German president, said in the wake of the weekend\u0027s events.But that left unanswered questions about how a protest that was supposed to bring together a coalition of anti-vaxxers, coronavirus sceptics and conspiracy theorists ended up culminating in a far-Right attack on the Reichstag.Michael Ballweg, the organiser of the demonstration, immediately distanced himself from what happened. “They have nothing to do with our movement,” he said of the protestors on the Reichstag steps.Mr Ballweg, who heads an initiative called Lateral Thinking and has been known to invite the audiences at his speeches to meditate, is typical of the eccentrics who have dominated the anti-virus protests in Germany until now.Largely unknown before the pandemic, he has been catapulted to national fame by his campaign against the government response and says he is planning to run for mayor of his native Stuttgart.A rival group calling itself Resistance 2020, founded by an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor who posted a video questioning the risk posed by the virus on his YouTube channel, says it is planning to become a political party.Adherents have taken to carrying pendants fashioned from aluminium foil in reference to the tin foil hats of conspiracy theorists. But it appears the reference is not entirely ironic. A message being circulated ahead of Saturday’s demonstration read: “Please wrap your cell phone in aluminum foil 100km from Berlin. Switching it off is not enough!”But there is more to the protests than harmless eccentrics. As Spiegel magazine put it this week: “It would not be accurate to describe this event as purely far-Right. But nor would it be accurate not to mention the fact that the crowds were interspersed with people who, with their flags, T-shirts and tattoos, were clearly recognizable as far-Right.”Or, as Wolfgang Schäuble, the Speaker of the German parliament, put it: “Anyone who takes part in a demonstration should ask himself who he is marching alongside”.What happened in the run-up to Saturday’s protest is that the German far-Right began openly to adopt the movement as their own. The Identitarian Movement called for protests. So did the National Democratic Party (NPD) and The Third Way, both regarded by their critics as neo-Nazi, though they reject the label.So did Björn Höcke, one of the most influential leaders of the far-Right Alternative for Germany party (AfD), and a man German television has compared to Hitler.“Corona is over. And corona will not come back either,” Mr Höcke declared in an interview with German television last week. The AfD has had a hard time of it this year. It has seen its support evaporate as voters flock back to the established parties in times of crisis, falling to fourth place in the polls on 11 per cent, a far cry from the 18 per cent it reached two years ago, while popular backing for Mrs Merkel, the party’s bete noire, has returned to the heights she enjoyed before the migrant crisis.But there are signs that may be shifting. A poll last week found public approval for the government has dropped to 49 per cent in recent days, from a high of over 60 per cent in April, while the number dissatisfied with its performance has climbed to 42 per cent.Jens Spahn, the health minister, who is widely considered in political circles to have had a good crisis, was abused and spat on by protestors in the western city of Bergisch Gladbach at the weekend. Mrs Merkel has lost the support of Bild, Germany’s biggest-selling newspaper, which recently accused her of “scare tactics” and a coronavirus policy it says is “damaging the country”.“What if we get the impression that the measures taken to contain the virus did more damage than the virus itself? There are people who have these thoughts, and they are allowed to,” Jan Josef Liefers, a popular television actor, said at the weekend.It is against this backdrop that Mr Höcke and his colleagues have identified an opportunity in the protest movement, and an emboldened far-Right seized its moment on the steps of the Reichstag.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"taiwanese czech speaker channels jfk taiwan speech","story":"A senior Czech politician invoked a famous Cold War-era phrase by late US president John F Kennedy as he delivered a landmark speech to Taiwan\u0027s parliament Tuesday during a visit that has incensed Beijing.Czech Senate speaker Milos Vystrcil channelled President Kennedy\u0027s 1963 challenge to communism when he declared Ich bin ein Berliner to West Berlin citizens worried about the Soviet Union\u0027s looming presence behind the Iron Curtain.President Kennedy used the phrase \u0027Ich bin ein Berliner\u0027 to show his support for the people of Berlin and the highest values of freedom, Mr Vystrcil said.Maybe I can be more humble, but allow me to use the same determined phrase to conclude my speech in your country\u0027s parliament, in Taiwan - I am Taiwanese.His final declaration - I am Taiwanese - was delivered in Mandarin and received a standing ovation from lawmakers on the self-ruled island.As a precaution against coronavirus he gave his speech wearing a facemask, which was decorated with the flags of the Czech Republic and Taiwan.Mr Vystrcil is leading a 90-member delegation to Taiwan that Beijing has slammed as a despicable act.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi warned on Monday that Mr Vystrcil would pay a high price for his short-sighted behaviour and political speculation, while Beijing summoned the Czech ambassador.Prague then summoned Beijing\u0027s ambassador in response to Mr Wang\u0027s comments.Beijing\u0027s authoritarian leaders view Taiwan as part of China\u0027s territory and have vowed to seize the island, by force if necessary.It has tried to keep Taiwan diplomatically and economically isolated from the rest of the world, especially after the election of President Tsai Ing-wen in 2016.She rejects Beijing\u0027s idea that Taiwan is part of \u0027One China\u0027 and views the island as a de facto sovereign nation.The Czech government accepts Beijing\u0027s \u0027One China\u0027 policy and does not send official delegations to the island.But Mr Vystrcil is a member of the right-wing opposition Civic Democrats and is not bound by the protocol.The delegation, including politicians, entrepreneurs, scientists and journalists, will meet Ms Tsai on Thursday as part of their five-day trip.Mr Vystrcil said his visit was a way to highlight Czech sovereignty as his country should not listen to the orders of another country, especially a non-democratic country, a clear reference to Beijing.He said the Taiwan visit did not violate Czech\u0027s interpretation of the one China principle.We are not against the People\u0027s Republic of China, he told reporters.We also hope to have good, equal and mutually beneficial ties with the PRC, and similarly equal and mutually beneficial ties with Taiwan.Taiwanese parliamentary leader Yu Shyi-kun called Mr Vystrcil\u0027s visit a diplomatic breakthrough for Taipei that helps proves its existence to the international community.He does not yield to threats, intimidations and the lure of incentives...

And staff fear they will have to raid cash meant for teaching. One union boss said: “The Government should cover these costs.” Teachers’ leaders say that England’s , schools - already cash-strapped after a decade of austerity - are each spending an average £, to prepare. They have called on the Government to cover the costs - warning that the “short-sighted” decision means schools will be forced to use educational budgets to balance books. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Headteachers, said: “Every pound spent on cleaning materials is a pound that cannot be spent on a child’s education.” Around two in five schools are expected to welcome back pupils for the start of the autumn term on Tuesday, despite ongoing concerns about their ability to reopen safely. The majority of pupils will already be three months behind in their studies when theyto the classrooms, with boys the worst affected. Teachers estimate that those at school in the most disadvantaged areas could be more than four months behind pupils in the wealthiest areas. A National Foundation for Educational Research study also found the learning gap between the two groups has widened by % since the start of the pandemic. The Government has provided £m ‘catch-up’ funding to help close the gap, as well as covering some other costs related to an outbreak.  But schools are expected to cover additional expenses themselves - including sanitiser, extra cleaning staff, signs, disinfectant wipes, PPE kit, perspex screens and large ‘troughs’ for disinfecting outdoor play equipment themselves. Teachers’ leaders claim the £m ‘back to school’ cost will go up as they are forced to restock supplies, bring in supply staff to cover those who need to self-isolate, or in the event of a further lockdown. Mr Whiteman of the NAHT said: “School leaders and their teams have stuck to their task, calmly and professionally and parents can have confidence that schools will be ready. “Our research shows that  per cent of schools are organising regular additional cleaning of classrooms and school premises. The Government has mandated certain safety measures, and parents and schools alike would rightly expect the Government to meet these costs in full.  The NAHT’s latest research also found that three in  teachers believed budgetary constraints would affect their schools’ ability to reopen safely. Heads spent an average of £, getting ready, while they are also losing an average £, in income from renting out facilities or cancelled fund-raising events. The NASUWT union estimates thatschools spent as much as % of their funding on all Covid-related costs, rather than just reopening costs, they would need an injection of at least £.bn to this year’s £.bn funding budget. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, added: “The Government has said that schools should use their existing resources to make arrangements to welcome all children back, and that there are no plans to reimburse additional costs incurred as part of that process.  “This is a deeply disappointing and short-sighted decision which will inevitably mean that school budgets will be put under further strain. The costs that are associated with reopening in line with the Government’s own guidance are considerable. “Our view is that the Government should provide funding to cover these costs, so that school budgets, as well as extra catch-up money from the government, can be used as effectively as possible for educational purposes, rather than funding hygiene measures and plugging gaps in staffing.” One primary school head told how children will lose out as a result of a lack of Government support. The experienced teacher told the Mirror: “We are using precious money from our budget to pay for this which would otherwise be spent on resources for the children.  “We spent about £ and were led to believe we would be able to claim this back but we can’t. “The only claims allowed are as a result of measures for a suspected case of COVID in school. “Our costs will continue to rise as we open fully and we don’t know how long we will have to keep this level of cleaning up for. “It’s time consuming for staff to be endlessly cleaning door handles and light switches and the office staff are cleaning toilets during the day. “We can’t afford to pay the cleaner to come in, especially now we know we can’t claim back any of the costs.” A Department for Education spokesperson said: “Headteachers, teachers and school staff have gone to enormous s to ensure children can get back into their classes safely when the new term starts as it is the best place for their education, development and wellbeing.  “Throughout the pandemic, schools have continued to receive their core funding, with this year marking the first year of a three-year £.bn total cash boost.“Schools have also been able to claim for specic exceptional costs such as additional cleaning required due to confirmed or suspected coronavirus cases.”Education Secretary Gavin Williamson, who remains in post despite his handling of the A-level results debacle and a series of policy u-turns and last-minute advice for schools, faces demands to come to the House of Commons today [TUES] to say how he will protect pupils’ schooling. Labour leader Keir Starmer will call for a “proper plan” from the Government, adding: “He needs to explain how he will make up for the damage already done, bring pupils up to speed and mitigate against the ongoing risk from the pandemic.”Thanking teachers for their hard work, Mr Williamson said yesterday: “I do not underestimate how challenging the last few months have been but I do know how important it is for children to be back in school, not only for their education but for their development and wellbeing too.  “But it is down to the sheer hard work of so many teachers and school staff that from today pupils will be able to learn in their classrooms together again.” Schools have been warned to expect unruly and disruptive behaviour as some pupilsto class for the first time in nearly six months. Guidance issued by the DfE admits that many young people will struggle to adjust to routine and discipline after being at home for so long. It suggests schools should have plans in place to help pupils reintegrate into school le, with children with special educational needs likely to need extra support. New research shows that lockdown has heightened anxiety with one in three parents feeling their child will struggle to settle back in with friends. Almost halfsaid that lockdown has negatively impacted their child in the study by youth charity The Diana Award and Nationwide Building Society. More than a thirdof young people also admitted to being more worried than usual about theto school because of lockdown. The NAHT has said that % of schools plan to welcome all pupils full-time from the start of the autumn term, while the remaining % have set out how they will phase pupils back into class. All children will stay in groups or bubbles to reduce the risk of spreading infection, and older children in particular will be expected to follow social distancing guidelines.

Gavin Williamson acknowledged the damage being done to pupils by not being in school in a letter to parents, in which he said: If a child is not in school, they stand to lose far more than just a few months of learning. It could well put a huge dent in their future le chances. Education is a birthright, so letaposs make sure we get all children back - back to learning, back to playing and back to being kids again. And now a new survey of nearly , school leaders and teachers has provided firm evidence of this. The majority of pupils will be three months behind in their studies when theyto classrooms in England this week, it found. A whopping % of respondents felt students were not as far along with their learning as would normally be expected at the end of the   school year. Almost a quarterof teachers from across more than , mainstream primary and secondary schools also believed boys had fallen further behind than girls.  The National Foundation for Educational Researchaposssurvey comes as many studentsto classrooms this week for the first time since lockdown. Its study found that as of July, teachers had on average covered % of the curriculum during the   academic year. Teachers estimated on average that their pupils were three months behind in their studies, the survey said. However, more than halfof those teaching in the poorest schools in England reported their students were four months or more behind in their learning, compared to % of teachers in wealthier settings. The survey also found that the learning gap between disadvantaged pupils and their better-off peers had increased by %, adding that the figure was likely to be an under-estimate.  Labour leader Mr Starmer has accused the Government of taking a chaotic approach to education as he demanded Gavin Williamson show how he will make up for the damage already done to pupils.He said the Education Secretary should go to Parliament to tell us how he will protect our childrenaposs futures. Mr Starmer said:  Excitement for children who will be back in the classroom for the first time in months. But anxiety for teachers and parents about a year ahead that is full of uncertainty because of a pandemic that continues to cast its shadow over childrenaposs education. I want to pay tribute to the extraordinary dedication of our teachers and school staff who have worked tirelessly over the summer to make sure schools can reopen safely.  Labour want and expect children to be back at school. Every day that schools were closed was a day of opportunity, learning and support lost. This situation was worsened by the exams fiasco and the Governmentaposs chaotic approach to education. We cannot keep repeating those same mistakes. Young peopleaposs futures cannot be held back by the Conservativesapos incompetence. But the Department for Education said its £ billion Covid catch-up package will tackle the impact of lost teaching time and include targeted funding for the most disadvantaged students. Other findings from the teachersapos survey:The majority of pupils had been expected to learn at home throughout the   summer term, but teachers reported that only % ed their last piece of set work in July, compared to % in May. School leaders said that just over halfof students who were eligible todid so, with those from black, Asian and minority ethnicbackgrounds having lower attendance at %.Almost a thirdof school leaders said safety concerns from parents were a common reason for their children not attending. Almost three quarters of teachersdid not feel able to teach to their usual standard while the coronavirus regulations were in force, the survey found.In an open response question, % of , teachers whose teaching was affected said distancing requirements had a negative impact on areas such as group work and their ability to interact with pupils properly. More than half of school leadersalso reported that they were using teaching assistants to lead classes. Teachers estimated that % of their pupils will need intensive catch-up support, the survey said, with the percentage increasing to % in the most deprived schoolsPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, which represents leaders in the majority of schools, said: This is another alarm bell that the Government needs to pay attention to. The Covid- pandemic has interrupted education for the majority of children, and schools were already struggling to provide everything children needed before this crisis, damaged as they and other social services have been by a decade of austerity.  Mr Whiteman said schools will absolutely require additional support to play their part in healing the scars left by the pandemic. Dr Angela Donkin, chief social scientist at NFER, said: While it is crucial that children catch up, we should not assume that teachers will immediately be able to deliver the same quality of teaching, at the same speed, as before the pandemic.

Tracy and AJ, from Bellshill, Lanarkshire, Scotland, were terried their daughter would not survive when she was diagnosed with Covid- just three weeks after her birth.Peyton Maguire weighed just lbs when she was born two months premature in March, the Daily Record reports. However, the tot, now five-months-old, bounced back from coronavirus and has become a symbol of hope for Scotland and the world.Tracy has now revealed how AJ was forced to self-isolate at home as his daughter fought for her le.  He feared the last time he would see Peyton was through a Facetime call from the hospital. But she fought back, beat the virus and is now a happy, healthy five-month-old. Tracy, , still has no idea how her newborn baby contracted the virus but she is grateful to staff at Wishaw General for saving her little girl. She said: “She is doing amazing. She weighs over lb now.” But when the couple learned their precious little girl had contracted the virus their world collapsed.  Tracy said: “It was so new we just didn’t know what was going to happen. “As a premature baby she had to have blood tests every week to make sure there was nothing underlying. She had a snfle so they thought they would check everything was ok. They took swabs and they came back positive. “It was horrible for me but it was worse for my husband because he couldn’t be there with her.” Because Peyton had Covid both Tracy and AJ had to self isolate. Tracy was allowed to isolate with Peyton but AJ had to stay at home.  Tracy said: “I could see she was OK and physically hold her but he was completely locked down in the house. That was the hardest bit. “We both had lots of support but AJ couldn’t have any physical support. “Afterwards he said to me ‘I thought you were going to Facetime me from the hospital and that would be the last time I saw her’. That was really hard for him. “He had only been able to spend one hour with her a day since she was born because of lockdown and then he never saw her for another five days.  “I will never forget the look on his face when she finally came home and he got to hold her for the first time.” Because AJ was in isolation he never got to enjoy the proud dad moment of driving his baby girl home from hospital, instead that honour went to Tracy’s dad. When they drew up at the house Tracy struggled to unclip the car seat and finally AJ told his we to lt Peyton out and give her to him. Tracy remembered: “He just left us at the car and went away into the house with her. He was taking his baby home. “For a good hour he just sat holding her, smelling her, making these memories. “In hospital he couldn’t even feel her skin next to his face. That was all restricted, for good reason, but all these lovely memories had to be delayed for a wee while.” But to look at her ow you would never realise what a traumatic start she had to le.  Tracy said: “She is now at the point where she is finding her voice and she likes to talk and shout at us and have a couple of laughs. “She is beginning to look less like a baby and more like a wee girl. “For us just getting to this point , seeing her growing, is incredible.” Peyton was  weeks old before her grandparents got to hold her and they had to isolate for two weeks before they were able to. Tracy’s dad even had to take two weeks unpaid leave from work to allow him to spend time with her. Tracy said: “I worried she would be strange around other people because she was born during lockdown and we couldn’t see anybody. But we have aways Facetimed so she got used to the voices evenshe couldn’t meet people. And she definitely recognises voices.” Little Peyton seems to bear out the recent evidence that young children were unlikely to suffer really serious effects of the virus.

Since August  Scottish students have been back in the classroom. In their first few weeks back from their summer holidays pupils north of Hadrianaposs Wall were not required to wear face masks. However, as of today coverings are mandatory in both Scottish and Northern Irish schools in corridors and communal areas. It is hoped that the measure will help to limit infections as large numbers of children in dferent classes pass each other on the way to lessons. In Scotland the rules apply to all pupils over the age of , with everyone over the age of five to mask up on public transport to and from school. In Northern Ireland, post-primary pupils and teachers have to wear face coverings in corridors and communal areas. Masks on school buses are strongly recommended but not mandatory. It is not required for pupils to wear masks in classrooms in either country.  The stricter regulations come after several outbreaks at schools in Scotland. At one school in Dundee  members of staff and two pupils recently tested positive for the disease. Scotlandaposs Education Secretary John Swinney said: There is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.  We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus. And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups. He added: We want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.  Swinney has stressed pupils will not be excluded from schoolthey do not wear a face covering. The World Health Organisation has advised that children aged  and over should wear face masks.

Boseman’s parting gt was empowering youngsters like mine, yours and millions around the world to follow his example and to be the change that they want to see. It was in proving to the film industry that a black movie that didn’t just focus on black pain and suffering could shatter box office records and appeal to all audiences.Boseman had been inspired to seek out positive black roles having seen too few previously. He went on to play the music legend James Brown, the first black American in baseball’s major league, Jackie Robinson,  and Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American US supreme court justice. Then of course, came the Marvel superhero Black Panther. In the s when I grew up, Huggy Bear from Starsky  Hutch summed up the negative attitude of TV and film towards black characters. If they were not portrayed as gangsters or pimps they were seemingly directed to endear themselves to audiences by making them laugh. Boseman exuded dignity and authority in and out of character, inspiring a generation of kids to triumph through adversity.

Jade Miller discovered she was pregnant via a blood test after she was rushed to Royal Preston Hospital in agonising pain on August . Jade was immediately wheeled into the surgery theatre where her fallopian tube was removed along with her child. Doctors told the -year-old, from Preston, Lancashire, that she might not have survived had she called an ambulance later on that day. Have you had a similar experience during the pandemic  Email webnews@mirror  The experience of discovering she was pregnant before losing the child has been a deeply traumatic one for Jade, made worse by the fact she endured it alone. Under legislation brought in under the pandemic patient support has been severely restricted, meaning thousands of women across the UK have suffered miscarriages without a friendly face beside them. Now Jade, a GPaposs receptionist and Instagram influencer, is calling on the government to change the policy so women have proper support.  She told : I called an ambulance because I thought I was going to pass out and didnapost think I could make it to the car.  I was then told my husband couldnapost come with me because of coronavirus restrictions. At the hospital I had a blood test and found out I was pregnant but that it was ectopic and had ruptured. I had to go straight to emergency surgery within half an hour of finding this out.  Finding all these things out was extremely traumatic by itself, without being alone. I wasnapost allowed to see anyone following the operation. Jade, who is mum to an -month-old boy, lost a litre of blood due to her tube rupturing.  Because endometriosis had already damaged one of her fallopian tubes, she may now not be able to carry another baby to term. While she was receiving one piece of devastating news after another her husband Patrick, , was waiting at home unclear of what was going on. Jade said: I had to call him before the emergency surgery to say I was pregnant, had lost the baby and was going into surgery.  I went into hospital at .am and he didnapost hear from me until pm. He is traumatised. He thought I was going to die. Jade has launched a petition calling for a change in the governmentaposs policy so that women who risk losing their unborn child can be accompanied into hospital.  In the week since she has been inundated with messages from women who have been through similarly traumatic experiences. Jade added: When someone tells you your baby has died you need someoneaposs hand to hold. It is a very alien environment. To have to be told that your baby has died, alone and without that support, is devastating.

Does that impress you with the lesaving power of something as simple as exercise  It does me. Researchers decided we’ve been concentrating too much on the ­negative fallout of our sedentary and inactive lestyles with bad news stories about heart disease, stroke, diabetes, even cancer. Scientists at the universities of ­Edinburgh and Cambridge wanted to celebrate the benefits of getting active rather than repeatedly telling people they’ll pay a pricethey fail to do so. The science team, including researchers from Moray House School of Education and Sport, studied data from  countries in an attempt to find out how many people on the planet were meeting recommended activity guidelines –  minutes of moderate exercise or  minutes of vigorous exercise each week. The proportion of people meeting these World Health Organisation guidelines in dferent countries was quite ied – from a low of % in Kuwait to % in Mozambique. The figure for Britain was %, still too low.To estimate the number of premature deaths prevented each year by exercise, researchers combined this data with estimates of the risk of dying early for active people, compared with the same risk in inactive people. What they found was that globally, thanks to exercise, premature death rates were % lower than they would have been – equating to approximately . million lives saved per year. This is a much more uplting message than the number of early deaths due to lack of physical activity – estimated at . million premature deaths each year. The researchers are keen to tell a good news story of what is already being achieved by focusing on the number of lives saved. In simple terms, concentrating on le rather than death.

Barbara Harvey suffered from a tingling and itchy sensation in her left nipple that spread to her whole breast over the course of a year. She said the feeling was aposdriving her madapos and she was forced to apostweakapos her left nipple while out in public to try and relieve herself of the irritation. Barbara, from Plymouth, Devon, said she also had the feeling that she wanted to breastfeed a baby. After several aposfrustratingapos trips to her GP revealing her baffling symptoms, doctors declared she was lump-free and that nothing was wrong. It was only when retired business owner Barbara, who hasnapost breast-fed since , visited a locum doctor that she was referred to hospital for a mammogram. Barbara was so stunned she broke down in tears when doctors diagnosed her with breast cancer - in her right breast rather than her itchy left one. She underwent a gruelling operation in April  to remove the tumour and a lymph node - weeks before her th birthday. Now aged  and cancer-free, Barbara is bravely sharing her experience to make other women aware of symptoms to look out for. Barbara said: All the health campaigns talk are about searching for any lumps or other changes, but they never mention the unusual symptoms I had at nearly  years old. Over the course of a year I experienced an itchy tingling feeling in my nipple that soon spread to the whole of the breast. I found without consciously being aware of it I was tweaking my nipple, I wanted to squeeze it as it felt as though Iaposd got milk in there and sometimes a clear liquid would come out. As time went on the irritation was driving me mad, it felt like I wanted to feed a baby from my left breast. When you are breastfeeding a baby you do get these feelings in there. The symptoms first started in , at the time I just thought aposoh itaposs something to do with my hormonesapos I never dreamt it was going to end up being cancer. When the consultant sat me down and gave me the news I was a bit numb, I was in total shock. I left his office, got in my car, drove to my sonaposs, walked through the door and burst into tears.  Barbara, who last breastfed her youngest  years ago in , said she went to the doctors a number of times desperate to get to the bottom of what was causing the bizarre sensation. Despite being declared lump-free several times, Barbara was unconvinced that all was well. The final straw came when she was unable to enjoy her regular knitting group meet-ups after being plagued by itchiness she was desperate to relieve. Barbara said: Iaposm a very sociable person and I run knitting groups, and have done for ten years. What worried me was the fact that I suddenly realised I was sitting there with other people and tweaking my left nipple because it was irritating me. It was very embarrassing trying to relieve that itch in public, I managed to keep it under wraps so nobody commented on it, but it was very frustrating. Fed up of being fobbed off, Barbara ed to her GP and was relieved when a locum doctor suggested a referral to Derrord Hospital in Plymouth, where she underwent a mammogram. Barbara said: Iaposd been going backwards and forwards to the doctor because it felt like I wanted to feed a baby from my left breast. The doctor would examine me and say there were no lumps, it was frustrating being told there was nothing wrong. A locum lady took a look and said although I had no lumps it was worth investigating and that she would request I have a mammogram. I went along to the hospital where they did the mammogram and I was told I had cancer. The specialist described it as being shaped like a fried egg - the aposyolkapos being the cancer and the aposwhiteapos being the oestrogen that the cancer feeds on. He took a biopsy and very soon after that I was told I had to go in and have it taken out. I found this fascinating, all the feeling was in my left breast but the cancer was in the right breast.  Barbara underwent the operation to remove the tumour and a lymph node, which came back clear showing that the cancer hadnapost spread where. The gran-of-seven now has hormone therapy, annual mammograms and avoids products containing oestrogen. Barbara said: During the operation they took away the cancer and one of the lymph nodes. That was clear, which was great news, and I was discharged the same day. After the op the tingling sensation disappeared. Iaposm now on tablets that stop my body producing oestrogen and I also carefully avoid anything with oestrogen in it, such as soya.  Barbara, who breastfed all four of her children, said: I was always aware of my breasts as they were very big, I didnapost struggle feeding any of my four children. Iaposm , so my boobs are almost down to my knees now, but there was a time when I was only st something but I was a HH. Iaposve always been conscious of my boobs but I never gave it a thought that it could be cancer. Barbara is now sharing her experience so women know to look out for other less well-known symptoms, as well as checking for lumps.

The exhausted pet spaniel had gone bounding after the birds while on a walk along the beach in Rhyl on Monday morning, before getting carried away. The dogaposs owner could only watch as his pet swam further out before he dialled  for help at around am.He was advised to keep the dog in sight and refrain from attempting any rescue of his own, and within  minutes of the call volunteers from Rhyl Coastguard launched a leboat, reports NorthWalesLive. Initial reports said that the dog was off the old Suncentre site to the East of the station at Rhyl, but the owner updated the coastguards saying that the dog was actually off the new SC site to the west. The leboat turned round and sped to the scene, directed by the coxswain at the boathouse over the station radio. The dog was soon located, brought on board the leboat and ed to his grateful owner.  Martin Jones, RNLI Coxswain for Rhyl’s RNLI Leboat, said: There was initial worry the owner would attempt to rescue the dog, but on the coastguard’s advice, remained on the beach, keeping the dog in sight. We are so happy the animal and it’s owner are reunited.In a video filmed from the leboat and posted on the RNLI Twitter page, a rescuer can be heard saying youaposre not supposed to be this far out, as they approach the paddling dog.He then whistles and says come here with the dog still around  yards away. The video then cuts to the boat right alongside the pet, as it continues to swim. The rescuer says: Come here.

Her mum, Tina, says the chances of finding another donor are so slim that doctors are now planning a dferent course of treatment. But, in future, a stem call ­transplant is Evie’s best hope of being cured. The schoolgirl, from Whitby, North Yorks, was first taken to hospital with a rash and was diagnosed with aplastic anaemia in May. After a global donor search was launched, a   match was found and the anonymous donor agreed to the procedure. In preparation, Evie had to have dental work and one of her oies was removed. But on August  the donor pulled out. Tina, , who works at RAF Flyingdales, in Pickering, North Yorks, said: “We were devastated, it was a huge blow. We have no idea why the donor changed their mind. Evie has already been through so much. She thought she had a donor and now she doesn’t. “The donor pulling out is quite hard-hitting, but we want to raise awareness of the stem cell register. It’s so easy to be a donor. It’s just like giving blood, but you could save a child’s le. It’s so easy to join but only % of the UK population is registered.” Evie said: “I need this transplant to save my le. Please sign the register to help.” Tina added: “The condition Evie has is le-threatening. She won’t survive without a transplant. We are desperately appealing for people to sign the stem cell register.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince harry upset cant fly","story":"NewsPrince Harry ‘upset’ he and Meghan Markle can’t join William and Kate at BalmoralPrince Harry is understood to be frustrated the coronavirus pandemic has prevented him visiting Balmoral Castle with the rest of the royals, with William and Kate having arrived on FridayShareCommentsByRyan Merrield:,  SEP Updated:,  SEP Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news world-news video prince-harry-eager-teach-archie-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Damien Turner, , has been part of the adult baby diaper lover communityfor ten years and wears nappies all day. The US nappy-lover, from West Virginia, said acting like a baby gives off a very calm relaxing and safe vibe but that his lestyle has caused problems in his professional le. Currently unemployed, he is constantly in and out of jobs and has been fired by previous employers for being childish. Speaking to , Damien said: Diapers are very convenient, comfortable, and cute. It’s a very nice lestyle and I wouldn’t want to do anything .  Dressing and acting like a baby gives off a very calm, relaxing, safe vibe. It’s almost asyou were back in preschool without a worry in the world. Employment is hard. Iaposm constantly in and out of jobs. Sometimes my employers find my pictures online or just canapost put up with the fact Iaposm wearing a diaper and acting childish in the workplace. Damien never hides his lestyle choice but has lost friends and is often teased outside of work. He has since been welcomed into the ABDL community who have helped him feel at home.He said : Iaposve lost a few childhood best friends. I do still have a few good friends that all know about it. I never hide it. If you are around me, itaposs just the norm. The adult baby used to work in the catering industry as a service coordinator and is open about his lestyle on social media. He claims bosses felt uncomfortable by his actions and he is now forced to live off his savings after being fired.Damien said:I have enough saved up for a while but at the moment I’m currently putting in job applications. So we’ll see how that goes. Since childhood, Damien has had a desire to wear nappies and has been wearing them since he was . He initially told his parents, who support his lestyle, that he had an incontinence problem and fully embraced the lestyle during his teen years.  Damien added: ‘It’s something I’ve always been into since I was a kid. If I really had to pin it to something I’d say episodes of SpongeBob or Tom and Jerry where they are wearing a diaper for a gag or throwaway joke. I found it very appealing and have pretty much been wearing them since I was . I lied and told my parents I had an [incontinence] problem at the time so they would buy me some. Eventually, I told them the truth. My parents don’t really mind at all, I’ve never had a problem with them when it came to my lestyle. Despite the support from his family, Damien has been poked fun at on the street and faced cyberbullying where people post memes of him.

The rare breed, known for its unique howls, has been found in the highlands of west New Guinea, also known as Papua, in Indonesia. The animals were first discovered there in , however researchers have only just published evidence showing they are apossingingapos dogs. A journal article comparing DNA from three of the  wild pooches was published on Monday. Around  apossingingapos dogs, whose ancestors were captured in the s, live in zoos and conservation centres. Their genomes were not identical with the wild group of dogs, however the dference was attributed to decades of inbreeding among the captive population. A description of the journal article, which was published in PNAS, states: We provide DNA-based evidence for an ancestral relationship between highland wild dogsand captive NGSD suggesting that the founding population of the NGSD is not, in fact, extinct and that HWD should be resourced for conservation efforts to rebuild this unique canid population. Researcher Elaine Ostrander said: They look most related to a population of conservation biology new guinea singing dogs that were descended from eight dogs brought to the United States many, many, many years ago."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/06/594260fd79dff-471x575.jpg ","title":"charlie adam set dream move dundee","story":"Charlie Adam is in signing talks with Dundee.And Tele Sport understands the lelong Dark Blues fan is keen on a move to Dens Park.Adam has been training with Bolton Wanderers in recent weeks and has been tipped as a potential signing for the English League Two side, who are managed by his former Blackpool teammate Ian Evatt.However, Dundee have swooped with an audacious bid to bring the former Liverpool, Stoke City and Rangers man back to his home city.Charlie told Tele Sport in July of his readiness toto Scotland after more than a decade in England.Now, Dundee fans will hope their club ends up as the latest addition to the -year-old’s glittering CV.Talks are ongoing between the Dens Park club and -times-capped Adam – and are set to continue over the weekend.It is understood there is still distance between the parties’ respective positions, but with both eager to get a deal done, a resolution is likely to be reached in the next few days.Adam has not played a game in the Scottish league since , when he left Rangers for Blackpool on loan.After penning a permanent deal with the Seasiders, he spearheaded their promotion to the Premier League in , scoring a stunning free-kick in their play-off final victory over Cardf City.A big-money move to Liverpool followed, before Stoke City paid around £ million for his services in .He stayed with the Potters for seven years, becoming a fans’ favourite, before spending last season with Reading in the Championship.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

But he has to find that consistency to stay in the team.#As far as interest in him, then I#m delighted for him. I hope there is because that means I#ve got good players here.#I wouldn#t want an empty scouting bay as that would mean people had made their mind up about my team.#I have no problem in teams taking an interest but it honestly won#t deflect away from every day improvement and trying to win games of football.#Mellon will come up against a familiar face in the opposition dug-out on Saturday when he takes United to Rugby Park to take on Alex Dyer#s Kilmarnock.Mellon knows the Englishman well from his time south of the border and while he insists there will be no old pal#s act this weekend, he is confident his friend can turn Killie#s campaign around after seeing them open up the season with just two points from the opening five games.The former Shrewsbury and Tranmere boss said: #I#ve known Alex for a long, long time. He#s a real good football man. I#ve competed against him numerous times.#I remember him and Chris Powell at Charlton and again at Huddersfield, so I know him really well.#I know that he will make sure his team are ready and we#ll have to overcome that challenge.#I#ve no doubt he can get Kilmarnock out of the situation they#re in. It doesn#t even need me to justy that.#Given his experience in football and the type of guy he is, you can#t look at him and think he doesn#t have the know-how to win games at any time.#It#s always dficult when you get both Rangers and Celtic in your first five fixtures.#But we know we#ll have to go down to Rugby Park and get an awful lot right.#We#ve shown in the first five games that we#re a match for anyone.#What we need to find is the consistency of that performance over a league season.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

class=attachment-part-small size-part-small wp-post-image ","title":"north east leisure facilities welcome back customers after five month wait","story":"Gyms, swimming pools and other leisure facilities across the north-east have thrown their doors open to fitness fans for the first time since they were shut due to the Covid- lockdown.Those tired of doing workouts in their living rooms and running the same old circuit around their local park made their way out to the health centres – some of which are offering heavy discounts.Sport Aberdeen, the charity which runs several venues across the city, saw a total of  bookings for yesterday’s reopening.Customers and trainers alike were thrilled to get back to their old regimens again.Michael Watson, a Sport Aberdeen health and wellbeing co-ordinator, said: “It was so great to welcome people back to our classes today, we are all set up and so happy to get back and get going.”Irene Kerr, a member at Get Active @ Sheddocksley, said: “I’m really looking forward to coming back, slightly nervous, but raring to get going again!”Sport Aberdeen director of community leisure operations David Selkirk said: “The response to our venues reopening has been great.“It has been a busy day and we are thrilled to see people back in the gym, taking part in fitness classes and following our safety protocols so well.“We worked hard to make sure that our venues were safe, clean and ready to welcome our members back, and to have so many memberson the first day has been fantastic.“Now our focus is on engaging with the community, providing them with a range of opportunities to get active across the city.”Duncan Sinclair, chief executive of Aberdeen Sports Village, said: “It feels great to be able to open our doors to our members again today and see so many familiar faces come to ASV and support us once again.“After four months, there were some nerves and a lot of excitement but we had been working behind the scenes during the downtime to make sure that we were ready to welcome our members back to enjoy all of the facilities with safety, health and wellbeing at the forefront.“We have new procedures in place to ensure everyone feels safe throughout ASV, whether they are in the gym, on the tracks or in the aquatics centre, and our team is on hand to help members with the changes as everyone s to enjoy the world-class facilities here at the Sports Village.”The reopening date for gyms was brought forward after First Minister Nicola Sturgeon initially indicated sports facilities would only be able to reopen from September .The change of plan meant a hectic few weeks for staff at gyms, but the work paid off yesterday morning with the majority of visitors saying they felt safe toto the buildings despite earlier fears about the potential for coronavirus to spread inside them.New measures in place to keep customers safe include an abundance of hygiene stations and machines being taped off to ensure those using them remain safely spaced out.The co-owner of Results Gym on South College Street in Aberdeen, Lewis Thomson, said: #It#s maybe going to feel a bit weird to start off with, it#s very dferent to what it was like pre Covid-.#We#ve got a lot of safety measures in place and we#ve followed the guidance down to a tee.#The gym has a three-layer track and trace system to ensure #nobody falls through the gaps#.Mr Thomson said: #We have members only at the moment and we#ve opted for a booking system online.#Members are also asked to complete an application form and the door entry system will track users coming in and out with a QR code on their phones.The owner added: #We are operating at a reduced capacity to give people space to do what they want to do.#Normally  people are allowed in the building, but this has been reduced to  including staff.#We#ve made other strict guidelines including enforcing masks to be worn in the gym at all times.  If everyone follows our guidelines, it should limit the chances of any transmission.#At Energie Fitness in Inverurie, owner Nick Ruta has formed plans to launch a #Covid support membership# for people who have lost their jobs due to the pandemic.Standard membership is £. and the facility hopes to provide the discounted tarf at £ per month.Mr Ruta said: #We want to do this as a way to look out for people who have been affected by job loss.#The pandemic has been a very worrying time for a lot of people and being able to go to the gym is a good way to relieve stress.#In an effort to keep members safe, the gym equipment is being thoroughly cleaned throughout the day.Mr Ruta added: #We#ve had a long time to prepare for the opening and we would have been ready to open much sooner than now.#We#ve been asking membersthey feel safe and comfortable. So far we#ve had a very positive response, those who have been coming along seem happy # but, understandably, not everyone is ready to come back yet.#Meanwhile, a handful of lycra-clad fitness fans were working out in the Pure Gym at Kittybrewster by .am.There were red warning signs affixed to every second machine to ensure that people remained distant from one another, and several stands with sanitiser and anti-bacterial spray.The gym has launched a mobile phone app which allows members to check how many people are there before attending.Meanwhile, Live Le Aberdeenshire, the Aberdeenshire Council body with operates a number of leisure facilities throughout the region, has announced a swathe of promotional price offers to welcome customers back into its gyms, sports courts and swimming pools throughout September.A -day gym pass, which originally cost £, is now £, and the gym or swim only option has had its price reduced to £ from £. – with a discounted pass for households too.Inidual exercise sessions, including fitness classes and gym entry, are half price at £..An inidual swim now costs £., and a group swim £., while there is also a heavy discount on the use of sports courts and outdoor pitches.Prices are reduced further for those with a low income, students, young people and the over-s, with all-inclusive passes for those with low incomes priced at £.Six key facilities have now been reopened by Live Le Aberdeenshire, with the rest opening their doors on a phased basis.The six currently available are Banchory, Banff, Fraserburgh, Stonehaven, Peterhead and Turrf, though people can still do outdoor fitness sessions at facilities that are currently closed.Further announcements are expected in coming weeks.All customers are asked to book and pay for their chosen activity before attending.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

The decision was taken to send me to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, and Neil Newman and Billy McArthur drove very carefully on the ersion route to Paisley, avoiding the recently damagedRest and be Thankful route.I am grateful to all those who delivered care to such a high standard, ensuring that my recovery was so successful after excellent treatment at the RAH.Jeremy Houston, PoltallochSir,As I read Councillor Alastair Redman’s letter in the August  edition of the Advertiser I thought how sad it is that a young man should always have such a pessimistic and depressing outlook that he chooses to share regularly with your readers.While we live through a pandemic we have seen the very best in people in our communities working to support and care for each other.Only last week the council publicly thanked the thousands of volunteers for their amazing efforts during the past months.The volunteers throughout our communities worked tirelessly and optimistically, always offering encouragement and kindness helping those who were at home to stay positive during such an anxious time.Local businesses provided an excellent service and continue to do so, enabling people to shop locally without making long journeys.If Councillor Redman cannot see the confident and positive support in all of our communities perhaps he should book an eye test, and he most certainly doesn’t have to travel to Barnard Castle to visit an optician.Councillor Anne Horn, TarbertSir,I was delighted to see the piece in a recent issue of the Argyllshire Advertiser featuring a reader from Tayvallich, setting out his case for #Time for Change#. I share many of his concerns, and commend the series of articles.It would be good to hear from a range of Argyll and Bute residents with their ideas for how we get from #here# towards a better #there#. My personal pet project would be an Argyll and Bute Citizens’ Assembly, that would bring people together to generate real strategies to bring about just and #green# change for our area.A good start would be better transport links, via enhanced road and ferry services.A permanent solution to the Rest and be Thankful would be welcome, of course, but it was really heartening to see how Western Ferries rose to the challenge on Friday Auust .  They magicked away that endless queue at Gourock with great patience and goodwill and double service, showing what can be done.Mary MacCallum Sullivan, ArdrishaigSir,Following the latest landslide and road closure at the Rest and be Thankful, once again the road closure signs were placed at the wrong place on the Arrochar side.Having spoken to several of the local businesses owners, the main issue around the signs are they are too far away from the incident. There are information signs from Balloch to Tarbet advising of the closure at the Rest.Surely moving the signs to Ardgartan would make more sense. Should anyone have to turn then there is ample space to do this.

This is now brought into line with the public transport guidance.What about primary school children With the exception of school buses as outlined above, the new guidance in schools only applies to secondary school pupils.Do they need to be worn in class While staff and students can continue to wear face coveringsthey wish to, they will not generally be necessary in the classroom.This is because there is greater scope for physical distancing and face coverings can have an impact on teaching.However it remains the case that where adults cannot keep m distance and are interacting face-to-face for a sustained period , face coverings should be wornCan a child be excluded for not wearing one It is expected that the guidance will state that pupils should notbe excluded from schoolthey do not wish to wear a face covering.Can someone help my child with their covering Education Secretary John Swinney said:ldquoSchools will be asked to ensure children and young people have clear instructions on how to put on, remove, and store face coverings.\"Any staff member or pupil will still be able to wear a face covering when they wish to do so.\"John Swinney confirmed the new guidanceWhy is this being done Mr Swinney added:ldquoThere is increasing evidence that face coverings can provide some protection for the wearer as well as those around them.\"We also know that some pupils have found it very dficult to physically distance when moving around school, which could increase the risk of transmission of the virus.\"And on school transport, as on public transport, there can be mixing between dferent age groups.\"What  was said Mr Swinney said:ldquoWe want to continue to protect what we have achieved in suppressing the virus and re-opening schools, and to do the best for children in schools.\"Alongside this change to the wearing of face coverings, we need to reinforce the importance of maintaining high standards of cleaning, personal hand and respiratory hygiene and physical distancing, where possible.\"In situations where there is a local cluster, use of face coverings throughout the day may be required.ldquoThe position will be kept under review to ensure that our

Masks can trigger ious types of skin irritationsand redness .How can you combat maskne There isnrsquot a prevention for maskne, as we need to continue wearing our masks, but there are ways that you can help combat the issues.Skin Care routineIf you want to combat the impact of maskne then having a good skincare routine is essential.It is just as important to cleanse your skin before wearing a mask as it is to cleanse after wearing a mask.To help your skin heal, Ashley would recommend using a squalane or balm cleanser so help remove make-up, dirt and debris.However,you are experiencing chapped, irritated skin or suffer from sensitivity then a gel based cleanseradvised.Dermalogicarsquos UltraCalming Cleanser helps to calm and cool sensitised irritated skin.ExfoliatingExfoliating is key to clear clogged pores and remove dead skin cells which will help reduce the impact of maskne.There are thousands of dferent types of exfoliators available from chemical, physical and masks but it is always important to follow the recommended application and how often you should use the product.Over-exfoliating your skin can compromise your skins barrier , damage the skins capillaries and dehydrate the skin.Ingredients such as glycolic acid, lactic acid and salicylic acid are great exfoliating athelping fight breakouts.Spot treatmentsUsing targeted spot treatments with ingredients such as salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide will help remove dead skin cells and decongest pores.Hyaluronic AcidsHyaluronic acid can hold , times its weight in water -

It was the sound of their wings that caught my attention before I saw them. It was a lockdown morning, no traffic, no background sound, and they were flying low.I never have been much of a bird watcher well, what I mean is I have always loved sightings of wildle, including birds, but donrsquot sit for hours to spot dferent types. I know the names of some birds but many I canrsquot identy with certainty. My friend Jim is my human encyclopaedia for such things.Of course, we can still appreciate nature and wildle without being able to identy their exact names. A beautul tree is still worthy of admiration, evenyou donrsquot knowitrsquos an oak or a sycamore. You can enjoy the antics of a flock of birds, evenyoursquore not surethey are martins or swts.And there are some wild creatures we all know and can identy: a fox, a robin, a hedgehog, a squirrel, a rabbit, a mole, a deer, a dandelion, a daisy, a heron, a swan, a duck and a hare would be on this list, but itrsquos not as extensive as it used to be. As nature has receded from our lived experiences, so has the ability to identy and name much of the wildle and plants that survive around us.The beautully illustrated book The Lost Words by Jackie Morris and Robert MacFarlane was a response to this loss of nature vocabulary. With beautul pictures and poems, it brings back to le some of the animals and flora of our land. And resources like the ranger service do a fantastic job in our county, providing walks, giving fascinating information and talking to a iety of groups.But itrsquos the lived experience of nature that is the vital link between having knowledge and developing an understanding that will nurture a love of our natural environment. We cannot really love that which we do not experience and value personally. Itrsquos when we physically encounter a plant or animal that we develop a desire to know its name and understand its signicance.This seems a perfect time to find ways to enhance that lived experience of nature. In schools, because of the presence of Covid, learning outdoors as much as possible is being promoted. Some schools will have access to woodland or natural areas more than others. Some schools in built-up areas will be more restricted. But even in urban areas, there may be a grassy area with a tree or two, or perhaps a nature corner can be created.Teachers do a great job, and they are doing so in very challenging circumstances just now they know their business. But as a storyteller who until the lockdown was in schools every week telling stories, I am unable to do so in these new circumstances. I fully understand why, of course.But as things develop, it may be possible for storytelling to take place outdoors, wersquoll see. For me this is not so much a restriction but a new opportunity to make nature the stage, with listeners immersed in the natural surroundings in which so many stories are set. Evenonly concrete playground is currently available, there is potential to make more of the outdoor space now that it will be used in a dferent way.As I say, time will tell what will be possible. My interest is not just as a storyteller but also as a parent. Itrsquos a time to be cautious and safe, yes, but let us not forget the vital importance of the creative arts in all this. Many children have missed out on so much already, and music, song, storytelling and drama are such a vital part of childrenrsquos development and soul indeed for us all. Perhaps we all need to relearn the campfire spirit, around which so much human culture and understanding developed.And so my thoughtsto the swts which flew over my garden. They will now be flying over Africa, following the rains and chasing the insects there. Their story is utterly fascinating a lesson in natural and human history, as well as geography, biology and ecology.Soon the pink-footed geese from Iceland will arrive in their honking formations, to spend their winter here. Irsquove noticed some trees are showing they already feel the nip of autumn. The cycle of naturersquos stories are all around us,we have an ear to listen and eye to notice.More learning outdoors is a gt. Letrsquos make the most of it."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-peeps-past-august-25-28-1995-1970-1920","story":"A POTENTIALLY fatal craze in Dunbar was highlighted in the East Lothian Courier on August , .Children as young as  are risking their lives by ing ft into Dunbar harbour.The fine summer weather has enticed groups of youngsters to put on their swimming trunks and leap into the water at the harbour entrance.And warnings that their antics could be fatal have only moved the boys on to even more dangerous jumps into the rocky sea near the ruined castle.Dunbar community policeman PC David Munro said that the craze had been going on for several weeks and the dozen-strong group ldquodid not seem to appreciate the dangers.ldquoApart from the diesel, oil and other chemicals that are floating on the surface, the kids are also at risk from the boats that are coming in and out, he said.ldquoThey could easily fall on to rocks belowthey slipped or lost their footing and it is also worrying that younger children are coming along and want to imitate the older ones.A NEW school opened in Haddington, reported The Haddingtonshire Courier of August , .Haddingtonrsquos new school ndash Kingrsquos Meadow Primary School ndash opened its doors to pupils for the first time on Monday.The school, which cost about pound, to build, can accommodate  pupils.Built by James Harrison and CoLtd., Edinburgh, it was designed by Mr Colin Stewart, a Haddington man employed as an architect by the firm.

However, in our local conditions wersquove rarely seen it much above -.metres.If yoursquore looking for an evergreen tree, itrsquos worth remembering many coners are extremely hardy and tolerant of adverse conditions, surviving in severe coastal conditions and at altitude.The tree wersquore highlighting is the Picea omorika, sometimes called the Serbian or Bosnian spruce, being native to those countries.With dense, short green needles that are slightly whitish underneath, it has a dense, columnar habit, and forms a graceful, slender, conical feature in the garden.It is extremely hardy and, although it doesnrsquot require any pruning, it can be trimmed to remain in proportion to the garden.Many of our customers love garden lighting, and the stable conical form of P omorika makes it the ideal plant for strings of lights!For something a little dferent, why not try Phormium Phormium is sometimes known as the New Zealand flax because of its country of origin. It is one of the hardiest plants we know and indeed is used effectively at the front of the garden centre as a windbreak!Grown primarily for its form, the clumps of strap-like leaves are virtually indestructible, and some years will even produce tall, architectural flowering spikes which dry and remain a feature.Most often grown as a focal point, it can also be used to create an unusual hedge.There are many ieties of Phormium to choose from offering a wide range of colours, from eye-catching yellow through to deep, purplish-black, or combinations of colours on striped leaves.Similarly, therersquos a great selection of sizes available, from small compact ieties to the larger ieties that can exceed two metres.Itrsquos been very dficult to choose only five of our favourite evergreens, because there are so many wonderful plants that will provide you with structure, form, colour and interest throughout the year.If you require advice on these plants or other options, just please speak to one of our plant team and theyrsquoll help you choose an evergreen plant thatrsquos just right for you!"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus-scotland-book-covid-test-testing-centres","story":"The First Minister suggests some Scots have had trouble trying to book coronavirus tests over the weekend due to a \"major spike\" in demand, which resulted in technical issues.Butyou are experiencing symptoms, how do you get a test  Heres everything you need to know.If you think you are experiencing symptoms of coronavirus, you should take a test.

The doocot on its land was built in the mid th century after Oliver Cromwell had sacked the tower, which has a pit-prison and stands four storeys high."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.comource srcset=/resources/images/11435036.jpg?htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"new-bbc-documentary-series-jamie-genevieve-great-indoors-air-week","story":"The make-up artist, who is a worldwide star on YouTube and Instagram, will star in the three-part series Jamie Genevieve: Great Indoors on BBC Scotland onThursday at . pm.It comes after the success of her first documentary for the networks BBC Scotland channel Jamie Genevieve #Unfiltered.The former Cathkin High School pupil started out working in make-up counters in Debenhams in Glasgow.Now she is known for her how to make-up demonstrations on YouTube.The new mini-series focuses on how Jamie and husband Jack is coping in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic from trying her hand at hairdressing to baking."},{"url":null,"title":"list-glasgow-shops-administration-lockdown","story":"Here we look at some of the businesses who will no longer be operating in the city and the ones under threat.Remnant KingsCity location: Howard StreetA total of  stafflost their jobs from the firmrsquos bases in Glasgow, Hamilton, and Edinburgh after the administrators were called in.The firm, which started in Glasgow in , said that although they were historically profitable, they have since suffered from declining turnover and trading dficulties in recent years caused by changing consumer habits.:Glasgow firm Remnant Kings goes into admistration resulting in job lossesOasis and Warehouse GroupCity locations past and present: Buchanan Galleries, Silverburn, Princes Square, and Glasgow Fort.The company behind Oasis and Warehouse went into administration in April when Deloitte was appointed as administrator.All stores haveclosed indefinitely whileonline sales have stopped.Reports say the fashion brands have been sold to restructuring business Hilco in a deal which includes stock but not the  stores or  concessions.Hash Ladha, chief executive of Oasis Warehouse, previouslysaid: ldquoThis is a situation that none of us could have predicted a month ago, and comes as shocking and dficult news for all of us.ldquoWe as a management team have done everything we can to try and save the iconic brands that we love.:Oasis and Warehouse who have shops in Glasgow fall into administrationCath KidstonCity location: Gordon StreetCath Kidston said they will not reopen their shops when lockdown ends.They called in the administrators in April with the closure of shops costing around  jobs.It is understood that the owner of the retro fashion brand has secured a deal to buy back the brand and its online operation.

I really wanted to get the role.IN WHAT WAYS DID YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THE CHARACTER Even physically we were quite similar. He talks about having a wiry strength from the long walks around the Yorkshire Dales... And I was very sporty as well, just like Alf was.Hes got a lot of passion and commitment to his field and that was like me. Once I found acting, I was completely enveloped in it - and havent looked back.He has little intricacies sometimes he can be a little socially awkward... Little quirks that I could identy with. I had fun with them as well.HOW DAUNTING WAS YOUR FIRST DAY OF FILMING I thought Id be more nervous or apprehensive on the first day of filming I really wasnt, and it was a fortunate revelation.My first day was with Samuel West - obviously a veteran of the industry. I was so excited to work with him and then, on top of that, he was just so lovely. Any questions I had, he was there for me.He just put me at ease straight away and, its maybe a bit corny, but I genuinely did feel at home on that first day.HOW DO YOU THINK FANS OF THE ORIGINAL SERIES WILL REACT TO THIS ADAPTATION The original is obviously loved the world over- and in a lot of peoples eyes, its perfect. But Ive never thought of it as a competition in any way, because its a completely new adaptation. The storyline will not be the exact same.That series was the late seventies, eighties, and the technology in filmmaking has come on leaps and bounds. Youre going to see the Dales in stunning HD, with drone shots and crane shots. I think the Dales are really realised in this it is like another character.WHO WAS YOUR FAVOURITE ANIMAL TO FILM WITH Theyve got these Jersey cows who were just lovely. When youre working with these bigger animals, a whole new focus comes into it. Theres an atmosphere on set you have to be really calm. So it was nice to do those scenes.But also the little dog who plays Tricky Woo, which people will remember well from the series and the books, is a little Pomeranian... tail waggles in the air as he walks along, you cant see his legs and its kind of like he glides. But the dog actor is actually called Derek. You would never expect this fancy little thing to be called Derek!He was a consummate professional and his character journey over the series is very strong. Hes going to be a star.WERE YOU BROUGHT UP AROUND ANIMALS I was raised in the north of Scotland, in a little town. It was my back garden, then a fence and then a field the field always had cows and sheep in it.When we were really small, there was one cow who we named Friendly because the farmer would lt us onto her back and let us ride on this cow for theof the garden and take us off again.THIS SERIES SHOWS THE IMPORTANCE OF BELONGING TO A COMMUNITY. IT FEELS VERY TIMELY...Its certainly that thing about helping your neighbour, and community, and coming together... [after schools shut because of COVID-] I remember a teacher going out with his backpack on full of school meals and he was doing kilometres a day to get meals to the kids. Brilliant stuff.I think it [All Creatures Great and Small] is simpler times and something many people yearn for, especially now, when times are a bit more complex. It will be a lovely bit of escapism.ARE YOU READY FOR THE FAME THAT WILL COME WITH THIS ROLE Honestly, I have no idea. In drama school, theres no class on people noticing you in the street.

All have a strong hold over the upbeat, poppy tracks that in dferent circumstances would have been certied dancefloor classics.Certainly Perry doesnt shy away from being honest, with lyrics such as \"Ill cry about it later, tonight Im having fun\", and \"Just keep on dancing with those teary eyes\", flowing over disco beats and electronic sounds.But theres a triumphant edge to the album, and Perry brings her lighthearted trademark sound to the proceedings, \"Im faithful, baby\" is an uplting lyric that will compel you to sing along at the top of your voice, and \"Ill regrow right through the cracks\" is the audio equivalent of a joyful plateau after rising out of a depressive episode.While Smile isnt % cohesive as an album, its a collection of singles that were made to be sure-fire number ones, andthey cant pack a dance floor thanks to social distancing, theyll have you singing along, revelling in their powerful message.Sophie GoodallPVRIS - USE MEUse Me is the album that sees PVRIS step out of the shadows while retaining the darkness that has always surrounded them.\"Wide awake, just cut the head off of a snake\", Lynn Gunn sings on opener Gimme A Minute, to dramatic synth chords and urgent bass.The Lowell, Massachusetts band have come a long way from their metalcore beginnings, with their third full album completing the journey into stadium electropop.Thats not the only change, as Gunn this year found the confidence to step out as the sole creative force behind PVRIS - pronounced Paris, the original name before being changed for legal reasons.Drummer Justin Nace left in January, with guitarist Alex Babinski and bassist Brian Macdonald fading into the background on videos, artwork and merch.Use Me is delayed from May and while its release at the end of summer fits the goth elements, PVRIS missed out on a summer of touring and festivals that would have surely lted them to the next level.The tour is delayed to spring but the charismatic Gunn is a star in waiting and there is no reason why PVRIS should not be huge after this supremely confident album.They embrace pop fully on Stay Gold, Hallucinations and Wish You Well, while the title track has an alternate version featuring rising New Jersey rapper  Shake, hinting at future new directions.The shadows remain, and on Good To Be Alive Gunn sings \"feels good to be alive, but I hate my le\", while other tracks are called Death Of Me, Old Wounds and Loveless, an acoustic ballad, but they never sound miserable, saved by panache and some jet-propelled choruses. may have been a washout for live music, but thanks to Use Me, well always have PVRIS.Matthew GeorgeGIANT ROOKS - ROOKERYGermanys Giant Rooks offer more than just an intriguing name on their debut album, which melds classic indie with modern soul flavours.Album opener The Birth Of Worlds, a shock of cascading drum rolls and cinematic synths, suggests a more experimental album than ever materialises.But it is a fine showcase for frontman Frederik Rabes throaty voice, which takes centre-stage throughout Rookerys  songs and holds up some of the weaker cuts.Rabes swaggering, half-sung delivery hints towards a confidence that never quite shows up in the songwriting.Subsequent songs like Watershed and Wild Stare stray towards the derivative, drawing from the sanitised RB of Jungle and the quirky aesthetics of Alt-J.This formula works better when Giant Rooks go full pelt like on Heat Up, which features a taut disco beat.There are plenty of lyrics - some nonsensical - about hip-swinging clubs and souls being set on fire by love.Into Your Arms unexpectedly transforms into an auto-tuned slow jam and, oddly, works.You have to admire their bravery.It is a promising debut that would have helped Giant Rooks storm festival stages worldwide in pre-Covid times.Alex GreenMETALLICA -

But isnt this a non sequitur, especially in light of the SNP administrations latest economic figures The Readers Digest version of the numbers shows that, in the last fiscal year so before the pandemic, Scotlands deficit soared to . per centwith Scotland generating pound less per person than the UK average in taxation while public spending was pound, per person higher in Scotland, as a consequence of the generosity of the UKs Barnett Formula.Ms Sturgeon may be considered by some to be telegenic yet she has made many of the same errors as Downing Street in handling the pandemic.

It is in effect tribalism and an appeal to the worst instincts in humans.None of this is helped by the rampant narcissism and rabble-rousing displayed by the SNPrsquos leaders, past and present.At UK level, we have Boris Johnson, and in the US, Donald Trump, both at times approach the buffoon level. Both are lacking the intellect and political skill to govern wisely.I fear for my children and grandchildren in this \"brave new worldrsquo.rsquoAlexander McKay, Edinburgh EH.IT IS WRONG THAT SALMOND IS STILL ON TRIALIAIN Macwhirter suggests that while Alex Salmond has been found not guilty by a jury of his peers, he remains on trial . Of course he is. The story of a colleague suggesting that Nye Bevan was ldquohis own worst enemy, being met with the comment by Ernest Bevin, ldquonot while Irsquom around he ainrsquot is instructive in thatwe substitute Salmond for Bevan and much of the Scottish media for Bevin, the situation is much the same.Mr Salmond enjoys a fantastic degree of loyalty from his supporters, much to the astonishment of his opponents, some within the SNP. But the not guilty verdict has been greeted in some circles with ldquohe got away with it. This is most ably demonstrated by the last words in Kirsty Warkrsquos recent ldquodocumentary on the trial going to one of the women whose case did not convince the jury of Mr Salmondrsquos guilt.Moreover, bear in mind the Moorov doctrine, which says ldquo that the evidence of one witness can corroborate the evidence of another in certain situationsthe Crown can prove that the accuseds offending was part of a course of conduct, systematically pursued. This can address dficulties of proving rape or other sexual offences, where there is no corroborating evidence, by showing a pattern of behaviour over a period of time. However, while there were  charges for the jury to consider, with certain features in common ndash the involvement of alcohol, being alone with Mr Salmond ndash the jury chose not to convict. Therefore, is the conclusion not that the jury were unconvinced by the womenrsquos versions of events not just inidually but collectively as well Mr Macwhirter concludes ldquothat you are guilty even when you are found innocent. Early in her ldquodocumentary Ms Wark speaks of the ldquowomenrsquos stories, but without convincing evidence that is what they remain ndash stories. The Carl Beech case, though I am not associating any of Mr Salmondrsquos accusers with him, is a prescient warning of where justice being based on ldquostories without convincing evidence can lead. We cannot have a legal system that accepts something is true just because the accuser says it is.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.SONGS THAT SHOULD BE CHERISHEDWHAT a pointless brouhaha created by the BBC so unnecessarily over those two rousing tunes which bring such a resounding climax to the Proms.If ever we needed the feelgood factor in our lives, it is today, in the midst of a pandemic and the gloomy prospect of economic woe.What better way to raise the spirits of any community than with powerful community singing which comes across even from our TV screens as energising, defiant and uplting Those tunes provide a marvellous send-off to the traditional finale of the last night of the revered Proms.Yes, Britain did have an empire, which like any endeavour contained elements both good and the bad.Maybe we should recall those words of a well-known holy man, \"let he who is without sin cast the first stone\".Again while the lyrics of the songs were written in a dferent era with a dferent outlook ,they take on a fresh new meaning, outside of nostalgiafor every new generation.No one can quarrel surely with the sentiment that Britons shall never be slaves when that applies to all our compatriots regardless of their origins, colour or creed.Let the BBC reinstate the choral singing of those tunes which it has downgraded out of a weird and faux concern over political correctness.There are some traditions we should always cherish and this is one of them.Denis Bruce, Bishopbriggs.DEPORTATION IS THE ANSWERDOUGLAS Robinsonchooses to reduce the important topic of illegal immigration to that of a pub discussion.He is obviously a Europhile. Mr Robinson misses the whole point about UK sanctions on France, since the Yellow Vests would riot on the streets demanding Emmanuel Macron stopped the migrant flow to the UK. Britain can get food from where delivered to our door.More than , asylum seekers, paying large sums of money, have illegally entered the UK this year. Following the death of -year-old Sudanese migrant Abdulfatah Hamdallah on a beach in France, the usual suspects have been rushing to blame Britain. After leaving Sudan he and his friend Gamr Alsha were in Italy and France, so under EU \"safe haven\" rules they should have claimed asylum there and Abdulfatah would not have died.

This was Brown Young, Shaw McCall, Woodburn and Cox. There were no substitutes then and no thought of squad rotation. When one of the five outfield defenders was injured, Willie Rae came in at left half and the others were moved around as necessary. Young could play at full back or centre half and Cox could play anywhere. So for other defenders at the club, the Iron Curtain meant they could not get a game.

Carrying in a tray of tea first thing in the morning, itrsquos very odd finding tousled, sleepy-eyed friends in their pyjamas, propped in our regular place. For the duration of these visits, we relocate across the landing, to the spare room. Its bed is not what yoursquod call generous. Itrsquos fineyou are alone, orboth of you have been on a diet, but less so in any other circumstances. It does, however, have the advantage of being above the kitchen, and thus the second warmest place in the house. For that reason itrsquos also my study.Back in April, as we used an old tin of Farrow  Ball found in the loft, and discovered too late that there was only enough to cover a single wall, we were uncertainAustrian friends due to visit in July would still be able to make it. While Alan slapped glossy woodwork paint onto the ceiling, wondering why it was so hard to work in, we discussed the advantages of cast iron bedsteads over wooden, Scandi sleekness over shabby chic. Gradually, though, the need to make a decision receded. As the weeks ticked past and Europe turned into a giant hairbrush, covered in spikes, all such international trips have been cancelled or pushed back a year.Even in the best of times, when it comes to hospitality we are more roadside burger van than country inn. Where we previously lived, we did occasionally have friends and family to stay, but it was not what yoursquod call a revolving door. More of a portcullis. It was noticeable, though, that after we moved to the Borders, footfall increased.What does Hoolet have that East Lothian or Glasgow doesnrsquot, you might ask  Itrsquos a question to which others, clearly, also wanted an answer. In my seven-year-old step-granddaughterrsquos experience, the big dference is a roaring fire, and the witchy shadows of moving trees on her bedroom wall during the night which, she told us next morning, ldquoliterally petried me.Peter Maylersquos A Year in Provence was the first and funniest of a genre that offers a humorously enticing glimpse of moving to another country, and meeting head-on the challenges of local lingo and customs while undergoing house restoration. One of the late Maylersquos charms ndash assuming you were not a neighbour ndash was his candour. He describes near strangers inviting themselves for a holiday, entirely oblivious or resistant to every excuse given to dissuade them. In that initial year he and his we learned their mistake: ldquoHalf-forgotten invitations, made in the distant safety of winter, were coming home to roost and drink and sunbathe. The girl in the laundry assumed from our sheet count that we were in the hotel business...At one particularly low point, with a boorish London advertiser in residence, they sat by the pool and ldquowondered why we both found it so dficult to get rid of thick-skinned and ungracious people. They realised then that in future theyrsquod require more than ldquofirmness and ingenuity. What they needed was an answering machine.The lucrative and entertaining well that Mayle dug is still gushing. Quite apart from the ever-popular Frances Mayesrsquos books, which turned the word Tuscany into a synonym for bourgeois, there have been quieter, better books. One such is A Season in Spain, by Andrew and Lesley Grant-Adamson. Taking on a fruit farm in Andalusia for two years, they lived among peasant farmers whose families have worked the land for centuries. Despite the excellence of local food and wine, they learned how tough and precarious subsistence living can be in a region that goes from scorching heat to freezing, from drought to deluge.They too had unwanted guests: ldquoQuiet. Remote. The essence of tranquillity  Not quite. We ed from our first foray to find a young English family stripping one of our few ripe orange trees. The man was wearing a cheeky grin and a hat that put us in mind of Eddie Grundy of The Archers. He and his we carried off sackfuls of oranges, using the Grant-Adamsonrsquos wheelbarrow to transport them to their mule. Meanwhile their children were stripping the mandarin trees.Fashion in travel writing has since turned the compass towards Scandinavia, Latin America, Japan, but the principle of all these books remains the same: hapless, starry-eyed foreigners stumble into a beautul and rural part of the world, and either makes a success of settling, or eventually, after discovering a worm in the apple, acknowledge defeat and retreat.The danger in any such enterprise, of course, is not poisonous reptiles or a poor grasp of grammar, but that writers have a tendency to hyperbolise. An ordinary day, in their hands, becomes the stuff of adventure, romance or glamour. Mayle was a former advertising copy writer, so could sell turnips as truffles. Not that he had to try very hard. Since Provence offers months of sunshine, sumptuous local cuisine and wine, and rolling fields of lavender, itrsquos no surprise that visitors flocked to his doorstep. His books became such a success that the whole region, previously an idyllic backwater, was flooded with tourists. So too Mayesrsquos Tuscany.Writing about the Borders carries no such risk, unless yoursquore keen to test out equipment for a trip to the North Pole. We once encountered a man who had a weekend place in the nearby hills. It was a beautul old house that he was slowly renovating, whenever time allowed, but we got the impression his guests hadnrsquot bargained on it still being under hammer and drill when they arrived. ldquoFor some reason they prefer to camp out in the field, he told us, waving to the rugged fields in which the house sat. They must have been robust. Even indoors the draughts whistled.And yet there is something about living here that makes the hardened hermits happy to make up beds and stock the fridge.

But for thousands of people in our communities, the pandemic has exacerbated an already impossible situation ndash how to provide a roof over their heads, have enough money to feed their children or have someone to turn to for help with mental health or addiction issues.As we begin to emerge from lockdown, the charity sector now faces a situation which is also unprecedented .

Suddenly % doesnt seem so ruinous now that the UK deficit is heading to % and Britains debt pile is over pound trillion. Rishi Sunak has borrowed nearly ten times the Scottish budget in six months. Curiously, the roof hasnt fallen in.The whole debate over debt has radically altered as even Conservatives have abandoned the discredited logic of austerity. The ldquocost of a budget deficit, crucially, depends on interest rates. As the UK government and the Bank of England keep telling us, interest rates are currently so low that financiers and banks are actually paying the governmentto take their money.Suddenly, independence doesnt seem such an expensive luxury. There are many issues and problems associated with independence since Brexit, but GERS isnt one of them. The figures are anyway largely discredited. Whatever GERS measures it isnt economic viability.Scotland has labour productivity and employment levels comparable to England with a highly educated workforce, world class universities and a developed financial sector. It also has prodigious natural resources, both hydrocarbon and renewable, plus high-value food and drinks brands. Few countries would be a safer bet for foreign investors.However, there is no disguising that independence would entail readjustment, hard choices, even a degree of sacrice in the interest of reconstructing the underdeveloped Scottish economy. Just like Brexit in fact. No pain, no gain. GERS is,anything, an index of dependency: a measure of how Scotland has lost out being a backwater of the UK, not a country with the economic powers ndash tax, borrowing, debt ndash required to run a national economy.But even then, as the tax expert Professor Richard Murphy has pointed out, it is absurd to claim, as GERS has in recent years, that Scotland with % of the UK population accounts for nearly % of the entire UK deficit. This just doesnt make sense. GERS crudely measures the taxes raised narrowly in Scotland and assigns a great heap of spending from all over the UK ndash like defence ndash onto the spending numbers. It is an arbitrary carve up, which can be challenged under international accounting conventions. But lets not bother with all that, because GERS is irrelevant for a much more important reason: pandemic economics.The catastrophe that is coronavirus has demonstrated how malleable and transitory debt and deficit figures really are. GERS is based on the discredited Thatcherite logic of the household budget. ldquoSpending what you can afford...balancing the budget...never a lender nor a borrower be. These are out-dated fiscal homilies, which have no bearing on how economies actually work, which is through issuing debt.You dont have to be a devotee of Modern Monetary Theoryto see that balanced budgets are a recipe not for economic strength and productivity, but often for economic stagnation and decline. John Maynard Keynes told us that much  years ago.Now even Boris Johnson has made debt the centrepiece of UK financial policy, justying prodigious borrowing on the basis of historically low interest rates. This is as near as we get to free money. The UK government can issue -year bonds locking in these evanescent interest rates, even making money out of being in debt. Central banks are now talking about negative interest rates.Of course, there are limits to this. If a government really did spend like there was no tomorrow, andthis spending did not generate economic activity, there would be inflation ndash possibly hyper-inflation as in Zimbabwe. But for an advanced economy, under current world conditions, this is a remote risk.So, evenScotland had this % independence deficit, ex-Covid. The answer has to be: so what  Countries are coping with much larger deficits. This is not Scottish exceptionalism or romantic nationalism. There is every reason to suppose that Scotland would perform better as an independent country than as a remote region of the UK. Look at small countries across Europe, from Slovakia to Norway, in and out of the EU. The idea that Scotland is uniquely cursed is not just offensive, it is economically illiterate.Debt is a bogus bogey man, always has been. But Covid has finally made this clear to everyone who looks at the national accounts. How could Boris Johnson be borrowing to invest when the UK deficit is heading into orbit and UK debt has just topped pound trillion  The European Union was the last redoubt of austerity economics, which was used brutally to impoverish Greece. But even Brussels has abandoned the Maastricht Stability Pact limiting debt to % of GDP.Actually, there is one final, final redoubt of austerity economics: the Scottish Labour Party. Having recently supported a leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who proposed the greatest borrowing and debt in economic history, it obediently applauds the scary logic of GERS every year ndash but only for Scottish viewers. If Labour wanted to make itself relevant again it would recognise that, in the real world, debt problems would largely vanish in the course of reconfiguring the UK after Scottish independence.Labour could seize the political moment by calling for a new union of equality. As this column has argued, the first act of an independent Scottish government would be to strike a new union with the rest of the UK to ensure economic continuity, free movement, common trading standards. Scotland is too wise to opt for autarky. In the process notional debts and deficits would be diminished as politics took over.The UK will want to be on good terms with an independent Scotland, not least because of the disruption that will follow Brexit. When Ireland became independent its nominal debt of % of GDP was negotiated away. Similarly, in Scotland there would be debt trade offs ndash such as leasing Faslane for  years, or as a quid pro quo for accepting most rUK trading deals with other countries. Debt is malleable because it is essentially political.The real lesson of GERS has always been this: there is no obvious way that Scotland can reverse its historic decline while remaining in the United Kingdom as it currently exists. This dependency culture can only get worse. Like unemployment benefit, Barnett bungs are no alternative to self-sustaining employment, to economic regeneration.GERS cheerleaders havent realised that the window of opportunity here is relatively narrow. Ideally, Scotland needs to become independent while interest rates remain at historically low levels to smooth the path to autonomy. Perhaps GERS should really stand for: get out while the going is good.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

It has been an unmitigated failure, and Holyrood is an appalling waste of public money that has failed in every area of its limited responsibility. Along the way it has legitimised an agenda of hate and politicised everything in public le, including local government, to the detriment of us all. Enough already. Game over.John Dunlop, Ayr.TO accept Peter Russellrsquos argument that the Vow was deliveredrequires a lack of awareness of the reality of the UKrsquos constitution, and in particular that the House of Commons is sovereign, possessing supreme or ultimate power. For instance, there is nothing to prevent the repeal of the Sections of the  Scotland Act which Mr Russell puts his faith in. Similarly, the Barnett Formula could be brought to an end by a vote in the House of Commons, and with  of  MPs at Westminster, there is little we could do about it.Ah, but they wouldnrsquot do this, comes the reply. They are bound by the Vow. But with UK indebtedness at something like pound trillion the temptation to cut spending in this way must be great for a Conservative Government with little support here already.With regard to ldquoextensive powers devolved, letrsquos suppose the powers were ldquoextensive as Mr Russell asserts. However, we already know Westminsterrsquos intentions with regard to the ldquoSingle British Market will mean Scottish food regulations can be undermined by the requirement of ldquomutual recognition. In any event, it would always be open to Westminster to legislate to amend regulations passed at Holyrood. As Enoch Powell said, ldquopower devolved is power retained, because it can always be taken back again.Thus to consider the Vow without consideration of the context within which it will operate, is, to put it at its best, limited. His reticence to do this is though easily understood.Lastly, Mr Russell disapproves of others ldquotelling lies, but the fact is his claimed Commission opinion about Scotlandrsquos membership position never existed, as this would only have been forthcoming to the political head of state of a member country. It might be interesting to learn why David Cameron never did get round to asking that question. Thus, Mr Russellrsquos claim that, had Scotland voted Yes, we would have left the EU on independence, is based on no more than the opinion of inidual Commissioners writing in a personal capacity.While Mr Russell may, as I do, deprecate anyone telling lies, his letter reveals a careful selection of the truth.Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.CATRIONA Stewart thinks Douglas Ross ldquois right, we need to learn to disagree.

Forces are gathering to launch a Fox News-style TV channel to undermine the broadcaster, and cash in on lost public faith.One rival is GB News. Itrsquos gunning for what it describes as an ldquoout of touch BBC, and already has a licence to broadcast. GB News co-founder Andrew Cole kicked sand in the BBCrsquos face calling it ldquopossibly the most biased propaganda machine in the world. There might be an announcement come September. Itrsquos understood GB News has been in talks with Andrew Neil.Rupert Murdoch ndash Fox News owner ndash is also circling the BBC. Hersquos long wanted to wound his arch rival, and looks close to aiming a crippling blow. A second rival project to the BBC is being cooked up by Murdochrsquos News UK, spearheaded by David Rhodes, former Fox News executive.Most likely, any rival to BBC TV journalism from the right will set its sights on being comment-driven in a bid to get around UK rules on news broadcasting impartiality. TalkRadio, which is also owned by Murdoch, already operates by that standard. Itrsquos effectively a licence to propagandise, with highly partisan and provocative presenters thriving in a culture wars battleground. LBC, the countryrsquos other major talk radio network, operates to pretty much the same standards. It made Nigel Farage a presenter. Farage no longer hosts but itrsquos an open secret hersquod love another big media  to further his agenda. Therersquos speculation about his involvement in one of the rival ventures.These rival plans to the BBC prove some unpleasant truths about the broadcaster. The BBC is much less clever than it thinks, for starters ndash as the corporation created the very monster which is now attempting to eat it alive.The BBC, for years now, has pursued a clickbait agenda. Once you get beyond its traditional reporting slots ndash like the Six OrsquoClock News ndash its current affairs programming is cheap and sensationalist. Question Time being the number one offender.Think of the characters shows like Question Time created and pushed into the public consciousness. It gave Nick Grfin, the former leader of the BNP, a  it became like a rolling bandwagon for Nigel Farage it put Katie Hopkins on stage. The BBC fed the right-wing beast ndash and now the forces of the right are coming for it.The BBC also turned Andrew Neil from a partisan newspaper man into a national broadcaster. Neilrsquos background is evidently right-wing ndash and therersquos nothing wrong with that it might not be my political slant on le, but in newspapers itrsquos standard operating procedure to take a political position and fight for it. Thatrsquos what a free press is meant to do. The BBC, however, must be impartial.A savvy operator like Neil is perfectly capable of keeping any bias in check on air, but letrsquos be clear: the BBC built him into a powerful figure in British television ndash now it seems hersquos coming for them as a rival.The BBC also created the atmosphere in which these rival bids are thriving. Itrsquos pandered to a culture wars agenda ndash not just promoting the likes of Katie Hopkins, but elevating every Twitter storm into a national debate.As the old saying goes ndashyou sow the wind, you reap the whirlwind. The BBC is so clodhopping it even stokes culture wars against itself. The recent row over the singing of Rule Britannia during the BBC Proms was confected nonsense but the broadcaster worked to ramp up the storm in discussion segments.Herein lies the key flaw with the BBC ndash it should stick to reporting the news, not commenting on the news. Itrsquos the BBCrsquos job to tell the nation, impartially and intelligently, whatrsquos going on nationally and internationally through its publicly funded journalism. Itrsquos not the BBCrsquos job to get clicks online and stir up social media rows.Leave the commenting to newspapers. The British press is historically a rambunctious free-for-all ndash in print, the news should be reported with accuracy and balance, but in terms of comment you can fight your political corner as vehemently as you wish, within the limits of libel laws and decency. In contrast, broadcasting rules are very clear on standards of impartiality. And that makes sense ndash a newspaper isnrsquot piped into your home. You chose to read a particular paper. In Britain, you donrsquot chose the BBC ndash itrsquos a fact of le, like death and taxes hellip at least, until the Tories use the licence fee to finish it off.We got a hint that even the BBC sees the writing on the wall with reports that the new director-general, Tim Davie, is apparently lsquoopenrsquo to the broadcaster implementing some Netflix-style subscription model, in the wake of a damaging poll showing ebbing public faith.As an aside, I should point out that while the BBC has pandered to a right-wing agenda, thatrsquos now coming for it, itrsquos also pandered to the so-called lsquowoke leftrsquo, whose activists equally hate it. The BBC tried to play both sides against the middle and failed miserably.A word of advice for the BBC. Forget about social media ndash itrsquos drugged you and your journalists and you can no longer see the wood for the trees when it comes to reporting. Get your staff off Twitter ndash itrsquos not a good look when it comes to impartiality. Stick to reporting the news, not trying to whip up storms through comment on the news.The problem is, itrsquos too late to change the BBC. And that spells trouble for British democracy. The incorporation of Fox News-style TV to Britain will make our current culture wars look like a playground tf. Wersquoll further ide, truth will become ever more remote. Look to America ndash thatrsquos a land we donrsquot want to venture towards as a society.

It comes after research found that during lockdown those living in more deprived areas had less access to gardens and green spaces.It is estimated that one in eight households has no garden, making access to parks more important.WWF Scotland said this figure is concerning as multiple studies have shown the benefits of nature to physical and mental wellbeing.The conservation charity says their findings add more weight to a fresh post-Covid campaign to ldquotransformative actions that will help Scotlandrsquos nature and ldquobuild a fairer future for all.Launched by a host of environmental charities including RSPB Scotland, Scottish Wildle Trust and WWF Scotland, it highlights five areas for immediate action from the Scottish Government: restoring and protecting Scotlandrsquos globally important peatlands replacing and expanding native forests improving deer management creating a new system to support eco-friendly farming and linking up wild places through a new Scottish Nature Network.Other proposals include introducing new legislation to ensure all new development is net-positive for nature establishing a Scottish inspectorate to tackle invasive non-native species and committing to at least a third of Scotlandrsquos seas being highly protected.Lang Banks, director at WWF Scotland said: ldquoThese findings make it clear that nature is a boost to peoplersquos wellbeing and that the majority of people in Scotland really valued having the opportunity to get out into nature during lockdown.\"Sadly, we know that not everyone has access to greenspace, with people living in the most deprived areas less able to enjoy nature close to home. Itrsquos in all our interests that everyone is afforded the chance to enjoy easy access to greenspaces and more nature.ldquoThatrsquos why our recent Nature Recovery Plan, calls for a change to planning policy, ensuring that new developments enhance and make space for nature and that habitats across Scotland are better managed and better connected. We need the places we live and work to support our collective well-being where people and nature can thrive.With the current climate and bioersity crises affecting species, habitats and landscapes here in Scotland and around the globe, the survey also found people in Scotland showed great concern for our natural world.Almost three-quarters of those askedsaid the Scottish Government should take decisive action to tackle the nature and climate emergencies on a similar scale taken to tackle the COVID- crisis.A recent study by researchers at the University of Exeter found that spending time in the garden is linked to similar benefits for health and wellbeing as living in wealthy areas.People with access to a private garden also had higher psychological wellbeing, and those with an outdoor space such as a yard were more likely to meet physical activity guidelines than those without access to outdoor space.Britainrsquos parks and fields are also at signicant risk of development, according to new research by the Fields in Trust charity.It estimated that . million people currently lived more than a -minute walk away from a public park, and this figure could increase by a further , in the next five years.The study, which coincides with Field in Trusts annual green space index, suggests that the equivalent of , football pitches worth of green space could be lost in the next  years due to population growth.Earlier research from Fields in Trust suggested that the wellbeing value associated with the frequent use of green spaces is worth more than pound billion each year to the UK.A Scottish Government spokesman said: \"Scotland is an environmental leader and the importance of green space is recognised in our policies from health to regeneration, early years to planning. Such spaces are important for peoplersquos health and our towns and cities boast a wealth of them.

Bismarckrsquos distinction should really be seen as being between ideas, however bizarre, that are realisable, and those that are merely idealistic.Charles Fourier, one of the godfathers of libertarian socialism, thought that the oceans would turn into lemonade when the workersrsquo paradise was achieved, which seems unlikely. But he was just as thoroughly mocked for some of his other wacky notions, which included feminism , redistribution of wealth, homosexual equality and the foundation of a Jewish state in Palestine.Politics may not be able to contravene the laws of nature, which includes human nature. Attempts to produce ldquosystems so perfect that no one will need to be goodmay be doomed by humanityrsquos instincts towards free association, self-interest, collective action, the desire to trade, to challenge authority or any of dozens of other impulses.But when it comes to redrawing longstanding borders, or throwing out regimes, or even fundamental forms of government, that have seemed invincible, history has no shortage of examples. Indeed, what most of us think of as history is a list of such events: the fall of Rome, the Reformation, the French Revolution, universal suffrage and countless other seismic changes that were thought unthinkable by many, until they happened.In Malcolm Bradburyrsquos novel The History Man, when someone objects to a Marxist studentrsquos assertion that ldquoall forms of knowledge are ideological. That means they are politics, another student asks: ldquoWho is this crazy doll  She says we donrsquot need a revolution.Howard Kirk, the bookrsquos radical protagonist, replies: ldquoThere are people who think like thathellipthere werenrsquot, we wouldnrsquot need a revolution. The historical fact of revolutions is proof that that what once seemed unthinkable is perfectly possible politically. The same is true of counter-revolutions: the historian Richard Cockettrsquos account of the academics and think-tanks that challenged the economic and political assumptions of the post-war period was entitled Thinking the Unthinkable.Yet those ideas about markets and globalisation have been dominant for decades, as was the Clause IV-era of socialism that preceded them .Clearly, these positions are all in the realms of the possible. The error ndash whatever the claims of Marxian historicists, or those who believe in the necessary triumph of liberal democracy , or assert that technology, or laisser-faire economics, can fix anything ndash is to think them inevitable.Despite that, there is a growing tendency among those actively committed to certain kinds of politics ndash notably the Left, though it is apparent on all points of the compass ndash to consider any contrary view unthinkable:not strictly speaking impossible, somehow impermissible.They mostly donrsquot seem to think that because of pseudoscientic Marxist economics or post-Hegelian historical determinism, but because they are incapable of seeing why anyone  might not share their views. Much of the current atmosphere of what passes for political discourse is not about disagreements, however vehement, about basic principles, or even the traditional,sometimes irrational, tribal loyalty of political parties .Instead, justication is by faith alone, and evidence can be cheerfully disregarded when it collides with doctrine. Whatrsquos more, its claims are to be advanced by constant searches for heresy: those who donrsquot share the grouprsquos opinions are not just wrong, but wicked. They canrsquot just be mistaken they have to be thick, or misled by deceitful conspiracies, or fascist.All sorts of people, some of whom previously seemed fairly normal, now operate like this. Ardent Remainers, of course, who think anyone who voted for Brexit was thick, misled, selfish, too old for their views to count and, naturally, racist. But Leavers who now maintain anything except a WTO settlement is a betrayal look very nearly as unhinged.Corbynites, who collectively share the delusion that only a conspiracy of Tories masquerading as members of the Labour Party prevented St Jeremy from gaining a landslide win. Anyone who thinks that the Union, or independence, is a self-evident, easily settled or straightforward issue, even when presented with the knowledge that their side can be no more than a few percentage points ahead. Those convinced of the existence ndash nay, the desirability ndash of identity politics and coming race or culture wars, and who are deeply entrenched in their commitment to one side or the other.All of these groups seem to regard it as an affront, not only to their own opinions, but to the natural order of things, that they might not be on the winning side. But itrsquos not particularly useful to deny reality.Letrsquos take an example I suspect most of us will find uncontroversial. I donrsquot think Donald Trump is a good president. He has a record that ought to make it certain hersquoll lose: unemployment is over  per cent, the economyrsquos in trouble and hundreds of thousands of people have died. He keeps saying things that are demonstrably untrue. He gives plenty of evidence of being an unscrupulous and unsuitable candidate.But I still think Mr Trump might win, yet the reaction of most of his opponents to Joe Bidenrsquos relatively poor polling is to maintain that their man is still ahead, and to deny that Mr Trump can prevail. If he does, they will claim that he has cheated.I can readily believe that Mr Trump would cheat, but that attitude is missing the point. If they donrsquot understand that it is possible for others to disagree with them, theyrsquore not engaged in politics, but magical thinking.

This is only the beginning though.“The plan will evolve and respond to reflect the feedback and the needs of the sector. We are therefore calling for industry to review and contribute to the plan.” The recovery plan is available to view on the CLF website.Feedback can be submitted via the website on enquiries@constructionforum.scot by September .CLF will take all feedback on board to help develop the plan further, with regular updates published on the CLF site.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The infrastructure proposals have been designed to enable Orkney to manage a transition away from fossil fuels, while continuing to generate social and economic benefit from ongoing oil and gas activity.The proposals will have #transformational# impact on Orkney#s economy and society. As well as creating as many  new jobs, there will also be a substantial number of job opportunities during the construction phase.OIC leader James Stockan said: “Our vision is to build a truly sustainable business that is a core economic asset for Orkney, but also a first phase in enabling a scale of investment and logistical capability for the UK, which will be of international signicance.“Prime Minister Boris Johnson clearly welcomed our ambition and Orkney’s potential during his recent visit to our islands, describing as a ‘fantastic idea’ our vision for Orkney as a low-carbon, zero-emissions hub of innovation, with Scapa Flow at its heart.“We believe the time is right to maximise the incredible natural assets and geography of Scapa Flow and Orkney, to ensure a long-term sustainable future for our communities. We are open for business now, and ready to work with potential investors and operators to develop the signicant strategic and international opportunities Scapa Flow offers.“The Scapa Deep Water Quay proposal has been included in the Islands Deal list of projects that has received funding commitment from the Scottish and UK governments, and we are continuing to ensure that the funding earmarked for this will be secured.”Central to the project is the unique geographical advantage of Scapa Flow, described by the council as the largest natural deep-water harbour in the northern hemisphere, as the potential setting for internationally signicant marine logistics to serve the new and emerging sectors, including low-carbon fuel transition and offshore wind developments.Scapa Deep Water Quay is seen as the optimal location for construction and operations and maintenance activities, associated with offshore wind, as well as for a liquefied natural gasstorage and distribution hub. At the same time, this infrastructure has the capability to accommodate semi-submersible s of all types, giving Orkney a unique UK competitive edge within the existing oil and gas market.The project team believes it could be delivered by . Other proposals, such as Hatston and Kirkwall, could take three or four years to deliver.Phase two will ultimately develop the islands’ smaller harbours and piers across the islands.Harbour users and key stakeholders were consulted from the outset, to help gain an understanding of the issues, constraints and opportunities associated with harbour infrastructure around Orkney, through workshops and interviews. The range of stakeholders includes local communities, harbour users, potential funders and environmental bodies such as Scottish Natural Heritage.Harbourmaster James Buck added: “Tackling decarbonisation is the strand that binds these proposals together, providing infrastructure and knowledge for renewable energy developments around our waters will allow us to reach climate change targets. “We will also look at the potential for net environmental gain through habitat reinstatement and enhancement.”According to the OIC, Orkney Harbours is one of the most erse and successful council-run port authorities in the UK, with an annual turnover of £ million and nearly , annual vessel movements.The council added that the exact timing of construction for each of the phase one masterplan proposals is not yet known.This will be determined over the next six to  months, and will depend on a range of factors including market requirements, funding and environmental considerations.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/image.jpg","title":"royal celtic societys unique music","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineWork has begun on processing the twenty entries received for a unique competition which set the country’s musicians the challenge of creating a new shinty composition.

This report is confirmation of how big a con by republicas that ‘decommissioning’ was.”However, all the weaponry controlled by the IRA was confirmed to have been decommissioned in  when the senior IRA figure liaising with the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning gave an assurance that the organisation’s entire arsenal was put beyond use.The decommissioning process was hailed by the British and Irish Governments, and praise was heaped on the committee headed by Canadian general John de Chastelain.West Belfast-based Catholic priest Fr Alex Reid and former Methodist president Rev Harold Good witnessed the decommissioning.In a statement afterwards, the two clergymen said: “We are satisfied that the arms decommissioning represents the totality of the IRA’s arsenal.”It is claimed that in the MI recordings of the dissident meetings New IRA leaders boast of having raised signicant funds abroad.A source with knowledge of the recordings said: “They boast about raising £m in America and Russia, the bulk of which came from America, but claim they can’t get access to the money.”It is also claimed that the New IRA leaders complain about the lack of respect they receive compared to former IRA leaders.A Glaswegian, Dennis McFadden, was last week named in court as an MI agent by lawyers representing those dissident republicans facing charges following the sting operation in Co Tyrone.Houses were bugged during Operation Arbacia, which has devastated the New IRA.

He also recalled being boozed up from an afternoon in the pub when he was handed the Northern Ireland job by Boris Johnson.The  track performed by German Eurodance group Snap! was an international success when released  years ago.It spent six weeks at the top of the UK singles chart, becoming the second biggest-selling single of , surpassed only by Whitney Houston#s version of I Will Always Love You.Mr Smith revealed his eclectic musical tastes yesterday during the in-depth BBC Radio Ulster Talkback interview with presenter William Crawley, which was intercut with songs specially chosen by the ex-SoS.The programme kicked off with Land of the Mountain and the Flood by Hamish Maccunn, a Scottish overture. Other choices, however, displayed Mr Smith#s love of pop music such as the Pet Shop Boys#  synth number one classic, It#s a Sin.He went on to reveal that listening to dance music has been something of a hallmark of his political career which he continued when he arrived in Northern Ireland.And the one I was listening to the most when I was going through the later end of the Stormont talks - when I was trying to persuade Arlene , when I was trying to call on votes with Michelle , when I was rushing down to Derry to see Colum , was Rhythm is a Dancer, he recalled.I would sit in the back of the truck with the protection people in the front and a special advisor fed up with the sight of me from the long days beside me, with this in my headphones.The MP said he would continue to help Northern Ireland any way he could, describing his  days in the role as a huge privilege.The -year-old said he was offered the role after he had spent the afternoon in the pub drinking far too many beers when he lost his job as Conservative chief whip, adding it was a huge honour to accept the role.It was a joy, it was demanding and it was relentless... I#m really committed long-term to do anything that#s needed to assist a part of the UK that has gone through the most horrendous time, he explained.Mr Smith, who recently enjoyed a holiday here, was replaced by Brandon Lewis in Prime Minister Boris Johnson#s cabinet reshuffle just five weeks after power-sharing was reinstated. He is regarded by the public as one of the most popular Secretaries of State in recent years. Going forward in Northern Ireland, he said he wanted less focus on the constitutional issue and more on the people here.I was really struck when we did the Stormont deal, people were literally coming up to me in the street and just thanking me for getting it back up and running. That was because, not that they didn#t have views on the constitution, but at the moment the focus needs to be on getting stuff done, whether it#s education, healthcare, whatever.Belfast Related ContentNews PremiumexclusiveJulian Smith: #I miss so many things about Northern Ireland... not least the Ulster fries and tray bakes# Northern Ireland is accustomed to Secretaries of State who can#t wait to catch the first plane home when their time is up and never set foot in the place again, butnot this one.Most ReadTerrorist who allowed Newry home to be used for IRA plotting dies suddenlyCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  new cases confirmedDUP MLA questions police Portstewart promenade closure to put brakes on #boy racers# Sinn Fein members met #MI spy# in loyalist heartlandIvan LittleOpinionTime for Sinn Fein to show Martina Anderson the door,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colleges smart new unorm includes a blazer and jumper piped in gold which can be worn with a skirt or trousers. School principal, Martine Mulhern, said the new look came about after pupils said they wanted to be able to decide which they wanted to wear. A lot of the girls prefer to wear a skirt, but they said other pupils should have the choicethey want to wear trousers, she said. The whole idea of respecting other peoples choices is very important. googletag.cmd.push Last year the school council surveyed the pupils who voted overwhelmingly in favour of introducing a trouser option. This led to a long process of designing the new unorm, with the pupils allowed their say in how it should look and feel. The conversation started with Hunters Apparel in Derry who gave us dferent designs and that solid groundwork allowed us to get to the place where we are today, said Mrs Mulhern. The girls were so mature and insightful throughout it all. They knew and understood that there were certain things we couldnt do, but it was so important they felt comfortable. googletag.cmd.push There were a few prototypes before we got to the finished designs, but everyone is delighted with them. They are all loving the new blazer because its very smart and really brightens things up, and a surprising number of them have decided to take the option of wearing trousers. StCecilias worked closely with local unorm suppliers Max Fashions and Select Kidz to keep the cost of the new unorm, which has been adopted by the new intake, down. There will be a gradual phasing out of the old unorm over the coming years. The girls are loving the new unorm and as a school community we are so proud of them for taking the lead, added Mrs Mulhern. The children always come first and we have to listen to them. It was the right thing to do.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Micky Doherty was presented with the Foyle Pride Mark Ashton Award for Outstanding Contribution to the LGBTQ+ community by the citys real Mayor, SDLP Councillor Brian Tierney, at a ceremony at the Holywell Trusts Garden of Remembrance on Saturday night. A spokesperson for Foyle Pride said Mr Doherty, who fronts the citys Pride parade each year, was a truly deserving winner who does so much, for not only the LGBTQ+ community, but also the wider city and district community. Mr Doherty is a tireless charity fundraiser and helped set up a special fund to help local people in need during the oronavirus crisis. googletag.cmd.push Im known in the local area as being a charity fundraiser-theres a charity fundraiser Ill host it, said Mr Doherty. Its just part of me that I like helping people. During lockdown I knew people had started to struggle and they were coming to me and I started to think about how I could help. Because I have been working with charities for a long time people put their trust in me. Mr Doherty was hosting a drive through bingo event last week when he got a phone call to say he had won the Foyle Pride award. I just burst out crying, he admitted. I really didnt expect it so I was just overwhelmed. googletag.cmd.push I just have so much gratitude for the award and for everyone who nominated me and I want to thank them all. Mr Doherty said he wished his late mum, Cathy, could have been there on Saturday to see him receive his award. Its hard to accept that my mammy couldnt be there, he said. Its just not the same without her but I am still filled with so much gratitude for it, he said. Derry LGBT+ campaigner, Suzanna Toland, who passed away earlier this year, was remembered at Saturdays ceremony. It was really nice to see Suzanna recognised for everything that she did, said Micky. She was a very special person.Before she passed away she had set up an LGBT+ disco at Rosie Joes so that people would have a safe place to socialise.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The guidance, announced this evening by Peter Weir, comes into effect from August . The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. googletag.cmd.push ”This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. “It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. “In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. googletag.cmd.push “In relationto communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible.  “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. “However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. “Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir added: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperaturea new, continuous cougha loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Another site, Vessel Finder, also states that it received the latest position of the boat at .pm on August . googletag.cmd.push FSR were tasked on Sunday last, following reports of a grounded vessel. Pat Carlin, of FSR, said the boat was likely to be there until mid-September when the tide would be high enough for it to re-float. “She’s stuck solid,” he added. “We went and assessed the boat, determined that the crew were safe and passed that information on to the police service,” Mr Carlin explained “We provided them with some basic supplies that they needed and basically the vessel is grounded and can’t be move until the tide is lted. “All relevant services were notied and are aware that it’s there.” googletag.cmd.push Mr Carlin continued: “I think they were up on the council pontoon and to the best of my knowledge they may have come from outside the area, I don’t know exactly. “They’ll have no choice but to wait, maybe with the sudden floods tonightthey’ll be lucky and might get re-floated otherwise they’ll have to wait until the tides are high enough.” The PSNI confirmed that police assisted partners, including FSR and Coastguard in liaising with the crew. A report from , shows that Day Dawn N  was bought for the purposes of fishing from Portavogie. It was said to be the first time the vessel had been based anywhere  apart from Kilkeel since her arrival in  from Banff where the wooden-hulled boat was built by John Watt  Sons as a trawler. Harbour master at Portavogie, Neil Warnock, yesterday said Day Dawn was based there but left a couple of months ago. “Somebody bought it for a pleasure craft,” he explained. “It’s not a fishing boat any more, the licence on it was sold off a while ago there. “The last I heard the boat was in Portrush, I saw a picture of it at Portrush harbour after it left here.” At Portrush, the assistant harbour master said the boat owner was only there for three days and he believed the man travelled from the Greencastle direction. He was trying to get himself a permanent mooring, he said, but wasn’t able to secure it. The owner left Portrush heading towards Derry where he tried to get a mooring in the town and ended up on the mud flats. “I just know that he bought that for pound. None of the fishermen like decommissioning so they basically would rather they go off. “So I think he bought it for a pound and wanted to change it into an Air B ‘n’ B, but we couldn’t offer him a permanent mooring in Portrush, so he was only here for three days,” the Assistant Harbour Master added. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for Foyle Port added: “Foyle Port is aware that a small trawler has run aground at Madams Bank in the River Foyle. “There is no environmental threat or impediment to other marine craft. “Once conditions are right we expect the vessel to become buoyant again.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Bark n Baths in the Springtown Industrial Estate has four dog washing stations equipped with a professional shower and dryer and specially formulated sham- poos and conditioners.  Co-owner Garaidh Tomas Grfiths said the idea came about after many dog owners had to start washing their own pets during lockdown. “All the dog groomers had to close but they were sharing videos online to show people how to wash and brush their dogs coat themselves, said Mr Grfiths. People had no choice but to do it for themselves, but they were bent over their bath and giving themselves a bad back. googletag.cmd.push Then they had to chase a wet dog around the house to try and dry them before they got that wet dog smell and after all that they had to spend another half an hour cleaning their bath so it could be used by the rest of the family again. Mr Grfiths, who also owns the Canine Lodge doggie day care, hit on the idea of opening a self service dog washing salon. “After lockdown people are looking to save as much money as possible and we are able to offer people the chance to wash their dog from as little as pound. googletag.cmd.push “Its great for people who have taken their dog to the beach or a country park and want to give them a quick wash and get rid of any sand or muck. Every station at Barks n Baths is set up with an industrial shower and dryer, highly absorbent towels, and PH balanced dog shampoo and conditioner and disposable aprons and gloves. A dogs PH level is dferent to a human so using the wrong product can affect their skin, coat and overall health, said Mr Grfiths If we can help someone maintain their dogs health we are happy to do it. A  minute session will cost pound and the price goes up from there to pound for  minutes, pound for  minutes and pound for an hour which would be long enough to wash and dry a big dog with long hair. There is also a private bay for dogs that may be anxious or anti-social. The private bay is partitioned off and has its own entrance so it is perfect for dogs that are nervous or aggressive around other dogs or people, added Mr Grfiths. We have had people come to us who have been told their dog isnt suitable to go to a groomer, so they are delighted this service is here. Bark n Baths is located at Site , Unit  in the Springtown Industrial Estate close to Cable  Accessories.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Derry man Stephen Whoriskey has loved Brooks’ music since she he was a teenager and often listens to it when he is having a tough time. The -year-old has struggled with anxiety, depression and insomnia on and off for nine years and the coronavirus lockdown brought his mental health problems to the fore again. In a bid to give him a distraction, his we Kimberly set him the challenge of learning to play the guitar and promised she would buy him the same model as the country music superstarhe succeeded. googletag.cmd.push Meanwhile, Stephen sent Garth a message on his live Facebook QA page sharing his battle with depression, asking how Brooks kept his spirits up during lockdown and telling him about his we’s guitar challenge. The Derry man burst into tears when Mr Brooks choose his question for a live video chat. “He said me and you have a lot in common, I deal with a lot of stuff too, said Stephen. “And he said he liked being dark for his music, but that the dference was he could switch it off. “I just broke down in tears. I ran up the stairs to my we but I couldn’t speak. googletag.cmd.push “She thought something bad had happened, but I just couldn’t get the words out.” Before signing off, Garth said he would send Stephen a guitar. Weeks had passed and there was no sign of the much-longed-for instrument, but out of the blue he got a call from UPS saying it was being held in customs as it might be made from illegal Brazilian rose wood. A frantic string of phone calls followed until a Garth Brooks impersonator from England, who had the same guitar, confirmed the rose wood was East Indian. Finally, Stephen’s guitar was delivered to his home in the Waterside and he hasn’t put it down since. “I still can’t really believe it, he said. “My two-year-old Aria was always slapping and twanging away at the strings on my old guitar, but she knows not to touch this one,” he laughed. “It shows how much Garth cares about his fans. “He always says his fans made him and they are like his family.” Stephen, who is a youth worker and a performer with ‘In Your Space’ circus said it’s important to him to be upfront about his mental health. “Lock down is so unprecedented, he said. “No one has ever been here before. “It has caused a lot of anxiety and depression. “Because I work with young people I think it’s important to show them it’s ok to talk about your feelings- particularly young men. “Younger and younger people are dealing with stuff like this. “I would say to anyone who is struggling to look for the small things to get you through. “But this, for me, was massive,” he added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In an article for last weeks Sunday Independent, former Derry player and GAA pundit Joe Brolly stated the Oakleaf board had borrowed a poundk Covid bounce-back loan and the county were currently poundk in debt. In the article, in which Brolly quoted former All-Ireland winning teammates Kieran McKeeverand Fergal P McCusker, who is part of Derrys Finance Committee, he said the board were having serious discussions about the feasibility of entering the senior team in the  championship. However, Derry GAA county board chairman Stephen Barker yesterday said: “The simple facts are: Derry GAA is on an extremely solid financial footing.” googletag.cmd.push Barker said that any talk of not entering a senior team in next years championship was completely farcical. “We are not in debt and any reports which suggest otherwise are completely ,” read a county board statement released yesterday. “Unfortunately, these baseless reports about our financial position are causing serious concern among our members and supporters.

Celtic Park is due to host three games in this weekends championship schedule and the senior hurling final is set for the city venue later this month. “At this time, % of that loan remains and the monies have already been set aside to complete that payment schedule within the next three months,” Devlin stated. As part of this seasons championship, the group games were played on a home, away and neutral basis, with a total of approximately poundk in gate receipts. Clubs were promised all the money from their home championship games. “We generated approximately poundk in gate receipts from the group stages and the county board has taken the decision to redistribute that money back to the clubs. “This should help to alleviate some of the financial pressure felt by our clubs due to the Covid- situation,” Barker points out. We are also planning ahead and have secured an additional facility of up to poundk,required, in line with our strategic plan.

Shortly before nine oclock to be precise. Peter Buzzers back bar in Maghera is sparsely populated. Apart from the commentary, as Gaeilge, from TGs GAA  programme humming out of the TV on the wall, you couldve heard a pin drop. Its a Monday club with a dference. There are no boom boxes, no empty take away pizza boxes strewn around the tables nor half drunk people roaring into your ear while making little or no sense. Less than  hours earlier, two decades of concerted Slaughtneil planning and effort morphed into a slick hunger Loughgiel simply couldnt deal with. By the tenth minute, the maroon and white hooped juggernaut had broken into the orbit of Ulster hurling. Nine points clear and  months after the hurt of an extra time defeat by Cushendall, there was no catching them. googletag.cmd.push In his victory speech, Chrissy McKaigue thanked every man, woman and dog involved in their success. Everyone except Thomas Cassidy, who had passed away days before. He waited until the inner sanctum of a packed Slaughtneil hall later that night, when back among their own. The Four Seasons Cup was clasped by one victorious outstretched fist. The index finger on his other hand gestured to the hall floor scarcely visible below the throngs of fans, where Thomas taught him how to play hurling all those years ago. There wasnt a dry eye in the house. Even the walls wouldve had goosebumps. googletag.cmd.push On the Monday night, his brothers Mark, Declan and Bungazed at Buzzers TV with a look and a body language that money couldnt buy. Slaughtneil were at the top of the tree. The new Ulster champions had many helping hands to shape them along the way. But the Cassidys fingerprints were always prominent. Taking over the mantle of the Kellys, who sowed the seeds in the s. Mark and Declan seemed like eternal minor managers when, in the beginning, silverware didnt always reward their toil. On a monsoon afternoon at Kevin Lynch Park, a saturated Bun thumped the roof of the then prefab dressing rooms to the sound of campeones. A team he managed with former minor winner Eoin McGuigan, that included Cormac McKenna and Chrissy McKaigue, had brought home the bacon. It was another building block. Also seated for that Monday viewing was Dermot Doherty, a selector under Michael McShane who is now running his eye over the minors. The apple doesnt fall far from the tree. His father Barney and the late Eugene Babs Kelly managed the clubs  winning team. It was a fitting reward for Barneys ferrying of average underage teams, year after year, in the back of his blue Mercedes van. Often on the lookout for a th player to make up a team that would iniably be on the end of many a hammering. An U shield at a blitz in Dungiven and a South Derry minor hurling final win against Lavey were the modest s for the effort. A FIRST FEacuteILE Below it all, another batch was coming to the fore to cut new ground. In , under Thomas and Barney and captained by current minor selector Adrian Quigg, Slaughtneil won their first ever Feacuteile title. By minor level, with direction from Mark and Declan Cassidy, back to back Ulster minor titles followed, from a group that also won a football title at St Pauls and lost in the final the following year. A generation that also produced current senior football boss Paul Bradley. Under Thomas wing, they won the senior title in  before being beaten out the gate by Dunloy in the Ulster final. It couldve been the beginning of dominance, but instead it was a last senior title for  years as Kevin Lynchs and Lavey ruled the roost. Armed with more coaches coming forward, the Slaughtneil underage hurling production line succeeded Ballinascreens time at the top. No longer was the journey south to the Feacuteile a novelty. It was a permanent fixture in the calendar. With it, came families bonding together and each success inspired the younger teams to follow. A new wave of minor glory at Ballinascreens Ulster tournament followed, but Kevin Lynchs were still the standard at senior level.  was supposed to be the breakthrough year. After winning a league title, Slaughtneils young guns were the pretenders to the Fr Collins Cup only to be sent home with their tail between their legs again by the Lynchs. It was neighbours Swatragh that took the cup for the first of eight seasons into the Granaghan parish where it still remains. The following year, under Mickey Glover, Slaughtneil eventually wrestled clear of Kevin Lynchs on their way to glory. In Ulster, their gung-ho tactics and bravery put Loughgiel to the pin of their collar in a moral victory to ascertain the level required. For the next two years they faced Cushendall in Ulster, but again came up short. All the while the underage production line continued. The Fr Collins Cup was present at one of the underage management meetings, almost as a sign of the level that needed maintained. With every year, came one or two new players into the squad. The fact that Michael McShane handed Shane McGuigan his senior debut in an Ulster final, while still a minor, was a sign of their commitment to growing the team to a height to challenge the big boys. McShane built a management team to match the players ambitions. Every base was covered. Cormac Donnelly came in as trainer. Their games were all analysed. Like the footballers and camogs, the strength and conditioning made them a finely tuned engine. The pre-game routine was planned to the nth degree, so that all the players had to do was turn up and deliver. And they did. Three Ulsters later and their stature on the national stage has soared. Cuala beat them in the manner Dunloy did in . It was followed by defeat to Na Piarsaigh, a game they surrendered from a position of strength. How times had changed. In the s, when Tom Magill had Lavey at their peak, just winning a championship game was a challenge. Now, not being happy after putting up a performance on the All-Ireland stage told enough about the ambition. The Ballyhale game was the greatest statement of intent, taking the giants of club hurling every step of the way. In the physical stakes, they were able to match them and in the skills of the game they were not found wanting either. In an epic, they came so close to the biggest day of all. This weekend, they enter the knockout championship stage again. They will have the favourites tag. There are no two ways around it. Last week, they saw off Na Magha with virtually a reserve team. Only Jerome McGuigan, suspended against Lavey, started from their All-Ireland semi-final team. Thats how far Slaughtneils hurling story has come. From the days when getting  players for a game was an achievement, they have set a standard of skill, attitude and athleticism that the rest of Derry must strive to reach. Success comes in cycles. In recent times, Kevin Hinphey has followed his father into coaching and led Kevin Lynchs to back to back Ulster minor hurling titles. They have been swimming in Slaughtneils wake, searching for ato the top table. The overall Derry hurling landscape needs them, and others, to narrow the gap. To do so, they will need to match an unrelenting hunger for more success. When you have had barren years like Slaughtneil, you wont want to step off the perch anytime soon.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

At the end of a dire game of football, substitute Ciaron Harkin latched onto a cross from Colm Horgan to volley City into the lead with just one minute left on the clock. A clearly dispirited Drogheda then conceded a second in added time as another substitute, this time Stephen Mallon, fired in a second goal to flatter Derry, who responded to their Europa League exit with a valuable win. In a game of few chances, Drogheda were on the front foot early on, showing a lot of energy and enterprise as they did not take Derry settle into the game at all. The home side could well have been celebrating an early goal. Darren Cole gave the ball away down the right and Drogheda countered, with Kane working his way in from the left, and he got a sight of goal only to blaze his effort high and wide without testing Peter Cherrie. googletag.cmd.push It took Derry  minutes to finally threaten the Drogheda goal, and it all came from another brilliant surging run forward from Eoin Toal, this time down the right-wing. Toal’s cross from the right won City the first of two successive corners, the latter of which saw Ada, Hammill cross brilliantly to Cameron McJannett who somehow headed over from under the crossbar when it seemed he must surely score on his debut. City were on the front foot immediately at the start of the second period and Ibrahim Meite, after a quiet first period, went for a spectacular effort almost immediately, his left-footed effort from the edge of the area curling wide of goal without testing Ross Treacy. googletag.cmd.push The visitors were asking the questions at the start of the second half but a Drogheda break, led by Mark Doyle, saw the home side very nearly take the lead. Doyle went on a mazy run through midfield right to the edge of the City penalty area, where his attempted shot was blocked. The ball however ran straight to Brandon Bermingham who tried a low first-time effort which had Cherrie scrambling across goal but it went just wide of the target. The game was heading to extra time before one decisive moment decided it – Colm Horgan breaking into the area and crossing for Harkin to fire in a fantastic finish at the near post with just  seconds left on the clock. There was still time for another goal to really flatter Derry as Meite’s threaded pass put Mallon through on goal and he smashed in his third goal of the season to send the Candystripes through to the quarterfinals. TEAMS DROGHEDA UNITED: Ross Treacy, James Brown, Conor Kane, Jack Tuite , Hugh Douglas, Derek Prendergast, Richie O’Farrell, Mark Doyle, Jake Hyland, Brandon Bermingham , Mark Hughes. DERRY CITY: Peter Cherrie, Ciaran Coll, Cameron McJannett, Eoin Toal, Darren Cole, Conor McCormack, Jake Dunwoody , Joe Thompson , James Akintunde , Adam Hammill, Ibrahim Meite.

At that stage, Bryansford had work to do with Clonduff leading - to -.Charlie Carr split the posts for Clonduff with a superbly taken score.

Like Pantridge, after the war he could neither forgive nor forget and had a burning hatred of the Japanese.During his time in captivity, Pantridge suffered badly from malnutrition, beri beri and other illnesses. Following the Japanese surrender he weighed less than five stone and was a physical wreck.On ing home to Northern Ireland in October  he was still very weak, but was determined to resume his medical career, getting a housemanrsquos position at the Royal Victoria Hospital.Because of his experiences in the POW camps, he decided to specialise in heart medicine. He became a consultant physician and cardiologist at the RVH before inventing the portable defibrillator in the s.Pantridge had become convinced that a patient might be savedan electric shock was applied to the chest as soon as possible after a cardiac arrest. There were defibrillators in hospitals, but they were too big and bulky to be taken outside.Along with others he set out to make a defibrillator small enough to fit inside an ambulance. In  the first ambulance with a defibrillator was operating in Northern Ireland, making the province one of the safest places in the world to have a heart attack.The mobile defibrillator was used to treat US President Lyndon Johnson when he suffered a heart attack in .Although he was known worldwide as the lsquoFather of Emergency Medicinersquo Pantridge was less acclaimed in his own country, and was saddened that it took until  for all front-line ambulances in the UK to be fitted with defibrillators.He had retired in  and died on December , , aged . A bronze statue of him stands outside Lisburnrsquos civic centre as a timeless tribute to his achievements.Cecil Lowry says of Professor Pantridge: ldquoFrank was a man, whose talents and achievements were so extraordinary, that the further we consider his character, the more he will be remembered by the present generation with admiration and reverence.ldquoThis book has told the manrsquos story of incredible bravery in the face of overwhelming odds during the Second World War and his dedication to the concept of the portable defibrillator on his .

The way they have been treated is diabolical, he declared.Cllr Boyle said parents have raised their concerns with him, highlighting what their children experienced at the start of the new school term by having to wait to use the ferry.He also revealed that he became increasingly concerned when he highlighted the issue on social media and was told how children were being treated.Cllr Boyle said problems were compounded with the closure of the main Strangford to Downpatrick road to allow a number of trees to be pruned to allow double decker buses to use the route in future.ldquoMy main concern is that there was no prior notice in relation to the number of children who could board the ferry. Parents also were not told, he continued.Cllr Boyle also commended two St Patrickrsquos Grammar School students who were waiting for the ferry on Monday but stood back to allow two elderly people to board the vessel.ldquoOnce they had boarded, the students were not allowed on as there were  foot passengers. They were the only two left at the quayside before being joined by other passengers waiting to cross on the next sailing.

The Minister cannot allow all this to simply be thrown away.The Strangford MLA added: ldquoThe local community previously stood together to save Exploris and will do so again. I would urge anyone with concerns to make their voice heard and lodge their concerns and together we can save our local economy.It is believed that the poundm aquarium proposal could create more than  full-time jobs and would be the biggest attraction of its kind on the island of Ireland.The firm behind it, reefLIVE, says around  to  jobs could be created during its construction, with  full-time

He said the impact of the small building mdash redeveloped by the Parish Church mdash was expanding all the time.He added: ldquoI know that you will protect and encourage all that happens from there.Dean Hull paid tribute to Mr McDonaldrsquos contribution to not only Down and Hollymount churches but all those within the Lecale Area Mission Partnershipgroup.ldquoScott made a signicant contribution to LAMP and he and his family have been very much part of le here in Down and in Hollymount, also touching on the other churches within the group as well.ldquoScottrsquos ministry very much focused on Down Parish and Hollymount but he has influenced people in churches where and there are those who are sad that they cannot be with us this morning, the Dean continued.Praising Mr McDonald for launching Carols by the Lake and Blue Christmas initiatives, Dean Hull said the latter really touched those dealing with bereavement and loss and hopes that bothcontinue to feature on the church calendar.Mr Dorrian highlighted the key role played by Scott in forging relationships, referencing his work with the Pepper Johns Community Centre and establishing a link betweenHollymount Church and Hollymount Pipe Band. One of the bandrsquos members, Sam Gill, played at the end of Sundayrsquos service.Mr Telford described Sundayrsquos service as a ldquosad occasion as the congregation in Down Parish said goodbye to their minister who had touched all their lives.He said Mr McDonaldrsquos arrival in  ldquosparked renewed optimism within the church with the new man quickly making his mark, especially in relation to the Pepper Johns Community Centre which he helped deliver along with the board of trustees.He added: ldquoPerhaps the best tribute that can be paid to Scott is that he very soon became one of us and, deep down, I think he knows that he always will be. It was a hard decision for Scott and his family to make the move to Newry and it is important that while we are disappointed aboutthis, we support them and continue to do so.On behalf of Hollymount Church, Ms Blair said that Mr McDonald will be very much missed, praising him for his leadership and the ious initiatives that he spearheaded over the past four years.ldquoWe are all fond of Scott who was with us through thick and thin and ups and downs. No matter what, Scott was there, she said.Ms Blair added: ldquoWhile we are sorry to see him go, we wish Scott and his family all the best in Newry..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26th August 2020 Students.jpg","title":"Students celebrate GCSE results after ‘challenging year’  ","story":"IT was a dferent GCSE results day this year for local schools and students as the need to maintain social distancing measures was a key concern.As with the recent A-Level results, grades this year were predicted by teachers as examinations could not be held due to schools closure over the Covid- lockdown.Down High Schoolrsquos principal, Mrs Maud Perry, reported that  students collected their results from two designated venues in Downpatrick at dferent times with social distancing measures in place.Nearly % of all students achieved at least seven A* A grades while six pupils mdash Katie Dickson, Ellen Johnston, Cameron McCaughey, Lauren McCormick, Rosa Morgan-Young and Anna Torrens mdash all received ten A* grades while Lucy Healy and Tori Marks secured nine A* grades each.Mrs Perry paid tribute to the hard work of her pupils during such challenging times.ldquoThis was a lovely year group and we congratulate them on these outcomes, which provide a firm foundation for the next stage of their education.

The scenic aerial footage above the meandering river was shot by retired British Airways Captain Mick Crossey whose film company is aptly named Airborne Pixels. Directed by Tristan Crowe with captivating music from NVTV’s music library, the film is “a celebration of one of our most iconic rivers” Liam told Roamer, adding “it’s a hidden gem and a lure for anglers right along its .” Charlie Gillen’s hugely evocative poem about the river begins with two introductory verses.“Ye hae hard aboot the Danube the Shannon an’ the Clyde,They’re a weel knowed rivers that ir sung aboot wae pride,But whun ye talk o’ rivers, there is only yin for me,She flows oot through north Antrim, on hir wye doon tae the sea,She rises in the muntins awa abane Loughgiel,An she flows through fermin’ country an’ villages as weel,She haes a special quality, for the man wha loves tae fishShe is that famous water folk cathe river Bush.”The poet’s words, the panoramic footage and the music, with Liam’s gently authoritative presentation, make this special river flow from the screen into the viewer’s soul. “It is vivid and eloquent and heart-warming,” Liam explained, describing Charlie Gillen as “the poet laureate of North Antrim.”Mr Logan reckons we don’t normally hear enough about “the discreet charm of North Antrim’s River Bush. The film endeavours to correct this deficit and show it to us in all its beauty, in all its ersity and colour. Charlie Gillen offers a proper poetic tribute of his own, reminding us that Ulster Scots is the voice best suited to take us on our journey across the Antrim Plateau, ending in the Wild Atlantic near Portballintrae.”“She starts hir journey doon Glenbush, fae the dam at Altnahinch,Ir tinklin music there she plays, as she trevils inch bae inch,She flows bae Magherahoney, tae the village o’ Armoy,Alang hir brews in the gloamin the girls mak trysts wae boys“Then she flows doon through a valley, beside a stately hall,An’ she adds hir ain wee magic touch tae the beauty over all,An’ye axed the emigrant whut wus he’s fondest wish,He’ll sey tae stan on Stranocum brig an watch the river Bush,“Fae there she keeps on flowin tae she passes through Bellisle,An then on oot tae Conagher, she flows in perfect style,Aboot a mile fae Dervock village, the Blackwater joins the flow,On the ither side o’ Conagher rins burn Gushey dark an slow.“She’s gettin near hir journeys en’ whun passin through Seneirl,Through the toonlans leadin tae Bushmills she glissens lake a pearl,She taks the Walkmills in hir stride she’s gyely in Bushmills,A lang an weary journey fae the peat an heather hills,“An at last tae Neptunes kingdom she maks a final rush,Where the tireless Atlantic meets the famous river Bush.Noo I hae niver fun the spot whur I wud rether spen mae time,Than on the brews o the river Bush, wae fly an rod an line“Oul Isaac Walton lang ago these wurds he’d whiles recite,He dee’t in sixteen eighty three, an still his words are rightO’ forthe gallant fisher’s leIt is the best of any,‘Tis full of pleasure void of stre,And is beloved by many”“An noo mae pen I’ll set aside an gie ye some advice,An heed mae wurds baith young an oul ye dinnae pass here twiceWull ye tak a break fae yer busy le, in this worl o shove an push,An sit an lissen tae the music o mae ain oul river Bush.”NVTV broadcasts on Freeview Ch across the Greater Belfast area, and on Virgin Ch where available in Northern Ireland.

More than half of the children with covid- reported no symptoms.However, the study found that gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting were the most common symptoms of covid- in children, ahead of cough or changes in their sense of smell or taste.The findings also showed young children under  years of age were just as likely to have evidence of prior infection as older children, and that asymptomatic children were just as likely to develop antibodies as symptomatic children.Executive director of Public Health for Cardf and Vale University Health Board, Fiona Kinghorn said: ldquoCovid- remains a relatively new virus to us, and it is important that through valuable research studies such as this we continue to increase our understanding of it.ldquoI would like to thank my research colleagues here at Cardf and Vale UHB for their excellent contribution to this study, and congratulate everybody involved for their role in these important findings as this research continues to monitor community transmission of the virus in children.Paediatric research nurse specialist, Zoe Morrison added: ldquoThanks to this study we now better understand the prevalence of covid- in children after the first wave of the pandemic, and know that while the majority of children with Covid- will display no symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting could be a sign that they are infected with the disease, and must now consider the value of refining the testing criteria for children to include these symptoms.ldquoThe interest in participating in this clinical trial has been unprecedented and we would like to extend our thanks to all the children and their parents who have volunteered to take part in this study, helping us gain important insight into how this virus behaves among children.CYARU were able to input into the study thanks to funding for research equipment from the Noahrsquos Ark charity.The team will also be using samples collected during the study to test the efficacy of new antibody tests that are developed, as well as monitoring the longer term behaviour of the antibodies to understand whether they reduce in numbers orchildren can lose them over time. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Over my years as principal, we have had great support from the club and some of our past pupils have gone on to represent their county.For me, the notable achievement has been to see the way in which past pupils have progressed in a iety of chosen careers and been successful in so many walks of le.Another achievement is the way in which the staff both past and present have worked together as a team to have accomplished so many things over the past  years, not least to have been awarded Outstanding in our last inspection report.The development of the St. Cairealls Community Playschool on the school site has also brought me great joy over the past ten years to see it now as a successful pre-school provider with DENI status and funding for our local children.Having spent so many years of my le in St Cairealls P.S., it has become a second home and the staff and pupils a second family. Retiring for me brings mixed emotions. However , I am looking forward to having more time to spend with my family, my husband Kevin, our daughters Emer, Niamh and Fionnuala and their partners. Also our son Michael and his partner and my two precious grandsons Micheal and Braidan. Mrs McHugh concluded: I want to offer good wishes to the future of this very special school – St. Cairealls Primary School, Aghyaran and success and happiness to my successor, Mrs Michelle Ellis.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebdbbdefeefd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbcffdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1598431969897.jpg--post_primary_pupils_now_to_wear_face_coverings_in_corridors.jpg?159843197000","title":"post primary pupils now to wear face coverings in corridors ","story":"Education Minister Peter Weir has announced that guidance on face coverings will be updated to include wearing them in corridors of post-primary schools. This will come into effect on  August when schoolson a full-time basis. The Minister said: “My key priority is that pupilsto school on a full-time basis, as soon as it is safe to do so. “Following further advice which I have received today from the Chief Medical Officer and the Chief Scientic Adviser, I am recommending that pupils and teachers wear a face covering in corridors and other communal areas of post-primary schools from next week when schoolsfull-time. This updates the existing guidance on the use of face coverings in educational settings. “The current public health advice is that the use of face coverings provides some benefits, however, it is not a replacement for frequent hand washing, social distancing where possible, covering your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze and regular cleaning of surfaces. It is also important to remember that evidence suggests that the risk of transmission in schools is relatively low compared to some other settings. “My existing guidance on the reopening of schools already deals with the use of face coverings. In terms of school transport, the advice remains the same, that we strongly recommend that all pupils wear a face covering on all dedicated school transport including buses and taxis where it is appropriate for them to do so. “In relation to communal areas in schools, the guidance already strongly encourages face coverings for activities that entail large numbers of staff or pupils within an enclosed space where social distancing is not possible. “Given the risk mitigations in place in schools to limit and contain the spread of Covid-, face coverings are not recommended as being compulsory for routine use in education settings. However, staff and pupils may wish to use them during the routine school day and this is acceptable. Schools should also be aware that some personsare exempt from wearing face coverings. “I will continue to keep all guidance in respect of education settings under review in light of the latest medical and scientic advice. Peter Weir said: “The first step in keeping our schools safe is that anyone with symptoms should not attend school. Parents should not send their children to schoolthey have any of the Covid- symptoms including: a high temperature a new, continuous cough a loss or change to your sense of smell or taste.” The Department’s New School Day Guidance will be updated to reflect this recommendation.  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ebdbbdefeefd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_ddbcffdd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
