[{"url":null,"title":"Dame Judi Dench says theatres NEVER reopen lifetime amid coronavirus lockdown","story":"Share this article Boris Johnson and his Chancellor Rishi Sunak need to think hard about what is at stake here. One top forecasting firm projects that revenue from the creative industries will drop by an astonishing £74billion in 2020 thanks to the coronavirus lockdown. More than 400,000 jobs will be lost by year\u0027s end - simply a human tragedy - and the damage doesn\u0027t stop there. Countless more millions in revenue will be lost to the bars and restaurants that complement theatres and concert halls around the country. At the Theatre Royal, Plymouth, we earn 91 per cent of our annual turnover and take only a 9 per cent government subsidy. At a stroke, all our income except that small subsidy has been lost. Many regional theatres have a reputation for developing acting and writing talent. In Plymouth, I gave Michael Sheen his first directing job at our Drum theatre, while David Suchet and Ben Whishaw have also performed there and James Corden, Michael Ball - a Plymouth lad - and Sir Ian McKellen have played our Lyric stage.  It is a virtuous circle of British creative talent that now circulates around Hollywood and the globe. Now all of that is threatened. South Korea shows us what can be done. It may surprise some to learn that Phantom of the Opera is currently playing in Seoul to packed houses. Cast and patrons have their temperatures taken and apply sanitising gel. Masks are worn. But people sit side by side, with no social distancing. At the beginning of the reopening, only half those Koreans with booked seats were prepared to attend. But after a dozen or so performances, the figure shot up to above 90 per cent. This is the sort of bold thinking that will be necessary to save our industry. Large-scale theatres require attendances of 70 to 80 per cent to break even, so social distancing, even at one metre, is a non-starter. In the immediate term, we need a financial support scheme for the whole sector. But equally important is political leadership. The Prime Minister and his scientific advisers must get behind a new regime that will allow theatres to open again. We need to get back to the business of safely delighting people. Adrian Vinken is chief executive of the Theatre Royal, PlymouthTimes letters: Arts still in peril after the lockdown lifts | Comment | The Times"},{"url":null,"title":"Amber Heard called Elon Musk Rocketman texts","story":"Share this articleShare this articleAmber Heard called Elon Musk her \u0027Rocketman\u0027 in texts while married to Johnny Depp - Mirror OnlineElon Musk denies threesome with Amber Heard and Cara Delevingne"},{"url":null,"title":"Coronavirus testing carried parks churches sports grounds","story":"Share this article But latest data from the Office for National Statistics suggests there are up to 3,200 new infections a day or 22,400 a week, suggesting fewer than a third of people are being tested.To further increase uptake, the Department of Health is planning to double the number of mobile testing units from 117 to 236 by the end of July. Officials yesterday said 43,230 people had died after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK, up 149 from the day before.Dido Harding, executive chairman of the test and trace programme, said: ‘Our new walk-through testing sites will be set up in places that are easy for people to get to by foot or on a bike.’The Newcastle walk-in unit is close to an Asda supermarket, Slough’s is in a leisure centre, Rochdale’s is in a town hall car park and Newham’s is located in a community care centre.Officials at the Department of Health say the location of the new sites will be driven by where residents are most likely to use them rather than a ‘national diktat’.They hope the new units will improve the Government’s test and trace programme, which is meant to be playing a crucial role in the safe lifting of the lockdown. But figures from the scheme yesterday showed the numbers of patients handing over details of their close contacts had fallen compared to the previous week.A total of 70 per cent were asked to provide these details for the week to June 17, while the remaining 30 per cent could not be reached. This dropped from the 75 per cent who gave contact details for the week to June 10.Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said: ‘There are still many questions that need answering before we can be confident that we have a fit for purpose regime, let alone a world class one.’ The retreat of the pandemic has stalled in England and the number infected may even have gone up, figures suggested yesterday.Around one in 1,100 people were infected in the middle two weeks of this month – up from one in 1,700 in the first fortnight of June, findings published by the Office for National Statistics said."},{"url":null,"title":"Japan suspicions health Kim Jong strange movements","story":"Share this articleKim Jong-un dead rumours resurface as Japan reveals it has ‘some suspicions’ about state of North Korean tyrant’s health"},{"url":null,"title":"Mother two children saved house gas explosion fridge freezer","story":"Share this articleMum, 31, and two sons aged five and two, fighting for life after \u0027gas explosion\u0027 at three-bedroom homeCrowdfunding to help raise funds for Jess, Mike and their 2 beautiful boys who lost their home in a devasting explosion in Seven Sisters. on JustGiving"},{"url":null,"title":"Woman 28 told TWO wombs","story":"Share this articleWoman learns she has two wombs when doctors tell her she\u0027s carrying a twin in each - a one in 50million chance"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68ca6b3b594fdbca56109b923a9e4e5954ca1c8a/0_320_5715_3429/master/5715.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=64ec5fc8cee6d27981a043504c67df9d","title":"splendid isolation in search of scotlands hermits","story":"Many isolated people have struggled in lockdown, but others enjoy solitude and choose it as a way of life. Here, Elliot Caunce portrays four modern hermits who live off the grid in ScotlandWilliams, 70, moved into his off-grid farmhouse in the 70s, with his then wife and his daughter, Ceilidh, after falling out with his landlord in Aberdeen. When the marriage ended, he stayed on alone, but he is philosophically optimistic about a future relationship: “I was once married and I may well be married again. It’s a big house to be rattling around in by myself.”Down a remote forestry track in Aberdeenshire, his house has no mains electricity, water or conventional sewage system. For a hermit, he is not averse to fame: he featured in the cinema documentary Two Years At Sea by Ben Rivers, appeared on a Frankie Boyle television show and plays folk music at open mic nights.Maitland, 70, is a successful author who writes books about religious fantasy and solitude, informed by her Roman Catholic faith. She spent increasing amounts of time alone when her marriage broke down in 1993. “I went to live in the country. It was here I started to practise solitude and it grew from there. I found I loved it.” She has lived in the remote moorlands of Galloway since 2006.She recognises that living alone in remote countryside could become difficult as she gets older, especially if she becomes unable to drive. She needs a car to fetch supplies and to remove rubbish, as there is no bin collection.McDonald, 65, moved into a tent in 2007, after he was diagnosed with a critical heart condition and told he needed a transplant. He decided to self-isolate on the edge of a loch, to the east of Fort William. “I thought: if I’ve only got a short life expectancy, I’m just going to come out and live in the wild, which is what I was going to do when I retired.” Living in an area without a phone signal or roads, and few hikers, he has become resilient and self-sufficient. Shopping for supplies involves a round trip of 10 miles walking and 50 miles by train.Smith, 74, is known as the Hermit of Loch Treig. He has lived alone in an isolated log cabin, lacking all modern amenities, since 1984. Once a month, he hikes along an active train track to his nearest station, then takes an hour’s ride to Fort William for food and medical supplies. His one concession to modern life is an emergency locator beacon, which he activated in February 2019 after becoming ill – the distress signal was routed via Houston, Texas, to the coastguard and then Lochaber Mountain Rescue he was airlifted to hospital by helicopter."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bee217d86edc84e83006477901f3df910988d746/0_2_4433_2661/master/4433.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0c31a8608286adf580241c8d44b2a980","title":"tracing lives visual response to coronavirus","story":"In part four of our series in collaboration with Prix Pictet, the photographer Alexia Webster provides an intimate portrait of her parents, telling the story of life and her own origins in South Africa and examining the violence and triumphs, mixing new images with projections of moments from their livesThe ability to move us beyond cliche is a characteristic photographers shortlisted for the Prix Pictet share, and it is important as we grapple with the reality of the world as we emerge from the Covid-19 crisis.The global lockdown has birthed new cliches: wildlife cautiously exploring the unpeopled streets, or iconic monuments devoid of tourists, ignored save for the occasional solitary inidual escaping their own confinement.This commission asked photographers to move beyond the obvious, and present a series of images that respond to the issues confronting us today, and begin to plot a route through to a new future and new ways of thinking about the world.A few months ago Covid-19 spread across the world like a force of change and I found myself, like millions around the globe, suddenly and unexpectedly grounded. I live in New York City, but I was working on a project in the rainforest in Madagascar when the government announced it was shutting its borders. I managed to get on the last flight out of the country to South Africa and I arrived in my childhood home, Johannesburg, a few days before a military-enforced lockdown grounded all international flights indefinitely.I had left Johannesburg over 10 years ago and I have spent these years looking outward, restlessly exploring this strange, complex world. But suddenly I was forced to sit still. The city seemed to have been turned off the sky cleared, the traffic stopped and we all went inside. I felt shipwrecked and trapped. As the military started rolling into the city in armoured vehicles, forcing people inside, and we believed the virus was stalking the streets, I felt a familiar unsettledness, similar to the anxious uncertainty of my early childhood growing up during apartheid.Apartheid loomed large over my childhood. Our phones were tapped by the security police, friends of my parents were killed by the government and many nights I would lie awake eavesdropping on anxious political discussions. My parents are both academics, teachers and political activists who have dedicated most of their lives trying to help build a more just and equal society. Now as the world entered a new uncertain time, I found myself stranded right where I had started, just a few minutes away from my first guides to surviving a world in turmoil, my parents.So I took my camera and spent the afternoons of the lockdown sitting with a mask on in their garden interviewing them about their lives before I was born, sifting through giant, chaotic, dusty piles of family photos, and skulking around their house with a portable projector and a bottle of disinfectant.This is an incomplete portrait of my parents. This story leaves out many of the most notable successes, heartbreaks and struggles that defined their lives. But it’s a small glimpse into the quiet violences and small triumphs of life, and the steps that led my parents to the moment that made me.(Left) Photographers Portrait Studio, Johannesburg, 1939. My mother, Luli Callinicos, at two years old sits with her parents, Thalia and Yannis Callinicos, who ran a small grocery store in the mining city of Boksburg, and her two uncles. The family had arrived in South Africa a few years before from a tiny village on a small Greek island.(Right) The family home, Fort Hare, 1947. My father, Eddie Webster, on the right with his parents, Enid and Lionel Webster, both schoolteachers, and his older brother, Trevor. My grandfather had recently returned home from the second world war after being away for four years.“I think that was possibly the most traumatic moment in my life although I have no recognisable conscious memory of it. What I know is what my mother told me … In the 1940s Cape Town experienced an epidemic of diphtheria, and diphtheria, like Covid-19, is highly infectious and it was believed at the time by the medical profession that it weakened the heart and that if someone moved quickly or jerked that could lead to the collapse of the heart and you’d die. I was two years old when I acquired the virus. The diagnosis once it was made was that I had to be locked down, I had to be tied down and put in a glass case to prevent the infection from spreading to others. My mother was only allowed to visit once or twice a week. I was there, tied down in a hospital bed, for six weeks.”“My generation was born in South Africa but our parents were immigrants. It was the height of colonialism and the Greek community, a vulnerable, newly arrived minority, was at that time quite closed and defensive. Some of my earliest memories of anyone outside of the Greek community are of my nanny, Tryphena, who lived in a room in the backyard of our house. My parents worked long hours at the cafe that my father ran so she would look after me when my mother was at work. She was so warm and affectionate and I really adored her. The only time off she had was on Thursday afternoons. One day I remember her preparing to leave in the afternoon and she was so beautifully dressed. I usually only knew her in her work clothes, an overall, an apron and a cap on her head. I remember this particular time though she had high heels on and a beautifully fitting red dress and she was so elegant and beautiful and sexy. She said sweetly, ‘Good bye Luli, see you tomorrow,’ and walked out the door. I couldn’t help myself, I followed her, I couldn’t bear to see her go. We must have walked about two blocks, I was behind her not saying a word. When she came to the bus stop she turned around and saw me and her whole face suddenly changed. She became angry and shouted, ‘What are you doing? Go back at once! I’m not going to take you with me. Just go back!’ I was devastated and felt so hurt, not at all understanding that this one afternoon was her very precious, only a few hours of freedom and escape from our house.”“At the age of 13 I was sent to boarding school. I was desperately homesick, separated from my mother and father in this totally alien world. It was rough and often violent. There was a system that was called ‘running the gauntlet’. You’d have five or six boys on each side, they’d line up and you had to run through and you could hit the guy with anything you had, a cricket bat, a stick, or even a brick and people would do that, especially if there was something different about the guy, then they could seriously hurt the person. There was a very violent masculinity there that in order to survive in a sense you had to become part of, either tacitly or actively. I found it deeply compromising and unsettling.”“One day, when I was 18 we went to a Greek dance in the city hall. A man came up to request a dance and I recognised him from a week before when I won a raffle at the Greek club. He was the pharmacist my mother had mentioned a few days before. We began to dance and he said: ‘I was so struck by you, I want to ask for your hand in marriage.’ I was a bit taken aback. This was my first time I was meeting him. ‘Actually I’m in love with someone else,’ I told him. We spent the rest of the dance in silence.”“My parents had heard from him what I had said and they were outraged. The young man I was in love with was a cafe owner like my father, whereas I was getting a university education and could be marrying a pharmacist. There was a huge confrontation that evening. I declared, outrageously for the Greek culture at that time, that I would either marry the man I loved or not marry at all. My father\u0026nbspdisappeared and came back with a revolver in his hand and said, ‘If you contemplate marrying him I’m going to kill him and then I’ll kill myself.’ A few days later I was allowed to go to the library where I met my love secretly. We had a tearful farewell. It was taken for granted that I would become engaged to the pharmacist. I had no other option unless I wanted to be exiled to Greece. I was married three months later at the age of 19.”“My big first shift in how I saw the world was going overseas and hitchhiking in Europe and the Middle East in 1960 when I was 17. That’s what transformed my life. Travelling on my own I had to adapt and observe. I noticed things that were new to me and distinctive. We were travelling on the edge of colonialism. Egypt was already independent. We travelled back down to South Africa via boat, stopping off at ports along the east African coast. In Mombasa I met a young Kenyan man that belonged to the Kenyan African National Union, who was telling me about his desire for independence from British colonial rule. When we arrived back in Durban, I remember driving back with my family and it was the height of a state of emergency there were soldiers everywhere. Suddenly I was looking at the country through different eyes. My consciousness had started to evolve, an awareness was emerging.”“I was 23 years old and had joined the ANC. After the 1960 state of emergency, which was declared after the killings of Sharpeville in which 69 people were shot dead during a peaceful protest, we met and decided to work in pairs, some at night and some in the daytime. We went up Anstey’s building, the tallest building in Johannesburg city centre, and because we were white we could just take the lift right to the top floor. We had packets of leaflets saying that this was the time now for whites to realise there must be change, the only solution was democracy for all. I had a whole packet of leaflets and I threw them all down over the streets from the top of the roof. Hundreds of them gently floated into the busy city streets below.”“After the massacre in\u0026nbspSharpeville in 1960, every week we would hear news of people being arrested, detained and tortured. Increasingly, there were reports of political activists who disappeared into apartheid’s dungeons, or had managed to escape the country. I was the secretary of the Defence and Aid Fund, and for a few years we had been secretly funnelling people to safe houses and then out of the country. But eventually the underground leadership was captured and sentenced to lifetime imprisonment on Robben Island. I was 27 years old when the special branch came to the school I was teaching at and asked me to go with them. I was held for two days in detention.”“For a few years after I orced my husband I taught history at King David high school. I really enjoyed teaching and wouldn’t teach the apartheid curriculum to the students. When my history co-teacher was forced to resign over a statement questioning the validity of Israel’s right to Palestine during the recent six-day war, I pleaded his case but the headmaster dismissed it. ‘I have a wonderful replacement: a captain of the rugby team at university, he’s got an honours degree in history and his name is Eddie Webster.” And of course that’s how I met your father, because of a political upheaval thousands of kilometres away.”“That photo was taken in 1969, the same day as they walked on the moon.”“1976 was a tough year. I was on bail after I had been arrested for calling for the release of Nelson Mandela.\u0026nbspI had to report to the police station twice a week and I was starting to teach a new class and a new course at the university. When they announced by name that these communists had been arrested, my mother had a very serious stroke and nearly died.”“A year later when we were eventually acquitted and I stood down from my evidence in the court, my father came up to me and said, ‘Eddie, when they arrested you I supported you because you are my son. Now I’ve heard you in the dock and I support you because what you did is right.’ What kept me going in this time was the support of my family and my wife, who was unshaken by this and fully supported me, but also it was the fact that I was intellectually now shaping a whole new political agenda that was to become my life’s work really.”“Through writing my book Gold and Workers I found a voice, one that I was deeply interested in. I was pregnant with you when I started writing my first book. I had forged a new sense of community through the city, and through the common beliefs and values I shared with people of the city. Johannesburg gave me an enormous sense of place and identity. And I got to understand and admire the incredible resilience and creativity and the inventiveness of people who were so crudely oppressed and hideously exploited. I came to understand Ubuntu, that ‘a person is a person through other people’.”“It’s interesting reflecting on the past now towards the end of my working life. During the anti-apartheid struggle we had a very clear idea of who the enemy was, it was the system of racial domination and the way in which it gave white people privileges and power at the expense of black people. The virus now is starting to raise questions that are quite fundamental and\u0026nbspdeeper than have ever been confronted before in this country. Namely that we are not in this together, we are actually experiencing this pandemic in a very different way. If you are rich and white or if you are black and poor. If you are rich you are living in a comfortable house with clean water and electricity, a regular income, access to a laptop and wifi. So for those around me it’s one kind of experience, loneliness yes, frustration at lack of human contact, yes, but for the majority of the population, particularly those who are in precarious employment, this is devastating. What it has revealed, this pandemic, is the deeply racialised nature of our inequality. There is\u0026nbspa wonderful saying by Warren Buffett, who I don’t particularly like, ‘When the tide goes out, you see who’s swimming naked.’ That’s what’s happened, the tide has gone out and we see who’s actually struggling and the deep inequalities that we have inherited from apartheid that haven’t been resolved.”\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspEddie, 78: “I think on the one hand I feel like I’ve had a rich, active life and quite a fulfilled one. In some ways I’ve added value to other people’s lives as a teacher, writer and an activist. On the other hand I feel the journey is not over and I haven’t quite finished my life’s project. I feel like I’m racing against time.”\u0026nbspLuli, 83: “As you get older you just adapt to the idea that there is less time, so there is more meaning. It may be the last time so you feel the good things more consciously.”• Prix Pictet was founded in 2008\u0026nbspby the Geneva-based Pictet Group, with the mandate to use photography to move beyond cliche and deliver powerful messages about sustainability to a global audience.

The brand would give Marks and Spencer access to a potentially younger consumer and be in line with the retailer’s new strategy, revealed last month, to increase sales by selling “complementary guest brands” online.Analysts questioned whether Victoria’s Secret, once renowned for its over the top fashion shows featuring scantily clad models known as “angels”, would be a positive addition to Marks and Spencer’s online lineup.The shows were ditched several years ago but the brand, aimed at teens and twentysomethings, has attracted criticism of its treatment of models and presentation of women. Its sexy image is also out of tune with a shift to more comfortable and gender-neutral underwear among younger shoppers.Patrick O’Brien, an analyst at GlobalData, said Victoria’s Secret had lost relevance in the #MeToo era. “It’s a very jaded brand that hasn’t moved on with the times at all.”The UK stores have been closed since March under the government-imposed high street lockdown to limit the spread of coronavirus but they reopened on Friday.M\u0026ampS is unlikely to want Victoria’s Secret’s portfolio of stores, which the administrators at the advisory firm Deloitte are thought to be keen to offload as part of a deal. The UK ision also does not have ownership of Victoria’s Secret’s online sales in the country – which are controlled by the US parent.Next is a more likely contender as it already sells a portfolio of brands via its Label catalogue and online business and has previously bought up the younger brand Lipsy to help broaden its appeal.M\u0026ampS and Next declined to comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28068016361a00c4aab929a3bc7058061abb0144/37_99_5814_3489/master/5814.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=72a8d7ca1d7a6aac6a25d60f565e0d0e","title":"shopping centre owner intu expected to go into administration","story":"Firm that runs Lakeside and Trafford Centre fails to secure creditor deal before deadlineIntu Properties will collapse into administration on Friday afternoon after the heavily indebted shopping centre owner failed to secure an agreement with its creditors.The company, whose centres include Lakeside in Essex, the Trafford Centre in Manchester and Gateshead’s centre, has debts of more than £4.5bn and has been unable to persuade lenders to grant a debt repayment holiday ahead of a Friday night deadline. The company employs 2,500 people and owns 17 shopping centres across the UK.In its second stock exchange update of the day, Intu said it had begun the process of appointing KPMG, the accountancy firm, to handle the administration, a step that is expected to be completed this afternoon. The company has made a court application to appoint administrators to Intu and several other key parts of the Intu Group. The official appointment will become effective shortly.The company said all shopping centres would continue to trade. Intu’s chief executive, Matthew Roberts, had faced a herculean task in trying to persuade the multitude of banks and bondholders the company owes money to agree to pause repayments. The group is essentially a holding company with £4.5bn of borrowing spread over 21 separate debt instruments creating a complicated web.Roberts said on Friday morning that the attempt to secure some breathing space for the company had been unsuccessful.In addition to Intu’s 2,500 employees, another 100,000 retail workers are employed by its tenants, who include big high street names such as Marks \u0026amp Spencer, Next and H\u0026ampM, to work in its centres. The travails of the former FTSE 100 company have weighed heavily on its shares which on Friday were worth just 2p before the administration triggered their suspension. They were changing hands at 200p less than two years ago.Any sale process will be complicated by the group’s complex structure, and property analysts predict it will be broken up. Intu owns nine of the top 20 shopping centres in the UK. Malls such as the Trafford Centre, Lakeside and Gateshead’s centre are likely to attract potential buyers, but its smaller regional malls may prove less popular.Intu had been under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic. The value of its centres, as well as those of rival operators such as Hammerson and British Land, had been falling as some of the high street’s big space occupiers, including Debenhams, House of Fraser and Topshop, closed stores and demanded rent cuts so that they could stay in business.With the shift to online shopping undermining the economics of physical store retailing before the health crisis, the high street shutdown has raised the stakes. “There is little doubt about the fall from grace of retail property companies,” said Adrian Palmer, a professor at Henley Business School. “Intu has been hit by changes in shopping habits. Online shopping has taken custom not just from high streets, but also Intu’s out of town shopping centres.“Retail property used to be considered a safe bet for investment, and many pension funds will be hit hard by the declining value and liquidity of property funds such as Intu which include retail in their portfolio.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88adbaa7f15317186809a741d6e548d7970e81b3/25_249_3422_2054/master/3422.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dcda2c9aa2d32331373b32754587f5a3","title":"tesco sales soar as customers turn to deliveries in pandemic coronavirus","story":"Tesco has suffered a major shareholder revolt over executive pay, casting a shadow over a strong sales performance during the coronavirus lockdown.It said it did recognise “that a significant number of shareholders had concerns” with the decision to remove Ocado from the rivals list and would publish an update on its plans for the year ahead within six months.The row comes as Tesco sales soared during lockdown, with shoppers switching to buying online and in local stores as well as returning to big weekly shops at the supermarkets.Retail profits for the year are expected to be in line with last year as Lewis said the cost of adapting to the coronavirus pandemic had been “very significant”, including new safety measures in stores, covering sick pay for vulnerable staff who have had to isolate at home and bringing in 47,000 new workers to help with increased demand. He said he expected additional costs to be close to £920m, the upper end of expectations set out earlier in the year.“In the last three months the industry has changed beyond imagination,” Lewis said in his last results presentation before handing over to the new Tesco boss Ken Murphy in the autumn.Poor trading at Tesco’s bank hit performance in the quarter. Sales at the bank fell by just over a quarter as its travel money business closed temporarily and fewer people used ATMs. Tesco said it expected the ision to report a loss of up to £200m.Lewis said Tesco’s efforts to keep price rises below inflation, including a new price match promise with Aldi, had helped it win shoppers from the German discounter for the first time in more than a decade.On Friday, Tesco said it would be extending the Aldi price match to a further 500 products, from about 300 at present.Roberto Pozzi, an analyst at the credit ratings agency Moody’s, said Tesco’s plans would have implications for the whole grocery market in the UK: “Tesco extends its price-matching campaign to all branded products, challenging suppliers to lower prices in order to compete and regain market share from discounters. This will likely spark new price wars, a credit negative for UK grocers.”Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: “Tesco appears to be gearing up for an all-out price war with the discounters.”About 590,000 vulnerable customers, including elderly people, had started shopping online with the supermarket, many of whom had never done so before, and the group was confident it would continue to serve them."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c1b3cd54bf5ec04f48094b9bdd499babd32d8ed/0_139_4064_2438/master/4064.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=8ce6a646d3d44f2e5012a36cdb572c86","title":"racism future mixed race child london suburb","story":"As a mixed-race child growing up in a London suburb, signs of change were brief but exhilarating. Today I feel that jolt againLast week I was reminded of something important: one of the most meaningful moments of my early life was walking into the newspaper shop where I worked as a paperboy – this was in the white London suburb where I grew up as a mixed-race kid – and seeing the image of Tommie Smith and John Carlos making the black power salute at the 1968 Olympics.For a while I’d been trying to work out, on my own, in my head, and with a few books, what exactly it meant to be a child of empire. It hadn’t been going well I was more than confused. So I remember almost staggering as I experienced a surge of exhilaration and pride at the sight of the two raised fists. I didn’t enjoy feeling strongly – there was a lot that people like me had to endure every day, so it was better to be bloodless – but I was overwhelmed.Maybe, I thought, this is it: our time is coming. We will be recognised. Your face will not always be your fate. There will be resistance and change.I was mumbling something about how moving the photograph was, when my employer, the shopkeeper, said, “Why have these people – including that Cassius Clay – involved politics in sport? Can’t sport just be sport? They should leave it right out.”I’d like to say I responded appropriately, or, rather, inappropriately, but I wouldn’t have been able to say much, saving my many thoughts for writing, the only place I could speak freely. But I was certainly aware that in April of that year, in Birmingham, Enoch Powell had made his infamous “rivers of blood” speech, which had, to say the least, a considerable impact on the lives of people of colour.I was reminded of the photograph of Smith and Carlos when I saw something equally notable, disruptive and carnivalesque: footage of the 18th-century slave-owner Edward Colston’s statue being hurled into Bristol harbour by dozens of young, mostly millennial, anti-racists, cheering and dancing as the bronze effigy was drowned. Two of my children went to university in Bristol they had to walk past that statue of a slaver on the way to class. Now they ask, why did it have to be there at all? And that is indeed a question worth asking about everything like that, over and over. What is it doing, what does it say, and, more importantly, what are we doing today?I grew up in the world colonialism made, and I was taught to be ashamed of where we came from. My father, brought up in British India, used to say: we were told by the white master what a lavish favour they were doing us by colonising us. While they wouldn’t want to be colonised themselves, they were, in fact, civilising us – and more: bringing us education, democracy, trains!After so long, what a break this insurrection or uprising is. After Brexit, Trump, Orbán, Le Pen and the escalation of fatuous populism with its scapegoating and persecution of minorities, this celebration of new voices looks like being our #MeToo moment, a paradigm shift, with some significant acknowledgement of how unalike the experiences of black and white people are, and of how traumatic the infliction of racism is. And of what a pleasure it is to inflict such a trauma on others.What is usually left out of accounts of racism is the enjoyment it gives to those dishing it out – that hit of power and privilege, so easily obtained, telling the other who is boss, who would want to give that up? My father and his family, who came to the west, were soon aware that the white master wanted it both ways, to use immigrant labour to build their economy, and to enjoy their share of colonialism – racism. To do that, we had to stay in our assigned place and acknowledge that nothing is deeper than skin. But that is over.This raises an important question about merit. The wonderful US writer Flannery O’Connor knew she didn’t like black people, and when she met one, she liked to wonder if she’d like them if they were white. (She didn’t like the idea of James Baldwin, black- or white-skinned.)When I was younger and a bit bored in film, theatre or publishing meetings, I’d sometimes conduct a thought experiment comparable to O’Connor’s: if these white people were of colour, would they ever get through this door? Would they be in this position? In this building at all?The truth is that white people must be afraid. In their hearts they know it is only class, race and privilege keeping a lot of them in position. In a real competition these mediocrities would get nowhere. In a meritocracy they’d be sweeping the floor, as the immigrants do, if they were lucky.This is strange, because isn’t capitalism supposed to be an ideology of inidual liberation? We compete our lives are projects we could be entrepreneurs, reinventing ourselves for the market. Yet the ruling class use racism to shy away from real competition because they know it would relegate them.Sometimes one is tempted to give up on the world, and dismiss it as a hopeless thing that can never be improved, but then something comes along to lift the heart, so that pessimism looks like another form of cynicism.It takes a lot of effort to make the future. One or even several demonstrations will not achieve that. The effect will be cumulative. Some things are now impossible, and other things have become possible. And so this moment of economic breakdown and capitalistic stagnation, when neo-liberalism is destroying the very ground on which it is built, is an opportunity.It was unforgettable, the faces of all of those young people, no longer only puppets of the market, fighting injustice and making the future. If they ask what we want, say: only the future."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/185f5d8db953310dfe67c12c02bb603aa52857d4/0_82_6016_3609/master/6016.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=73324e3e9ce732d0ca334990b68f2a03","title":"tell us how do you feel about cinemas museums and galleries reopening","story":"We’d like to hear your thoughts about returning to cultural venues in England after the coronavirus lockdown Cinemas, museums and art galleries in England will be able to re-open on 4 July after the easing of lockdown rules.Theatres and concert halls can also open their doors again, but only to show previous works on a screen.

Along with one oriental cuckoo and three other common cuckoos, each fitted with a tiny tracking device, he was about to embark on an epic journey to southern Africa.Last month, he was the only bird to return safely with his tracker intact.Onon has not only amazed conservationists, but gripped social media across the globe. As coronavirus lockdowns brought the world to a virtual standstill, fans followed online updates from the Mongolia Cuckoo Project, watching in awe as Onon cruised across oceans and made 27 border crossings in 16 countries.He returned on 27 May, having become a media celebrity in India, Kenya and Sweden. Back in Mongolia, he appeared on television and made newspaper headlines.Researchers are now studying data from his journey for clues about why cuckoos travel as far as they do, and how they might be affected by the climate crisis.Hewson, who worked on the project with the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, admits he did not believe cuckoos were such proficient migrators. “Although they’ve got nice long wings, when they’re flying around the breeding site they look slightly ungainly compared to the other birds,” he says. In fact, cuckoos such as Onon, which migrate in search of caterpillars, their favourite food, travel remarkably fast, he adds. Using tailwinds, they can motor for more than 1,000km a day for a week.Caterpillars are most common in places that are sunny and wet and so, in summer, there are plenty in the Khurkh valley, in the south-east of the Khentii mountain range. As the weather changes they go to India for monsoon season, and then, as the wind changes, to east Africa.It’s not an easy journey. The four other birds that set off at the same time as Onon did not make it back. Their fate is unknown – their trackers may have failed or they may have died. One of them, Bayan, is thought to have died in Yunnan province, China, after flying 7,200km in just seven days from Somalia.As researchers compare the flight paths of cuckoos from across Asia, they are exploring why Onon and his peers choose such epic journeys. They could potentially winter in Asia or Australasia south of the equator, but they don’t, says Hewson. “Probably partly because the presence of a competitor species, the oriental cuckoo, makes this less profitable than it would otherwise be.” The very long journey is perhaps easier than it might appear because there’s such an abundant supply of caterpillars on route, he adds. “If you’re finding food when you get there, it’s not such a costly thing to do in terms of energy.” This raises questions over how the cuckoos might manage if global heating or other threats affect the availability of food.“If their stopover sites get lost they will be in big trouble,” says Nyambayar Batbayar, of the Wildlife Science and Conservation Center of Mongolia, who said the project had raised awareness of the need to protect key flyways and the areas where the birds rest and eat. In Mongolia, schools in Khentii province have taken part in the project, helping to name the birds and closely following their journeys.Onon, named after a local river, has also attracted lots of attention among social media users in India, said Terry Townshend, who documented the cuckoos’ journeys through the website and Twitter account Birding Beijing.Twitter followers bombarded the site with questions about the journeys: “Can the cuckoos stop on water?” (they can only pause during ocean crossings if there’s an island) and “How long do they stop for?”(anything from a few hours to a few days).Back in the lush hills and wheat fields of the Khurkh valley, Onon is getting on with life. “He has no time to waste as he needs to set up his territory, defend it from competing males and mate with as many females as possible!” the Mongolia Cuckoo Project has informed his fans.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c8ada7d5ea61892d28d98f90109c2cdcfb26f6bf/0_68_2097_1258/master/2097.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=519f476d3749ad2558aefb15bd9e7f72","title":"leading scientist criticises uk over its climate record","story":"Rapid transformation needed, Kevin Anderson says, particularly in lifestyles of richKevin Anderson, one of the world’s leading climate scientists, had a familiar reaction to the latest report from the government’s climate advisers, which was published this week.The 196-page document by the Committee on Climate Change delivered a stinging rebuke of the government’s record and said ministers must urgently up their game if the UK is to avoid a significant rebound in carbon emissions after the coronavirus crisis and meet its 2050 net zero carbon target.Anderson is a professor of energy and climate change, working across the universities of Manchester, Uppsala in Sweden and Bergen in Norway. He said: “The constructive, meticulous criticism of the government, which is failing abysmally by any measure, is fine. The problem is the framing the CCC has for net zero is already far removed from what is needed to meet our Paris commitments.”Anderson’s latest research argues the UK’s planned reductions in emissions, even if it hits net zero by 2050, would be two or three times greater than its fair share under the landmark 2015 Paris agreement, where countries agreed to hold global increases in temperature to “well below 2°C  and to pursue 1.5°C.”“Academics have done an excellent job in understanding and communicating climate science, but the same cannot be said in relation to reducing emissions,” said Anderson. “Here we have collectively denied the necessary scale of mitigation, running scared of calling for fundamental changes to both our energy system and the lifestyles of high-energy users. Our paper brings this failure into sharp focus.”Shortly after the study was published, Anderson posted a warning on Twitter about what he described as a cosy consensus between senior academics, journalists and government scientists, who were unwilling to publicly acknowledge the urgent system-level transformation required to tackle the climate crisis.He said: “Many senior academics, senior policymakers, basically the great and good of the climate world have decided that it is unhelpful to rock the status quo boat and therefore choose to work within that political paradigm – they’ll push it as hard as they think it can go, but they repeatedly step back from questioning the paradigm itself.”Anderson, who travels between his three universities by “long, slow train” and last took an airline flight in 2004, says that such “mitigation denial” stems from the “fundamental failure” of the academic community to be honest about the implications of its research. This has potentially devastating consequences for the future, he said.“On mitigation, the academic community and the CCC have collectively failed the political realm and civil society by tailoring our conclusions to fit with what we judge to be politically palatable – all at the expense of scientific integrity.”Chris Stark, chief executive of the CCC, defended the logic behind its 2050 target, which he said was based on “detailed considerations of the climate science, based on the IPCC’s work, the international context, including the Paris agreement and ‘equity’ considerations, and the feasible speed and cost at which UK emissions can be reduced”.Stark added: “Our recommendations reflect a consideration of all of these issues and are designed to best support the required increase in global effort. It continues to be the CCC’s view that this is the right target for the UK, but we welcome new evidence and we will review new studies as we develop our advice on the sixth carbon budget for the end of this year.”However, Anderson said too many models for tackling climate change relied on “unproven technologies far in future,” such as carbon capture and storage. “Perhaps we’ll be lucky and they will work at huge planetary scale – but it’s one hell of a gamble.”He said the models also ignored the fact that it was the lifestyles of a relatively wealthy few that give rise to the lions’ share of emissions.“If we were serious about this crisis we could do this in a year – if we were really serious we could do it in a month, but we are not and our emissions just keep rising.”In his latest report, published in the journal Climate Policy last month, Anderson and his colleagues argue that after “thirty years of failure” to control growing emissions, a fundamental reframing was required.But he insisted that this did not mean a complete upheaval in how most people live their lives, even in the UK.“Yes, some changes will be needed, but for the majority of people the solutions to this crisis will also improve their lives – long-term job prospects for them and their children, better house quality, better access and more affordable public transport.”However, for wealthy high emitters it would mean fundamental change.“The very wealthy amongst us, senior academics and professors included, will have to make profound changes to our high-emitting lifestyles. We recycle and often live in relatively efficient homes, but they’re typically big homes and sometimes we have two or more of them.“Many of us are frequent fliers, we drive long distances in big cars, buy a lot equipment, have fridge-freezers the size of a small terrace house - every facet of our lives, although normalised by us, is central to our nation’s high emissions. But the models are unwilling to accept this – preferring to pass the buck onto our children in the form of future technical silver bullets.”Anderson said that the UK’s use of energy should be zero carbon by 2035 rather than net zero by 2050 – a move that would “require a fundamental re-evaluation of economic assumptions around growth value and progress.”He said the scale and timeframe of transformation required would be bigger than that of Roosevelt’s New Deal or the Marshall plan to reconstruct Europe after the second world war.“Many say that such rapid and deep change is unrealistic – but it’s much more realistic than believing a fair and progressive society can survive with 3, 4 or even 5C (41F) of warming,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cd6a52f24ee5615301084259469426f361f7a360/0_93_1400_840/master/1400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9b261b6bec8c017c37ce681eba8ff2fc","title":"no small matter film education america","story":"Research has repeatedly shown that investment in a child’s first five years can determine life chances. So why is it so hard for so many families to access?Maria Hernandez, a single mother of four in Waco, Texas, ferries her children to school in between two job shifts, midnight to 6am, and 8am to 5pm. Shannon and Donnie Poff, parents to a four-year-old son in Henderson, Nevada, split childcare between staggered work shifts – Shannon as a nail technician during the day, Donnie as a security guard during the graveyard hours. Wahnika Johnson took time off work to care for her seven-month-old daughter in Yorktown, Virginia, but worries about finding any affordable childcare once she returns. All three families – black, white, Hiic, middle- and working-class, three different states – require childcare to stay afloat. And as depicted in the documentary No Small Matter, all three are cast adrift among a sea of challenges – access, cost, lack of quality options – in the decentralized and devalued Wild West of early childhood education in the US.No Small Matter, a 74-minute film directed by Danny Alpert, Greg Jacobs and Jon Siskel and narrated by executive producer Alfre Woodard, examines the frustrating state of early childhood education in the United States, a country with no universal pre-kindergarten system. The film endeavors to be “not an exposé, but a wake-up call” to the recognize the bedrock importance of education in the first five years of life to opportunities down the road, and reprioritize the country’s spending therein the educational landscape it reveals is rife with access sinkholes compounding systemic inequity and at odds with decades of research on child brain development, the established pay-offs of early childhood investment, and the serious, studied work of pre-school educators.Early childhood education is “the foundation of our future”, Dr Rosemarie Truglio, the senior vice-president for curriculum and content at Sesame Workshop and featured expert, told the . “We now know so much about how these early years are critical foundational years. We know that their brain is developing at a very rapid pace, and we know that parent-child, adult-child interactions are critical in developing these neural connections.” Truglio, who received a doctorate in developmental psychology, has spent over two decades developing programming for Sesame Street built on the explosion research into infant and toddler brains.Engagement and stimulation in those early years are critical for so-called “executive function skills” – practice in delayed gratification, focusing and shifting attention, managing emotions, listening – that are crucial to stability in later life. “Without these processing skills,” said Truglio, “it’s hard for me to reach and to teach your child in the classroom,” no matter the academic setting once children enter America’s education system in kindergarten, usually around five.In some cases, a patchwork of federal grants such as Head Start, subsidies for early childhood education from the US military, or community organizations such as Avance, which works with ESL families such as Hernandez’s in Waco, can fill in the gaps. But many children slip through, and enter the formal education system with the deck already stacked against them. The gap often compounds with time by three, as Woodard explains in No Small Matter, children from low-income families have heard an average of 30 million fewer words than higher-income peers. Thousands of extra dollars on enrichment activities such as museums, pre-school programs and educational materials means that by the first day of kindergarten, higher-income kids are already as much as two years ahead in language development. A gap in opportunity at an early age solidifies into an achievement chasm a low-income fourth-grader who’s already behind in reading is 13 times more likely to drop out of high school kids who drop out of high school are more likely to be incarcerated.“You can make an honest argument that keeping kids in school is grassroots crime prevention,” John Wetzel, the secretary of the Pennsylvania department of corrections, says in the film. “True criminal justice reform is investing in early childhood education.”Part of that investment, the film argues, is valuing the profession of early childhood educators as rigorous and important, rather than as glorified babysitters. Early childhood educators such as Rachel Giannini, a pre-school teacher from Chicago, Illinois featured in the film, make less per year on average than parking attendants or dog walkers. Giannini, bubbly and preternaturally at ease in the classroom, works a second job as a bartender and was still forced to leave teaching one of her colleagues breaks down in an interview explaining how she can’t achieve financial stability or move out of her parents’ house due to the low salary. “It’s like you don’t matter,” she says. The barely passable pay (according to Glassdoor, the average for pre-school teachers in Chicago is less than $29,000) “devalues the profession, it devalues the time that these kids have here.”The systemically low compensation for teachers is “criminal,” said Truglio. “You’re giving these teachers your most precious resource – your child – and we as a country are giving our children to these teachers and we don’t treat these teachers with respect and pay that they could actually have a career in education.”The often prohibitive bar of low compensation is one symptom of a larger cultural misunderstanding about the importance of upfront investment in early childhood education, Truglio and several experts in the film argue. “People think, ‘Oh, they’re just kids, they’re just going to play, why do we need to put all this money in?’” Truglio said. As pointed out repeatedly by activists in the weeks of protests against police brutality and anti-black racism since George Floyd’s killing by Minneapolis police last month, America invests heavily in punishment – policing, courts, incarceration. From community to city to state, it spends comparatively little on education, especially in the first five years.“It takes leadership and policy makers to put this first and decide that they should make this investment,” she added, “because it’s an investment in our future.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/46b0a32068157d67249b571dd9ba27182b4f4532/0_69_2000_1199/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a6b94c13e79080bcc557b80c97353e37","title":"share your best and worst lockdown baking experiences","story":"Have you been baking up a storm during the pandemic?

The danger is to become numb to such relentlessness, to think it is normal. It is not, not even as football’s self‑destructive economics stretch the gap from the top of the table to the bottom.The days since the restart have offered a reminder of how good City are with the ball, even if their defensive fallibility was clear at Chelsea on Thursday. Liverpool have not streaked away from a league of mediocrities. City remain a formidable side capable of idiosyncratically brilliant football. The temptation would be to suggest Klopp’s football has superseded that of Pep Guardiola, that the great tactical wheel has turned again, but it’s nowhere near so straightforward.Guardiola’s Barcelona presented the world with a level of possession football that had never been seen (in part taking advantage of a changing environment with better pitches and equipment, a crackdown on intimidatory fouling and a new interpretation of the offside law that increased the effective playing area).That set the rest of football a problem. You could try to copy the Barcelona approach, although without the traditions of La Masia, or you could try to challenge it. In essence, then, the question was simple: they have lots of the ball what is the best way to get it back? The answer to that isn’t complex, although the theory is extremely difficult to put into practice: you press.Even by 2010, it had become apparent there were two ways to take on Barça. Opponents either sat deep, went into the bunker and tried to restrict the number and quality of chances Barça had (as Internazionale and Chelsea did in the 2010 and 2012 Champions League semi-finals) or they pressed high and tried to disrupt Barça’s possession at source.It is a high-risk approach but it is also the one Klopp saw as being at least to an extent controllable. As he has said, sitting deep against a Guardiola side is essentially hoping to win a lottery in that it accepts them having a (significantly) greater number of chances and relies on them failing to take advantage.Tactical evolution can be understood as a series of interlocking dialectics: proactivity against reactivity, art against pragmatism, iniduality against the team. The most relevant here is technique against physique. Guardiola’s Barcelona were so technically good that it did not matter their five most advanced players had an average height of 5ft 6½in bigger teams couldn’t get close enough to take advantage. The challenge was to devise a way of pressing that was so good that bigger and more aggressive players could bring their physical advantages to the battle. That has been the underlying logic of tactical development over the past decade.In the broadest terms, football – and Liverpool – have been here before. As the 60s yielded to the 70s, total football supplanted catenaccio, hard pressing and attacking displacing man-marking and caution. But then total football mutated. The German model, as practised by the national side, Bayern Munich and Borussia Mönchengladbach, was still about possession and the interchange of positions but it lost the pressing element that had made the Dutch school so radical. It was then overwhelmed in the late 70s by the pragmatic pressing of Liverpool and Nottingham Forest, technically accomplished sides who overpowered opponents but were also extremely defensively capable.In that regard a comment Klopp made after a diligent Bayern had held them to a 0-0 draw at Anfield in February last season seems significant. “Something,” he said, “changed in the world of football – everyone adapted to it and we have to make sure we adapt.” He was talking about the largely forgotten art of defending. City have scored seven more league goals than Liverpool this season but, vitally, Liverpool have conceded 12 fewer.But of course it is nothing like as simple as a recapitulation of the pattern of 40 years ago, or of Klopp seeking a solution to the challenge set by Guardiola and finding it this season. For one thing, Guardiola has evolved after leaving the microclimate of the Camp Nou. He changed in Germany and his football at City, particularly in his second and third seasons in the job, showed further shifts away from the Barcelona model to something (relatively) more direct.Last season there was a hair’s breadth between them (or rather 11.7mm). This season City have faltered, largely it seems because of failures of defensive recruitment. The verdict of the court of arbitration for sport has the potential to inflict serious damage on the club but if City’s appeal is upheld – and quite possibly even if it is not – there is no reason to assume Liverpool will necessarily win a race against City next season, particularly given the front three are all 28 and some sort of transition will have to begin at some point. There cannot be an assumption that Klopp has found a tactical formula that will dominate Guardiola in perpetuity.Klopp’s pressing, well-organised and relentless as it is, clearly causes City problems, which is why he has by far the best head-to-head record against Guardiola of any manager who has faced him a meaningful number of times, but the idea that his style has surpassed Guardiola’s is misleading. Rather, Liverpool have come to play a form of football that has repeatedly challenged City’s and this season outstripped them, while influencing an evolution Guardiola was already undergoing.Guardiola a decade ago established a hegemonic style of possess and press. What Klopp has done is to emphasise the pressing aspect, to shift the balance from technique back towards physique."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/54610daad5a668134f00fd02fab8e43c0ee39555/1_74_3499_2100/master/3499.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8d44577c9be3643c3fed8f1e07b50276","title":"inter close to signing achraf hakimi from real madrid for 40m","story":"Inter are close to signing Achraf Hakimi from Real Madrid for about €40m (£35.8m) plus add-ons.

Bottom of the Premier League, any hopes of achieving their manager Daniel Farke’s “little miracle” and escaping the drop appear to have been undone after defeats by Southampton and Everton. According to their captain, Timm Klose, however, there is some good news: it’s Manchester United in the FA Cup next.Klose is talking via videolink from his sitting room, half his long face cropped out by the camera. The Switzerland international, 32, was signed to keep Norwich in the Premier League the last time they were in the top flight in 2016. After an impressive opening spell, however, he got injured and the Canaries’s form went with him as they succumbed to relegation. It took three years to return and Klose had not played a league games this season because of a knee injury before the pandemic struck.“It was hard in the first game. When you hear yourself in the stadium it’s weird you know? I can actually talk to the guy on the other side of the pitch, which was never the case before. You have to get used to it but I feel a bit like I’m back to youth football again, which is actually lovely. I have some great memories from youth football.”“I think nowadays the mental aspect in football is so important. Because of social media everyone can go anonymous and write whatever they want call you a bad player: ‘You can’t play for this club, get out of the club.’ But I’ve tried to stay the same all the time. If you win games or lose games, you have to look at yourself. You have to be critical with yourself, you have to see what you can do better. It’s only if you accept that, if you accept your mistakes, that you can get better.”Klose was part of the Project Restart discussions in his role as Norwich’s PFA representative. He admits to some scepticism about the return, but also acknowledges the factors that made it necessary. He is less understanding, however, about the role government played.“I was a bit frustrated in that situation. I thought as well that the Premier League and PFA didn’t protect us that well maybe in public. But I think as players we came together and we did a great job. Jordan Henderson and Troy Deeney and all those players who are long in the Premier League. We didn’t lose our cool, we stayed as calm as possible and every club found a solution in the end.”As for the restart itself, he has understandable concerns over the compressed calendar. “If it was me I would made it so we had more breaks between the games. I mean I get the money side of it, don’t get me wrong. I’m happy that a club like Norwich said you don’t need to have pay cuts. I totally get that and I understand it. But maybe we should have thought how that whole situation could influence the health of the players. I don’t think there is a right thing to do or a wrong thing to do, but I am 32 now so obviously i am thinking more about health. I want to stay fit and I want to make sure that I can use my legs after my career, for my kids.”Thanks to an injury list that has meant Farke has never once had a complete set of defenders to call on, Norwich have only two centre halves-fit for the remainder of the restart. Klose will be needed for every remaining match, starting with taking on the pace of Rashford, Martial, James and co.“I mean I love it …” he says of the prospect. “I couldn’t wish for a better scenario. Obviously it would have been better to have been eased into the situation but I love to play football. That’s something you learn in rehab as well. At the start you are angry and you think everyone and everything is against you. Once you get close to the team again, close to training you start to love the game again. I’m looking forward to playing all the games. If my body is up to it, we will see.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b92f60690fb753c946742bdcdf5d7bb7214d2d39/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=652c143bb6b7c419a6f26335efe1e43e","title":"trust patience and hard work how jurgen klopp transformed liverpool","story":"The German was not under pressure to win titles when he arrived at Anfield in 2015 so he set about his own Project Restart. This is how he did it …Finally. An interminable wait stretching 30 years plus one lockdown is over and Jürgen Klopp stands alongside Bob Paisley and Joe Fagan as an immortal who made Liverpool champions of England and Europe. There is no asterisk attached. Liverpool’s 19th title may have arrived with the Kop eerily silent but it was a resounding triumph for a dominant, record-demolishing side.“I am not the guy who is going to shout: ‘We are going to conquer the world!’” said Klopp at his unveiling. Yet that is precisely what the 53-year-old from the small Black Forest town of Glatten has achieved. This is the story of his own Project Restart …When they’re sitting around that table to appoint a manager, do they say: ‘He can be part of the committee?’ That’s wrong, and I don’t think Jürgen will accept that. Sir Alex Ferguson, October 2015The former Manchester United manager was right to worry about Klopp revitalising his old adversaries but wrong about how he would put Liverpool back on their perch. A paradox of Liverpool’s rise to European, world and English champions inside 13 extraordinary months - it could have been 10 but for lockdown – is that it has been accomplished by a manager wielding greater authority than many predecessors, yet who delegates and defers like few others before him.In a world that increasingly shuns experts Klopp embraces them and not only physically. Whether tempting renowned backroom staff from Bayern Munich – the head of fitness and conditioning, Andreas Kornmayer, and the head of nutrition, Mona Nemmer – or appointing a throw-in coach, Thomas Grønnemark, having researched the Dane’s world-record throw on Google, Klopp has shown an effective leader does not have to be an autocrat in the modern game. “You cannot have enough specialists around you,” he said when explaining Grønnemark’s appointment in 2018. “I must always be the guy who makes the decisions on when we use all these specialists but you cannot have enough.”His willingness to defer to the sporting director, Michael Edwards, on transfers, however, lies at the heart of Liverpool’s renaissance. The club’s “transfer committee” was synonymous with waste and drift before Klopp’s arrival. It still exists, with many of its members overseeing recruitment at Anfield, only now it delivers thanks to the manager’s receptiveness towards others and without the unofficial title that once dogged it.Klopp’s office sits opposite Edwards’ at Melwood. It is located where Gérard Houllier envisaged it should be when the training ground was redeveloped in 2001, looking down on the first-team pitches. That panoramic view has been incorporated into the new £50m training complex under construction in Kirkby, incidentally. The Melwood offices are roughly 10ft apart and the carpet between them well-worn. Klopp can be regularly found in Edwards’ office, feet on desk and planning the next step. The scene is in stark contrast to when Brendan Rodgers was in situ and pushing to sign a striker who never suited Liverpool’s style, Christian Benteke, one month after Edwards and co had landed what should have been the perfect one, Roberto Firmino.Rodgers’ use of Firmino, often on the left or on the bench, bewilders to this day but the summer of 2015 encapsulates perfectly the top-level dysfunction that held back Liverpool for so long. “Players the club brought in” was Rodgers’ way of stressing he was not entirely responsible for signings. Nor is Klopp, although he dismissed the notion he could not work within Fenway Sports Group’s preferred structure on day one. “For me it is enough to have the first and the last word, the middle we can discuss,” he said. “I am not a genius. I don’t know more than the rest of the world. I need other people to get perfect information.”In Edwards, Klopp realised quickly he had that source. The Liverpool manager’s tactical vision was clear but he needed others with inside knowledge of the transfer market to find the suitable parts. Sadio Mané, acquired during Klopp’s first summer, started a pattern of supreme talent identification that has underpinned Liverpool’s rise to champions the key change overall. Klopp ranks the decision to not sign Mané from Red Bull Salzburg among his biggest mistakes at Borussia Dortmund, yet righting that wrong with Liverpool was not the obvious move it now looks. Mané was inconsistent at Southampton and unproven at the highest level. Liverpool, sensitive to accusations of paying inflated prices, insisted the fee was £30m. Southampton maintained it was £34m, correctly.Twelve months later, with Edwards promoted from technical director to Liverpool’s first sporting director, a role Klopp had worked alongside for 14 years in Germany, Mohamed Salah arrived for the same price from Roma. Liverpool scouts including Dave Fallows and Barry Hunter had tracked the Egypt attacker since his emergence at Basel but there was no guarantee a player who struggled at Chelsea would flourish in English football. At least not to the phenomenal extent he has. Georginio Wijnaldum had impressed in patches at Newcastle. Andy Robertson had just been relegated with Hull when Liverpool paid £8m for an uncut diamond of a left-back. In 2018 Liverpool had the market to themselves for Fabinho, despite Manchester City being in the market for a holding midfielder and missing out on Jorginho. Liverpool, under Edwards, have pursued the right players for Klopp’s system, not necessarily the biggest names.Virgil van Dijk was the £75m exception in January 2018, accompanied by the £65m capture of Alisson six months later. Transformational signings who rectified longstanding flaws in an instant and elevated the entire team, the pair represented a fundamental shift in Klopp’s approach. Eighteen months earlier he had lamented football’s flawed economics as Manchester United negotiated an £89m deal for Paul Pogba. “I would even do it differently if I could spend that money,” he said. “The day that this is football, I’m not in a job any more.”Neymar’s £198m move to Paris Saint-Germain gave Klopp an excuse for his sea change. He employed it occasionally but was also honest enough to admit: “That’s the problem these days, whatever bullshit you say nobody will forget it.” The Van Dijk deal was controversial – with Southampton accusing Liverpool of an illegal approach and refusing to sell in the summer of 2017 – and ultimately a reward for patience. Klopp declined to look elsewhere for the centre-half he desperately needed and held out for his first choice. He also stood firm on a conviction there was only one goalkeeper to improve Liverpool when Roma, stung by the Salah fee, initially quoted £90m for Alisson.Pre- and post-Van Dijk, Klopp has kept a pathway open for Liverpool’s brightest academy talent. The manager dismissed Nathaniel Clyne’s claims at right-back early in his reign but did not sign a replacement on account of Trent Alexander-Arnold emerging through the ranks. The homegrown youngster struggled in the senior squad at first but, once called up, he was there to stay. Klopp wanted time to work on Alexander-Arnold’s technical ability and believed a similar full-back on the opposite flank would be ideal for his system. Enter Robertson, also beneath the required level on arrival but another who Klopp felt would develop on the training ground. In many respects, and with the exceptions of Alisson and Van Dijk, Liverpool are a side of slow-burners, Firmino and Fabinho among them.Klopp has been repaid handsomely for last summer’s assessment that this squad had more to give. He could have built from a position of strength having guided Liverpool to their sixth European Cup and the first trophy of his reign after several near-misses. Instead, he did not make one outfield signing. There has been only one in the last three transfer windows – Takumi Minamino for the cut-price release clause of £7.25m in January. The Dortmund left-back Raphaël Guerreiro was considered and attainable last summer but Klopp, Edwards and the FSG president, Mike Gordon, opted against paying a sizeable sum for a player to serve as back-up to Robertson.They favoured stability plus the occasional major signing who could make a telling difference. The latter ambition has been affected by the ravaging effects of coronavirus on football’s finances. Timo Werner and the £53m release clause in his Leipzig contract long appealed to the Liverpool hierarchy. The striker favoured a move to Anfield but the pandemic has prompted a rethink at a club faced with an annual wage bill in excess of £300m and, according to the chief executive, Peter Moore, “unprecedented operating losses”.The anticipated postponement of the Africa Cup of Nations, which threatened to occupy Mané and Salah for up to six weeks next season, would ease pressure for quality cover in the short term. With the title wrapped up Klopp has the luxury to rotate before the new campaign while City are occupied with the Champions League. Liverpool’s dominance strengthens the conviction Premier League titles can become the new normal at Anfield.He’s your friend but he’s not your best friend. Dejan Lovren, November 2015The throwaway line from the Croatia international was delivered weeks into Klopp’s reign and summed up the dynamic between the charismatic manager and his players. Their relationship has developed over time and changes in personnel but it underpinned the sense of unity during lockdown and is fundamental to the achievements Anfield revels in today. Lovren was speaking with respect for a manager who had earned plenty at Dortmund. Klopp was in command from day one. Players know there is a line that should not be crossed, although the manager has adapted to their needs at important moments. Hugs and belly laughs alone do not make Klopp an ideal manager for the modern footballer. His public persona projects an image that is partially true and overshadows the meticulous approach and training-ground graft that have made Liverpool such a force.To Klopp the training ground is sacred. Respecting Melwood as a place of work is his absolute rule. There is no leeway on that instruction, a point he enforced by banning impromptu visits from wives and partners, agents and hangers-on as soon as he arrived. Family members and representatives now make appointments. Some rules are more flexible. There is no smoking inside Melwood, obviously, so Klopp goes outside on to a first-floor balcony at the back for a sneaky fag whenever the craving overrides his persistent attempts to quit. Well, he is the boss.Another change introduced at the start was more and later training sessions. Sessions corresponded with the kick-off time of the next game, the amount of time off was drastically reduced and training was unremittingly intensive. The template had served Klopp well in Germany but Liverpool players complained about the impact on family life. Several were unhappy at missing the school run and having to make alternative arrangements. Others claimed the demands contributed to the downturn in results that Liverpool suffered during Klopp’s first few winters. The manager accepted the feedback and, with this coupled with his shock at the fixture schedule in England, tailored training routines, their intensity and times accordingly.Before lockdown imposed its unforeseen break Liverpool’s players had been given more time off in the last two fruitful seasons than previously under Klopp, who still oversees every training session. This season Liverpool have also travelled to several away matches on the day, rather than staying in a hotel overnight. Leicester on Boxing Day was one. Having just won the Club World Cup in Qatar, Klopp felt his weary players deserved Christmas Day at home. He was repaid with arguably Liverpool’s finest performance of the season in the 4-0 win. A huge moment.Klopp took a stand against the fixture schedule when he refused to select any senior players for the FA Cup fourth-round replay against Shrewsbury. But there was another factor at play in that decision. He had promised the first-team squad a genuine mid-season break and they responded with a winning streak that included hard-fought victories over Tottenham, Manchester United and Wolves. When the Cup replay clashed, the manager felt he could not go back on his word. The decision was universally appreciated inside a dressing room who know Klopp has their backs.Supporting players under pressure, whether in word at a press conference or in deed by keeping them in the squad, ignoring outside influences or the temptation for a quick transfer fix are other attributes that have fostered unity. It is not done for effect. Klopp has never deviated from his core philosophy that players can always be improved through coaching. There are very few exceptions to that principle within the Liverpool squad. There are also few examples of players betraying Klopp’s trust with breaches of discipline, surprisingly few given the intense scrutiny on the club and the strong characters within it. Perhaps Mamadou Sakho provided a salutary lesson.The France centre-back missed the 2016 Europa League final defeat by Sevilla as a consequence of a Uefa doping charge that was later dropped. He was sent home from Liverpool’s tour of the United States that summer after almost missing the flight out, missing a recovery session and turning up late for a team meal. He aired frustration at being sidelined the following season on Snapchat. Klopp called a team meeting at which Sakho was present to declare he would not tolerate dissent on social media. The defender was banished from the first-team squad, made to train with academy players and joined Crystal Palace, initially on loan, four months later. There have been no public falling-outs on that scale in the intervening three years a reflection of the personalities that have come into the club as much as the manager’s disciplinary code. Players adhere to the manager’s insistence that the team come first and there are no allowances for star names.Klopp delegates the running of the Liverpool dressing room to Jordan Henderson, James Milner, Van Dijk and Wijnaldum. He keeps a distance from the players’ inner sanctum and allows senior players to resolve any trivial internal matters. He knows he can trust that group to uphold standards and, in Henderson, Liverpool have a selfless but demanding captain. The midfielder banned title talk among the squad until the feat was accomplished. His influence enables Klopp to take a step back. Not that there is an impenetrable barrier between players and manager.Klopp is reminded of a player’s birthday in order to congratulate them on the day, usually in front of their teammates on the training pitch. He is also informed of any serious problems that affect his squad, such as family illness, and will have a private word. There is a lightness to the working day at Melwood. Klopp has interests beyond football and two sons who keep him up to speed with social media and life for a younger generation. His world view, shaped by the experience of becoming a father at 20 while studying at university, working in a warehouse at night and trying to make it as a player, means conversation around the dinner tables at Melwood is not limited to football. He gave journalists travelling to cover a game in Munich a list of the best beer halls to visit. The instructions were followed with almost religious devotion.Liverpool’s title triumph reflects Klopp’s ability to connect with players. His team have dominated with a relatively settled first-choice XI, give or take rotation in midfield and changes forced by injury, but the entire squad has made an impact. There has been no public clamour to leave from established internationals deprived of playing time. Winning helps appease everyone and, though Xherdan Shaqiri could have gone in January had Klopp given the green light, the manager has kept everyone onside.Milner, Divock Origi, Adam Lallana, Lovren and Joël Matip have made valuable contributions. Lallana was assured his patience would be rewarded with a starting role against Everton in the FA Cup. Some senior professionals might have sulked at the thought of carrying academy players Lallana led by example and Klopp doffed his baseball cap to the 32-year-old as he left the pitch victorious. Everyone has felt part of this historic campaign.When Klopp interrupted his sabbatical to take the Liverpool job it was a personal opinion that, for once, the manager had taken a bigger risk with the appointment than the club. His stock was considerably higher than the team’s in October 2015. It goes without saying Klopp’s judgment was correct: Liverpool was the right place at the right time. Managers who prefer to develop winners and a winning mentality rarely get the time at a global giant but Liverpool’s position among the elite of English and European football had gone when Klopp was approached by FSG. He was granted patience as a result and, though progress has always been evident to those who follow Klopp’s team, there was no internal pressure on the manager during his first three trophy-less campaigns. His reconstruction of the team also coincided perfectly with the rebuilding of the club.The lucky bastard Klopp was referring to is himself. The admission came at the grand opening of Anfield’s £114m main stand at the start of his first full season in charge. Anfield had felt a lonely place to Klopp when fans filed out of the ground before the end of a defeat by Crystal Palace in his fourth home game. It has been re-energised since the redevelopment and not only owing to the presence of an extra 10,000 supporters. Klopp’s responsibility, he said when the main stand opened, was to “fill it with life”.The painful irony of winning the title without a crowd is lost on no one at Liverpool but the extent to which Klopp’s team have delivered is phenomenal. A season-ticket holder will have witnessed 56 victories, 14 draws and two defeats in the four Premier League seasons since the stadium entered the 21st century and FSG resolved decades of controversy and heartache over Anfield’s future. A pandemic has deprived them of more, as well as the long-awaited opportunity to celebrate as champions should.These unprecedented times have also greatly affected the finances of a club that recorded a £19.8m loss in the year before the main stand was rebuilt but profits of £42m and £125m in the two most recent financial years. That money had been reinvested in Klopp’s squad and infrastructure before Covid-19 struck. Although plans to increase Anfield’s capacity above 61,000 with a redeveloped Anfield Road stand have been postponed for 12 months, and uncertainty stalks football’s landscape, the foundations are in place for continued dominance from Klopp’s side.That is for tomorrow. Today is not how any Liverpool fan could possibly have imagined but it is the moment they have craved for 30 years all the same."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a67ecad77cdc35ed577ea2ce0ff17d6eb9c22ed5/0_39_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=10c1922d4e121ac1fe4a66e34990d6e8","title":"liverpool win the premier league title live reaction","story":"Liverpool is a city that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and local government budget cuts, but today is a celebration - even for some Evertonians. Helen Pidd has been out to capture the mood:Liverpool fans have been out and about around Anfield today, although thankfully in smaller, better distanced numbers than last night. One such fan was Jean Smith, who demonstrated a decent first touch in a kickabout with her grandson.Klopp mentioned changing his team every year, and Liverpool fan Ben Sanders has some thoughts:“We need several players. We’ve romped to the league, but our squad’s thin and our performance in the cups has been disappointing. We badly need a creative attacking midfielder (no, not Coutinho). Firmino and Salah need competition, Origi isn’t good enough and the jury’s out on Minamino. Someone like Adama Traoré would be fantastic.“I think we’ve got enough quality in our academy to cover our defence, especially if Neco Williams is able to fill in at left-back. Will we actually sign anyone? I expect at least one arrival, but I don’t expect a net spend of more than £20m.”Afternoon, everyone. Here are some more choice quotes from Jurgen Klopp, taken at today’s press conference:I am happy. Really happy. Relieved. Last night I was overwhelmed obviously, but it’s a very good moment in my life. It’s a mix of everything. I know it is a really big achievement, and it was an incredible ride to get here.I called my family 10 seconds before the final whistle. We had a Facetime call. I told them I loved them, they told me they loved me. All the other messages, maybe I should use this opportunity to say sorry I cannot answer all of them, but I will read all of them.You have to change each year, bring new things, that’s how it is. A season is really long, you need to be lucky in some moments, especially with injuries, so you can never be sure but I knew we would become a really good football team.We have a lot of really good players, world-class players but other clubs do too. The consistency comes from buying into the idea: attitude, personality, character and that is what makes this group so special. If we stay humble we have a good chance to be successful in the future as well.That’s all from me. I’ll hand you over to Niall McVeigh, who is going to host the blog for the next couple of hours. You can email him here. Have a nice weekend, bye!“Dear Rob et al,” says Jamie. “I revelled in the Paisley era. Dalglish, Rush, Hansen, Neal, Thompson, Case, Bruce, and my hero (really) McDermott... it was astounding year after year. Paisley’s record was incredible and the dominant swagger, wow, just wow (hat tip to Ferg for eclipsing Paisley’s leagues). I worshipped the team in that 79-85 time. “But... this team... Klopp didn’t have to win to already be a hero, the way he conducts. There has never been a player as dominant as VVD, as cheeky as Mane, as cunning as TAA. There is just so much joy here. Of course we know these players do much more because of social media - but what better role models than Trent, Milner, Hendo, Mo, Sane, VVD and Klopp. “They’ve only won it once. But the effect on me, awe, pride, is already surprisingly greater than it was for seven-year-old me.”Liverpool have a week off before their trip to the Etihad, but there’s plenty of football this weekend. These are some of the big games:Comments aren’t open on this blog but you can join the debate below the line on Jonathan Wilson’s article. Based on some of the early comments, I wouldn’t bother.A question for the panel (that’s you, yes you ’mon, look lively) Where does this team sit in the Liverpool pantheon? I’d probably still have Bob Paisley’s first team at the top, because they retained both the league and the European Cup, but I’d certainly put Liverpool 2017-19 alongside 1981-84 and 1987-88.Here’s Jonathan Wilson on the tactics that enabled Liverpool to overcome Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. Tactical evolution can be understood as a series of interlocking dialectics: proactivity against reactivity, art against pragmatism, iniduality against the team. The most relevant here is technique against physique. Oh I sayIn other news“I moved to Manchester from Liverpool in the late 80s just as Liverpool FC were going off the boil,” writes Stuart Lea. “I’ve waited a long time for this and have taken a lot of stick. In sad times, a happy, happy day.”The afternoon-after thoughts of Jurgen KloppThe consistency the boys showed really is so exceptional that I cannot describe it and we will not stop. We really have to - and will - stay focused, we see the opportunity ... but that doesn’t mean we will win everything, we just want to improve.The other teams, they are really good already and will be better, City is absolutely exceptional. So, I cannot promise we will win everything but I can promise we will try everything to improve.The consistency is difficult to improve, if we can keep that level of consistency that would be already really nice. But we are in a good place, that is why we are here.”We knew, if you want to win the league it is pretty much not allowed to lose any game because City are usually not losing games. They never stop since Pep is there.We didn’t do more, we did it again. I am not sure it was possible to do more, from a training and intensity point of view, we were already squeezing everything out.The first thing we think about with Jurgen Klopp’s Liverpool is their exhilarating attacking play. But if you really want to tell the story of the Klopp years, you need to look at their defensive record.My colleague Paul Doyle, who reads football better than anyone I have ever met, said in the summer of 2017 that if Liverpool signed van Dijk they would eventually win the league. Doyle knows.“As a teen, I remember celebrating the Champions League final on a worn suede sofa at my mate’s house,” says Gregory Bott. “We all crowded round his old TV, and when the final whistle went, we shook up our beers and poured a bottle of lager over his Dad’s head, before running out into the streets, wild-eyed with glee. We didn’t know what to do with ourselves – we just wanted to be out and about, to feel the buzz, to meet strangers acting on the same impulse, scattering the dark with our sunbeam smiles... “Nowadays, I live away from the tribe, away from the city, hundreds of miles down South. But that connection is still there – it is urging me to come home, twanging like some long, unplayed chord. Other than absorbing every bit of media around this that I can, I am struggling to know exactly how to commemorate this momentous day. Any suggestions?” How close are you to Bournemouth beach?Another plug for our quiz on Liverpool’s glorious campaign. I got 1215 and I’m on about two hours’ sleep, so you should be aiming high.The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, has been talking about last night’s celebrations outside Anfield. People believe, wrongly, that we’re over the worst of the pandemic. “In the euphoria... people have decided to ignore advice, but it’s gone, it’s happened. We’ll have to see whether there’s a spike in coronavirus as a result of this. But if Chelsea or Manchester City had won the league, we would have seen the same scenes outside Stamford Bridge or the Etihad. We are where we are.It’s notable how little criticism there has been of the Liverpool fans who showed such contempt for social distancing with their celebrations last night. I’ll level with you: I can see both sides!“I don’t expect any major signings, but I think left-footed cover for Andy Robertson would be a good idea, and possibly quietly thanking Dejan Lovren, so perhaps a replacement centre back if there is no one suitable coming through,” says Andrew Parker. “Having said that in the 70s80s Liverpool often signed an up and coming player after winning the title to keep everyone on their toes.”That’s true, although squads were much smaller then so the psychology of a new signing for a bit different. Ki-Jana Hoever is a brilliant young centre-back, though he’s only 18. But again, I think there’s just about enough depth there – Van Dijk, Gomez and Matip as the main three, with cover from Hoever, Fabinho and Sepp van den Berg. The alarming thing for Liverpool’s rivals is that a) Jurgen Klopp is going nowhere for a while and b) they have four or five teenagers who look seriously good, so this success could well be sustainable.“Hi Rob,” says Marty Bull. “I don’t see any 1st IX transfers happening this window. They are all fantastic already. But there needs to be an injection of quality (and hunger) in the supporting cast - with Lallana, Lovren, Shaqiri, Clyne etc all likely moving on.”As Mike said, there are some extremely good youngsters. The only position where you are short of cover is left-back, and even then, Milner or Gomez can do a decent job. Maybe you need one more back-up forward as well, but you have decent cover in those positions: Minamino, Origi, Oxlade-Chamberlain, perhaps Wilson.There’s a lot of talk of Traore and, while the thought of him playing with the additional energy and power that Jurgen Klopp gives all his players is utterly terrifying, it’s hard to see how he would fit in. Why tinker with the best forward line in the world?“I can’t see the need to buy this window,” says Mike MacKenzie. “A fourth top striker would want more playing time than he’s likely to get barring injury. Same for any good LB to back up Andy. At other positions, there is enough talent in academy and soon-to-be ready-for-prime-time guys like Elliott, Jones \u0026amp Williams.”Yes, I agree. I suppose you could make a case for a centre back but I think Gomez and Matip are fine. Besides, you could play me alongside Virgil van Dijk and still keep a clean sheet most weeks.

Liverpool are the best team in the world but they’re not back on their perch. At least not yet.Liverpool looked tired in March but lockdown has refreshed them and, with no other distractions, you’d expect them to break the English top-flight records for points (100) and wins (32).Both those records were set by Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City.

In 1947, they beat fellow challengers Wolves in their final game of a weather-hit season. They were top, but had to wait a fortnight for Stoke City to finish their campaign. If Stoke won at Sheffield United, they’d be champions. But they’d preposterously sold star man Stanley Matthews during the run-in (!) and lost, so the title was Liverpool’s. They were told the news midway through a local-cup kickabout with Everton.

Uke Krasniqi, a diehard Liverpool supporter from Kosovo, now based in Vancouver, took Steven Gerrard’s infamous 2014 slip hard. “You never get over it, but you have to, that’s life, you have to move on.” Whether that philosophy strictly tallies with his subsequent pledge to never cut his hair again until Liverpool won the Premier League is perhaps a debate for another day. “I’ve been keeping my hair... I’ve been waiting for this moment. I said it: as long as it takes. I had a few disappointing moments but it seems that I’m finally there, it’s going to happen. Whenever I see Jordan Henderson lifting that trophy I will be cutting my hair.” There’s some video of him not cutting his hair yet here, if that’s not more than enough.Who doesn’t enjoy staring blankly at a list?

The organisation didn’t like itI was 22 when I moved to a different US city and needed a new yoga studio. I discovered a place that believed in eastern mysticism – perfect for an open-minded spiritualist, which was how I saw myself at the time.I walked in and a young woman was very excited to see me. She paid attention to my every word, making me feel cared about. I then met with a “master”, who informed me I was in very poor energetic health and needed to sign up right away. The classes were quirky. We’d do 40 minutes of exercise and meditation to a mix of new age flute music and Michael Jackson. It was far less pretentious than the yoga studios I had visited before. I decided to join for the haggled price of $100 (£79) a month.During my second class, the teacher gave me a healing massage, rubbing my chest with both hands. I started to cry. A friend had killed herself a few weeks before and I was probably more emotionally raw than I realised.As I got better at yoga, the masters told me I had potential. Within a month, my master had personally requested that I attend a weekend retreat the organisation was hosting in the Arizona desert, where about 400 people spent time doing yoga. I’d have to pay my airfare, plus fees to the organisation.The retreat was fancy: lots of rich Californians in a huge house with a pool, gardens and many outhouses. We were well fed. I made close friends from around the world, forging deep bonds with other members, some sexually charged. I had a good time.After that, I attended two more retreats. At one, the leader addressed the crowd in the manner of a minister giving a sermon. (There was even a special chair that only he could sit on.) Before he was introduced on the opening night, the crowd was whipped into a frenzy as loud dance music played a rock star entrance.During that third event, senior devotees tried to convince me to become a “healer”, their term for someone who teaches classes. They said, “Do you want to save the world? Make that happen by teaching.” By then I’d sacrificed time and money for the group, and made friends. I had reservations, but was too embarrassed to turn back. I paid several thousand dollars to train, maxing out my credit cards.Healers are a step below masters who are similar to monks, living in small apartments with other masters and turning over most of their possessions. A close friend who joined around the time I did quit university and spent tens of thousands of dollars from her student loan fund to become a loyal master.After a few months’ training, I realised I wasn’t seeing my friends and family as much as I used to. The organisation didn’t like it if I went on a weekend away with friends. I thought about leaving, but had already paid a year’s subscription and for more Arizona trips. I figured I’d stay and gain from the experience.As time went on, I struggled. I started reading online accounts of others who felt exploited by the group. I wasn’t falling in line, either. Once, a master grabbed me by the shoulders, shouted in my face and shook me, because I wasn’t doing what they wanted. I was supposed to be an obedient subject.The tipping point was when I was told I should leave behind my “unconscious family” (my parents), as my “spiritual family” (the organisation) was more important. One master hadn’t spoken to his parents for five years. It was tough, he told me, but said that saving the world was far more important. I know he believed he was doing the right thing. He was just fully indoctrinated.I spent six months with the organisation. I didn’t want to be convinced to stay, so when I left I basically ghosted everyone. I still felt I owed them an explanation, though. In the end, I sent them a postcard, saying, “Good luck on your path, but this is not my path.” They never wrote back.The only time I saw anyone from there again was a decade later, on the front page of a magazine. The article described the organisation as a cult, outlining its brainwashing tactics and speaking to several former members I knew. From some of their stories, I’m glad I got out when I did. • As told to Jack NeedhamDo you have an experience to share?

Not so much because they fear catching the virus (although that is, of course, still very important), but because they haven’t been out for so long.A neighbour tells me she feels anxious about going out because she hasn’t been farther than the end of our road for nearly three months, and hasn’t driven her car, which she is worried about.Another friend says she has been moving about in our local town within a radius of about four miles, but feels anxious about driving outside of it.These are people who happily drive to continental Europe in normal circumstances and have a wide circle of friends and activities.I forced myself to drive out to meet a friend for a picnic last week, once restrictions had eased. Then I made myself queue to go into a store, just to keep in touch with that aspect of life. (I’m over 70, so have been having home deliveries.) Actually being inside a store again reminded me of going into a sweet shop as a child. I now feel much more confident to do more, including driving my car again.But what would you advise? Is it normal to feel like this, and so disoriented? Should I encourage my friends to do as I did and introduce themselves back into the world a little where they can (very vulnerable groups excepted)?It’s completely understandable to feel like this, although lockdown has affected people differently. Some can’t wait to get out there again some are nervous and have lost confidence.It’s not dissimilar to people who have spent time in controlled environments – such as the army, prison, even boarding school. Some flourish when they leave, others need help to acclimatise. Of course it’s more complicated at the moment because the threat of the virus is still there, so it’s not a case of “open the doors and go forth freely”.Of course, for some people, for whom home is a safe place, new routines have been established, although they tend to be “smaller routines and ones that don’t involve going into a wider space and for a longer time, unlike those before,” Rohleder adds.So our world has shrunk, and expanding it again – safely – can seem onerous for some. “When we go out into our immediate neighbourhood, we may see familiar faces, things may look OK. We think, ‘This isn’t too bad’ – but we might imagine things are worse ‘out there’, if we go farther afield.”There are also those for whom the abdication of responsibility has been a welcome relief from everyday life, because a “higher authority” has told us what to do. “In situations like these,” Rohleder says, “the control and responsibility have sat with the government you have rules and regulations to follow. Now the responsibility is moving back to us, the inidual, and we have to make our own risk assessments.” For some, having that control again can feel overwhelming – not least because we have conflicting information about how to keep ourselves safe.So for those who want to venture forth safely, but feel trepidatious, Rohleder advises “taking gradually longer steps while maintaining social distancing. Maybe walk to a shop a bit farther away, so your circle of safety becomes larger.”Remember that confidence comes from doing the same thing repeatedly. For those feeling shaky, it’s worth breaking down the different factors and working out what you feel unsure about. If it’s a trip to the supermarket, is it the time spent in the shop, or the drive? Could you walk instead? Could you have a socially distanced meeting with a friend to introduce a bit of familiarity? Ask: what would make this a bit more achievable?I think you’ve done the perfect thing, and I’m pleased it worked for you. But some of your friends and neighbours may need to take smaller steps at first. And some may be happy with a more focused world for a while longer, and that’s OK, too.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

I’m lucky. I have spent lockdown with my boyfriend, with our usually shared flat to ourselves. Although our relationship has its pinch points, this period has mostly brought us closer. I have always appreciated him, but now I know how much.I appreciate how he lets my mother make fun of his driving, because it makes her laugh. He’s a safe driver, but he once told my mum that as a teenager he had crashed into an empty hearse on a roundabout and had to exchange details in the back of it. In doing so, he declared open season on himself. Soon enough, the joke of the bad driver spread. Now it is a regular motif in family conversation and the subject of many novelty gifts (an improvement on most joke cards that imply the receiver has a drinking problem, or asks why they aren’t yet dead).In groups of people, there is usually one good sport who is sent up by the rest. I have come to admire this service: inside jokes bond those who share them, a shared history that is sugar-coated. In my circles, I am the good sport, but it isn’t always easy too much of the same wisecrack and, like water, it will find my lowest point. But my boyfriend takes it in his stride, and I wonder if it can be learned, or taught.“It’s confidence,” he explains. “I know I’m an excellent driver, so I’m not offended.” I suspect a touch of self-delusion doesn’t hurt. “Besides,” he adds, “that thing with the hearse wasn’t my fault. You should have seen how slow they were going.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/064538ea6a67c8df32f9446de9eba6704ebcb886/0_55_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4182093956e9fd1589db532f82c7eb21","title":"social lifeline swimmers frustrated uk lidos stay shut","story":"Open-air bathers say estimated 130 venues should be allowed to reopen as Covid-19 lockdowns are relaxed“The wonderful thing about outdoor swimming is that it looks after everybody,” says Eleanor Kennedy, the chair of the Parliament Hill Lido Users’ Group and – before lockdown – a 7am open-air enthusiast.“We have young swimmers, families, key workers, retired people, disabled people. You don’t need a huge amount of kit or expensive gym membership, and on a concession rate you can pay a few pounds to swim in a beautiful environment.”As temperatures soar and with beaches potentially out of bounds, Kennedy believes there is a groundswell of support for reopening the UK’s estimated 130 lidos.There was dismay and frustration when Boris Johnson failed to include any type of swimming pool in the 4 July lockdown relaxations for England, despite rigorous preparations across the sector.Swim England has launched a national Open Our Pools campaign and, with no firm dates forthcoming from Scottish or Welsh governments either, those desperate to tone up physically and mentally after weeks confined to home are joining a growing clamour from passionate outdoor swimmers.Further up Hampstead Heath from Parliament Hill, a group of frustrated bathers last month raised a banner calling on the City of London authorities to “stop drowning in bureaucracy”, as the three famous single-sex and mixed ponds remain shut.Paul Jeal is senior supervisor across all four Hampstead pools, and says he was shocked when outdoor pools were not included in the forthcoming easing measures, though heath managers are seeking clarification for the three open-water ponds.“Unauthorised swimming is becoming a real problem,” says Jeal, who has lifeguarded on the heath for 25 years. “We have signs up and tape but with the heat and lack of other facilities it is very difficult.”While interest in open-water swimming is a relatively new phenomenon, with research for Sport England confirming a surge in people swimming in lochs, lakes, rivers and seas, lidos have long offered a golden mean between the more regimented indoor experience and wilder waters. Devotees describe the exhilaration of all-weather swimming, surrounded by coastal vistas or art-deco elegance, and many lidos have served as a focus for community regeneration.Lido regulars are also alert to the danger that, with pools closed, inexperienced swimmers may be more tempted by unguarded open water, while the RNLI and other agencies have reiterated safety warnings after a spate of drownings, including the death of a 10-year-old boy at Loch Lubnaig in the Scottish Highlands on Wednesday.Emma Pusill, the co-author of the Lido Guide, a celebration of all publicly accessible open-air pools in the UK and Channel Islands, declares herself baffled by Johnson’s decision to allow commercial open-water venues – like the Cotswolds Water Park – to restart, but not lidos. “It shows a sad lack of understanding of their unique nature,” she says.“The majority of lidos are community-run and operate on a financial knife edge. They’re currently unable to earn any money over a summer of good weather and I fear that for some pools this could spell their demise.” A number have already taken the decision to remain closed until 2021 in the face of continued uncertainty.At the UK’s oldest freshwater outdoor baths, Pells Pool in Lewes, East Sussex, the community association that runs it is similarly perplexed, having trained staff in revised life-saving guidance and planned a new pool layout and cleaning measures.“We don’t understand the science behind it,” says the committee member Rob Read, echoing the Swim England chief executive, Jane Nickerson, who has written to the prime minister calling on him to explain the evidence informing his decision. “Why is it so different for an outdoor pool or a beer garden, when we know that transmission outside is very different to indoor settings?” Indeed, many advocates believe a chlorinated pool ought to trump a boozy terrace.Pells Pool, which was established in 1861 and remained open through two world wars, is strongly supported by locals: more than 300 people have paid to join the ‘friends’ scheme that was set up at the start of the lockdown to help cover running costs. “Generations grew up learning to swim here,” says Read, “and it’s a big part of Lewes’ identity”.As researchers at Edinburgh University trial the use of saltwater in treatment of Covid-19, across on the west coast of Scotland, Chris McEleny, a councillor, is musing on the potential impact of the study on his local coastal pool. Following a £2m refurbishment, day-trippers to Gourock Outdoor Pool now provide a summer spending boost for an area more often highlighted for its poverty indices. “It’s given the town a real boost. The pool is usually open until the end of September, so we can only hope that the restrictions will be lifted, people can come to Gourock, have a safe swim and help the local economy.”As well as the more evident health and wellbeing benefits of open-air exercise, Pusill suggests lidos attracts people who would not ordinarily use indoor pools, making them more female- and family-friendly. “They are less intimidating, there’s less lane-raiding,” she says.“Body type, ability, age … it doesn’t matter. You can spend all day there with children splashing about.” Volunteering at a lido brings benefits too, according to her research. “It’s a social lifeline for some people and embeds lidos in the local community rather than being just another amenity.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9af6ce24f3784d9f425e5fbd1b4059e82fdd75da/0_19_1453_872/master/1453.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0340fe0024b96d8c47221d99ef6ff352","title":"struggling to achieve perfection this nautical metaphor might help","story":"In choppy seas, it’s better to mend the sails than return for a total refitThere’s a certain kind of person who es into each new life-improvement project – decluttering, redecorating, a new fitness regime – determined not to do things by halves. I’m one of them. When I discovered the new(ish) and impressive productivity software Notion the other week, my first instinct was to transfer my entire digital life to it and when I set up a home composting system last month, I had to fight the urge to spend a fortune on the very best equipment for what is, after all, basically a heap of old food in the corner of the yard.It’s easy to rationalise this attitude as a desire to do things properly, but really it’s the desire to do them perfectly – with the result that you either never get round to them, or you do, but then feel bad, because you’re constantly falling short of your unmeetable standards.Lately, I keep seeing people slip into a similar all-or-nothing approach to social causes, too. Perhaps lockdown made them appreciate the importance of community, so they vow never again to let work duties distract them from being a good neighbour. Or police violence impels them to take to Twitter, declare their anti-racist credentials and swear they’ll henceforth be laser-focused on racial justice. The sentiments are admirable but, once again, perfectionism is at play: it’s hard to sustain the motivation to make a real difference when your standard for success is the total transformation of how you spend your energy and time.To adapt an analogy from the Austrian philosopher Otto Neurath, we’re like sailors on a ship that long ago left port and now urgently needs repair. We’d love to return to dock and get it kitted out perfectly – setting up our lives so they’re just as we’d like them – then start the journey again. Instead we have to patch things up mid-voyage as best we can, adapting incrementally towards the people we’d like to be. I have too much work to spend the next month designing the ideal productivity system. And you, I assume, have too many non-negotiable responsibilities to become the perfect, fully committed campaigner against injustice.One useful perspective shift here is to reframe the situation so that learning to tolerate the discomfort of doing things imperfectly becomes a kind of self-improvement project in itself. From this viewpoint, a defining quality of the successful activist (or exerciser, declutterer, or anything else) is precisely that she cultivates the ability to resist demanding perfection of herself – to relish every small accomplishment as vastly preferable to the only real alternative, which is doing nothing at all.Brené Brown explores imperfection as a path to a wholehearted life, rather than an obstacle to one, in her 2010 book The Gifts Of Imperfection."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dde41bc6c4ab69a85ebfee151fc60af9887c2052/1257_1259_7279_4368/master/7279.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56beea7fda1ddf704c30c70d1f099306","title":"bbc television centre 60 years of history in pictures","story":"As the BBC’s west London complex approaches its 60th anniversary, the corporation has released a new archive of images, many previously unseen.

Her base within a disused brewery in Shepton Mallet just three miles from the festival site is heaving with stock, from swishy “psychedelic trance” tops to “pixie” wrap-around skirts and fleece blankets – she normally sells 600 of the latter at Glastonbury. “Business-wise it’s massive,” she said.But not being there also leaves an emotional emptiness. “There are so many happy people in one place and the vibe is wonderful. It’s like a great family getting together. Most of us won’t see each other now until next year.”Charlotte Grant, who first went to Glastonbury as a punter in 2003 when she was 16 and in recent years has been refreshing festival goers with cordials, smoothies and teas made from foraged ingredients on the edge of the theatre and circus fields, is to be found this weekend near Bath selling her drinks and ice lollies from a canal boat.“We’re absolutely gutted not to be at Glastonbury – it’s a total highlight for us,” she said. “It really is such a special place.” To fill the void, she has been venturing into the virtual world, streaming a Friday night cocktail hour. “We’re having to ersify as best we can.” But it’s not the same.The Glastonbury faithful are spread far and wide. The team behind Macshac, which should be dishing out stomach-lining pasta this weekend, have instead set up a pop-up delivery service in Leeds.Guerilla Archaeology, an archaeologyartsscience collective from Cardiff, is putting out videos on how to make Viking-style rings out of antlers rather than running workshops in the Green Fields area.And meanwhile Glastonbury, Shepton Mallet and Pilton, which transforms from a sleepy village into a heaving metropolis at festival time, are eerily quiet.Dawn Wartski, manager at Wildwood, which sells crystals, anointing oils and other new age paraphernalia on Glastonbury High Street, described the atmosphere this year as muted.“Normally people from all over the world are here,” said Wartski. “The festival is a great thing, an amazing event but it obviously couldn’t happen this year. It will be back and we’ll look forward to it.”Clare Charlton, who runs Pilgrims B\u0026ampB, usually has a full house of festivalgoers who like to retreat to a comfortable bed after a day and evening of revelry. “We’ve lost all that and all the visitors who normally come for the summer solstice. Fortunately our regulars have rebooked for next year already. Everyone is missing the festival, very much so.”Ali Lobb, the owner of the Mocha Berry cafe, said the weeks before and after the festival were busiest for her business when the stage crews, the water supply experts, the security guards, the cleaners, packed the town. It’s been so quiet this year,” she said.Lobb feels sorry for local organisations that raise money at Glastonbury, from the carnival clubs to the rugby team and children’s charities, who miss out on a financial boost this year. “It’s tough for a lot of people.”Glastonbury fans across the country were holding their own mini-festivals in back gardens or front rooms. Some hired in portable toilets to recreate one of the earthier festival experiences others have been busy building their own ribbon towers in honour of the festival’s iconic structure.The Rees family – mum and dad Fiona and Matt, and 11-year-old Dylan – set up a mini-Glastonbury in their Worcestershire garden complete with mini-pyramid stage, bar, camping area and toilet tent. They were planning to settle down to watch streams of previous festivals.And though there is no Glastonbury festival this year, 2020 souvenirs are still selling well. Some of the official charity merchandise including a tea towel showing a sunset and a poster featuring the motto “Hope shines brightest” have sold out.The independent Festival Postcards team, who have been attending the festival since 1981, have produced a wistful “Wish we were there” image.In Pilton, villagers Pat Sumner and Peter Cheetham were reminiscing about festivals past.Cheetham, who first came to the festival in 1981, is missing old friends, from the guys who make sure there is a supply of fresh water on the site to small army of media types.He lives so close to the site, that one year he popped home and made tea and toast for a New Zealand festivalgoer who had a sudden craving. “I popped home, made tea and toast and took it back to the site for him – he couldn’t believe it.”Sumner, who grew up in the village, said: “Every summer this amazing collage of sound and images happens in a field behind our house one week in June”Over the years he has worked in the ticket office and DJ’d in the dance village. “Glastonbury for me is not the headliners it’s about being with friends. You can be in a field with 200,000 people and you’ll still bump into your friend you went to West Pennard primary school with.”The Glastonbury blues usually hits a few days after the festival. “This year there’s a much bigger Glastonbury blues feeling. We’re already looking forward to next year.”The vast majority heeded the festival’s plea not to be tempted to turn up in Somerset. But a few could not resist the pull and were to be found hanging around Glastonbury town or trekking up to the tor.Jim Jones, from Bristol, was on top of the tor gazing out towards the site at Worthy Farm. “You miss the music, the buzz, the community, the cultural conversations,” he said. “I feel as if there’s a big hole inside me at the moment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d229d509db5e27307384832dbec9d2536c91157a/0_0_5000_3000/master/5000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16369efe30e1d279514f6c50aa5ee61e","title":"from bowie to beyonce glastonburys 50 greatest moments","story":"Although Covid-19 scuppered Glastonbury’s 50th anniversary, organisers Michael and Emily Eavis discuss the moments that made it the world’s greatest festival – from the healing fields to StormzyGlastonbury festival’s first ever booking came from Michael Eavis serenading his cows with the Kinks. “I was playing Lola to them through a sound system in the milking parlour,” he says. “I’d been to Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music at Shepton Mallet showground, wandering in on the Sunday because there was no fence left by then. I was totally inspired. Jean and I had just fallen in love and we were all loved up, among all those bands and millions of people … I’d never seen a hippy in my life before – the boys and girls all looked the same! From that, I was determined to do an event of my own. I had a better site, facing Glastonbury Tor in the vale of Avalon – it was all a bit romantic.“So I phoned the Kinks and booked them for £500. My favourite band coming to the farm! It was an amazing feeling. Then there was a story in Melody Maker that said: ‘Kinks for mini-festival’. The band didn’t like that: they were No 1 across the world, why were they doing a “mini festival”? So they pulled out. I’d already sold 100 tickets, so I felt very guilty. But the same agent said his mates had got T.Rex going down to Minehead Butlins, which is on the route. They did it for the same 500 quid. So I was saved by Marc Bolan, really.”“I attracted quite a lot of trendy hippies,” Eavis says. Two of them were Arabella Churchill and Andrew Kerr, who had read John Michell’s 1969 book The New View Over Atlantis, “which had Glastonbury as the new Jerusalem – he wrote about leylines and all sorts of silly things. A lovely fellow: an Etonian, old-school British with a stiff upper lip, but also a hippy. Andrew and Arabella put the two together: Michell’s book and my farm.” They worked together on a free festival, with David Bowie, Joan Baez and more. “Arabella and Andrew ran out of money so I had to carry the can for it in the end. I was getting more and more worse off.”Eavis hosted free festivals on the farm throughout the 1970s. “The police were bringing all the waifs and strays off the side of the road and into my place as somewhere to dump them, and I didn’t seem to mind, so we had a party every year.” He started the festival up officially again in 1979. “We ran out of money and had to go to the bank to get £15,000 to see that one through,” he says. The bank now had the deeds to the farm, and it would be theirs if he kept losing money. “But I was keen to carry on.”Eavis steadied the ship by joining forces with the anti-nuclear campaigners CND, initially naming the festival after the organisation. “They picked up 300,000 posters and stuffed them into envelopes, so people suddenly knew who we were. We took the costs, CND took the balance, and they ended up with £20,000, a fortune in those days.”Eavis calls this one of his favourite years, for the performances by Jackson Browne and Van Morrison, but also for the growing scale. “Sixty thousand people turned up to that – we were looking at fives and 10s before. The CND thing helped, and I attracted a lot of people who were anti-Thatcher, so I’ve got Maggie to thank for our success in a way. We had out-of-work miners working on the security fence, from Maggie closing down the mines.”The NME’s review of Glasto 83 is wonderfully snooty – the crowd are regarded as “sun-soaking slabs of human tripe” – but even they were entranced by Mayfield: “It took one song from this wondrous man to discover the unearthed treasures of the Pyramid.” One of the most incongruous fashion choices in Glastonbury history came when Paul Weller performed with the Style Council amid mud in a bright white suit. “It seemed a bit at odds anyway, a band like us doing Glasto,” Weller tells me. “There was a post-apocalyptic fashion look, a lot of anarchists. It was just a mudbath, like something out of the first world war, and I had to resort to wellies. We felt out of our depth, so we got straight on the Pernod. By the time we went on I was completely gone. I realised I couldn’t play properly, so I put my guitar down and just sang instead. All the anarchists down the front were chucking mud, but because I was even more out of it than the audience was, I think we won them over. We played Long Hot Summer, which was really taking the piss – it was pouring down with rain – but everyone seemed to see the funny side of it, and it ended up all right. The suit was fucked up, though.”Dedicated to esoteric therapies, the healing fields opened in the mid-80s and are still going strong. In 2019, the  spoke to a couple of gong bath practitioners who had managed to see just one music performance in 15 years.Backed by the then home secretary Michael Heseltine, the police cracked down violently on travellers who organised a free festival each year at Stonehenge, in a confrontation that was later called the Battle of the Beanfield. Eavis gave the travellers refuge as they fled west. “I put them in the field next door and they ran their own thing, with their own music. And it was free, even though I was doing a paying event on my farm. You had all these lovely posh girls from Hampstead coming down, and they all ploughed off to the hippy festival next door.“I quite enjoyed the hippies’ music and they did make me laugh,” he says. “I was just a dairy farmer, but I thought of them as friends. Being a dairy farmer in Somerset, milking and calving cows, some people do get depressed and kill themselves – it’s quite a lonely life, really. So this was an excitement that I’d imported, and they came on board and added a bit of extra spice to it. I was doing the Cure, Elvis Costello and stuff – and they came up with a new dimension in their music.”Those hippies turned out to be extraordinarily creative, and have come to define Glastonbury’s aesthetic. You can see it in the flame-belching creations of Arcadia or the cyberpunk shanty town of Shangri-La, but a large part is down to Mutoid Waste Company, who kicked off in 1987 with their Carhenge installation.Named by Rolling Stone as one of the 50 greatest concerts of the past 50 years, this headline show featured just two songs: CBB and Teacher Don’t Teach Me Nonsense. But what songs. Fela delivered solos on percussion, soprano sax and organ between statesmanlike vocal addresses, all over that inimitably tripping, rolling beat.The cordiality with the crusties dissolved in spectacular fashion. “They were selling too many drugs for my liking,” Eavis says. “I got a security firm from Wolverhampton who were all judo gold medallists, and they confiscated all their drugs. It got nasty in the end.” His daughter and now co-organiser Emily Eavis tells me she remembers “people running past the window with molotov cocktails and burning telegraph poles and blowing up Land Rovers. The fact we’re still here is miraculous.”“But all those people still work for me now, you know,” Michael continues. “They’re a very clever, creative crowd – never got proper jobs – and the things they build every year are unbelievable. And they get paid now – they weren’t paid in the mid-80s. So they’re a lot happier.”Every Glastonbury-goer will find themselves suddenly agog at a daredevil circus act, and the peak for this kind of eccentric performance was the French troupe Archaos in 1990. While they weren’t allowed to do some of their more outré material involving chainsaws and motorbikes, they still wowed with high-wire and trapeze from their base high up at the apex of the Pyramid stage.This festival-friendly addition to the megalithic structures that dot this part of the west of England is technically called the Swan Circle. Its designer, Ivan McBeth, conceived it while living on the Glastonbury site in a portable geodesic dome. “As the full moon rose over King’s Hill, my inspiration arrived,” he writes. “I was to build a stone temple whose prominent stones represented the major stars of the constellation Cygnus, the Swan. I experimented with my star map. It was not possible to make a circle of stones given the positions of the stars, but an egg would fit.” Anyone visiting his ovoid temple, “consciously or unconsciously, will be irrevocably changed by their interaction with spirit. Every year tens of thousands of people – pilgrims all – enter the Swan stone circle and fly on her back through Dreamtime, and experience transformation. Yo!” To be honest, flying on a swan through Dreamtime is positively vanilla compared with some of the stuff that goes on here at 5am on Monday morning.Rave culture reached Glastonbury with this epic dance happening. “It was the first dance field, where Shangri-La is now,” remembers Underworld’s Karl Hyde. “We set up on a two-storey tower in the middle of the field surrounded by a quadraphonic Funktion-One sound system – over two nights, DJs, live musicians and visual artists jammed, only stopping at the point we got taken over by a hardcore rave crew who, thankfully, got booed off by our crowd. Eight thousand people turned up to the last night, when we collectively played for 18 hours straight. By the time they asked us back, we were headlining the Other Stage.”The hippy-heavy crowd at Glastonbury were in thrall to the Levellers: swelled by gatecrashers, this is possibly the biggest-ever Glastonbury headliner crowd, estimated at 300,000 people. “Because it’s dark, you can’t actually see the crowd,” singer Mark Chadwick later said. “Except when they put the lights up between songs, and they look like a field of ploughed potatoes.”The BBC has long had the TV rights to Glastonbury, but it was Channel 4 that first broadcast from the festival, helping it go from hippy curiosity to British cultural heavyweight. An enterprising YouTuber has uploaded VHS-taped coverage, complete with sax-backed Tampax ads.“Hello, I’m Johnny Cash.” With those words, as ever, Cash launched into Folsom Prison Blues and cemented the Glastonbury tradition for legends to play on a Sunday afternoon. “I’ve seen a lot of people who are not like me,” he said in an on-site interview. “That’s all right. Everybody’s got the God-given right to be who they wanna be.” As good a maxim for Glastonbury as any.Having recently left Take That, Robbie Williams turned up to the festival with Oasis for the year that Britpop reached its zenith. Emily had just done her GCSEs and, in typical teenager fashion, was camping out in the fields well away from her parents. “We’d never really had a pop star here before, and there was such a buzz about Oasis too. It felt like a turning point in the festival’s history we captured what was happening in the outside world, culturally and musically.”Drafted into a headline slot after the Stone Roses pulled out due to John Squire breaking his collarbone, Pulp seized their moment and became pop stars with a common touch. “If a lanky get like me can do it, you can do it too,” Jarvis Cocker told the crowd. Emily calls it “one of my real musical turning points – when you’re 15 and standing in a field and watching those bands that mean so much to you, that was Pulp for me. It was a storming, incredible set.”Thanks to what was diplomatically described as “an unfortunate operational error”, the dance tent was flooded in gallons of excrement after the machine that was meant to be sucking up excess water did exactly the opposite. In perhaps the worst year for mud and rain ever, Radiohead hoisted the audience off the soaking ground. “A moment of transcendence: when it becomes something greater than a gig in a field, and turns into something that people talk about for a long time after,” Emily says. “It had this almighty resonance. People were probably feeling a bit stranded – it was Friday night and they had two more days of these extreme conditions tents were already sliding downhill. But this band came on and spoke to them.” Their monitors stopped working, so while it sounded great in the crowd, they couldn’t hear themselves playing. “There was a deep connection with the crowd, because both sides were vulnerable,” Emily says.Guitarist Ed O’Brien recalls: “It was the biggest gig we had ever done and would ever do for years. We were in flight-or-fight mode during the show itself as the monitors weren’t working. It was so emotionally charged up on stage that night and it wasn’t until Thom asked Andi our lighting director, to switch on the lights that we were finally able to get an idea of the sheer size of it. That was the only moment of euphoria. We thought we’d blown it when we walked offstage. But something happened that night.”Just one month before the festival, Jean Eavis died of cancer, aged 60. Michael and Emily led a memorial event during the festival, where a phoenix was burned with a brass acorn inside, and an oak tree was planted where it fell. “We were in a very delicate state,” she says. “But even though it was a sad year it was a real celebration of her life. The festival was due to end in 2000, but the amount of support we had made us think we could keep it going.“In the early days of the festival, it was very unpredictable and wild – every time you walked out there might be a pagan on the doorstep who’d had some kind of brainwave. A melting pot of people, and my mum was the anchor. She even held my dad down – he needed a bit of grounding because he got overexcited, running away with things. Back in the 80s, there were a lot of drug casualties because there were a lot more dealers on site, so after welfare had gone home, my mum would look after them. There would often be people there when I got home from school – she’d be giving them sweet tea, and wrapping them up in blankets. And then parents would call and ask us if we had their children – she would drop them off back to where they needed to go.”“Bowie’s agent, John Giddings, phoned me and said David wanted to play,” Michael says. “So I said: ‘What’s he doing now, can we listen to the stuff he’s playing?’ He was doing a show in Manchester Arena, so I took the kids up. We walked into the box in the arena, and people started cheering below, and I thought: ‘My God, how do they know who we are?’ Turns out Eric Cantona was just behind me. I didn’t really like the show – it was a very experimental stage in his life and he was all over the place. We didn’t know a single song. I thought: ‘What’s the point of going with this?’ I phoned John back and said: ‘Can’t he play some songs we know?’ So he said: ‘We’ll do another show in London for you, then, of all his hits.’ And we loved it – it was so good. I told John I could afford £90,000. John said: ‘Is that all? How are we going to tell David?’ Well, that’s your job, John. And it was a done deal. The whole crowd went crazy on it – it was a wonderful show.”This was a truly feral year, with gatecrashers in record numbers. “I wasn’t prepared,” Michael says. “The fence wasn’t good enough, the security was crap. So I was hauled over the coals by the police, who said: ‘You’ve got to get someone to organise your show. You’re a nice bloke and all that, but you couldn’t arrange something in a brewery, you know the saying?’ I said: ‘Fair enough. At least I can be guaranteed to get 150,000 people at the drop of a hat – I did get the knack of that!’” He hired Reading and Leeds promoter Melvin Benn to sort the operational side. “He used to work for me in the 80s I’d trained him up, in a way. Bless his heart, he convinced the police he could make it a lot better.”“I then had their agents saying the band weren’t ready for it: ‘Can’t they go on in the middle of the afternoon?’ No, they’re headlining. I thought these people were controlling his life, saying they weren’t fit for it. And they were fit for it, and did a wonderful job. And they went from strength to strength after that.”By pairing Hunter wellies with tiny shorts, Kate Moss invents the definitive British festival look – even for men – that is still going strong today.One of the hottest, most enthusiastically queued-for experiences in Glastonbury opens, an ultra-sweaty den of drag, disco and debauchery. “I was there at 5am last year, and I had never seen scenes like this in my life,” Emily says. “An incredible club in New York full of drag queens dancing all night: can this really be happening on Worthy Farm?”Glastonbury already had a Mad-Max-on-perry vibe about it, but was massively enhanced by the arrival of Arcadia. The collective’s Afterburner installation made it debut in 2007 and gradually grew legs and became a 50-tonne spider. “Anatomically, it was very incorrect – real spiders don’t have built-in fire cannons,” its creator, Pip Rush, brother of Mutoid Waste Company’s Joe, told the  last year. In 2019, it was replaced by a fire-breathing crane rescued from Bristol’s docks.The best views, the best secret sets – the Park stage is now a much-cherished gem. “We got a licence for 15,000 more people, so we asked a farmer if we could use a bit more of his land and start a new area,” Emily says. “I wanted the Park to be really random, musically – stuff which you wouldn’t see anywhere else. It’s got its own feel.”“I’m not having hip-hop at Glastonbury. It’s wrong.” This blinkered view from Noel Gallagher teed up one of the funniest moments in Glastonbury history: Jay-Z opening his headline performance with a sarcastic version of Wonderwall. When it segued into 99 Problems and onward, the energy levels never dipped.Under a blue sky turning pink, Leonard Cohen’s Hallelujah was a beautiful moment of secular communion. He took his hat off and held it to his chest, a gesture of awed respect for a Glastonbury crowd that always does singalongs better than any other festival.Emily calls this “a very emotional end to the weekend”, and how: Damon Albarn cried as he led his reunited band into a climatic This Is a Low. “That’s what we dreamed of, that sense of commune – we’d done it,” Albarn later said.“We can get Bob Dylan, and Johnny Cash why can’t we get Neil Young?” Emily thought. “And Springsteen as well. As it happened, they both said yes the same year. Although Jay-Z helped get Springsteen, to some degree, because the festival was a talking point in the US, which it hadn’t been before.“Neil Young walked on stage and looked like he was thinking, ‘Am I going to enjoy this?’ But by the end he was really smiling. It was such an amazing gig, definitely one of our best moments. Springsteen opened with Coma Girl, which is a song Joe Strummer wrote about Glastonbury. Playing that song, it personalised the set, made it different to a stadium show and made people feel like he really understood it. The power of Bruce when he goes for it is like nothing else – we were all blown away.”“We wanted to have a bigger area for late-night entertainment,” Emily says, “instead of just dancing outside a blanket stall.” This was the south-east “naughty” corner and Shangri-La, a kind of post-apocalyptic walk-through rave-cum-art-gallery, turned it into an otherworldly destination. Emily came up with the name because “my dad always called the farm Shangri-La. He didn’t really like going on holiday, and whenever we got back he always be like: ‘Aaah, Shangri-La, the best place on Earth!’”The Park has hosted plenty of big secret gigs, from Pulp to Foals, although the biggest coup of all was an acoustic set from Thom Yorke, with Johnny Greenwood turning up to play piano on Karma Police. The festival had changed enormously in the 10 years since Eavis was hauled up in front of the police – and Benn’s contribution was no longer needed. “Melvin was a marvellous chap but he was a control freak,” Michael says, picking this out as a key, if not strictly great, moment. “We didn’t need him any more, because we knew what we were doing. It was my show, and yet he was doing all the donkey work – he didn’t like that combination and said he didn’t enjoy coming down. I said, well, can we call it a day then? He was unhappy to go – we probably did fall out. But two jockeys on a horse doesn’t really work, does it? We’re best of friends now, though.”Beyoncé’s Vegas-style revue of a set, straddling power ballads, Prince and Etta James covers, a six-song Destiny’s Child medley and a version of Kings of Leon’s Sex on Fire, saw her make sure every single person in the 100,000-strong audience was having a good time. They responded with remarkable vocal dexterity in a raucous rendition of Irreplaceable.“Kate Moss and all those fashion icons were saying: ‘You want to get U2, they want to do it,’” Michael says. “Eventually I had a phone call to my kitchen from their agent, saying the band want to play. I picked the wrong day for the weather it did rain, but they did a wonderful set. Incredibly well-mannered, that lot.”In terms of crowd-pleasing headliners, the Rolling Stones have arguably never been topped. Read Mick Jagger’s memories of the performance here. If Johnny Cash set the trend for the Sunday-afternoon slot, Dolly supercharged it. “She’s the ultimate teatime legend,” Emily says. “So many different tribes came to see her. She talked about her upbringing on a farm and how she had this love for mud, and everyone warmed to her. In person, she was lovely, warm, friendly, and my kids were completely transfixed. Everything about her oozes perfection and grace, with her voice, and accent, and songs – it was like this magical person had arrived.”“The Dalai Lama was turning 80 that year, so we asked him to come,” Emily says. “We were thinking: who could give him a birthday cake? Patti Smith. Her gig was incredible – when she tripped over and said: “I’m a fucking animal!”, the crowd’s reaction was so good. Obviously I was on stage going, who put that lead there? But the energy was so high, she got the audience into a bit of a trance. I was thinking, we’ve got to bring on a birthday cake and the Dalai Lama now ... It was quite a contrast, but it worked really well. I enjoy bringing people in who people wouldn’t necessarily expect to see and giving them platforms to speak. Like David Attenborough, or Pussy Riot when they brought a tank in.”With Dave Grohl doing a Stone Roses and breaking his leg, forcing Foo Fighters to pull out of their headline slot, Florence Welch got called up to the biggest gig of her life. By keeping it percussion-free, and backed by brass and acoustic guitar, her cover of the Foos’ Times Like These kept the Pyramid crowd in a kind of suspended animation.At 78, Paul McCartney was set to be the oldest Pyramid stage headliner ever this year, although that’s still nearly a decade off the oldest person ever to play the stage: Burt Bacharach, aged 87. “To walk on to that Pyramid stage, at the 5pm slot, had to be one of the most exhilarating and nerve-wracking moments of my life,” the now 92-year-old tells me. “Daylight, where faces of so many people just seemed to stretch to foreverland. I’m so grateful for the experience.”On an afternoon battling some of Somerset’s most stinking weather, Mary J Blige gave life back to the Pyramid audience with a performance of physical and spiritual indefatigability, screaming in defiance and doing repeated jumping squats in high heels. It is raining? We hadn’t noticed.“Adele grew up coming to the festival. She’s a proper child of Glastonbury,” Emily says, picking the moment she persuaded the singer to headline as one of her greatest festival moments. “But if she wanted to do 20 stadiums, they would sell out. Some people need a headline slot – she just didn’t need to do it, and doing Glastonbury is a challenge, because of the size, and you’re not playing to your own audience. We looked at the crowd for Kanye from the side of the stage, and it was pretty incredible. I’d gone through a lot of shit to get there, it was stressful it was probably one of the most isive sets we’ve done, but I’m really glad we did it. There was a huge turnout and this really charged atmosphere. The excitement and energy you could feel in the field climbed all over your body – that feeling when you’re in a crowd waiting for something magnificent to happen. I said: ‘Are you gonna do this next year? You’ve got to do this!’ And she said yes, and we shook on it.”There was a dumbstruck mood on the morning after the Brexit vote, though once the music started up, it seemed to be quickly swept away. More than ever, Glastonbury felt like a cocoon from reality, one that people sealed themselves inside with even more determination. (Perhaps there were more Brexiteers than you might expect, too.) But the issue was addressed head on with grace and stunning power by PJ Harvey, who read John Donne’s 1624 poem No Man Is an Island: “Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main … any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind.”At a snap general election earlier in the month, the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, chomped into the Tory majority and forced them into a minority government. He took his victory lap at Glastonbury, drawing a vast crowd and telling them: “The elites got it wrong – politics is about the lives of all of us.” The “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn” chant sprang up throughout, and it felt like real change was in the air. Of course, it wasn’t to be, but the feeling endures that a whole swathe of young people had a political awakening here.One of the emotional high points of last year was Kylie, who had been forced to cancel in 2005 due to her breast cancer diagnosis. She finally got her moment. Chris Martin and Nick Cave guested, but Kylie’s joy – “I’ll never get you out of my head!” she told the crowd – is what really lingers.“It was such an overwhelming experience,” she says now. “I’ve never seen that many people in my life, let alone had the honour, and nerves, of performing for them. It was sensory overload, in the best way. All of the ‘experienced’ people who had advice for me before the show, they were all right: try to enjoy, feel the love, it will feel like for ever and then be over in a minute. It was, in short, one of the best experiences of my life. To feel that I had done enough in my career to be there in that moment. Also, to have the chance again, finally, after missing my headline opportunity in 2005, made it all the more emotional and a small personal triumph.”Emily offered Stormzy the headline slot back in 2017, after he blew her away on the Other Stage. “I’d never seen a live show like that before. This guy had so much talent and energy: everything we need right now on the Pyramid stage. His agent was like, really? And we said, yeah, definitely.“The 2019 set was a universal, incredible moment. Not only was it his performance, his delivery and how he was connecting to the audience, but the production stakes were high – I’ve never seen so many BMXs at the side of the stage before. It makes it worthwhile running a festival when you can have moments like that.“I walked off to tell him this was incredible – and he had had a different experience. He couldn’t hear himself on stage. People were saying no one could go in and see him. I said: ‘I need to tell him I’ve seen all sorts of gigs at Glastonbury, but I’ve never seen anything like that please let me in, I don’t want him leaving thinking that was a disaster.’ I literally held him, and told him how fucking brilliant it was, and he had to realise that. He wasn’t angry, he was just spinning. But he watched it back, and realised, and started smiling.“Despite all the criticism you get for doing things differently, all the negative stuff from other parts of the industry saying: ‘That’s ridiculous, he’s only got one album, he’s not ready’ – you’ve just got to create moments like that, otherwise it’s pointless, the whole thing. It would dissolve. But it made Glastonbury more exciting than it’s ever been.”• Kylie interview by Laura Snapes"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4e9339497d432b32e7e13d4036faf6f5344e3b30/669_345_4052_2432/master/4052.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00ab5e8ab02b2d178258061b2288ef50","title":"martin parrs glastonbury tour photo essay","story":"Coronavirus might have claimed this year’s Glastonbury festival but, undeterred, photographer  Martin Parr assessed the lay of the landThis week I should have been experiencing and photographing the Glastonbury festival for the first time. That it would have been my first is for me is matter of some regret as I have spent a long career trying to shoot a mix of all things British, and in particular iconic British events. How I managed to miss this festival is almost beyond me, given its significance in the British social calendar. I do have an excuse though, as the last weekend of June is always the AGM of Magnum, the cooperative that I am a member of, and I always felt obliged and keen to attend.So for the 50th festival I had planned to go, but as we all know it was cancelled. However, I thought it would be interesting to tour the site just before the festival would have opened, to see how it looks.I am being taken around by John from the press office, and the first thing to remember is that this is a large, busy and working farm. I photograph Steven, the farm manager, cleaning his tractor, and there are nearby piles of manure, and in front of the skeleton of the Pyramid stage is a large herd of friesian cows where normally you would see many thousands of dancing, waving festivalgoers.The other first impression is that the site is huge. This will not be news to regular attendees, but to this Glasto virgin it amazing to see the scale of it all. We pass the staff canteen, which serves 20,000 meals a day we see assorted landmark sites like the Greenpeace boat and the stone circle. We visit a site called Permaculture, where John picks some raspberries: normally at this time of year it would be a thriving market garden.All around the site are remains of the assorted attractions waiting to be brought back to life in a year’s time. There is a sense of melancholy about the whole site.We go back to base and meet Emily, and a few moments later Michael comes by in his bright red Land Rover. He is a pretty nimble 85-year-old. I explain I have taken his photo a few times and say the last time was when he opened a summer fete at an old people’s home in nearby Shepton Mallet. He says: ‘That’s the sort of thing I do!’ I shoot their portrait in front of the door to one of the farm barns.The tour continues and I go to an area with dozens of skips and many refuse lorries, a reminder that at the festival peak this is a community of more than a quarter of a million people, with all the servicing this entails. There are piles of old oil barrels which are the litter bins, which are freshly painted every year but are now looking a bit sad. I go to the festival workshop barn, where Rob is employed year-round to build and maintain the festival infrastructure.I hope to be back next year, to see the real thing in full operation, but I am grateful to have had this chance to first see the lay of the land."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85d82632ed3d6584d8ceba44a6ebbfc5c430eeae/0_0_2800_1860/master/2800.jpg?width=1010\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=ca6b17904c7611478497a9438568984a 2020w","title":"after a decade of austerity what now","story":"Columnist John Harris has spent the past decade touring the country and reporting on what devastating budget cuts have meant to communities. Looking back, he sees some signs of hope amid the devastation. But will the government change its approach for the impending Covid-19 economic crash?When George Osborne delivered his spending review in June 2010 it ushered in what would become a decade of austerity measures. As budgets were slashed for children’s centres, libraries, parks and welfare, they were accompanied with the phrase “we are all in this together”.   columnist John Harris has been touring the country for the entire decade, chronicling the devastation that those cuts have made in local communities for his award-winning series Anywhere But Westminster. He tells Rachel Humphreys how his latest reporting on the Barnsley village of Thurnscoe is illustrative of what austerity does to a place.

The current system will not be able to cope with an expected surge in demand as the nation starts to rebuild after Covid-19, Boris Johnson has been warned. The Samaritans, Rethink Mental Illness and Mind are some of the charities who have said he must place mental health at the heart of the government’s recovery plan. They estimate a further half a million people are likely to go on to experience mental health problems as a result of the economic impact of the crisis. The coalition of voluntary and social sector organisations is calling on the government to work with them to develop a mental health renewal plan. Their letter to Johnson reads: We know, as you do, that no one organisation, agency or government department can provide the solutions to the enormous challenge facing us. But as prime minister, you have the authority to convene all the right people to make this happen. Together we can lead the world in delivering a Covid-19 recovery that puts the nation’s mental health at its heart.Mark Winstanley, chief executive of Rethink Mental Illness, said: “Mental health care has been chronically underfunded for decades and we were only just starting to see the impact of investment when the pandemic hit. “Covid-19 has changed the course of the journey we are on and we need to pool all our knowledge and resources to navigate the challenges ahead, with support at every level of government. “There’s an opportunity here to provide the nation with a renewal plan for mental health and to reduce some of the most damaging health inequalities in society. If we do not seize this chance, we will feel the impact of that failing for decades.” Ben Waugh, who runs a bicycle hire shop on the seafront at Bournemouth, has lived in the seaside resort all his life but has never seen so many people packed on to the beach – and so much terrible behaviour.“I understand why people wanted to come,” he said, as the cleanup continued around him. “It’s the best beach around and when the weather’s good it’s like being in Benidorm. But what happened here this week was horrific.”Waugh watched aghast as groups of revellers took drugs and drank their way through countless crates of beer. “There was a Lord of the Flies vibe to it. The atmosphere was ugly.”“I miss the joy of random events, of not knowing what will happen between the hours of 2pm and 4pm,” writes  columnist Zoe Williams. I am having the unsettling realisation that it was never organised entertainment that entertained me, but the random stuff in between. I miss outdoor events taking place, but, even with a gun to my head, I couldn’t tell you which outdoor event I want to attend (there is usually a county show in my local park, where you can pet a cow. I would consider that, obviously having first checked bovine potential as a transmission vector). I want non-essential shops to be open, but there is nothing I want to buy. Sure, I want to see my friends. Really, though, I want to be in a room that is at least half full of people I don’t know and have a meandering conversation with them for no reason – and who would waste their friendship allowance on that?Mr Z said that the problem isn’t any one thing it is waking up knowing that every day is going to be the same as the previous 95. It is Groundhog Day retold as tragedy (at least Bill Murray’s endless day began in a new place, with new people) it is a fairytale curse, which none of us will be allowed out of until we have learned something about ourselves.Union leaders have called for calm this weekend after council workers suffered “frightening” levels of abuse as huge crowds flocked to Bournemouth beach this week. The GMB union said its members employed by Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch Council (BPC) were subjected to verbal abuse and threats of physical violence. More than 550 parking control notifications were issued on Thursday around the area, which had become gridlocked with visitors, with more than 40 tons of rubbish needing to be removed from the beaches. One council worker, who wished to remain anonymous, said:While we are trying to go about our job, the levels of abuse are frightening. Be it clearing rubbish or asking people not to light barbecues, we are seeing abuse and confrontation like never before and we simply want the public to consider the impact of their actions not only for themselves, but also for the wider community.Adrian Baker, GMB regional organiser, said: “GMB are calling for calm ahead of the weekend when we anticipate more and more visitors coming to the Bournemouth, Poole and Christchurch area. “While people are obviously looking to enjoy the hot weather, our members should not have to put up with these kind of attacks - not to mention that we want them to be able to remain safe doing their jobs. “We ask for members of the public to respect social distancing at all times according to the government advice and help our members and their families to stay safe and protected.” A “large amount” of the Covid-19 virus is still circulating in Greater Manchester according to new testing data, the region’s mayor Andy Burnham said. He warned the public to stay cautious as the country emerges from lockdown after the region received pillar 2 test results - swabs of the wider population - for the first time across its 10 boroughs. Previously the authorities in Greater Manchester had only been able to release pillar 1 test data in which swabs are taken at Public Health England labs and NHS hospitals for those with a clinical need, and health and care workers. This week, Burnham said the number of positive pillar 1 positive cases was 78 - a continued decrease - but leapt to 465 when combined with the pillar 2 data. Speaking at his weekly coronavirus press conference, he said:Finally we have been able to put pillar 1 and pillar 2 together and get much more of a truer picture in terms of what’s going on with the spread, the circulation of Covid-19 in Greater Manchester. It represents a significant number of new cases and while the overall numbers are coming down and transmission is reducing, nevertheless there is still a significant amount of Covid-19 circulating within Greater Manchester. For the first time we are seeing the true picture. He stressed though that more tests were being carried out in the region than “pretty much anywhere else in the country” and the figures were a reflection of increased testing activity. However he added it was a “warning sign” and they would monitor the figures in the coming days and weeks. He said: “Council leaders in Greater Manchester are concerned the message is going out - as people look at the images of beaches across the country, particularly Bournemouth, and what we have seen in gatherings in towns and cities - that lockdown is over. Well what I would say is it can’t be. “Everyone needs to refocus on what the Chief Medical Officer (Chris Whitty) is saying. The risk is clearly present and people need to focus again on the government’s advice, particularly in this period where people are beginning to emerge from lockdown and return to a degree of normality. “Clearly it can’t be the case we are back to normal, we are not. There is a large amount of this virus circulating in Greater Manchester and people need to know that and they need to take precautions.” Today’s statistics have now been published. They relate to information covering the whole of the UK.The DHSC says data on the number of inviuals tested for Covid-19 has been temporarily paused to ensure consistency of reporting.

Shipman’s book All Out War also served as the basis for the Channel 4 drama Brexit: The Uncivil War, in which Benedict Cumberbatch played Dominic Cummings.Announcing the project, Passenger’s Richard Brown described the premise as “a story which appears to demonstrate that fact is indeed sometimes stranger than fiction.” There are rare moments in history when leaders find their private lives uniquely connected to national events, where personal experience and official role collide in an unusual way. The last few months in the life of the UK prime minister clearly mark one of these moments.The proportion of Covid-19 patients in hospital who are dying is falling, research suggests. The authors suggested several reasons for the “steep and continual decline in the death rate in hospital of patients”. One could be that patients with Covid-19 in late March and early April included a significant proportion of patients who caught the infection in hospital, they said. “These patients, because they were in hospital, were more likely to be sicker and more vulnerable than patients who acquired infection in the community and so more likely to die from Covid-19.” But as this changed, and patients with community-acquired infections became a greater proportion of patients in hospital, the death rate could fall, the researchers suggested. Other reasons may be that medics have become more skilled at treating patients with Covid-19, patients over time have become younger with fewer underlying health conditions, or people are now suffering less severe disease. The researchers said: “The reasons for the declining death rate in hospitals may be a combination of one or all of these factors or due to some other reason we have not considered.“In either case, further research is warranted to understand why the hospital death rate has declined so markedly over the past eight weeks.” Intu Properties will collapse into administration on Friday afternoon after the heavily indebted shopping centre owner failed to secure an agreement with its creditors.The company, whose centres include Lakeside in Essex, the Trafford Centre in Manchester and the Newcastle  Centre, has debts of more than £4.5bn and has been unable to persuade lenders to grant a debt repayment holiday ahead of a Friday night deadline. The company employs 2,500 people and owns 17 shopping centres across the UK.The company said that all shopping centres would continuing to trade. Intu had been under pressure before the coronavirus pandemic with the value of its centres – as well as those of rival operators such as Hammerson and British Land – falling as some of the high street’s big space occupiers, including Debenhams, House of Fraser and Topshop, closed stores and demanded rent cuts so that they could stay in business.With the shift to online shopping undermining the economics of physical store retailing before the health crisis, the high street shutdown has raised the stakes.Police are responding to a serious incident in Glasgow that has forced road closures in the city centre. In a statement on Twitter, police said the incident is “contained” and there is no danger to the general public. Images on social media showed armed police entering a building and a large number of emergency vehicles. Greater Glasgow Police tweeted: “Emergency services are currently dealing with an incident on West George Street in Glasgow. “The street is currently closed off and the public are asked to avoid the area at present. “The situation is contained at this time and there is no danger to the general public.” An unprecedented “breakdown in public behaviour” led to a major incident being called on Bournemouth beach, according to the leader of the local council. Vikki Slade, Liberal Democrat leader of Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council, said that many of the hundreds of thousands of people who descended on the Dorset beaches had caused multiple incidents of anti-social behaviour, were abusive and left large amounts of litter. We had so many people here and the behaviour was so bad, the road blockages were such a problem that had someone been seriously ill there is a very good chance emergency vehicles wouldn’t have been able to get to them properly. Slade said the beaches have previously seen such high numbers, which were in the hundreds of thousands, but the problem stemmed from the lack of infrastructure which would normally be available. She said: On bank holidays the pubs are open, the cafes are open, the hotels are open, people aren’t just congregating here, they are not bringing vast quantities of alcohol. The behaviour of people, fly-parking on the middle of roundabouts and pavements - unprecedented - people defecating in a cardboard box on the beach and leaving it for our staff to deal with, refuse collectors being abused for doing their job, that is what made it unprecedented and that is why we had to take action. The people who behaved badly, and there were lots of them, ruined it for everybody else, are trashing our environment, and our local residents are fed up with it.Slade said the main threat of a Covid-19 spike would be people taking it back to their own communities, and added: “There is a Covid-19 issue but it’s very much about this breakdown in public behaviour that we are seeing. “Other councils have told us they have never seen the levels of litter ever in their history, never seen the levels of illegal parking, never seen the abuse thrown at public servants. “I asked somebody whether they were going to park on a junction and I got the finger. “You are trying to be a good citizen and there were some really unpleasant people out there, and it’s not acceptable for our staff to be having to deal with that. “We have recruited security guards to protect our beaches - that’s not a good sign is it?” There was an ugly mood. Nobody is going on a foreign holiday at the moment, people can’t go to the pub, football match, theme park, can’t see their friends where they normally see them. That frustration and anti-authority thing was played out here with large, large groups of people who we don’t normally see, with a bad attitude, treating this place with disrespect. We have to hope that as other things open, the pain is shared with other people. At the moment it’s concentrated in small areas and that’s part of the problem, there is conflict between local communities and visitors. We would like to have lots of visitors that respect where we live.  A serious police incident has closed roads in Glasgow city centre. There is a heavy police presence on West George Street with more than a dozen police vehicles in attendance. A traffic information bulletin issued by Glasgow City Council said: “Due to a serious police incident the following roads are currently closed until further notice. More to follow.At her daily media briefing, Nicola Sturgeon was asked about chaotic scenes in Glasgow’s Kelvingrove park yesterday where a large police presence was required to disperse crowds, with two arrests. Particularly for young people, I understand it’s the hottest day of the year, you’re in your flat and you want to get out and about. She said that she remembered enjoying spending time in Kelvingrove herself as a student at Glasgow university, but that everyone needed to understand the risks posed by large gatherings.Sturgeon also confirmed that there were no registered coronavirus deaths in Scotland in the past 24 hours for the first time on a weekday since 20 March, before lockdown began.Sturgeon had a strong message for groups organising protests over the coming month – including pro-independence activists: “Please don’t do it”. Asked about a Police Scotland warning about planned protests, including a Black Lives Matter event, this weekend, and All Under One Banner plans for July, she said: I’ve been involved in political activism all my life, I know how important protest is...but right now they are risky so find other ways to make your views known.She emphasised that avoiding an immediate spike now allows the health service to plan for a potential second wave in the winter. Nearly 1.4 million people in the UK cannot access public funds during the coronavirus pandemic because of their immigration status, a charity estimates. Some 1,376,158 people have no recourse to public funds (NRPF) because their immigration status is not finalised, suggests research by the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford. This means they cannot access most benefits, such as Universal Credit, child benefit, housing benefit, and a range of allowances and tax credits. Citizens Advice, which shared the research, said the number of people seeking help about this and non-EU migrants’ access to benefits during the pandemic has more than doubled compared with last year. Since 11 March, it has been supporting someone regarding these concerns every 20 minutes on average. The charity says the rules mean families are risking their health to work and some may be split up in future. Some have faced the “impossible choice” between returning to work while ill or shielding so they can continue to earn, and staying at home, as per public health guidance, but losing their income. Migrants from non-European Economic Area countries are disproportionately likely to work in frontline roles, including in healthcare, care work and security jobs, it added. Briana, a Jamaican national with NRPF who usually works in a care home, is shielding due to heart and respiratory problems, Citizens Advice said. While she is receiving statutory sick pay, she cannot afford to pay her rent or bills and feels forced to return to work because she is so worried about rent arrears and eviction. Chief executive Dame Gillian Guy said that despite measures put in place by the government, the charity is seeing “significant increases” in people seeking help. The government has made people with NRPF eligible for the Job Retention Scheme and provided emergency funding to councils. But the charity said people are racking up “significant levels of debt” in order to avoid jeopardising their immigration status by attempting to claim benefits.

Seeking a fresh start in Australia, she quit her job as a web designer and packed her bags.“Back in 2001, pilates wasn’t that well known in the UK – so when I saw my local gym in Australia had a studio, I decided to give it a go,” Smith says. “At first I thought: ‘I don’t understand this.’ But afterwards, I realised my back pain had gone away. When I returned to the UK in 2003, I decided to retrain as a pilates teacher, mainly so I could learn how to do it properly.”Once trained, Smith began working part-time as a teacher, meeting with clients in homes, offices and rented studios. But after having her first child with husband Ed in 2011, she decided to set up a permanent base – The Pilates Pod in Hitchin, Hertfordshire.The business gradually grew from a one-day-a-week enterprise to opening seven days a week, with seven staff and 30 classes catering for approximately 150 core clients. Then two years ago, after the birth of her second child, Smith decided to refocus her business on classical pilates – and found her niche.“We all retrained in the authentic approach that follows the legacy of Joseph Pilates,” Smith says. “We completely changed our model, and really hit the nail on the head in terms of what we wanted to be about. We’re now one of only a handful of classical studios across the country.”Such a unique offering means Smith’s clients are fiercely loyal – one makes monthly five-hour round trips to the studio – so when lockdown struck, it was a devastating blow.“I felt sick and sad at the same time, because I didn’t get the chance to officially shut my doors,” Smith remembers. “The day before lockdown, I left the studio like any other day – then the announcement came on TV.“We’d started our company as a family, and felt like we needed to go back and close properly. We went to the studio together that weekend, and acknowledged that we were shutting the doors – something we haven’t done in nine years.”Despite suffering such a personal setback, Smith quickly rallied, working with her trainers to bring The Pilates Pod’s classes online.“This is by no means the first time we’ve experienced a crisis,” says Smith. “We set up the business in a credit crunch, and have come through Brexit and the birth of two children. There have been lots of times where we’ve nearly hit the bottom and had to pull ourselves up – so this is different, but not necessarily new.“I’ve been teaching privately on Skype and Zoom for a long time, and looking at bringing more classes online for a while, but we’ve never had the time to do it before. Coronavirus has actually given us the time and headspace to put it into action.”Within three days, Pilates Pod had gone virtual, with Zoom classes and curated content available online. Members were gifted bundles of lessons to use themselves or give away, and free sessions were offered to NHS staff.“Clients might have come to the studios once a week before, but now they’re doing classes three times a week, and still chatting to each other before lessons,” Smith says. “The ethos of the Pod was always about creating an environment, not just pilates. Clients have told us they feel supported by and connected to us and to each other, and that’s so important.”Although she doesn’t yet know when small studios like hers will be released from lockdown, Smith is putting safety measures in place, ready for a phased reopening.Meanwhile, she’s going the extra mile to retain the personal Pilates Pod touch.Despite being classed as vulnerable to Covid-19 herself, Smith regularly phones vulnerable clients to check in on them, delivers pilates equipment to those who need it, and runs virtual quiz nights to boost camaraderie.“Financially, it would be more beneficial for us to close the door and put our staff on furlough, and ride the storm – but that has never been an option for us,” says Smith. “It’s such a personal thing, to have a small business and nurture it – it’s like your baby. A local business is a very different thing to a big chain – you’re part of the community.”Her efforts shine a light on those small, high-street businesses that deliver something different, and desperately need their customers’ support to stay afloat.“It’s so important that giants like Visa, as well as regular customers, support the high street,” Smith adds. “To see that they care is everything. Sometimes you’ll be struggling through – but when someone pats you on the back and says: ‘Keep going’, it makes you think: ‘You know what? I will.’”Shop local.

The Banbury shop is an art lover’s paradise, full of watercolour brushes, lino sets, calligraphy pens and more. Upstairs there is a classroom where owner Barry Whitehouse delivers art classes for up to eight students.“My customers range from complete beginners to professional artists and my passion is to make art accessible and affordable to everyone,” says Whitehouse. “I know all my customers by name and many are retired or ‘recycled teenagers’ as I like to call them. It is wonderful to see the positive effects learning art has, such as mindfulness, confidence building and creating communities.”In January this year, The Artery celebrated its 10th year of trading and had been going from strength to strength. Forty different classes were available in the studio space at £12 each, plus there were strong sales from the shop. Whitehouse was also heavily involved in organising community events such as the Banbury art festival.But then Covid-19 hit and by late February he was seeing the effects.“Revenue dropped and so did footfall. My older students started cancelling classes due to health concerns. I needed a new business plan and fast because at that stage I didn’t even have an online shop,” he says.In March, he was forced to close his beloved shop and put his two part-time staff on furlough. Stuck at home like everyone else, Whitehouse started experimenting with streaming his classes online direct from his dining room via closed Facebook groups. The camera was trained on his easel and he offered step-by-step instructions just as he did in the real-life classes.“Those first few weeks were about getting my older students used to new technology,” he says. “For some, my classes were the only outside contact they got all week. It became a special time where they could connect and switch off from the stress of Covid-19 for a couple of hours.”Whitehouse charged a flat rate of £5 a class and by April had seven weekly classes available, covering watercolour, acrylics, drawing, and calligraphy. Initially the clientele were mostly current students but then he started to up his social media presence.He began by offering the occasional free paint-along sessions on the Artery Facebook page. To date those six sessions have now had more than 12,000 views, with his class on painting a bluebell wood in watercolour proving particularly popular. This resulted in new students signing up to his online classes from all across the UK as well as the US, South Africa, Australia and Canada.“I have gone from around 50 students pre-lockdown to several hundred now,” he says. “Some classes have 40-plus people in them. The students have created their own community by sharing their work and words of encouragement.”Whitehouse has also brought his shop online for the first time via a ShopAppy account. You can buy both art supplies and classes here. He is now sending parcels across the UK and sales are especially strong for products such as the watercolour brushes that students need for classes.“I personally deliver all local orders either on foot or in my car and often have a socially distanced chat,” says Whitehouse. “My customers love buying from a small local shop. Support from brands like Visa has been invaluable in raising awareness on shopping local and falling in love with our town centres again.”But now it’s all change again with government news that shops can reopen from 15 June. For Whitehouse though, while he will open up the shutters, it will be far from business as usual.“As the shop is so small, you can only safely have one person in there at a time. We’re opening for click and collect to begin with to keep everyone safe.”And as for the classes, Whitehouse says he will offer them face-to-face again once he is allowed, but they will also always be streamed online too.“The students see the same image and get the same instructions. It has made the classes so much more accessible, plus the recordings can be watched whenever and as many times as needed.”So an unexpected bonus of Covid-19 is that The Artery is actually busier than ever.“I always thought I’d need a bigger bricks and mortar classroom to grow my business. But the online world means my classes have opened up to so many more people across the world. They have become a crucial support lifeline,” says Whitehouse.“It is so wonderful that people are turning to creativity to help them get through this difficult period the world is currently facing and to see my small business grow at the same time has been incredibly rewarding.”Shop local.

I think a lot of small businesses felt the same.”Mills usually spends her days at The Workshop, Sprout’s retail space and the hub of production for her bright and playful made-to-order clothes. Just a few minutes’ walk from Bexhill beach, it started life as a shared workspace, but as Sprout quickly grew, she was able to dedicate the whole space to her own business.A place for creativity and connecting with customers, having to close the shop was a big blow. But, after a brief dip in sales just before lockdown, which she links to customers’ collective financial uncertainty, online sales soon began to rise. “Once lockdown started, because everyone was at home buying, my online business just flourished,” she says.Underpinning such a boost in online sales is Mills’ savvy decision to expand her website and ersify into other online marketplaces such as Etsy. Where she would once open the shop six days a week and make daily post runs, Mills was only able to manage twice-weekly trips to her workshop at the beginning of lockdown because she was juggling work and childcare. Postage was reduced to once a week. But the extra time proved just what she needed. “When I wasn’t able to get to my workshop and sew, I was spending a lot more time doing computer work, and that has had a hugely positive impact on the business now,” she says. “I’ve managed to do a lot of stuff that I’ve been meaning to do for years but literally not had the time!”As well as bolstering her online presence, Mills used lockdown to work on another long-held goal: expanding into womenswear. Her new line of made-to-measure women’s underwear, crafted from the same organic, colour-clash fabrics that make her childrenswear so popular, immediately became Sprout’s bestselling range.As well as her efforts in keeping the business alive and thriving during lockdown, Mills also credits consumers thinking more carefully about what and how they’re buying. “People have been looking at more sustainable ways of buying and my stuff is all organic – that’s why I thought it was important to go into doing some adult designs. Sales of my reusable products, such as reusable wipes and makeup pads, have also been huge,” she says.Sustainability is not just an extra selling point for Sprout, it’s something that has earned Mills a loyal community of like-minded customers. While face-to-face interaction has been impossible, Mills has found her brand’s Facebook group to be an essential source of positivity and communication, spotlighting it as one of her favourite aspects of the business. An 800-strong online community share photos of their “Sproutlets”, and buy and sell pre-loved Sprout items. The latter is something Mills is particularly proud of, as it’s proof in action of the longevity of her clothes. “You’ll see this pair of dungarees will be traced back through three or four different children,” she says. “That’s the whole point of my business. They last and they’re not disposable.”While the online side of the business has been booming and her community has prospered through social media, Mills is looking forward to the social interaction that her shop provides when she reopens. “People really love being able to see and feel the quality of the clothes, and it’s lovely when someone wanders in off the street, discovers my brand and becomes a regular customer,” she says.Opening with reduced hours at first, Mills believes it will take time for the high street to get back to where it was and is grateful for support from Visa’s shop local campaign. “It’s a real positive for such a huge brand to be supporting small businesses, it’s a bare essential to us,” she says.Those who venture on to their local high street and into Sprout’s workspace will gain a renewed connection between maker and consumer, as Mills makes each piece right there on the shop floor, an unusual sight when so much of clothing manufacturing happens overseas and behind closed doors. “When parents come in with their children, they’ll sit and watch me sew for a while. I think it’s important for children to know where their clothes are from, to see how it all works,” she says. “It’s been really weird working in here with the blinds down and the door locked. I’m looking forward to opening.”Shop local.

Making the most of his free time, he picked up a hire bike and went for a ride. An apt choice, given that when lockdown began, The Eco Larder started offering bicycle deliveries for the first time.This new option is one of the ways that Matthew and his co-owner and wife, Stephanie Foulds, have adapted their business during the coronavirus pandemic. “We started offering a delivery service as soon as the lockdown came into place because of how difficult it was for people to get hold of groceries,” says Stephanie. “And because we’re an environmental company, we decided to do this by cargo bike.”The Eco Larder is a zero-waste social enterprise food store in the Haymarket area of Edinburgh. It opened in November 2018 after a successful crowdfunding campaign helped the couple to raise £23,000. Their vision was inspired by their daughter, who was only six months old at the time. “She’s a really big driver for why we do what we do,” explains Stephanie. “We just wanted to bring her up in a world that takes better care of the planet than we have been seeing over our lifetime.”Juggling a newly established business and a small child is a challenge. Add a global pandemic into this mix? “It was total chaos”, laughs Stephanie, who is currently staying on the Isle of Bute with her mother and daughter. They travelled there before any of the lockdown restrictions came into force so that her mother, who shares their flat in Edinburgh, could recover from a period of ill health, which included a week in intensive care.Until she is able to return to Edinburgh, Stephanie is handling ordering for the store remotely while Matthew keeps the shop doors open with the help of assistant Charlotte Wood.Yet despite the physical ide, they have worked together to adapt their business model as circumstances changed. As soon as the store’s local Post Office shut, for example, they stopped orders of lifestyle products through the website. They also reduced the store’s opening hours to manage deliveries and the extra cleaning now required.The couple are both qualified yoga instructors and have a studio at the back of the store. While the physical classes have had to come to an end for now, Matthew is managing to find time on Sundays to offer a Zoom class for their regular yogis who are still keen for their weekly fix.The lockdown has resulted in more positive innovations too. As well as introducing cargo bike deliveries, The Eco Larder now offers click-and-collect. “It’s a contactless service,” says Stephanie. “We leave the goods outside the shop for people. That’s been really popular now that lockdown is easing.”Stephanie is keen to highlight Matthew’s hard work over the last few months (“I’m really proud of him for everything he’s doing and showing up every single day”), but it is thanks to both of them that their business has done so well. “We never ran out of toilet roll,” says Stephanie with pride.The couple have also been able to draw on support from various sources. Thanks to an existing relationship with a walking and cycling charity, they were able to borrow two cargo bikes and find two volunteers to do their deliveries. Being part of the Visa network has helped too. “Having the support of bigger companies is necessary for smaller businesses,” says Stephanie. “They have the resources to raise the profile of a small business like ours.”The couple have been keen to give back to others, too. Rather than charging for their deliveries, they asked for a £5 donation and put a food box together every week, based on how many deliveries they had, and delivered it to the foodbank at Tollcross community hub, which is close to the shop.Looking to the future, Stephanie and Matthew would like to open another store in Edinburgh as this would expand their zero-waste mission and allow them to reduce prices. “Being the type of shop we are, it’s all small suppliers,” states Stephanie. “It’s just an issue of supply and demand. The more demand that there is, then the lower we can provide prices.Until that is possible, the couple are focused on buying their own cargo bike and offering deliveries on all weekdays, not just three days a week – so Matthew had better get more practice miles in on his next day off too.Shop local.

However, he had found himself under increasing pressure in recent years over his links with Farah’s disgraced former coach Alberto Salazar.An independent review of UK Athletics’ links to Salazar, published earlier this year, found Fudge and the then performance director, the late Neil Black, had exerted pressure on the organisation to maintain its links with Salazar in 2015, despite mounting concerns over his methods.Salazar was found guilty of doping offences and given a four-year ban in October 2019. There is no suggestion either Fudge or Farah acted improperly.In a statement issued by British Athletics, Fudge said: “It’s a difficult time for the performance team and the sport as a whole but it has been great to see British Athletics use the opportunity to push on with recruiting the new head coach and performance director ahead of Tokyo 2021.“The time is right for me to move on and I am looking forward to watching our athletes progress and succeed at future championships.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f6aac64efabce687c0d1dd8dcf70aa6505e1ecd5/0_150_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2669d9eeab401cf84cfe1081e4088273","title":"lando norris i didnt enjoy last year because of nerves now they are gone","story":"Young British driver is raring to go following F1’s enforced break, having learned from his debut season with McLarenLando Norris climbed from his car with relief after his Formula One debut at the Australian Grand Prix last year. Having taken the flag, he was happy simply to have got the job done, too tense to take any pleasure in the experience.In Austria at this season’s long-delayed opening race next weekend he will revel in being the new boy no more. “I love racing in F1,” the 20-year-old says. “I just didn’t enjoy it nearly as much as normal last year because of all the nerves. Now they are gone.”After a season with McLaren bonding with the team and becoming the poster boy for esport racing under lockdown as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it will be an altogether more confident driver who takes to the grid at the Red Bull Ring. “I’ve missed driving a real car and pushing it to the limit,” Norris says. “It’s been the longest break I’ve ever had since I started racing at seven, so it does feel weird.”Norris and F1 are adapting to the sport’s post-virus reality, that of triple-header races and a season compressed into six months. Norris accepts the pressures of this new challenge but is typically irrepressible in his approach.“It’s going to be different, tough for the mechanics and engineers, and physically and mentally doing so many weekends close together,” he says. “But it’s also good fun to be able to do one weekend and look forward straight away to the second weekend. It’s cool to be able to get so many opportunities so quickly in a row.”When coronavirus put paid to racing, Norris ensured he was not oppressed or demotivated by the lockdown. Already a dedicated gamer and sim racer he threw himself into competing in online races. Broadcasting his performances on Twitch, his enthusiasm and dedication was infectious and he gained hundreds of thousands of followers. F1 could not have had a better ambassador for the new generation of fans they want to attract but Norris wants to make his point on the track.Norris’s impressive rookie year was part and parcel of McLaren finally performing to their potential in 2019. They finished fourth, 54 points in front of Renault, their best result since 2012. The British driver and his Spanish teammate Carlos Sainz, who will go to Ferrari in 2021, made a formidable pairing, racking up 24 points finishes between them.The confidence he clearly feels comes partly on the back of delivering such an impressive debut season. He outqualified Sainz by 11-10 and was generally within a few tenths of Sainz across the year. Moreover he was unlucky with reliability several times and there were outstanding drives too, such as his duels with Kimi Räikkönen and Pierre Gasly to take sixth in Austria.He has emerged a more rounded driver and there is a sense of how personal this is for Norris. In the office of the McLaren chief executive, Zak Brown, a water bottle sits centrally on his desk, incongruous among the model cars that decorate his workspace. It is not there by chance.“Lando got these for all of the team, water bottles for everyone and put their names on them,” Brown says, displaying his own in burnished chrome. “That’s over 800 people. He did that off his own bat. It would be really easy just to take some money and give it out but he really thought about this, it was his idea. That’s stuff the team feels. It’s special, those types of moments bring everyone closer together.”Norris plays it down as “just a little something to say thank you,” but it was an act that is indicative of the part he and Sainz have played in the transformation at McLaren. The pair brought enthusiasm and energy. Pre-pandemic, Norris who lives nearby, would go to the factory in Woking two or three times a week, use Whatsapp to take photos with mechanics, and go karting and playing golf with them. This is no gambit to get his team onside rather part of therole that he genuinely likes. “It’s part of a driver’s job to get everyone motivated, not just to be someone who turns up, drives and goes home, but at the same time I enjoy it,” he says.Much is made in F1 of the concept of drivers building a team around them, often as a box to be ticked, but with Norris and McLaren it feels like a mutual commitment. A refreshingly uncynical attitude from a driver still learning but delighting in the challenge of what is likely to be a very competitive fight in the midfield for fourth place. Norris may be relaxing into his role but the intensity, the determination is as fierce as ever.“I love what do and I wouldn’t go racing if I didn’t,” he says. “I want to have fun and enjoy everything, which is what I do as much as I can but I am still critical. I can be happy but I am never satisfied until I feel like I have done the best job I can. Every time I do something I want to do it better.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dfa8b82618ed4a4aefd6d3958cc209c9545cae31/0_50_4096_2458/master/4096.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cfffd56da6155f37fdf0227377bd176f","title":"novak djokovics coach goran ivanisevic tests positive for coronavirus","story":"Novak Djokovic’s coach, the former Wimbledon champion Goran Ivanisevic, has tested positive for coronavirus.The Croatian, who won Wimbledon in 2001, had defended Djokovic over his organisation of the ill-fated Adria Tour. The event had to be cancelled after one of the players, Grigor Dimitrov, confirmed he had tested positive.Ivanisevic supported Djokovic, who has also tested positive, telling the New York Times everyone criticising the 33-year-old was “smart now” but that the event had been given government approval.Now he has tested positive too. “Unfortunately after two negative tests in the last 10 days, I have just found out I have tested positive for Covid-19,” the 48-year old wrote on Instagram. “I feel good and don’t have any symptoms.”The event, which took place in front of crowds in Serbia and Croatia with little evidence of social distancing, was criticised by other top players. Nick Kyrgios called the decision to stage the event “boneheaded” while the British No 1, Dan Evans, described it as “a poor example to set”.Djokovic said earlier this week: “I am so deeply sorry our tournament has caused harm. Everything the organisers and I did the past month, we did with a pure heart and sincere intentions.“We believed the tournament met all health protocols and the health of our region seemed in good condition, to finally unite people for philanthropic reasons. We were wrong and it was too soon. I can’t express enough how sorry I am for this and every case of infection.”The coronavirus outbreak has also forced the Davis Cup Finals to be postponed until 2021. The event will now take place in Madrid at the end of November next year.“This is a tough decision but delivering an international team event on this scale while guaranteeing the health and safety of all involved ultimately poses too great a risk,” David Haggerty, the president of the International Tennis Federation, said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b859011a55a84536a66367431fdea9315733ea6f/0_199_3741_2245/master/3741.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=2dc33f9a6d1942eb17f41d97ab7ebf51","title":"major incident declared as people flock to england south coast","story":"Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole council says services are ‘completely overstretched’ as visitors defy advice to stay awayA major incident was declared after tens of thousands of people defied pleas to stay away and descended in their droves on beaches in Bournemouth and other stretches of the Dorset coast.The local authority, BCP council – covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole – said it was forced to instigate a multi-agency emergency response to tackle issues ranging from overcrowding on the beaches, traffic gridlock and violence. Security guards had to be used to protect refuse collection teams.Matt Hancock, the health secretary, said on TalkRadio that he had the power to close the beaches if people did not respect social-distancing rules.He said he was “reluctant” to go down that route as “people have had a pretty tough lockdown”. But he added that if there was a spike in the number of coronavirus cases “then we will take action”.The Bournemouth East MP, Tobias Ellwood, said half a million people had flocked to the beaches and said the situation was so overwhelming that the UK government should step in to help the council deal with the crisis.He said: “A lot of people have chosen to be not just irresponsible but dangerous. We’ve made such progress tackling this pandemic. I’d hate to see Bournemouth be the one place in Britain that gets that second spike.”“The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.“The numbers of people descending down here are like those seen on a bank holiday. We are not in a position to welcome visitors in these numbers now. Please do not come.”The council said services were left “completely overstretched” as visitors arrived in huge volumes resulting in widespread illegal parking, gridlock on roads, excessive waste, antisocial behaviour including excessive drinking and fights and prohibited overnight camping.The health secretary, Matt Hancock, threatened to close beaches if physical distancing laws were not adhered to.“We do have that power,’ he told Talk Radio. “I am reluctant to use it because people have had a pretty tough lockdown and I want everybody to be able to enjoy the sunshine.“But the key is to do it with respect for the rules – stay with your household, stay a good distance from other households.“But we do have those powers and if we see a spike in the number of cases then we will take action.”The chief medical officer for England, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to follow physical distancing rules in the hot weather or risk causing a spike in coronavirus.He wrote on Twitter: “If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.”Some motorists had to queue for two hours to get into Bournemouth and car parks were full by 9am on Thursday. BCP council issued 558 parking enforcement fines within a few hours – the highest ever. Families had travelled from as far afield as London and Birmingham to the beaches in Dorset.People queued for 30 minutes at ice-cream vans and refreshment stalls on the promenade as a police helicopter hovered overhead. At one point a dozen police officers and security guards stepped in as tempers briefly flared between two sets of teenagers.Phil Horton, 57, from Bournemouth, who works in the timber trade, said: “The number of people here makes me very nervous, and there’s absolutely no respect for social distancing. It seems like everyone has forgotten we are living in a pandemic.“What can the police do about it? There’s thousands and thousands of people here so they’re massively outnumbered. Good luck telling them to go home.”Rickie Inskip, a sports therapist, unfurled a banner reading: “Don’t be mean, keep the beach clean.” He used a siren and megaphone to get the attention of the beach and told them: “We love the fact you come to our beach but please don’t leave your rubbish because it was in a disgusting state last night. We urge you to keep the beach clean.”The council said refuse crews suffered abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront. Security was put in place to protect them as they collected more than 40 tonnes of rubbish.Extra police patrols were put on. Sam de Reya, Dorset police assistant chief constable, said: “These are unprecedented times and we are urging people to stay away from the area of Bournemouth beach and other Dorset beaches.“The declaration of a major incident allows us to bring agencies together so we can take actions available to us to safeguard the public as much as possible.“We are also reliant on people taking personal responsibility and strongly advise members of the public to think twice before heading to the area. Clearly we are still in a public health crisis and such a significant volume of people heading to one area places a further strain on emergency services resources.”Ellwood said it was a pity the government’s daily Covid-19 briefings had been halted as these could be a way of getting out quick, clear messages when issues like this crop up. He also said warning signs should be set up on the main roads and railway stations to warn people that the resort was already full.He said: “Bournemouth is deluged with visitors and the local authority cannot cope. We have the perfect storm of incredible weather and a liberation of some Covid-19 guidelines and given the wider consequences of a second spike, the government needs to offer assistance and respond to this dangerous event.“When you have mass demonstrations in London the politan police can call on other forces to help and I think this is what needs to happen here. The police locally are overwhelmed, they cannot be everywhere.”Stephen Allen, a resident of Sandbanks, said: “It is the illegal camping that gets us. You see people coming out of their tents in their pyjamas and head off into the sand tunes with toilet roll. It is very unpleasant.“There has been illegal parking happening all over the place. Cars have parked on cycle lanes, double yellow lines and on the pavements. They would happily take a £35 parking fine rather than queue for hours on end.”Along the Dorset coast at Lulworth, Cllr Laura Miller told of the abuse she received when she tried to turn people away. She said: “I have been shouted and sworn at and one guy spat at me.“These are people who have travelled three or four hours in their car, they are hot and grumpy and then they are turned away. Some drivers have ignored our barriers and just knocked them over and driven through.”Police officers also seized music equipment and arrested five people at Formby beach on Wednesday afternoon after young people collected on the sand dunes.Merseyside police said five people were arrested for various offences including drunk and disorderly behaviour and possession of drugs, and a speaker and music equipment were seized.Police remained at Formby beach, as well as Ainsdale and Crosby beaches, parks and beauty spots including Formby nature reserve, on foot, in vehicles and on quad bikes.Ch Insp Andy Rankine said: “While we want everyone to enjoy themselves, antisocial behaviour and criminality will not be tolerated and Merseyside police will take action where necessary.”The local authority and police in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, continued to monitor the numbers at its beach.Cllr Ian Gilbert, leader of the borough council, said: “We are aware of the situation in Bournemouth. Although we are very busy and have our own challenges to deal with including antisocial behaviour and littering, we are not currently at a stage where we need to announce a major incident. However, we are keeping everything under constant review, and liaising regularly with our partners in emergency services.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed8610ecce102bb5c379846353a3fdd70db4f118/1310_634_4700_2819/master/4700.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8ef2a7d10e06d20f41857a1da9176b9c","title":"angela merkel uk must live with consequences of weaker ties to eu brexit","story":"German leader signals trade compromise less likely as she hardens tone on no-deal Brexit The UK will have to “live with the consequences” of Boris Johnson ditching Theresa May’s plan to maintain close economic ties with the EU after Brexit, Angela Merkel has said, hardening her tone over the prospect of a no-deal scenario at the end of the year.After more than three years in which the German chancellor repeatedly emphasised her openness to a deal that would maintain the UK’s current flows of trade with the bloc, she suggested the door leading to such a compromise had now closed.“We need to let go of the idea that it is for us to define what Britain should want,” Merkel said in a wide-ranging interview with a small group of European newspapers, including the . “That is for Britain to define – and we, the EU27, will respond appropriately.”Speaking days before Germany takes over the EU rotating presidency, Merkel made clear that her priority was instead to push through a pandemic rescue plan to stop Europe’s economy sliding into the worst slump since the 1930s.Coming in the week of the fourth anniversary of the Brexit referendum, the change of rhetoric from within the chancellory also appears to quash renewed speculation in the British press that Merkel could seek to soften Brussel’s red lines to secure a last-minute deal.“With Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the British government wants to define for itself what relationship it will have with us after the country leaves,” Merkel said. “It will then have to live with the consequences, of course, that is to say with a less closely interconnected economy.“If Britain does not want to have rules on the environment and the labour market or social standards that compare with those of the EU, our relations will be less close. That will mean it does not want standards to go on developing along parallel lines.”Negotiations between the UK and EU are in deadlock over whether Britain needs to tie itself to the EU’s developing state aid rules and common environmental, social and labour standards in return for a zero-tariff trade deal.Merkel’s ambassador in Brussels, Michael Clauss, recently said he expected Brexit to command most of the political attention in the autumn, fanning British hopes that Germany’s six-month EU council presidency could push the negotiations back to the top of the political agenda before the extension period ends on 31 December.After 47 years and 30 days it was all over. As the clock struck 11pm on 31 January 2020, the UK was officially orced from the EU and began trying to carve out a new global role as a sovereign nation.

What needs to be done in this case is something extraordinary. Germany had a low debt ratio and can afford, in this extraordinary situation, to take on some more debt. It is also very important to us to keep the programme within the bounds of the European treaties. We have found a way to do that.”Her goal, Merkel said, was for the EU’s response to eventually match the multilateral response to the 2008 financial crisis. “These days, we have to do all we can to stop ourselves collapsing into protectionism. If Europe wants to be heard, then it needs to set a good example.”Merkel and Macron’s initiative faces resistance from Austria, Sweden, Denmark and the Netherlands. Even if they can sway the “frugal four”, in the coming months there is likely to be a scramble for access to recovery packag funds.“Because of the different degrees of damage inflicted by the pandemic, the distribution has to be based on a different formula from the one applied to normal European budgets,” said Merkel. “I hope that this argument will be accepted. This unusual challenge requires us to take an unusual path.“For countries which are already heavily in debt, more borrowing makes less sense than grants. I am working to convince the remaining countries which have so far been in favour of loans but against grants.”Some suggest Merkel’s seeming reinvention from arch-austerian to big spender has been forced by the German constitutional court’s ruling on 5 May, questioning the legality of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying programme, and thus the entirety of the EU’s legal regime.“Without a doubt, European law has precedence over national law – but that does not tell us where the realm of European law begins and ends,” said Merkel. “The essence of the European Union lies in the member states transferring powers. In the borderland between the spheres of jurisdiction of national and European law, friction can occur if the European level defines its limits more broadly than, for example, the German Parliament does. That’s what we are seeing in the ECB case.”While the ruling of the constitutional court in Karlsruhe represented “a conflict”, Merkel said, it did not fundamentally challenge the legal order of the EU: “That is the nature of the beast, since a nation state will always be able to lay claim to particular powers unless all powers are transferred to the European institutions, which is surely not going to happen.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0cbef8b7e457d9278b4bdfa7b22e70e624f05071/0_0_5391_3235/master/5391.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d0454555bb29d3262b57349af38745cc","title":"it looks like a gameshow russias pseudo vote on putins term limits","story":"Get-out-the-vote effort includes prize giveaways while campaign avoids focus on presidentThe people of Moscow received text messages this week telling them they had been registered to win “millions of prizes”.The catch? They have to vote on constitutional amendments that include allowing Vladimir Putin to remain in the Kremlin potentially until 2036.Organisers of Russia’s pseudo-referendum to amend the constitution – originally scheduled for 22 April but delayed owing to the coronavirus outbreak – appear to be making up the rules as they go along.In a single vote, Russians must choose whether to support a package of amendments that include pension and minimum wage boosts, a modest reorganisation of government, a constitutional mention of “faith in god”, a ban on gay marriage, exhortations to preserve Russian history, and a ban on top officials holding dual citizenship.Ads for the vote barely mention that it will also reset term limits for Putin, who has ruled since 2000. It is not an official referendum and the rules are custom-designed. Unlike in normal elections, voting is allowed online and takes place over a week, between 25 June and 1 July. As Russia continues to grapple with the coronavirus, some voting officials have decided it is safer to collect ballots outdoors, planting ballot boxes on tree stumps, in the boots of cars, in public buses and on plastic patio furniture.The referendum is both momentous and absurd. Russians can endorse (or oppose) a plan to let Putin run for two more terms, potentially prolonging his rule beyond that of Stalin, and then win a washing machine or a hairdryer.“It looks like a gameshow but I’m telling everybody I know to take this seriously, it’s enough to make you lose your mind,” said Oleg Kharlamov, a laboratory technician from Moscow who said he intended to vote against the amendments. The vote would help determine “who’s in charge for the next generation, and if we complain, they will say … ‘you voted for it’,” he said.Boris Yeltsin sacks his cabinet and appoints Putin, a political neophyte who headed the main successor to the KGB, as his acting prime minister and heir apparent.Yeltsin stuns Russia and the world by using his traditional new year message to announce his resignation and hand his sweeping powers, including the nuclear suitcase, to Putin.Putin is prevented by the constitution from running for a third term as president. The First deputy prime minister Dmitry Medvedev is elected in his stead. One of his earliest moves is to appoint Putin as prime minister, leaving little doubt that the two men plan, at the very least, to run Russia in tandem.Russia holds a yesno referendum on various topics including a proposal to amend the constitution to allow Putin to seek another two terms in the Kremlin.The raffles and prize giveaways are just part of a broad get-out-the-vote effort endorsed by the government. Companies have authorised their own prize giveaways that could allow them to track employee voting, while government workers such as teachers and doctors – some of whom are busy fighting the coronavirus outbreak – are reportedly being urged to cast ballots, in systematic attempts to boost turnout.Meanwhile, Instagram and TikTok influencers claim they have been offered millions of roubles by shady middlemen to urge their young followers to vote.Analysts say the Kremlin has concluded that the rescheduled referendum had to happen now, after Russia had declared victory over the coronavirus (despite more than 7,000 new cases a day still being reported) and before the effects of a battered economy or a potential second wave further sour public opinion.There are broad concerns that the results will be manipulated, particularly with limited scope to monitor polling places and online voting. Pavel Lobkov, a reporter for TV Rain, managed to vote in person at a polling station and then online on Thursday as the polls opened, effectively casting two ballots. Election officials said his extra vote would be discounted.There is almost no likelihood the vote will fail. Weeks before the vote, publishers had begun stocking Moscow bookstores with copies of the amended constitution.Rather than an emphatic public endorsement of Putin, the vote has more resembled a chore that must be done.“It will be something that the bureaucratic machine will be happy to get off its chest. ‘We’re done, now let’s forget about it,’” said Yekaterina Schulmann, a Moscow-based political scientist. She added that the vote was more of a burden on the Kremlin’s political resources than a chance to win a new political mandate. “It will not be the source of additional legitimacy to the political regime or to the president inidually.”The government campaign has avoided reminding Russians that they are potentially endorsing Putin’s right to rule until 2036, which Schulmann said was most isive amendment. Instead, billboards have urged Russians to “preserve family values” or featured images of the poet Alexander Pushkin saying “protect our language and culture”. Putin himself dangled the possibility of amending the constitution in 2012 but then boasted at his restraint in leaving the country’s founding document untouched. When he returned to the idea in the last year, advisors understood that the campaign would be isive. But despite calling for the referendum, Putin has exhibited a characteristic disdain for campaign politics, barely advocating for his own measures.The vote was targeted at stabilising elite circles, argued Stanovaya. “He needs a reference that he can show his elites and say: ‘I have public support to rule for as long as I believe I need to. No one of you has the right to discuss successors.”There remains debate over whether Putin will actually return for terms five and six or simply wants to avoid becoming a lame duck. As he himself argued during a TV interview last week, his potential return will put to bed discussions of a possible successor for the coming four years. Or 10. Or 16."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ceb5f537dd431b113d8329c379b7aed9957d65fb/0_138_2056_1234/master/2056.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cc8f0d736c4955661cc7d0444c461a51","title":"sumos heaviest ever wrestler urges others to keep eating habits in check","story":"Ōrora, who hit 292kg before he retired, warns wrestlers need to care of themselves after death of colleague from coronavirusJapan’s sumo wrestlers should rein in their enormous appetites and take better care of their health. The advice comes not from doctors or nutritionists, but from a former wrestler who weighed more than any other man in the sport’s long history.“It’s never easy to stay healthy as long as you’re living the life of a sumo wrestler,” Ōrora, a retired professional wrestler, or rikishi, said in a recent interview with the Asahi Shimbun, soon after a young wrestler died after contracting coronavirus. “You are the only person that can take care of yourself. Nobody in your sumo stable cares about you.”The Russian wrestler, who now uses his “civilian” name, Anatoly Mikhakhanov, said the sumo route to gaining weight – two gargantuan meals a day separated by an afternoon nap – was putting wrestlers’ health at risk.The dangers of a lifestyle that combines intense physicality and bulk-building food intake were underlined last month when Shobushi, a wrestler in one of the lower professional ranks, died from Covid-19. Doctors who treated the 28-year-old said he had several chronic health conditions.The sumo diet staple chanko nabe – a stew packed with meat, fish and vegetables – is high in protein and low in fat. But Mikhakhanov, who retired in 2018, knows to his cost how pressure to pile on the pounds can tempt wrestlers into consuming more than the 4,000 calories they need to refuel after gruelling early-morning training sessions.Weighing an already hefty 190kg when he turned professional, Mikhakhanov saw his weight increase to 292.6kg shortly before he retired. In 2017, he became the heaviest professional rikishi ever at 288kg, beating the record previously held by the Hawaii-born Konishiki, who tipped the scales at 285kg.Mikhakhanov would routinely polish off 200 pieces of sushi and a crate of beer, and found it impossible to refuse offers of extra bowls of rice from senior stablemates. As a result, he suffered from hypertension and struggled to fight off fatigue.“I would lie down right after eating, which wasn’t good,” he told the newspaper. “Just walking or moving was really troublesome.”The 37-year-old has since swapped his two huge meals a day for five smaller meals, and regular walks and gym sessions have helped him shed more than 100kg. “Of course, you can’t train unless you eat, but there’s no point in making yourself ill,” he said.Mikhakhanov was not alone in struggling to keep his eating habits in check. “Wrestlers in the highest makuuchi ision weigh and average of 160.2kg – 15kg heavier than three decades ago, and have an average body mass index of more than 47, while medical professionals warn that a BMI of 30 or higher indicates obesity.“Some are extremely diligent about what they eat some aren’t,” says Gunning, whose weight doubled to 120kg within two years of making his debut in 2004. “The bigger and heavier you are the better you’ll be. This is not an aerobic sport. If you want to be good you have to get big, and that can come at the expense of your health.”While other intense contact sports such as rugby and American football have adopted new approaches to training and nutrition, Japan’s de facto national sport is anchored to tradition.“There is pressure on wrestlers to get bigger and stronger, but there has been no significant change in training methods or nutrition,” says Gunning, who represented Ireland three times at the sumo world championships. “They’re doing the same exercise routines, eating the same things and living the same lifestyle as 20 years ago … or 200 years ago.”The Japan Sumo Association has published 10 health guidelines that include eating fish and vegetables, in addition to meat, chewing food properly and avoiding crisps, cakes and other snacks. The association conducts regular health checks on wrestlers, but enforcing good eating habits is practically impossible among stables with contrasting attitudes towards nutrition and health.“Most wrestlers are in their late teens and early 20s in a testosterone-fuelled support. They’re fighting every day and they don’t have much freedom,” says Gunning. “The pressure builds but there’s no way to release it. Overeating relieves stress and gets you big. I did it myself.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0e066c47163e66ee19067b2569ff23981add8473/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1abbb10fc0737ede5061eef515ac6ace","title":"swedes rapidly losing trust in covid 19 strategy poll finds","story":"Political parties demand Sweden’s strategy be reviewed before next election in 2022Swedes are losing trust in authorities’ handling of the coronavirus, as the man behind the country’s light-touch approach called lockdowns a form of madness and political parties demanded the Swedish strategy be reviewed before the next election in 2022.“The differences are big enough that we can say with certainty that there has been a real change,” an Ipsos analyst, Nicklas Källebring, told the paper. “The view of authorities’ capabilities has taken a clear negative turn.”Unlike most EU countries, Sweden did not try to shut society down. It closed schools for the over-16s and banned gatherings of more than 50 people, but otherwise relied on Swedes’ sense of civic responsibility to observe physical distancing and home working guidelines. Shops, restaurants and gyms remained open.Authorities argued that public health should be viewed in the broadest sense, saying the kind of strict mandatory lockdowns imposed elsewhere were both unsustainable over the long run and could have serious secondary impacts including increased unemployment and mental health problems.“It was as if the world had gone mad and everything we had discussed was forgotten,” Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s chief epidemiologist and the man behind the strategy, told a Swedish Radio podcast on Wednesday. “The case became too many, and the political pressure got too great. And then Sweden stood there somewhat alone.”But while broadly supported by most Swedes, the policy, which Tegnell has said was aimed not at achieving herd immunity but at slowing the spread of the virus enough for health services to cope, was heavily criticised by many experts as the country’s death toll increased.Sweden’s 5,230 deaths translates to a toll per million inhabitants of 511, many times higher than the corresponding totals in neighbouring Denmark (104), Finland (59) and Norway (47), all of which imposed strict confinements – but lower than the 650 registered in the UK, Spain’s 606 and Italy’s 573.Sweden has also been slow to get its testing programme off the ground, with per capita rates significantly lower than many European countries – although the number of people tested for Covid-19 nearly doubled in June, hitting 60,000 last week.As a result, many European countries now opening up to tourism have barred Swedes from entry until 30 June, while to its considerable annoyance the county’s neighbours have also excluded it from a Nordic travel bubble.Tegnell conceded earlier this month that the country has had too many deaths – particularly in care homes – from Covid-19, should have done more to curb the spread of the virus, and would “do something in between what Sweden did and what the rest of the world has done” if confronted with the disease now.But he has also insisted that “the basic strategy worked well” and “based on the knowledge we had then, we feel we made the appropriate decisions”. Löfven has said the country’s overall approach was right but it had failed to protect care homes, where half of all Sweden’s Covid-19 deaths have occurred.Under opposition pressure, Löfven in May promised a wide-ranging independent review of Sweden’s coronavirus strategy looking into specific failings such as testing and care homes, as well as the general approach and subsequent decision-making.After a meeting of party leaders, the government has now undertaken to ensure the review is completed by early 2022, partly on the grounds that any lessons should be learned fast but also to make sure there was full accountability before the next parliamentary election due in September that year.“The government did the only thing reasonable. There were several parties demanding that this must absolutely be clear before the next election,” said the Moderate party leader, Ulf Kristersson."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af4201478abe45f333400a189a57ccd7d1c5c04e/0_78_2333_1400/master/2333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9614312d68c82cf71aea0dc956b410f7","title":"uk foreign office urged to secure safety of three human rights activists","story":"MPs call for intervention amid fears activists face risk from Covid-19 outbreak The UK Foreign Office has been urged by a cross party group of British MPs to intervene to secure the safety of three prominent Gulf human rights activists, including Saudi women’s rights campaigner Loujain al-Hathloul, who are thought to be at risk from the coronavirus outbreak still present in prisons across the region.The MPs calling for a Foreign Office human rights intervention include the father of the house Peter Bottomley and they see the three cases as a test for the UK human rights policy in the coronavirus era. The letter coincides with the UN international day for victims of torture on Friday, and all three claim to have been tortured.Loujain’s sister Lina, who is based in Brussels, told the  that her family had spoken to her a fortnight ago, and she had expressed fears that she will not be able to speak to them again for many months.The campaigner for the women’s right to drive was arrested in May 2018 and although women can now drive in the kingdom, there appears no prospect of her release, or even proper trial.“One of the charges against her is meeting with a British embassy official in Riyadh, so I hope the foreign office realises it has a special responsibility to do everything to campaign for her,” Lina al-Hathoul said. “Her morale was very low psychologically. The last time she was not allowed to see anyone for three months she was tortured, so it is urgent to do more to campaign for her release.”Caroline Lucas, one of the MPs part of the cross party group, challenged the Foreign Office approach: “By refusing to speak out about the ongoing abuse of these brave iniduals, the government is once again putting its pursuit of preferential trade deals ahead of human rights. Its vision of a ‘Global Britain’ is looking like one where moral values are tossed aside in the name of political expediency.”Brendan O’Hara MP, Argyll \u0026amp Bute, chair of the all party group on Democracy and Human Rights in the Gulf said “with Brexit fast approaching, it is paramount that human rights are at the centre of UK foreign policy”.Loujain has been held in the Saudi Arabia’s maximum security al-Ha’ir prison complex near Riyadh for more than two years. Last year 13 UN experts called for her immediate release. Concern is also being expressed for Ahmed Mansoor,who was handed a 10-year sentence by the United Arab Emirates for “insulting the rank and reputation of the UAE and their symbols” and “disseminating false information to damage the United Arab Emirates’ reputation abroad”. Despite successive hunger strikes, he has been held in solitary confinement and is said to have neither a bed nor access to water.His state of health has deteriorated sharply, his supporters said. New coronavirus cases in the UAE have spiked up to 450 new cases per day and Human Rights Watch has reported outbreaks in UAE jails. Total deaths across the UAE has reached 307.The third activist for which concern is expressed by the MPs is Abduljalil Al Singace, a Bahrain activist sentenced to life for criticising the government. Bahraini activist, Maryam Al Khawaja, whose father Abdulhadi Al Khawaja is also at Jau Prison along with Al Singace, reported that there are confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the prison.King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa of Bahrain is thought to have presided over one of the most effective attempts to combat coronavirus with only 68 deaths, but there was a spike last week with new infections currently running at 550 per day.Partly on the advice of British public health advisers, the king has pardoned 901 prisoners while more than 500 more will be allowed to serve out their sentences outside prison.“On this important day of solidarity, we must not forget the suffering of these brave activists. It’s time for the foreign office to end its soft touch policy towards the Gulf and call for their immediate and unconditional releases, said Sayed Ahmed Alwadaei, the director of advocacy for the Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy.The Foreign Office says some of its successful work on inidual human rights cases comes through private lobbying, rather than public condemnation. It is also introducing a UK sanctions regime to make it easier to impose travel bans and asset freezes on egregious human rights abusers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/08b1f34dab873da39def03b61cae4b908e1244e9/0_8_2739_1643/master/2739.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ebe92d3952a06f1a59cba88e8dd2a1cc","title":"andrzej krauze europe easing lockdown cartoon social distancing","story":"While many Europeans would like life to return to normal in the holiday season, anxiety and confusion surround the rules on social distancing"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60720b4ecaf56cbe128e88dd93d10a18ff0cdcd2/0_205_3072_1843/master/3072.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=643eb9653ec3778929568881390a9d17","title":"coronavirus live news cases rise in 27 us states as cdc estimates 20m americans may have been infected","story":"WHO needs $31.3bn over 12 months for vaccines France plans 1.3m tests to find ‘hidden clusters’ Mike Pence to hold first taskforce briefing in weeksFlorida is reporting a record-high number of new coronavirus cases in a single day, after the state set its last record earlier this week.The Florida department of health reported 8,942 new cases from yesterday, shattering the state’s previous single-day record of 5,506 cases, which was reported on Wednesday.Florida has confirmed 122,960 coronavirus cases in total and the state has lost 3,366 residents to the virus so far.

The website hopes to give an idea of how busy the resorts are likely to be in the coming days.One town has put in beach markings to indicate 3 square metres.“We have implemented what we call ‘beach bubbles’, where one family or friends can be together in a safe way and to visualise the distance that they should be from one another,” Anthony Wittesaele, town councillor for tourism, told Reuters.Swimming in the sea off Belgium is banned until the on-season, when lifeguards are patrolling. It was delayed from May until this Saturday and runs until mid-September.A few more pictures from Mondragone in southern Italy, where the military was sent in to restore order after a coronavirus outbreak at an apartment complex illegally occupied by hundreds of migrant workers caused angry confrontations with residents.The area has been sealed off and people will need to quarantine for two weeks, the regional president has said.

Overall, a total of 8,911,226 tests have been carried out and 309,360 cases have been confirmed positive.The figure for the number of people tested has been “temporarily paused to ensure consistent reporting” across all methods of testing.“At this time, it is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars,” Abbott said in a press release. “The actions in this executive order are essential to our mission to swiftly contain this virus and protect public health.”For more on this and all the latest on the coronavirus crisis in the US, you can follow our dedicated US blog here:The Greek prime minister, Kyriakos Mitsotakis, and the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, discussed the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic by phone on Friday, the Greek leader’s office said – a rare such contact for two neighbours at odds over a range of issues.Erdoğan and Mitsotakis addressed ways of handling the effects of the coronavirus outbreak, the reopening of borders and the re-establishment of tourist flows, a statement from Mitsotakis’s office said.“Mr Mitsotakis and Mr Erdoğan agreed to keep the bilateral channels of communication open,” it said.

The move comes just days after the company announced it would invest €490m (£445m) to build a new vaccine production site in France that would create 200 jobs, during a factory visit alongside Emmanuel Macron.Company officials did not mention the coming layoffs during the visit, “but the French authorities knew that we had a restructuring to carry out,” Sanofi’s France chief, Olivier Bogillot, told AFP on Friday.The layoffs will be voluntary, and will affect marketing and support isions as well as some research jobs.The Federal University of São Paulo (Unifesp) is in talks to test a potential coronavirus vaccine developed by Italian researchers, the dean of the Brazilian university told Reuters. With the world’s worst outbreak outside the US, Brazil has become a leading front in the global race for a vaccine, as clinical trials are likely to yield results faster in places where the virus is widespread. Soraya Smaili, the president of Unifesp, said on Wednesday: “We are already in advanced discussions with Italy’s Lazzaro Spallanzani National Institute. We expect to bring it here, the accord is already moving forward and we’ll be able to do a lot of studies with this vaccine.” The Italian researchers want to conduct midstage trials and final phase three studies involving thousands of subjects in Brazil, Smaili said. Around the world at a glance:Some powerful US senators are pushing back against an attempt by the Trump administration’s Treasury Department to weaken a watchdog panel involved with overseeing $2.4tn in pandemic aid, according to three congressional aides. The Trump administration has petitioned the US supreme court to invalidate the Obamacare law, which added millions to the healthcare safety net, seeking to scrap coverage during the novel coronavirus crisis. More than 9.62 million people have been reported to be infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 489,208 have died, a Reuters tally showed as of 1222 GMT on Friday.  Russia reported on Friday 6,800 new coronavirus cases, the first daily rise below 7,000 since late April, taking its nationwide tally of infections to 620,794. Ireland plans to lift from 9 July a 14-day quarantine for people arriving from countries that have also suppressed the coronavirus, acting prime minister, Leo Varadkar, said on Thursday. Argentine doctors are predicting coronavirus cases will peak in coming weeks as the southern hemisphere winter sets in, straining hospital intensive care units after confirmed cases accelerated past 50,000. The governor of Texas temporarily halted the state’s reopening on Thursday as Covid-19 infections and the number of people admitted to hospital surged, as the US set a new record for a one-day increase in cases. Mexico’s health ministry on Thursday reported 6,104 new confirmed cases and 736 deaths. The finance ministry said it has initiated epidemiological contact tracing after the finance minister, Arturo Herrera, tested positive for the virus. Japan recorded on Friday more than 100 new infections for the first time since 9 May, hitting its highest daily total since it eased a lockdown, Kyodo News reported. Thailand confirmed on Friday four new coronavirus cases, all of which were imported from abroad, marking 32 days without community transmission.  Israel and the United Arab Emirates will cooperate in the fight against the coronavirus, the two countries said on Thursday, in a possible boost to Israeli efforts to normalise relations with Gulf Arab countries. Nigeria’s outbreak may push 5 million people into poverty as it triggers the worst recession in the African country since the 1980s, the World Bank said. The World Health Organization-led coalition fighting the coronavirus needs $31.3 bn over the next 12 months to develop and roll out tests, treatments and vaccines, it said on Friday. The WHO initiative aims to scale up delivery of 500m tests and 245m courses of treatments to low- and middle-income countries by mid-2021, it said in a statement. It also aims to scale up delivery of 2bn vaccine doses, including 1 bn to be bought by low- and middle-income countries, by the end of 2021.Vaxart Inc said on Friday it would test its potential Covid-19 vaccine on monkeys in a study organised by the Trump Administration’s vaccine-acceleration program called Operation Warp Speed.Vaxart said the vaccine is an oral tablet and is easier to store and administer than injectable ones. There are no approved vaccines for the coronavirus, and several companies including AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc have been rushing to develop a viable vaccine candidate. Executives and other experts have suggested clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could take a minimum of 12 to 18 monthsThe World Health Organization is holding a press briefing, which you can watch at the top of this blog. They are talking about the Access to Covid-19 Tools Accelerator, or the ACT Accelerator, which is designed to accelerate the development, production and equitable distribution of vaccines, diagnostics and therapeutics for coronavirus.Italy has sent soldiers to restore order in a coastal town near Naples after a coronavirus outbreak at an apartment complex illegally occupied by hundreds of migrant workers caused angry confrontations with residents, Reuters reports.The authorities announced on Thursday that more than 40 people living at the abandoned buildings in Mondragone, 45km from Naples, had tested positive for Covid-19, and warned the entire town could be quarantined if the outbreak proves widespread.The apartment buildings were sealed off to prevent the spread of infection but footage on RAI state TV from Thursday showed a group of residents defying the order to stay put and marching through the town in protest at what they said was raciial discrimination.Many of those living at the complex are Bulgarians working as seasonal fruit pickers in the fields around the town."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8f134cdbf097995186ccf78f6b3f7d82a1db5804/0_0_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca888a6142f7427eb20069937c8684b5","title":"nine points up on europe data shows uk increase in lgbtq harassment","story":"Before 51st anniversary of Stonewall riots, survey reveals rise in incidents of violence LGBTQ+ people in the UK and across Europe still face high levels of discrimination in all aspects of everyday life, according to a survey conducted last month by the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA). The survey – the largest of its kind ever conducted – focused on the social experiences of lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and intersex people in 30 European countries, and found that little progress has been made over the past seven years. Before the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, at the end of a Pride month marked by the cancellation of public events in light of the Covid-19 pandemic, we take a look at what the results reveal about the issues facing LGBTQ+ people in the UK.The European averages hide significant differences between the countries, and an increase in overall negative statistics appears to be linked to the adoption of actively discriminatory policies introduced in recent years across the continent. The study shows that trans and intersex respondents face even higher levels of prejudice than other categories: since 2012 they have experienced a disproportionate rise in discrimination and violence in all areas of daily life. In the UK, discrimination in the workplace in particular remains significantly high.Miltos Pavlou, the survey’s programme manager at the FRA, told the  that the results hinted at “a strong claim of trans people to participate in the labour market and in everyday life, and to be protected from discrimination”, as well as more openness by trans people about their gender identity.Like most respondents across Europe, people in the UK who say the situation has deteriorated blame “negative public discourse by politicians andor political parties”, as well as “lack of enforcement of existing law and policies” as the main contributing factors.New legislation introducing compulsory relationships education for primary school pupils and relationships and sex education for secondary pupils is due to come into force in England from September 2020.Bradlow hailed the introduction of the new regulations as a historic moment: “A whole generation will attend schools that not only accept LGBTQ people and same-sex relationships, but also celebrate and offer support on issues that young LGBTQ people face. Just think of the change that inclusive education will bring to the lives of so many young people.”The FRA survey’s full results can be accessed through their online data explorer."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Friends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transition"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289344.1593178042!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phoenix park gates to stay shut to keep safe quiet spaces for pedestrians and cyclists","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe OPW on Friday morning said it will not reopen all  the Phoenix Park gates on Monday, and has not set any future date for their reopening. Photograph: Nick BradshawThe entrance gates to Dublin’s Phoenix Park that have been closed since March in response to coronavirus travel restrictions, will not be reopened on Monday as previously planned, the Office of Public Works (OPW) has said.Motorists are also set to face new restrictions in the coming months to “curb traffic volumes” and for “maintaining safe, quiet, open spaces for pedestrians and cyclists to enjoy” in the park the OPW confirmed.Following the introduction of the 2km travel restrictions in March, the OPW closed the park gates to traffic with the exception of the Castleknock and Parkgate Street entrances.These gates remained open to allow the continued use of Chesterfield Avenue as a through-road, and to maintain access for park residences, such as Áras an Uachtaráin and the US ambassador’s residence, as well as Garda Headquarters. However, all car parking in the park was banned.In line with the Government’s roadmap for the lifting of Covid-19 restrictions, the OPW reopened some car parks, including the facility beside the papal cross, on May 18th, but parking remains banned on Chesterfield Avenue with the hard shoulder instead converted into cycle lanes.It had planned to reopen all the gates from 10am on June 8th, in line with phase two of the roadmap, but following consultation with the Garda it decided to delay the reopening until June 29th.However, the OPW on Friday morning said it will not reopen the gates on Monday, and has not set any future date for their reopening. It has also given its strongest signal yet that the use of the park as a “throughway” to the city could be brought to an end and said “further measures to curb traffic volumes in the park are likely to be introduced in the coming months.”Thousands of people signed an online petition, initiated by Green Party councillor Michael Pidgeon last month, calling for the end of the use of the park as a throughway for motorists.The OPW was “determined to ensure that the park is a safe, quiet, green space for our visitors, where flora and fauna thrives and where visitors’ health and wellbeing can be enhanced through experiencing the natural environment in the park,” OPW commissioner John McMahon said“With this in mind, reducing the volume of ‘through-traffic’ is critical and maintaining safe, quiet, open spaces for pedestrians and cyclists to enjoy is a key priority for OPW.”Visitors are asked to ensure that they park responsibly in designated car parking areas only.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Niall CarsonPA WirePolice searching for missing Belfast teenager Noah Donohue (14) have found his missing backpack, book and laptop. Supt Muir Clark said they were recovered in north Belfast following a call from a member of the public, and are now being examined by specialist officers. He described the recovery of the laptop as “significant”, and said that with other electronic devices “that will form a major line of inquiry now as to where Noah possibly is or if Noah was going to see someone, who that was.” Inquiries were ongoing, he said, as to how the bag and laptop came to be in that location. “We do not believe that at this stage the current find is related to Noah going missing,” he said. Meanwhile a 26-year-old man has been arrested in connection with social media posts about the boy’s disappearance and is currently helping police with their enquiries. Speaking at a press conference in north Belfast on Friday, Supt Clark said he had “previously commented about various rumours circulating about Noah’s disappearance” and had explained that “this type of commentary and rumour was distressing for Noah’s family and unhelpful as we continue our search to find Noah.“Last night we became aware of social media posts. We are aware of the content of these social media posts and are content there is no truth behind their content,” he said. Police do not believe the man was involved in Noah’s disappearance. A large-scale search for the 14-year-old has been taking place in north Belfast since Sunday, and was widened on Thursday to include the Antrim Road and the city centre. Noah’s school, St Malachy’s College in north Belfast, has also been searched. Supt Clark said on Friday that the main search area continues to be in the area of Shore Road, bounded by Premier Drive and Skegoneill Avenue. “There is significant work ongoing this morning in clearing vegetation in that area so that we can check it again,” he said, adding that he appealed to householders in that area to again check outbuildings, shrubbery, and any area of garden or premises where Noah might be. “That is the key bit of our investigation at the moment,” he said ‘Out of character’The teenager was last seen in the Northwood Road area in the north of the city just after 6pm on Sunday.He had cycled across the city from his home in south Belfast to north Belfast, where police believe he may have fallen off his bicycle and hit his head. He was seen discarding his clothes and cycling naked, actions which police and his family said were “completely out of character.” Police believe he then discarded his bicycle and left the area on foot. His helmet, trainers, hoodie and mobile phone were recovered by police on Wednesday.Supt Clark said the police’s main line of inquiry was that Noah had fallen off his bicycle and may have suffered some form of trauma which had left him either disorientated or incapacitated. He also made a specific appeal for two items of Noah’s clothing - a khaki green North Face coat and grey sweat shorts - which have not yet been found by police. “We need to find these outstanding items. If anyone has found any of these items and not yet come forward, please call us immediately on 101,” he said.“Again, I would like to thank everyone who has contacted police so far with information. If you have any information that you think might help, if you have any CCTV or dashcam footage that you think might help and have not yet come forward, please call us on 101 straight away.” Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287457.1593011275!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"c day everything you need to know about today s political drama","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe leaders of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil  and the Greens were  expected to meet on Thursday to decide how to configure government departments and allocate inidual portfolios to each party. Graphic: The Paul Scott How does the voting process work in each party?The ratification processes in Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens for the draft programme for government are coming to an end.Votes will be counted on Friday.Fine Gael requires the approval of its internal electoral college, rather than every party member, and only has 700 votes to count.It is expected that its count will begin after lunchtime on Friday and will be relatively short.The Greens’ count will start at noon with a result expected between 6pm and 7pm.The Greens and Fianna Fáil are running one member, one vote ballot and will take longer to count than Fine Gael.Fianna Fáil expects its own count to be concluded around tea time.Just under 2,000 people - 1,962 - are eligible to vote in the Greens’ contest, with around 14,500 in Fianna Fáil. Of those registered to vote for the Greens, 195 are from Northern Ireland.With a large number of Green Party elected representatives from Northern Ireland against the deal, it is expected most of the 195 northern members could oppose the deal.However, the number of those who registered to vote from Northern Ireland was relatively low - giving hope to those in favour of a deal.The Greens initially allowed telephone voting only for members outside the the Republic and Northern Ireland, but this week widened the eligibility to allow anyone who has not received their ballot paper to vote over the phone.Those wishing to do so must email the Green Party headquarters with their name, email, phone number, address, and a suitable time to vote by phone. Party officials will then check that person is eligible to vote.A special code which the voter will need to vote by phone will then be sent by email, and this code must be quoted over the phone when the vote is cast. Postal votes for those who vote by phone will be cancelled.A degree of co-ordination in the announcement of the three parties’ results on Friday is expected but has not yet been finalised.If the three parties approve the deal, what happens next?There will be a full sitting of the Dáil in the Convention Centre, Dublin, on Saturday morning to elect Fianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin as Taoiseach.The Dáil cannot sit in Leinster House due to the need for social distancing if all TDs are present.The sitting will begin at 10.30am and the proposer and seconder for each nominee for the position of taoiseach will get five minutes speaking time each.This will be followed by ten minutes of speeches from each party or group that has not put forward a nomination for Taoiseach.Votes will then be taken and, when, as expected, Mr Martin is elected, he will then be invited by the Ceann Comhairle to make a brief statement.The House will then adjourn to allow Mr Martin receive his seal of office from President Micheal D Higgins in Áras an Uachtaráin, which is expected to happen at around 12.30pm.The details of how this ceremony - and the later ceremony where the new Cabinet receive their seals of office from Mr Higgins - will operate with social distancing have not yet been finalised.When will the Cabinet be picked?Upon receiving his seal from the President, it is expected Mr Martin would then travel to his new office in Government Buildings where he will appoint the new Cabinet.Fianna Fáil will have six full Cabinet posts, as will Fine Gael, and the Greens three. Leo Varadkar will choose the Fine Gael nominees and Eamon Ryan will choose the Green nominees.The three leaders are expected to meet on Thursday to decide how to configure government departments and allocate inidual portfolios to each party.Each leader, however, will choose their own people for their allocated portfolios without the need to consult the other leaders.When will the Dáil sit again?The House is expected to reconvene at 4.30pm on Saturday when the members of the new cabinet will be nominated for approval by the Dáil. The Taoiseach will make a ten minute speech, as will the leaders of all parties and groups, with 100 minutes in total set aside for speeches on the nominations of new ministers.However, this stage of the process can drag on and could stretch on longer than expected. Votes will be taken at the conclusion of speeches and the new cabinet will travel to Áras an Uachtaráin to receive their seals of office and hold their first meeting.What about the Taoiseach’s nominees to the Seanad?The Government believes a new taoiseach must nominate 11 members of the Upper House in order for crucial legislation to be passed through the Oireachtas, such as the renewal of the Offences Against the State Act.The Government says this cannot be done by Mr Varadkar as acting taoiseach.Of the 11, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael will each choose four and the Greens will get two. The remaining one will be an Independent nominee, most likely from Northern Ireland.The Programme for Government says at least half of those nominated should be women.Mr Martin is expected to nominate the 11 on Saturday, with the fully constituted Seanad then expected to sit on Monday to deal with outstanding legislation.And if one of the three does not ratify coalition?The political system will be thrown into crisis. There are several scenarios that could play out. Taoiseach Leo Varadkar could try to dissolve the Dáil. He has said consistently that his party is interested only in a stable government involving three parties and not Independents. That is borne from past experience where governments that relied on Independent TDs became increasingly unstable as iniduals withdrew support, either over a constituency or national decision that affected their policy areas.Would that mean an election?Not necessarily. The State is still in the middle of arguably the worst crisis in its history and the question arises as to the advisability of holding an election when the pandemic is still live. Besides, the decision of the Taoiseach would not be final. One of the few executive powers the President has is conferred under Article 13 of the Constitution. He may “in his absolute discretion refuse to dissolve the Dáil”. If he refused, it would mean that parties would have to re-engage to see if an alternative administration could be agreed. If an election is held, it must be held within 30 days of the Dáil being dissolved.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4289407.1593172804!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government formation fg accepts historic coalition with ff and green results awaited","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe leaders of Fine Gael (Leo Varadkar), Fianna Fáil (Micheál Martin) and the Greens (Eamon Ryan).

Photograph: Damien Eagers If the coalition takes office, Mr Murphy, one of Fine Gael leader Leo Varadkar’s closest allies, is expected to instead take up a position which will link the party organisation and the parliamentary party. Well-placed sources said Mr Murphy has been relaxed in recent weeks, knowing what was planned for him in a new coalition arrangement. Mr Varadkar has spoken about devoting more energy to rebuilding the party and it is expected Mr Murphy will help lead those efforts.The shape of the next Cabinet was being hammered out on Friday as members of Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party vote on an historic Coalition government.The verdict of the members of the three parties will be revealed on Friday evening, either clearing the way for a new government or precipitating an immediate political crisis and a possible general election.If the programme for government meets with the approval of party members, it will see the coming together of Civil War parties with the support of the Green Party to form a majority. All eyes will be on the result of the Green Party vote, due to be revealed between 6pm and 7pm. And as counting of votes continued on Friday the ministries in the proposed government were being allocated. Sources said that a number of departments – such as Health, Agriculture, Social Protection, Communications and Education – are yet to be decided.However, Fine Gael is expected to take the Department of Justice while Fianna Fáil will take the Department of Housing. Fine Gael will also take Finance and Foreign Affairs and it is also expected it will take the Department of Jobs.The Department of Children will become the Department of Children, Disability and Equality and a new Department of Climate, Energy, Transport and Natural Resources will be created, although their names will be tidied up. The latter is expected to go to Green Party leader Eamon Ryan. A junior ministry responsible for roads is expected to be allocated to either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. There will be three “super juniors”, it is understood – one for each of the parties, including the government chief whip, which is likely to be a Fianna Fáil appointment, if Micheál Martin is elected taoiseach tomorrow.Super juniorsFianna Fáil is expected to take the position of Government Chief Whip, with the other two super juniors at Cabinet going to Fine Gael and the Greens. It is not yet clear which of the super juniors from Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael will take on responsibility for the roads portfolio.Super juniors are junior ministers who don’t have responsibility for a full government department but who sit at the cabinet table.Fine Gael will be allocated the position of deputy whip and the Greens will get assistant whip. The Department of Rural Affairs is slated for abolition, although it is not clear where its responsibilities will be transferred to.The Greens are set to have a total of four TDs at the cabinet table if the party approves the programme for government today and the coalition is formed over the weekend. The party will have three full cabinet ministries, including Mr Ryan’s, and also a “super junior”. Deputy Green Party leader Catherine Martin and Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman are also tipped for Cabinet for the Greens. The Greens are expected to have four junior ministers, including the super junior at cabinet.The three party leaders met on Thursday and were meeting again on Friday evening amid feverish speculation about the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil nominees for the cabinet. The two parties will have six cabinet members each, plus one super-junior each, and seven other junior ministers, it is expected.Within Fine Gael, four current Cabinet members are viewed as certainties – Leo Varadkar, Paschal Donohoe, Simon Coveney and Heather Humphreys. After that, Helen McEntee is tipped for promotion from the junior ranks to a full cabinet job, which leaves one full cabinet job and the super junior role – with several outgoing ministers seeking each.Mr Donohoe’s nomination on Thursday to be the head of the Eurogroup council of finance ministers suggests that he will remain in the Department of Finance. It is also expected that Mr Coveney will remain in the Department of Foreign Affairs, though sources say that there is no agreement from the other parties yet.Minister for Health Simon Harris is widely credited with an effective handling of the Covid-19 crisis, especially in its early stages, and a demotion from Cabinet would be seen as extremely harsh. Ending of careersEither way, if the Government is formed tomorrow, Mr Varadkar will have no option but to end the cabinet careers of several long-standing Fine Gael ministers, with Michael Ring, Joe McHugh, Charlie Flanagan, Paul Kehoe, Josepha Madigan and Richard Bruton all thought by their colleagues to be unlikely to make cabinet, though some sources speculate that a role will be found for Mr Bruton, and others may fill junior minister roles.Those close to Mr Bruton, the outgoing Minister for Communications, continued to lobby for his retention at Cabinet. A source close to Mr Bruton said he “has to be included in the cabinet”, citing his work during the government formation talks on agreeing the key 7 per cent annual average emissions reductions target sought by the Greens.“Leo moved him to communications because of his ability to get things done without a lot of controversy,” he source said. “He got what had been a highly controversial plan to deliver broadband to every house in the country signed, sealed and delivered, and he got the first ever climate action plan done. “He’ll have an honest to god role to play in brokering the difficult climate stuff that’ll have to be agreed to deliver 7 per cent. The first carbon budget for the first half of the decade is going to be very tricky.”In Fianna Fáil, as the party anticipates a return to government for the first time in almost a decade, the situation is more fluid. With Micheál Martin poised to become taoiseach, it is considered certain that Michael McGrath will take the role of Minister for Public Expenditure. Barry Cowen, Jack Chambers and Dara Colleary are also tipped for cabinet or super-junior roles, while Darragh O’Brien, Anne Rabbitte, Thomas Byrne or new Kerry TD Norma Foley could also figure.The fate of justice spokesman Jim O’Callaghan is much discussed in party circles.

Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsMinister for Finance Paschal Donohoe is expected to put himself forward as a candidate for the presidency of the Eurogroup, the influential club of finance ministers of countries that use the euro.The Minister will be forced to show his hand because the deadline for candidacies is on Thursday, which makes for awkward timing because parties do not conclude voting on the programme for government until Friday.“It’s tricky for him. It’s a gamble,” said one EU official. “But if he runs, he would be a serious candidate.”Mr Donohoe is thought to have wide support as a potential compromise candidate among Eurogroup members, as Ireland is viewed as a middle-ground country that straddles Europe’s north-south isions on economic matters.The job involves forging consensus in the informal but powerful group and would come at a crucial time ahead of an expected downturn across the EU.Coalition formationThe campaign by Spain’s deputy prime minister for the economy, Nadia Calviño, has already kicked off, and Mr Donohoe’s supporters in Europe have been forced to grapple with the complexities of Irish coalition formation in recent days in an attempt to understand whether his candidacy is certain.Luxembourg’s finance minister, Pierre Gramegna, has also been named as a potential contender for the job.Leaders Micheál Martin, Leo Varadkar and Eamon Ryan will meet on Thursday to discuss the allocation of ministerial portfolios.If Mr Donohoe applies for the Eurogroup position, it will be taken as an indication that he is confident he will stay in the Department of Finance.Such a scenario would likely see Fianna Fáil’s Michael McGrath become minister for public expenditure and reform, with Mr Donohoe and Mr McGrath swapping roles when Mr Varadkar takes over as taoiseach from Mr Martin in 2022.Voting is due to take place on July 9th, by which time Mr Donohoe’s position as finance minister will need to be clear, for him to have a chance of success.The best news and analysis from the campaign trail"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4288847.1593118692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"foreign travel green list of countries may change every two weeks","story":"In potentially his last press conference as Taoiseach, Leo Varadkar has thanked the people of Ireland for the sacrifices they made during the Covid-19 pandemic.

At this point the limit will rise to 100 people indoors and 500 people outdoors.But churches and places of worship will be exempt from the 50-person indoor limit, Mr Varadkar said.“The Cabinet agreed that we would make an exception for places of worship. However the specific protocol is going to be worked out with churches and religious bodies to allow more people to attend religious ceremonies. It will be very much policed by them.”He said the move was to acknowledge the fact that there are some large churches that can accommodate more than 50 people with social distancing.Catholic Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin earlier this week described the limit of 50 people attending churches as “strange” and “disappointing”.Mr Varadkar also said he has been Taoiseach for three years and “it has been the greatest honour”.He said the country owed a “profound debt” to chief medical officer Tony Holohan. He also thanked assistant Secretary General at the Department of Taoiseach Liz Canavan and the members of the National Public Health Emergency Team.Mr Varadkar also said he believed it would be appropriate to hold a “memorial day” in honour of those who have lost their lives to Covid-19 and frontline workers but that the discussion was premature as the pandemic is ongoing.The Government also agreed to make it mandatory to wear face masks on public transport.Minister for Health Simon Harris said there will be sanction for a breach of the rules which will be enacted in the next seven to ten days.Mr Harris also said that Ireland has seen the biggest drop in new cases across the European Union.“From Monday we will lift travel restrictions right across this country and reunite with desperately missed friends and family.”“It will be a week of immense emotion and joy.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4279871.1592249606!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"making a cabinet eamon ryan set to head up new department of climate action and transport","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGreen Party leader Eamon Ryan before government-formation talks at Government Buildings, Dublin. Photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollinsThe Green Party is set to have four TDs at the cabinet table if the party approves the programme for government today and the coalition is formed over the weekend.The Greens will have three full cabinet ministries, and also a “super junior” , a junior minister who does not have responsibility for a full government department but who sits at the cabinet table.The three Green TDs to hold full cabinet rank are expected to be party leader Eamon Ryan, who is expected to take over a new department of climate action and transport, deputy leader Catherine Martin, who may take a new department with responsibility for communications and culture, and the Dublin West TD Roderic O’Gorman who is tipped take a new department with responsibility for equality, integration and children. The Greens are expected to have four junior ministers, including the super junior at cabinet.Planning continuesWhile the outcome of the vote in the Green Party remains uncertain, planning continues for the construction of the new government. The three party leaders met yesterday to discuss the organisation of departments, but sources say that a number of issues are not yet resolved. It is expected that the three men will meet again today.There is feverish speculation about the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil nominees for the cabinet. The two parties will have six cabinet members each, plus one super-junior each, and seven other junior ministers, it is expected.Within Fine Gael, four current Cabinet members are viewed as certainties - Leo Varadkar, Paschal Donohoe, Simon Coveney and Heather Humphreys. After that, Helen McEntee is tipped for promotion from the junior ranks to a full cabinet job, which leaves one full cabinet job and the super junior role – with several outgoing ministers seeking each.The EurogroupMr Donohoe’s nomination on Thursday to be the head of the Eurogroup council of finance ministers suggests that he will remain in the Department of Finance. It is also expected that Mr Coveney will remain in the Department of Foreign Affairs, though sources say that there is no agreement from the other parties yet.Minister for Health Simon Harris is widely credited with an effective handling of the Covid-19 crisis, especially in its early stages, and a demotion from Cabinet would be seen as extremely harsh. However, his inclusion would mean there is no place for Minister for Housing Eoghan Murphy, a close personal and political ally of Mr Varadkar, and someone who is seen in Fine Gael as having taking a lot of flak for the Taoiseach on the housing issue. Other party sources say that Hildegard Naughten, the Galway West TD who was part of the negotiating team, has a strong case for inclusion and she will be helped by both gender and geography.Either way, if the Government is formed tomorrow, Mr Varadkar will have no option but to end the cabinet careers of several long-standing Fine Gael ministers, with Michael Ring, Joe McHugh, Charlie Flanagan, Paul Kehoe, Josepha Madigan and Richard Bruton all thought by their colleagues to be unlikely to make cabinet, though some sources speculate that a role will be found for Mr Bruton, and others may fill junior minister roles.In Fianna Fáil, as the party anticipates a return to government for the first time in almost a decade, the situation is more fluid.

Photograph: Saul MartinezThe New York TimesYounger people are making up a growing percentage of new coronavirus cases in US cities and states where the virus is now surging, a trend that has alarmed public health officials and prompted renewed pleas for masks and social distancing.In Arizona, where drive-up sites are overwhelmed by people seeking coronavirus tests, people aged 20-44 account for nearly half of all cases. In Florida, which breaks records for new cases nearly every day, the median age of residents testing positive for the virus has dropped to 35, down from 65 in March.And in Texas, where the governor paused the reopening process on Thursday as hospitals grow increasingly crowded, young people now account for the majority of new cases in several urban centres. In Cameron County, which includes Brownsville and the tourist town of South Padre Island, people under 40 make up more than half of newly reported cases.“What is clear is that the proportion of people who are younger appears to have dramatically changed,” said Joseph McCormick, a professor of epidemiology at UTHealth School of Public Health in Brownsville. “It’s really quite disturbing.”The pattern is drawing notice from mayors, governors and public health officials, and comes as a worrisome sign for cities and institutions as they look to the autumn. The rise in cases among younger people could complicate the plans of leaders who are eager to open schools and universities, resume athletic events and return to normal life and a fully functioning economy.Bars and restaurantsThe increases could reflect a simple reality: Since many states have reopened bars, restaurants and offices, the coronavirus has been allowed to spread more widely across communities, including to more young people. But people in their 20s and 30s are also more likely to go out socialising, experts say, raising concerns that asymptomatic young people are helping to spread the virus to more vulnerable Americans at a time when cases are surging dangerously in the south and the west.Dr Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Thursday that younger people have helped fuel the increase in known coronavirus infections – and that in the past, many of those infections went undiagnosed.“Our best estimate right now is that for every case that was reported, there actually were 10 other infections,” he said.No single answer fully accounts for the surge of cases among young people, who are less likely to be hospitalised or die from coronavirus than older people. “Is it the governor’s reopening? Is it Memorial Day? Is it the George Floyd demonstrations? Is it going to the beach?” said Eric Boerwinkle, dean of the UTHealth School of Public Health in Houston. “We don’t really know, but it is probably all of those things that are contributing.”New highThe United States recorded 36,975 new cases on Wednesday, a new high point in daily cases as the country confronted a new stage of the crisis two months after the previous high in late April.The resurgence is most immediately threatening states that reopened relatively early in the South and the West. Alabama, Florida, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas all reported their highest single-day totals this week, as did Montana and Utah, and cases were rising in 29 states on Thursday.Adriana Carter (21) is among the newly infected. For many weeks this spring, she said, she took steps to limit her exposure, eating many of her meals at her apartment in San Marcos, Texas, and wearing a mask when going in and out of stores. At the one Black Lives Matter protest she attended, most people were in masks.But after a particularly long week of juggling online summer classes and her job at an eye clinic, Carter took a risk one Saturday night in early June and met a friend at the Square, a popular bar district downtown. Though they were careful to avoid the most crowded spots, they chose not to wear masks as they sipped drinks inside and endured the hot Texas weather.Days later, her friend woke up feeling ill. Both tested positive for the virus.“We were told we could go out to bars,” she said, adding that she had been careful to quarantine since she learned that she had been exposed. “It’s very unusual for anyone in their 20s to stay at home all the time – not giving any excuses or anything, but I just think we are all just trying to do the best we can.”The new cases among young people may appear to be a departure from the early days of the pandemic when infections in nursing homes were spiralling out of control, and the virus appeared at higher rates among older people in New York City.Wider testingExperts cautioned that the seemingly new prevalence among young people may be, in part, a reflection of more widely available testing. But the growing numbers of people hospitalised in states like North Carolina and Texas also suggest increased transmission of the virus.Even now, people younger than 50 are being hospitalised at a far lower rate than people older than that, according to CDC data.While the effect of coronavirus on younger people “may not be highly associated with hospitalisation and death”, Redfield said, “they do act as a transmission connector for iniduals that could in fact be at a higher risk.”In Florida, which has emerged as a particularly concerning hot spot, reopened bars have been a source of contagion among young people. The state shut down the Knight’s Pub, a popular bar near the University of Central Florida in Orlando, after 28 patrons and 13 employees were infected.In Miami-Dade County, the number of known coronavirus cases among 18- to 34-year-olds increased five-fold in a month, to more than 1,000, mayor Carlos Gimenez said this week. “They’re thinking they’re invincible,” he said, adding that many of the infected have no symptoms.They are at higher risk, though, if they are overweight or have diabetes or other medical conditions, he said. About a third of the coronavirus patients at the public Jackson Health System were from that age group, and about half had a high body mass index, Gimenez said.In Arizona, rising infections have set many people on edge, including some residents in their 20s and 30s. In Arcadia, Arizona, Ian Bartczak, who is 31, said he did not feel comfortable dining out at restaurants and was dismayed to see crowds of young people squeezing onto patios and bars on a commercial strip near his home.“It goes back to, what is a want and what is a need?” said Bartczak, who works for an education technology company. “Did you have to go to a big swimming party or El Hefe nightclub with your friends?”His point of view has created awkwardness with some friends, he said. He has turned down invitations to go out for sushi, and been puzzled by friends who chose to visit casinos.“It’s affected some of my relationships because I won’t see them or get kind of angry,” he said. “How are you not willing to help the old lady behind you who could have a poor immune system? Or help lower our cases so we can increase our economy?” – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates.

Some will have to come down.Some names will have to change,” he said. “I mean, the church, goodness me, you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, there\u0027s monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey, and we\u0027re looking at all that, and some will have to come down.But yes, there can be forgiveness, I hope and pray as we come together, but only if there\u0027s justice.If we change the way we behave now, and say this was then and we learned from that, and change how we\u0027re going to be in the future, internationally, as well.Pressed on whether he was saying statues will be taken down in the cathedral, he added: No, I didn\u0027t say that. I very carefully didn\u0027t say that.He said it is not his decision, and told the programme: We\u0027re going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context and seeing if they all should be there… The question arises. Of course it does.He said it is what people do at times like this, adding: And it\u0027s a good thing, but there has to be, for forgiveness, there has to be this turning round, this conversion, the Pope called it.The change of heart that says we learned from them not to be like that, and to change the way we are in the future.The Archbishop was also asked if the “way the western church portrays Jesus needs to be thought about again”.He immediately replied: “Yes of course it does, this sense that God was white... You go into churches (around the world) and you don\u0027t see a white Jesus.“You see a black Jesus, a Chinese Jesus, a Middle Eastern Jesus - which is of course the most accurate - you see a Fijian Jesus.”With the growing surge in support for the Black Lives Matter movement, which has sparked global protests following the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, a number of petitions have emerged demanding controversial monuments in the UK are taken down.In Bristol, a statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and dumped in the harbour, while the figure of slave owner Robert Milligan was taken down from its plinth at West India Quay in London\u0027s Docklands.Last week, the governing body of Oxford\u0027s Oriel College expressed their wish to remove a statue of British imperialist Cecil Rhodes, following fresh protests.A spokesman for Canterbury Cathedral said that the Most Rev Justin Welby’s comments “highlight the work already being taken by the Cathedral to identify items such as memorials, statues or heraldic images that may have links with colonialism or the slave trade, and to create clear contextual information that acknowledges the history of such objects in an honest and sensitive way”.“All of the Cathedral’s items are being reviewed to ensure that any connected with slavery, colonialism or contentious figures from other historic periods are displayed with clear objective interpretations and contextual information, and are presented in a way that avoids any sense of aggrandisement.“We hope that by providing this context – and acknowledging any associated oppression, exploitation, injustice and suffering connected with these objects – all visitors can leave with a greater understanding of our shared history and be inspired to undertake further learning and discussion.”A spokesman for Westminster Abbey said: “Its many memorials, which range in date from the thirteenth century to our own, also reflect the judgments and attitudes of the times in which those commemorations were made.”However: “In light of recent events, the Dean and Chapter of Westminster have begun a conversation about the Abbey’s memorials and how we can better reflect the attitudes of our time.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth clean 40 tonnes rubbish left beachgoers","story":"Three men were stabbed near Bournemouth beach on Thursday night, after thousands of people defied advice to stay away from the town’s beaches, Dorset police have said.Dorset Police was called at 9.44pm on Thursday to a report of a fight near to the amusements on Bournemouth Pier.The men, all in their 20s and from London, were found with stab wounds and taken to hospital for treatment.One man sustained a stab wound to his back and has since been discharged from hospital, a second man sustained an injury to his face and the third was injured in the chest and arm. Their conditions are not described as life-threatening.Cordons were placed around the scene but were lifted around 12.20am on Friday. The police are now appealing for witnesses to assist in their investigation, particularly anyone who took video footage of the incident.Detective Inspector Gavin House, of Bournemouth CID, said: “We are carrying out a full and thorough investigation to determine who was responsible for this incident.“The public can expect to see an increased police presence near to the pier today as detectives continue their enquiries in the area.It come after a  major incident was declared by Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole (BCP) Council on Thursday when thousands of people descended on its beaches.Overnight, a clean up operation removed over 40 tonnes of rubbish from the beach.Photos showed piles of rubbish, including food, plastics and gas canisters, strewn across the sand.Refuse crews reportedly received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront during the day, BCP Council said.It added that in one stretch of the beach eight tonnes of waste was collected, while a further 33 tons of waste was removed along the full stretch of coastline. Dr David Nabarro, World Health Organization envoy on the coronavirus, said he was not really concerned by images of crowds on beaches, but feared what was going on out of sight.He told the Radio Four Today programme: I don\u0027t personally get really concerned when I see people outside in the open, because as you have just said, transmission is less likely to occur there.But it\u0027s what happens out of sight that I\u0027m more worried about. People going to the toilet and being in a queue and perhaps there being transmission there.Or particularly the person who is cleaning the toilet being exposed to lots of folk with disease, people getting on the public transport and exposing bus drivers and the like.That\u0027s where I get nervous because I actually feel this vast amount of movement that\u0027s going on - that is absolutely essential for people to come out and enjoy themselves again - does come at a risk.And I just ask everybody, don\u0027t just think of yourself. Think of the other person who you might be exposing to the virus because sometimes they don\u0027t have a choice.In response to the scenes, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, warned that he had the power to close beaches, adding: The virus doesn\u0027t respect that it\u0027s a hot summer\u0027s day. Professor Chris Whitty, Chief Medical Officer, said: If we do not follow social distancing guidance then cases will rise again. Naturally, people will want to enjoy the sun – but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.Another clean-up operation is under way on North East beaches after drunk revellers fought on the sand and dumped bottles and cans.Police made a number of arrests following trouble at the seaside on Thursday as record numbers visited the beaches in the North Tyneside area.A video shared on social media showed men fighting on the sand, close to where family groups sat enjoying the afternoon sunshine.On Friday morning a clean-up was under way after piles of rubbish were dumped and debris from fires was left for other people to remove.Carl Johnson, North Tyneside Council\u0027s cabinet member for environment and transport, said: It is always very frustrating to find rubbish on our award-winning beaches.As a council that prides itself on keeping standards high at the coast, we always bring in extra resources during peak season and our staff work incredibly hard to keep our coastline clean and tidy.He said staff had been kept on later into the evening to deal with the mess.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"can obey rules dont understand","story":"Got any plans for next weekend? Will you be going to the pub with up to five people from more than two households to sit outside in a beer garden? Or will you be sitting inside, in which case you’ll be back to the current two-household restriction? Or perhaps you’d rather visit friends or family at home, and even stay the night, which is – or rather, will be – fine, as long as you observe the new one-metre-plus rule, which means you can now get a bit closer to each other as long as you take other safety precautions such as wearing a face mask and sitting at an angle so that you are not directly facing each other. Unless you’re within a support bubble, in which case you can’t see anyone else, but you can hug the people you’re allowed to see. I think.Is there anyone out there still following these rules? If so, I salute both your conscientiousness and your powers of deduction. Lockdown was so much easier when it was harder. With only one essential rule to follow (avoid everyone), a person knew where she stood. Since then, however, the Government’s policy of cautious relaxation has generated a succession of different guidelines, each layered over the last to form a bewildering palimpsest of amendments and modifications.You can see how it got like this. Everything about our predicament is messy: the politics, the science, the economic fallout, the human cost. Trying to give us back as much freedom as possible, while also keeping the R-rate down, was bound to be a knotty task.Most of the new rules, such as the injunction against singing in church, make sense inidually. (Singing is a surefire way to blast saliva particles over your fellow congregants.) But put together they look byzantine, confusing and sometimes downright bizarre. (Who, apart from Lord and Lady Crawley, has a house big enough to host overnight guests without coming within one metre of them?)The other day, my daughter was invited to a birthday party in the park. There were only six other children there, and the adults tried (in vain) to enforce social distancing. “I think this is allowed, don’t you?” muttered one of the other mothers, uneasily. “But in that case, why can’t they go to school? Oh God, do you think we’re going to be arrested?”Judging from recent events in Brixton and Bournemouth, the police have bigger problems to deal with. But from kids’ parties to beach invasions, the principle is the same. Rules that are hard to understand soon become impossible to enforce.I don’t want to see any businesses go under, but I cannot mourn the demise of the shopping mall. Even in the Sixties – as the concrete for Birmingham’s Bull Ring was being poured – wise heads warned that this new American way of shopping would destroy the delicate eco-system of the high street.And so it did, but still they flourished. Each mall came wrapped in promises of local regeneration yet the surrounding high streets just became shabbier and more dessicated, the blood sucked out of them by glass-and-steel vampires.Now, though, who would want to go to an indoor, air-conditioned mall, where you can’t get anything (except Covid) that couldn’t just as easily be ordered online? Wouldn’t you rather go to smaller, specialist shops – somewhere local, so you can walk there in the fresh air? Somewhere, in fact, remarkably like a high street.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"former lead detective madeleine mccann case claims portuguese","story":"Portuguese police did an “excellent job” when Madeleine McCann went missing, and can solve the case by themselves, a former lead detective has claimed.Despite a series of catastrophic errors including poor crime scene management and formally naming Kate and Gerry McCann as suspects, Gonçalo Amaral, the police chief who first led the investigation into what happened to the young British girl, still insists that Portuguese officers are the right people to find the truth.Speaking to Jornal do Centro, Amaral, who was dropped from the investigation within a year of Madeleine\u0027s disappearance, said: “The Policia Judiciaria did an excellent job at the time and continues to do the best it can with the professionals it has.“The force has done its best and I know it has the capacity to be able to resolve this case by itself.”There has been a sense of frustration around Amaral’s comments, especially after he admitted that his officers went to interview the now-prime suspect Christian Brückner in 2007, but came away empty handed because he wasn’t home.Over the last 13 years, the case has been handled by the politan police and Portuguese authorities, but it is now being spearheaded by German prosecutors who have identified Brückner as the person they believe killed Madeleine. He denies this and has not been formally charged.Rogério Alves, a Portuguese lawyer and close friend of the McCann’s called the former police chief’s views “a waste of time” and that people should “focus on the reality and forget about the fantasy.”Speaking to the  earlier this week, Mr Alves said: “To be honest, I don’t want to give any stage to that guy. I didn’t even talk with the family. “It’s always the same. I learned a long time ago that we should not waste time with his theory and fantasy so I don’t want to waste my time with him.“To be honest, the other thing I am surprised about is how he can still have television and newspapers taking care of him, but to be honest, I have no comments to make and no time to waste on that. “We have to talk about the reality. We have to focus on the reality and forget about the fantasy, that’s all.”On Thursday, Hans Christian Wolters, the Braunschweig state prosecutor dealt a fresh blow to the McCann family and said the investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine could be dropped if the “missing evidence” needed to charge their prime suspect isn’t found.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"sweden accuses misinterpreting data saying had significant resurgence","story":"Sweden\u0027s state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has hit back at the World Health Organization after it included Sweden in a group of countries facing a very significance resurgence of coronavirus infections.Mr Tegnell, who has in recent months become one of the world\u0027s most high profile and isive epidemiologists, said: That is, unfortunately, a total misinterpretation of the data. It\u0027s very unfortunate that people lump Sweden together with countries that earlier have had no problem at all and are now apparently at the start of their epidemic, he told Sweden\u0027s state broadcaster SVT.Hans Kluge, the WHO\u0027s Regional Director for Europe, on Thursday named Sweden in a list of eleven problem countries, the rest of which were all in Eastern Europe, the Caucasus, or Central Asia, which are facing accelerated transmission of infection. For weeks I have spoken about the risk of resurgence as countries adjust measures. In several countries across Europe, this risk has now become a reality, Mr Kluge warned.Sweden has this month seen the daily number of confirmed cases more than triple from 60 on June 1st to 207 on Thursday. But Mr Tegnell argued that this has to do with increased testing rather than a resurgence in infection.This is growing because we recently started offering tests to everyone with symptoms, he told Sweden\u0027s TT newswire. We are doing twice as many tests as we were a few weeks ago. But the growth we are seeing is in mild cases, not hospital admissions.Mr Tegnell has drawn both admiration and criticism internationally for leading a coronavirus strategy that left schools for 14-16 year olds open throughout the pandemic, as well as bars, restaurants, gyms, and much else, relying instead on the public\u0027s willingness to follow social distancing guidelines.Since April, Sweden\u0027s death rate has pulled markedly ahead of Norway, Denmark and Finland, which all imposed much stricter lockdowns. Sweden has registered 5,280 deaths with coronavirus - more than four times the number of deaths in all the other Nordic countries put together. Mr Tegnell has put the difference down to the failure to prevent the infection spreading in elderly care homes in Stockholm, and to the amount of travel in and out of Sweden at the end of February.  The daily number of hospital admissions and deaths was now declining steadily, Mr Tegnell told TT.  The most stable data source is the number of new admissions to intensive care, he said, and there we have seen a decline since a long time back. Now it\u0027s just a few admissions a day in Stockholm, and in a few other regions.Countries across Europe, including its neighbours Denmark, Norway and Finland, have refused to allow leisure travel to and from Sweden as a result of the high number of recent confirmed cases, something Mr Tegnell said made Mr Kluge\u0027s comments even more unwelcome.It is certainly serious, especially in this situation where there are a lot of discussions going on about what countries people can travel to, this sort of statement is extremely unfortunate. The number of admissions to intensive care is at a very low level and even deaths are starting to go down, Mr Tegnell said.We are now down to a level where there are not more people dying now than during the same weeks in previous years.According to Sweden\u0027s Public Health Agency, around 10 coronavirus patients a day are being admitted to intensive care units, compared with 45-50 a day in April.In the past month, Sweden has more than doubled its Covid-19 testing and only began offering mass testing to the public last week, a delay which has been highly criticised.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel latest unenforceable air bridges could lead tourism subterfuge","story":"Holidaymakers hoping to make it to Greece this summer faced with wave of flight cancellationsDestinations for first set of \u0027air bridges\u0027 from UK revealed What are the candidates for an \u0027air bridge\u0027 holiday? Key dates: When will destinations reopen to British tourists?  Listen to our brand new travel podcast UK holidaymakers who have been keeping tabs on imminent air bridge announcements – and had hoped this meant their trips to European destinations including Spain, Italy and Greece would be able to go ahead this summer – could be in for disappointment.Tui have cancelled 95 per cent of its holidays in July, and easyJet are only running about half of their flights – although in some cases cancellation emails are only going out now. This means that even if air bridges were to be confirmed by the Government at the weekend as proposed, many UK holidaymakers will still not be able to travel on their existing bookings. Several easyJet and Tui customers posted news of their cancelled flights for the coming weeks on Twitter yesterday, calling into question whether the proposed air bridges would actually be coming into effect any time soon.Government ministers are meeting today at 12.30pm to finalise air bridge agreements, which are set to be announced in full on Monday.Follow all of the daily news below.While most country hotels are preparing to reopen on July 4, or shortly thereafter, the situation in London is markedly different. Stuart Procter, who runs The Stafford Hotel in Mayfair, is also a member of an association of managers of top London hotels.“Forty per cent will open on July 4” (including the Mandarin Oriental, Flemings, Corinthia, Hilton Park Lane), he says “twenty per cent some time in August, and the rest, including The Savoy and Rosewood London, have not yet declared an opening date – some may wait for months”.Stuart Procter has been eating his solitary meals on the roof terrace of the penthouseThe Stafford will reopen on August 3 and though Procter can’t wait, he knows it will be a pretty low-key affair. While luxury country hotels are experiencing a high volume of bookings for July and August, it is not the same in London. “I’m not going to lie”, says Procter. “We expect about 20 per cent occupancy for the rest of the summer.” If the government reverses its ludicrous decision on quarantine, then things may look up, but without it, there is no business. No quarantine and air bridges will bring back our clients, 80 per cent of whom get here on an aeroplane.”On the day in March that the Government instructed all hotels to close, Procter and seven other senior colleagues shrouded everything ­– furniture, plates, pots, glasses, saucepans, the lot ­– in either white sheets or clingfilm and switched off the lights. Seven of them made a rota: each would stay alone in the hotel in turn for 24 hours, from 9pm to 9am before the next took over. One of their jobs has been to flush every loo in the 107 bedrooms and turn on every tap and shower for five minutes to prevent the system from seizing up ­– and the threat of Legionnaire’s disease.Fiona Duncan has the full story on what it\u0027s like to be the only person in a five-star hotel. Nowhere is a new restaurant experience opening in August in Sweden with just six tables, spread around the Häringe Nature Reserve just outside Stockholm.

Campsites, mountain huts and beach resorts are also operational under these protocols, as are airports, railway stations and transport services.Bars and restaurants for instance, may ask customers to to sanitise hands before entry. They may also implement different entry and exit routes. Body temperature may be measured when going into beach resorts, and beach-goers may have to wait to be seated at a beach umbrella. Group sports that can lead to a gathering of people are banned.Holidaymakers will need to wear a mask at all times indoors and where social distancing isn’t possible, including public transport. They must also adhere to a one-metre social distancing rule in all public areas including restaurants, hotels and communal spaces. Flavio Zappacosta, Italia manager for UK and Ireland commented:With the extensive and thorough protocols available online for travellers, we hope to reassure visitors that Italy is ready for tourists and has the correct measures in place to both ensure their health and safety whilst having a fantastic experience in the destination.Along with France, Spain, Greece and Germany, Italy is one of the only European countries likely to be included in the first stage of air bridges with the UK – which is expected to be officially announced this weekend.Once this is confirmed, British visitors will be able visit Italy with no quarantine restrictions and will be able to move freely within the whole country, though registration is required upon entering Sardinia, Sicily, Puglia and Calabria.Should you book right now, or wait? Greg Dickinson has the answer.Not one of London’s major museums and galleries will reopen on July 4, despite being given the green light to do so from the Government.The latest easing of lockdown measures means that from next Saturday, cultural institutions, along with pubs, restaurants and hotels, will be permitted to welcome visitors, provided that they adopt a raft of safety and social distancing measures. The British Museum is yet to confirm a reopening dateWhile many hospitality businesses have been clamouring to reopen and quickly announced their plans after the Prime Minister’s statement, the capital’s cultural attractions have been much more reticent.After the announcement, the Directors of the Tate, Science Museum Group, Natural History Museum, National Gallery, British Museum and Victoria and Albert Museum issued a joint statement, which offered no concrete plans:We welcome the Prime Minister\u0027s announcement to allow the safe reopening of our galleries to the public this summer. We will now work closely with the Government, trade unions and supporters to see how and when we can open our doors again in a financially sustainable manner, for the long term.Emma Beaumont has the full story.The UK\u0027s largest tour operator has cancelled all holidays to Florida for UK customers until December 1. This news comes soon after the Sunshine State recorded its highest number of Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began. Many of Florida’s tourism businesses also fear a second shutdown as cases soar.The decision has been made following new health and safety measures implemented at Walt Disney World to ensure the safety of its guests. ‘These changes would significantly impact the holiday experience for many Tui customers who plan their magical and often once in a lifetime Florida holiday.Since the opening of the Spanish border to members of the EU\u0027s Schengen Zone and the UK on June 21, Spain-Holiday has seen UK\u0026ampI traffic jump 72 per cent.The holiday rental site, with villas, apartments and country homes across Spain, has also reported a 104 per cent surge in searches for properties with pools.Peter Jarvis, Head of International Brands at Spain-Holiday addedIt\u0027s very early days for Brits this summer who are still researching where to go, but so far we are seeing a huge interest in holiday homes in villages and small towns, particularly in the Alicante or Andalucia areas. Clearly people want to be away from the crowds in a holiday home, not in the big heartland cities. We are seeing this manifest through falls in interest in city breaks such as Madrid, Barcelona and Seville, falling on average 9 per cent versus last year. Interestingly at Spain-Holiday we have also seen a fall in island destinations which are only reachable by medium-haul or changing planes such as the Canary Islands, presumably because many people want a short hop to the sun this year.Find the latest advice on travel to Spain here.There has been much debate in the past 48 hours as to whether Portugal will be included in the UK\u0027s air bridge plans.Mary Lussiana shared the reaction of tourism business owners across the country, summed up best by Tara Donovan, who runs Casa Fuzetta in Olhã: ‘The uncertainty is crippling. Chris Leadbeater wrote how the Portugal \u0027air bridge\u0027 snub would be a strange way to treat your oldest friend.But Luis Araujo, President of Turismo de Portugal, has taken a more positive approach. He told  Travel: The Portuguese government and tourism officials remain in constant discussion with the British government regarding air bridge agreements and conversations continue to progress well. At this stage it would not be sensible nor rational to speculate as to which countries will be included in a bilateral travel arrangement until an official announcement is made on the 29th June by the UK government. We fully respect the date given by the UK government for an announcement to be made and we do not intend to undermine this be speculating on the outcome beforehand.The Portuguese tourism board remain fully confident in the safety of our nation and tourism establishments as well as the effectiveness of the safety measures put in place, swiftly, to ensure that visitors can feel safe and welcome here.  Read the latest air bridge news here.Cruise is slowly reawakening across Europe’s rivers and coastlines, and now a luxury option is back in the mix.SeaDream Yacht Club, made up of two small vessels, has set sail from Oslo, becoming the first luxury line to resume operations since the coronavirus pandemic caused the world’s cruise industry ground to a halt in March 2020.More good news for cruise lovers as luxury sailing begins in NorwaySo far only two river cruise lines – Nicko Travel in Germany and A-Rosa in Portugal – have returned to service, with Hurtigruten the first to take to the ocean around Norway.The two ships, SeaDream I and SeaDream II, both take a maximum of 112 passengers, with the line citing their size as an advantage which allows them “to quickly adapt their itineraries to comply with government regulations.”The first seven-day itinerary will sail as far north as Tromsø, with ports of call including Bergen, Olden, Geiranger, Ålesund, Flåm, Rosendal and Skagen.Benjamin Parker has the full story.We live in curious times when a traffic jam at the beach on the hottest day of the year is described as a “MAJOR INCIDENT”, says  Travel\u0027s Oliver Smith.The locals in Bournemouth, which was inundated with sunseekers yesterday, prompting the police warning, went even further. “It’s like Armageddon,” said one. Yes, a few thousand people letting their hair down at the seaside is apparently comparable to the final battle between good and evil before the Day of Judgement. The outrage on social media has been remarkable. “Selfish idiots,” was one verdict, summing up the general tide of opinion. “Ban people from beaches,” was another commentator’s even-handed solution. “It’s not even a bank holiday!” said a third, as if our coastal towns should remain empty on all but eight days of the year.The opprobrium levelled at those who decided to pack their lilo and factor 30 and head to the seaside this week has been withering – and almost entirely unfair. Yes, those who leave litter behind deserve criticism. And there will always be a few fools who go too far, drink too much, and engage in antisocial behaviour. But the vast majority of those who flocked to Bournemouth broke no rules. They were simply trying to make the most of the heatwave after the best part of three months stuck at home. What’s wrong with that?Read the full opinion piece here.As the country eases its way out of lockdown, many of Britain’s celebrated heritage and steam operated railway lines have announced dates for the first post-lockdown journeys of the summer.They have had to make a number of modifications, adapting to the changed times with face masks and social distancing.Better known as the ‘Harry Potter train’, The Jacobite linking Fort William and Mallaig runs along the stunning West Highland LineThere will be tighter booking conditions – gone for the time being are the rover tickets, allowing you to hop from train to train throughout the day as you please. Instead, in come limited pre-booked round-trips. Compartment carriages will be more in evidence than the more common open ones. On board dining will in the main be a more modest affair.But the trains are slowly gearing up to get back on track. Here are five great journeys to whet the appetite. All aboard! As much as £4.6 billion is still owed to British holidaymakers due to coronavirus cancellations, new figures suggest. As tour operators and airlines prepare to welcome holidaymakers again thanks to the easing of travel restrictions, questions remain over the efficiency of the refund process for those whose trips were cancelled by the pandemic. In April, Abta, the British travel association, said up to £7 billion was owed to UK consumers because of affected travel. Hundreds of thousands of flights and holidays have been cancelled since March. Now, it seems less than half of that has been paid back to holidaymakers.Resolver, the resolution firm, said 67 per cent of its travel complaints brought between March and May remain unresolved across the UK, that could equate to £4.6 billion. Hugh Morris has more details here.Lockdown has made us look again at what we have around us, and that includes some of the most beautiful coastal scenery in Europe. Who hasn’t felt the thrill of that first glimpse of the sea, whether it is between the high hedges of a Cornish lane, from the wide Norfolk cornfields, through the towering peaks of Scotland or over the grassy brow of the Sussex Downs?   Cocklawburn in Northumberland is a great place for sandcastle builders, shell ­seekers and fossil huntersYou will still need to be vigilant, of course, and not just about Covid matters the RNLI had to pause its recruitment of lifeguards in March, so fewer beaches will have cover this summer. Take heed, too, of warnings against overcrowding, as happened on the South Coast this week.As Uzbekistan opens its borders to travellers for the first time since March, its government has pledged to compensate tourists who catch Covid-19 while holidaying there.Those who contract the virus within the Central Asian country could be granted US$3,000 (£2,417) to cover the costs of medical care in an Uzbek hospital.Uzbekistan has started to reopen to tourists“We want to reassure tourists they can come to Uzbekistan,” said Sophie Ibbotson, Uzbekistan’s tourism ambassador to the UK.“The government is so confident that the new safety and hygiene measures being implemented across the tourism sector will protect tourists from Covid-19 that the president is prepared to put money where his mouth is: if you get Covid-19 on holiday in Uzbekistan, we will compensate you.”However, the offer only applies to visitors who are part of a tour group which is being led by a local guide.Tom Mulvihill has the full story.Unenforceable summer travel restrictions could lead to “tourism subterfuge,” with travellers flying to an approved destination, then driving a short distance to an area missed off of the UK air bridges list, experts have warned.Paul Charles, spokesman for the campaign group Quash Quarantine, which represents 400 of the biggest travel and hospitality businesses in Britain, argued, “It’s very difficult to restrict people’s freedom of movement when it comes to travel in Europe, because of the nature of the Schengen Zone. It enables me to fly into one country and then move around by car without borders preventing me from moving from country to country, especially now as they open up.”He added that the system would be unenforceable and people could easily reach a different destination by driving across borders. For instance, there will be nothing to stop someone flying into Seville and making the short drive to a beach holiday in the Algarve, nor someone landing in Cologne before ending up in Amsterdam for the weekend.“I think the government is realising that it is harder than they think to create these corridors with such narrow criteria,” shared Mr Charles, also chief executive of PC Consultancy. “I think the government is undoubtedly going to have to widen the number of corridors it initially created.”France is likely to be included in the first tranche of air bridge candidates As it stands, France, Italy, Spain, Greece and Germany are the only European countries likely to be included in the first stage of air bridges with the UK. The government is due to confirm the countries on the air bridge list this weekend, with around 10 countries in Europe named across the first two stages. Charles thinks that number could be boosted to 20 or 30, asking for countries that would not be included to be the exception rather than the rule. For example, it makes sense to not allow travel to countries with high case numbers like Sweden, but to create arbitrary rules about other European countries that all have a lower R number than ours does not make sense, nor will it be able to be policed.Charles concluded: “We’ve got to get going again, we can’t sit still and hope that the economy picks up by not doing anything. We’ve got to manage a recovery. While of course health is important and should be the number one priority, equally we’ve got to get going, get the economy moving, and allow travel again, albeit with some restrictions.”The British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar is on the list of likely candidates for an air bridge, meaning summer holidays there could happen without risk of quarantine upon return to the UK.On the southern tip of the Iberian peninsula, with the Atlantic on one side and the Mediterranean on the other and just 15 miles from Morocco, Gibraltar is dominated by the dramatic limestone Rock and covers an area of just over two and a half square miles. There is a lot packed into that small space though and it is really worth staying longer than a day, whether you’re interested in history, anthropology, geology, nature or marine life. Not to mention the shopping.  Annie Bennett has you covered, with all the best things to do and places to eat and stay.Under the blue skies of the Algarve, most hotels are already open. Floors gleaming with disinfectant, bedroom doors sealed, hopeful smiles behind the masks – but where are the guests? A few weeks ago, an air bridge with the UK seemed so certain (and, given the impressive handling of Covid-19 in Portugal, so obvious). Now it is unclear whether Portugal will be able to welcome British holidaymakers this summer at all.A feeling of rejection and disappointment is being felt across the country It doesn’t make much sense to me, said Armando Ribeiro, who runs a Travel PR company in Lisbon, not when they are opening up to Italy and Spain, who have been so much worse than Portugal. Yes, there have been clusters on the outskirts of Lisbon, but these are not dramatic events in a country which has proved able to handle the coronavirus.In the south, Tara Donovan, who runs Casa Fuzetta in Olhão, reacted with frustration. ‘The uncertainty is crippling, she told me. We had 35 groups booked for this year. Some took place before lockdown but 22 have already cancelled and of the remainder only a handful feel positive. Portugal have done have a fantastic job. The UK government’s lack of clarity and delay is having a devastating impact.Mary Lussiana has the full story here.Feeling frustrated about getting your holiday refund? Princess Cruises has revealed they have so far completed 60 per cent of requested refunds, reports Benjamin Parker.While the line – whose ship, Diamond Princess, was the first with confirmed cases of coronavirus on board – said that giving customers their money back or organising credits for future cruises “remained one of our top priorities”, they are still unable to give specific dates about when all refunds will be received.Despite significantly increasing people resources in this area, we needed to also ramp up our systems capabilities to be able to handle higher volume and significant complexity.With a global scope, our refund process is an involved one, dealing with 13 different currencies and various payment methods.Details about refund options, as well as when cruise lines will be sailing again, can be found here in our comprehensive guide.Services at Bournemouth beaches were left completely overstretched yesterday as visitors arrived in large volumes, resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping. We are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last 24-48 hours. The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Many locals have taken to Twitter to share photos of the rubbish that was piled up on the beaches.Yesterday,  Travel reported that Portugal\u0027s omission from the likely list of initial air bridge agreements had been called an absolute body blow as other European nations welcomed their inclusion. Portugal is not the only country likely to miss out out though, and experts across the industry have been calling for details to be announced as soon as possible, even if key summer holiday destinations will not quality for an air bridge until the second or third tranche.Jonny Baylis, founder of Aglow Pilgrimages, comments:It\u0027s extremely disappointing to hear that Croatia is unlikely to be included in the first tranche of air bridges.It\u0027s our most popular destination for pilgrimages, and we\u0027ve had hundreds of enquiries that we\u0027d love to fulfil, but concerns around quarantining are raised time and again by people calling to book.People don\u0027t want to travel if they have to quarantine when they return home, and until we have a firm date when quarantine rules will be lifted, we are having to turn down a huge amount of business. It would be a game changer for us if the Government could at least confirm that Croatia will be one of the destinations in the second or third waves of air bridges. People would at least feel more confident about booking now rather than waiting.Key dates: When will destinations around the world reopen to British tourists?It seems summer holidays may end up happening after all.

The Aurigny flights will run for an initial six-week period.This is thanks to the fact that the two Crown Dependencies have agreed an ‘air bridge’, which they announced in a joint statement. It is the first travel corridor agreement in the British Isles since the coronavirus lockdown began.Lighthouse on the Isle of ManBoth governments cited the very similar measures of the two islands in terms of border controls from other locations, and robust testing and contact tracing capabilities, as the reason the agreement was able to go ahead. Neither Guernsey or the Isle of man has had a new case of Covid-19 for “several weeks”, and a 14-day quarantine is currently in place for all other new arrivals.Howard Quayle MHK, Chief Minister of the Isle of Man, shared:Announcing our first air bridge, and unrestricted travel to the Islands of Guernsey, is a major milestone and reflects how well both communities have responded to the Covid-19 pandemic.Which countries will the UK announce for \u0027air bridge\u0027 holidays this summer? Find the latest news here.Criminals are exploiting the coronavirus pandemic to scam would-be holidaymakers, UK Finance has warned.With the Government expected to announce ‘air bridges’ with several other nations in the next few days, a number of fake holiday lettings sites have been set up with the purpose of duping consumers into parting with hefty deposits for villas that do not exist.The websites are slickly designed to resemble those of genuine travel companies, with small tweaks in their URLs the only indication that they are not legitimate, the financial sector trade association said.There has also been a large spike in phishing attacks, with fraudsters impersonating airlines and travel agencies to offer refunds for cancelled holidays in an attempt to steal personal information and infect their victims’ phones and computers with malware.Read the full story.With sails billowing in the wind, the world’s biggest square-rigged ship is to make its first voyages from Britain next year.Golden Horizon will carry up to 272 passengers on seven sailings from Harwich and two from Glasgow, starting in May.

We have made great strides with our purpose-built approach to safe, autonomous mobility, and our exceptionally talented team working every day to realize that vision. We now have an even greater opportunity to realize a fully autonomous future.The Wall Street Journal reported last month that the companies were in advanced talks and the deal could value Zoox at less than the $3.2 billion it achieved in a funding round in 2018The Independent has reached out to Amazon for clarification. Zoox did not provide a comment on the record.Zoox is working to imagine, invent, and design a world-class autonomous ride-hailing experience, said Jeff Wilke, Amazon’s CEO of Worldwide Consumer said in a statement. Like Amazon, Zoox is passionate about innovation and about its customers, and we\u0027re excited to help the talented Zoox team to bring their vision to reality in the years ahead.Amazon releases Alexa voice assistant for your carThis is not the only entry into the self-driving space that Amazon has taken.The shopping giant participated in a $530 million funding round early last year in self-driving car startup Aurora Innovation.It also tested self-driving trucks developed by the company Embark, which also works with the Alphabet-owned Waymo and Tesla.Additional reporting from agencies.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The lost item posed no risk to either the spacewalk or the station, NASA said.Spacewalking astronauts wear a wrist mirror on each sleeve to get better views while working. The mirror is just 5 inches by 3 inches, and together with its band has a mass of barely one-tenth of a pound.Nasa renaming headquarters in honour of first black female engineerCassidy and Bob Behnken, who followed him out without mishap, were conducting the first of at least four spacewalks to replace the last bunch of old station batteries.Once the six new lithium-ion batteries are installed, the orbiting lab should be good for the rest of its operational life, according to NASA. The big, boxy batteries — more powerful and efficient than the old nickel-hydrogen batteries coming out — keep the station humming when it\u0027s on the night side of Earth.The battery replacements began in 2017, with previous crews putting in 18 lithium-ion batteries, half as many as the old ones replaced.Cassidy and Behnken have six more to plug in before the job is complete. It\u0027s cumbersome work: Each battery is about a yard (meter) tall and wide, with a mass of 400 pounds (180 kilograms).Their spacewalks are expected to continue through July before Behnken returns to Earth in August aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas from fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telescope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo? You’ll find plenty of of delicious ideas from the likes of Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall and Amanda Grant at vegpower.org.uk. You can get involved too: share your recipes using #SeasonalVeg on social mediaTry different types of fishSimilarly, the UK\u0027s fishing industry has suffered during the current coronavirus pandemic.While higher-end produce is currently not being purchased by restaurants, much of the catch from UK waters that would usually be exported hasn’t been, so boats across the country have struggled to sell their fish and seafood. That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

Residents on the southwest coast, in Plymouth, Devon, also woke to find the detritus left behind in the city’s popular Barbican area overnight – where hundreds of people packed onto the waterfront, ignoring coronavirus social distancing rules.The streets were covered in rubbish this morning, including tampons and used condoms, Plymouth Live reports.Residents were also reportedly faced with people having sex in public, as well as urinating and defecating in back streets.

Today there was also evidence of drug use.  “Thank you to the park rangers who are also working tirelessly to clear the mess around the ground and park generally.”A suitcase, parasol and fridge were among items abandoned on beaches in Durdle Door, Dorset, where volunteers filled more than 30 bags with rubbish. Dorset councillor Laura Miller tweeted: “Is it still ‘iconic’? Just in from volunteer litter picking. 30 bin bags and counting. Nearly in tears at the state of our home.”She also shared an image of what she described as human faeces on pebbles near where her children swim at Lulworth Cove. The Conservative councillor said she was spat at by someone while directing traffic on Wednesday as the roads to Durdle Door and West Lulworth were closed off after car parks quickly filled up. Police imposed a dispersal order at Hove Lawns, in Sussex, after a fight reportedly broke out as hundreds of, mostly young, people gathered on Wednesday evening.Jo Shiner, temporary Chief Constable of Sussex Police, described the incident as “shocking behaviour impacting upon everyone trying to be responsible in challenging times”. She warned: “Sussex Police will take positive action but I would urge young people to think about their behaviour. A criminal record will not help you get a job in the future.” Video journalist Eddie Mitchell shared footage on Twitter showing several police cars lined up along the seafront as uniformed officers herded crowds away.Police in Merseyside also imposed a 48-hour dispersal order lasting until Friday after large crowds turned up at Formby Beach, on the Sefton coastline. Former Love Island contestant Joshua Ritchie, who was allegedly among those who turned up at the beach, was seen carrying a large speaker with friends in a video.Boris Johnson’s official spokesman declined to comment on particular scenes on beaches, but told reporters: “The prime minister and the government’s scientific and medical advisers have stressed the great importance of the public continuing to adhere to social distancing advice.“It is only due to the public’s hard work that we have been able to bring the virus under control, and if the rules don’t continue to be followed and the virus starts to spread exponentially again, we will have to look at having to reverse some of the easements that have been put in place and I don’t think anyone in the British public would want that to happen.”There were hundreds of kids grouped up on the Roath Park Rec earlier this evening. They left A LOT of rubbish and were only dispersed about 10 minutes ago.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free. It is important to protect those working here and the people who use our centre.”Gretchen Fisher, from Ealing, who has been volunteering for four years, added: “I wear them whenever I go out as you have to protect others.” Mantas Keblis, the depot manager, said that having “extra precautions” would help food reach more people in London. “Everyone really likes them.

And today, because of the enormous generosity of Virustatic Shield, whose innovative anti-viral snoods we’ve also been producing, 10,000 of London’s most vulnerable people will receive a vital face covering, delivered to them via The Independent’s fantastic campaign.Which star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day It is now mandatory to wear face coverings on public transport, but these coverings are in short supply.That’s why we started The Big Community Sew to encourage people to make face coverings for their friends and neighbours, and by doing so preserve vital supplies of PPE for NHS workers and care home staff who are fighting this virus on the frontline.The science behind face coverings is simple: they help prevent the wearer from unwittingly spreading the disease.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The Department of Transport has announced that public transport services will be increased in England from early July, though they will not rise as high as pre-pandemic levels. Bus timetables will reach 85 per cent of their former levels from 4 July, while train schedules will follow suit two days later. However, the government still recommends that people avoid public transport where possible. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGrant Shapps, the transport secretary, said: As more businesses across the country prepare to reopen, we are increasing rail and bus services to boost capacity and meet additional demand for travel, helping people to travel safely.Our guidance remains that people should avoid public transport if possible and to walk or cycle instead.Transport secretary offers no promises to ease travel quarantineDo I need to wear a face covering on public transport?End of lockdown ‘could result in worst congestion ever’Google Maps adds coronavirus warnings to directionsFace coverings made compulsory on public transport from 15 JuneIn a message posted on Twitter on Thursday, Mr Shapps also reminded passengers that they need to wear face coverings on public transport in England and Scotland. The announcement about a boost in public transport came just days after the prime minister introduced that new coronavirus guidelines would come into force early next month.Boris Johnson said earlier this week that indoor gatherings of people from two households will be allowed from 4 July, while the two-metre social distancing will be relaxed to a one metre plus policy. The new rules, which mark the most significant easing of restrictions since lockdown was introduced on 23 March, also allow pubs, restaurants, cinemas and hotels to reopen from 4 July.The hospitality sector has been particularly hard-hit by lockdown, with thousands of businesses shutting for more than three months. As a result, Robert Lingard, the founder of National Hospitality Week, has called on the government to create a universal travel voucher to promote internal tourism and help save thousands of businesses and hospitality jobs.

Despite the vast differences between the two situations, Fawcett’s extensive military experiences and qualifications have helped him and his team develop a robust response to the Covid-19 crisis.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I was the only doctor there for about 300 people, which was quite an eye-opening experience,” says Fawcett of his first stint in Afghanistan in 2007 as part of the Army Reserves. Working at the Role 2E Field Hospital in Camp Bastion and at the Forward Operating Base, Fawcett provided key treatment on the Afghanistan frontline.On his second stint in 2007, he spent three months in Camp Bastion as a Trauma Team Leader, and on his third tour in 2011, he was the clinical lead for the Medical Emergency Response Team, a four-person medical team operating from a Chinook flying over Afghanistan, picking up wounded soldiers on the battlefield.What’s more, Fawcett – who also counts a role with the Midlands Air Ambulance Charity as a helicopter doctor amongst his impressive repertoire – has completed an MSc in Disaster Healthcare. Playing an instrumental part of Stoke hospital’s response to the Coronavirus pandemic is just one more string to his bow.“I was able to take a lot of stuff I learnt and apply it from the very start,” Fawcett says of putting his Masters in Disaster Healthcare into practise. “Before the patients even get to the emergency department, we make sure there’s clear boundaries, and patients are directed to the right areas to avoid any cross-contamination.”His army tours also contributed: “Looking at the designs of how they set up field hospitals and stuff helps,” he adds. “And working with international colleagues – it’s good to get a non-UK perspective on how other countries deal with certain circumstances.”This involved an overhaul of the whole emergency area and its processes. “We now run two emergency medicine departments out of one department,” he explains. “We’ve had to basically split the whole department in half.”Now, Stoke hospital features red zones and green zones: the former is for those displaying potential Covid symptoms and the latter is for those who aren’t. As such, the pathways and patient-flow of the hospital have had to be changed to avoid any instances of contact between these areas.“We have separate ambulance entrances for red and green patients. We have two resuscitation departments, two areas for major patients, two areas for walk-in patients, two minor injuries areas, two paediatrics departments, as well as designing alternative pathways to try and stream those patients that don’t have to come through the emergency department to other places.” he explains, noting how such isions have had to be executed throughout the whole hospital to prevent crowding and maintain social distancing.The task may have been monumental, but Fawcett takes pride in the hospital’s response: “This is what we’ve always trained for and it’s been good to see how us as an emergency department have responded to it. We’ve ensured patient safety and staff safety has always been at the forefront.”Want to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

could have ability to break free from EU rules – in return for tariff punishment if it takes that pathA proposal seen as the best chance of avoiding a disastrous no-deal Brexit at the end of the year has been rejected by the UK’s chief negotiator.With the talks deadlocked, it was thought the EU could agree to give the UK the ability to break free from its rules – in return for the right to impose tariffs if it chose to do so.The arrangement would have avoided the feared cliff-edge on 31 December, when the UK will crash out of the single market and customs union unless an agreement is struck.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut, in a series of tweets, David Frost, Boris Johnson’s negotiator, announced: “I want to be clear that the government will not agree to ideas like the one currently circulating giving the EU a new right to retaliate with tariffs if we chose to make laws suiting our interests.“We could not leave ourselves open to such unforeseeable economic risk.”Minister won’t comment on chlorinated chicken, claiming US listeningBritish officials had suggested Boris Johnson would consider the compromise, under which the UK would secure the right to deviate from Brussels’ standards in areas such as state aid.The EU was thought to be sceptical – preferring to strike a firm deal, rather than set a path for future conflict in the relationship – but had welcomed what it viewed as new-found flexibility in London.After clashes following recent remote negotiations, optimism had crept up that an agreement could be reached when face-to-face talks resume next week.But, without the proposed fudge – kicking key decisions into the future – the two sides remain at odds over access to UK fishing waters and ‘level playing field rules’ to protect the

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

He has to go with somebody when he goes out,Another neighbour added that Jonty had been seen chucking stuff out of the window on to the grass [including] rubbish [and] faeces.Defence counsel Philippa McAtasney told the Old Bailey that Braverys parents abhor what he did at the Tate Modern, and cannot forgive him, but feel let down by the system.A Hammersmith  Fulham Council spokesman said a serious case review was under way, and the authority was co-operating fully and would learn from its findings.The mentally ill and violent Bravery has been told he may never be released from prison.He was jailed for  years at the Old Bailey on June , after admitting attempted murder.Judge Mrs Justice McGowan said: The fear hemust have experienced and the horror his parents felt are beyond imagination.You had intended to kill someone that day - you almost killed that six-year-old boy.She said Braverys autism spectrum disorderdid not explain the attack, and acknowledged expert evidence he presents a grave and immediate risk to the public.The judge added: You will spend the greater part -not all - of your le detained ... you may never be released.He has been in custody at Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security psychiatric hospital at Crowthorne, Berkshire, since mid-October .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm. While the new name — Lost The Pot Noodle — is inspired, one notes that it now requires the consumer to put the ingredients in a mug or make it in a pan on the stove.As any self-respecting, Olympically idle student will tell you, a clean mug is a rarer sighting than an eclipse and, as for a pan, eventhey own one it will be housing enough penicillin growth to solve America’s recent shortage.So, memo to Unilever: Don’t phase out the original just yet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The Prime Minister announced that we were at last allowed out of our Great British Hibernation.We can go to the pub, buy useless tat in shops and queue up for plaster lawn ornaments from garden centres. We can have the in-laws round to visit! Yoot!⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesBoris says that his decision was made on good scientic advice. Hmm, maybe. It is true that the infection rate for Covid has been dropping rapidly for some time. But it’s still there, still hanging around with mischief on its mind. All it takes is one person in a gathering of  or  at some pizza joint and that infection rate will be up again quickly enough.In some of the countries that have released their people from lockdown, a second spike has occurred.In Germany the famous “R” rate for infection is well above the dreaded one. South Korea and Spain have seen new outbreaks, too.But the truth is Boris didn’t have much of an option. The public is bored stf and the economy is wrecked.I suspect the decision was arrived at on those grounds, rather than strictly on the science. Everyone wants to go out and spend money. I am not sure why they do.  There were good things about lockdown — and it taught us one or two truths about ourselves.It was a pleasure to hear the birds singing, for example. A real delight to see the roads free from traffic. The skies are full of swts and swallows instead of the incessant airline flights. The quality of the air we breathe improved hugely as a result. So did the water quality of rivers and streams.We went out much, much less. As a consequence, many people saved an awful lot of money because they weren’t wasting it on buying rubbish from shops.People learned to cook — and ate home-prepared meals with their families. The truth is, in normal times, we eat out far more often than is good for us, financially or otherwise. And we shopped locally — the corner stores did a roaring trade — and less often, thus saving carbon emissions.Employers discovered that people could work from home perfectly well. Hopefully this will persuade some to scale back their offices and give people the chance to work from home.Imagine how many homes could be created from disused offices! We wouldn’t have to pave over half the country to sort out our housing crisis. Imagine cutting out the daily commute for ever!We didn’t have to hug people. Indeed, we were barred by law from hugging people. Or kissing them on the bloody cheek, like everyone in the media world does. That, by itself, was a huge bonus for me.My wish is that we take some of that stuff from lockdown and make it the new normal. Live at a quieter, gentler pace. Continue to eat at home — and support our local corner shops. Use the car less. Spend less money on a whole load of b******s we don’t really need. Use aeroplanes not at all, preferably. Right now, the Government has given us licence to go out and do stuff.Here’s my plea. Let’s do a bit less stuff than we used to. Let’s remain kind of half in and half out of lockdown. Whether Covid is still around or not. We’ll end up happier as a result.ONE thing Captain Tom showed us, as he walked around his garden as he approached the age of , is that it’s never too late to make a dference.Bob Dylan is just a young whippersnapper by Tom’s standards.But at the age of  he has just made his finest album in at least three decades, and probably more. Rough And Rowdy Ways is a joy to listen to – and I’d given up on the bloke in the s.If I ever reach  I intend to make a grime album with Rihanna. Get your orders in now.The United Nations has decided to give them to Mauritius. That’s because the islands are nearer Mauritius than they are to the UK. On that basis we could have a good claim to owning Belgium. The islands are important to the UK militarily. And we should keep them. The UN has given us deadlines to hand them over to a country that never owned them. What we should do instead is leave the crooked UN.EXCLUDED from the Government’s loosening of lockdown are Britain’s vibrant community of werewolves and vampires.“It is all very well biting someone’s neck, or ripping their lungs out while howling loudly,” a scientist advising the Government probably said. “But when they do this there is the risk that the virus could be passed on via droplets from the creature’s mouth. Or indeed paws – werewolves do not have a good record of using hand-sanitiser.”By contrast, zombies were praised for their social-distancing technique. “Whenever you see them they are always walking two metres apart with their hands outstretched and bits of flesh falling off their faces,” the same scientist probably added.A spokesman for the National Association of Lycanthropescommented: “This is typical of the prejudice we werewolves face and amounts to discrimination. Actually, I thought I had the virus a few weeks ago. Nasty cough and so on.“But I’m all right nooooowwwwwwooooo.”THE day after the woke ninnies at Warners withdrew the great Hollywood film Gone With The Wind because of “race issues”, guess what happened  Yup, it became the No bestselling film on Amazon. Better still, it reached No in the AppleiTunes chart for TV and film. Not bad for a movie made more than  years ago, huh I suppose it could have been “progressives” buying the film so that they would have something to be outraged about. Or maybe the Ku Klux Klan Film Club has a bigger membership than we thought.More likely though is that people loathe censorship. They don’t like being told what they can and can’t watch. Truth be told it hasn’t been for a good  years. And the process accelerated under Magic Grandpa and his front bench of mouth-breathing dingbats. Now it’s the well-orf who support Labour. And the poor who vote Conservative. But there aren’t enough people called Olly and Poppy in the country, which is why Labour hasn’t won an election for  years. Unless it reconnects with the people it was set up to support, the working class, it won’t win one for another few decades either.A SOCIAL media site had a big hit when it asked people to reveal things they regretted about getting married. The site, Whisper, was inundated with replies. Most were kind of: “I just wish I hadn’t married the fat bastard, full stop.”But some wished they’d had a fling with someone of the same sex first, or felt aggrieved they hadn’t checked out the in-laws first. That was quite a big issue.

The Seventies brought Led Zeppelin and countless rock bands, it gave us heavy metal and punk and Joy Division pretty much all at the same time.The biggest-selling album of the Eighties, Michael Jackson’s Thriller, was actually written by a bloke from Hull, while British greats as erse as Duran Duran and The Smiths ruled the waves.In the Cool Britannia of the Nineties, when Britpop was ringing out of radio networks worldwide, even American stars such as Madonna sought help from British producers such as Nellee Hooper and William Orbit.Then there were the Spice Girls. And Coldplay. Now we’ve got Ed Sheeran and Adele. And it doesn’t stop with artists. Love him or hate him, Simon Cowell’s TV programmes are another British global music phenomenon.But it’s live music where Britain really dominates today. Glastonbury should be taking place this weekend.I’ve played at just about every major festival on the planet, from Coachella in the US to Fuji Rock in Japan, but there is nowhere to touch Glastonbury.It is, quite simply, the greatest show on earth There is a massive ripple effect from Glastonbury. It sets a very high bar for the other  — that’s  — festivals that happen throughout the UK every single summer.And the same crews who build the stages, operate the sound systems, put up the fences and supply the bogs for Glasto are busy for the rest of the summer at other events.Now the independent festival sector is at risk of collapse thanks to the Covid shutdown.Last month, the Association of Independent Festivals , which represents  festivals in the UK, reported that  per cent of its members were facing costs that could ruin their businesses and . per cent were uninsured for Covid- related cancellations.Most of my time these days is spent planning and organising The Big Feastival, which was due to take place here on my farm in Oxfordshire this August Bank Holiday weekend.Of course I’m devastated it won’t be going ahead, but the really sad thing is that it looks like no one is going to hear any live music, new or old this summer.That’s a tragedy for the musicians who rely on gigging to make a living — as well as all the other people whose income relies on live music.The Musicians’ Union says its members have lost more than £million in income during the lockdown. Remember, that most musicians just scrape by at the best of times.Big stars are bigger than ever before, but they are the exception not the rule. When Adele releases another record there is a danger she will become so massive she will collapse into a black hole.But now bands need an audience to play to and also financial support, which used to come from record companies but now is hard to find.Records, or downloads, are basically free these days, so live shows are the only real way to make money.In the same way restaurants were already struggling before lockdown, many of Britain’s smaller live music venues were struggling too.So most of the places I played in the early days with Blur have already dis- appeared. They need to be able to open their doors again, as do festivals.It has to be possible to find a way. Just as with pubs, restaurants and cinemas, you could limit the number of people allowed into a venue.Perhaps more gigs could be seated to ensure social distancing. Not quite the same, but better than nothing.As far as the rest of the planet is concerned, Britain is represented pretty much by the Royal Family, football and music.We must keep our festival circuit alive and nurture new artists.That means we urgently have to find a way for music to be played to a live audience, evenit’s only a small one — so that we can keep meaning something to the rest of the world.To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But his determination to do what is right by the children made the real dference.Contrast that with the union militants and council leaders of the Left.

But this is the Government’s vision for our summer as it tries to save businesses while keeping us safe.To which we say: Well, good luck with that. We understand the reasoning.

Wildle department officers plan to lure the creatures into cages and take them to a clinic, where they will be sedated, sterilised and left with a tattoo to mark their neutering.

We are pretty sure he was knocked unconscious under the water and he didn’t come back up again. “Ralph and I saw what was happening and we climbed over and started trying to pull him out. “His friend also climbed over and tried to pull him out, he was unconscious. “We were telling them to pull his head out of the water, and Ralph was trying to do that and had a hold of him and was swimming alongside him. “His friend then lost his grip on him and he started getting pushed down the river because of the current. “A fisherman jumped in and helped us to grab him and pull him out to put him on the side of the river. “That was when someone  started to perform CPR on him, the ambulance service were telling them what to do on the phone. “I tried to do CPR but I wasn’t strong enough so I asked for help. “After all of this another one of his friends had tried to save him by grabbing the leguard ring and ing in. “We were all focusing on the first man we didn’t realise the second one had been swept away.“Because my friends and I go there quite a lot we know to avoid the middle of the river because of the hotspots. “But these guys didn’t know where they shouldn’t jump and got sucked into the current.“I’ve been going there for a long time and nothing like this has ever happened before.”Ralph added: “A group of us were at the weir and suddenly I heard the guys screaming, three of them were in the water and one was unconscious. “They were trying to get him out, and when I heard the screaming I jumped in and climbed down the weir and tried to help them pull him out. “His head was really under the water, his friend seemed to lose his grip on him and he went even further under the water. “As he went down the river someone helped us to get him on the bank and then an older guy performed CPR on him. “I’m glad he’s alive, I know he’s in the hospital but I hope he is okay. There was a lot going on at that moment. “The part that they jumped into was probably the most dangerous part of the weir, we did try to find his friend but we didn’t want to risk it when we know what the currents are like. “It’s generally a pretty safe place to go and swim but I don’t think we will be going back there again.”Both boys jumped back in to try to save Syrian refugee Eyad after he had also tried to save his pal. Other members of the Syrian community in West London also travelled to the riverbank after learning their friend, , who lives in Uxbridge, had gone missing.Jacks mum Nicola Thomas said: “It’s heartbreaking for the boys to see all of this, and for the family of the man that it’s happened to. “I didn’t know whether to shout at Jack or hug him at first, because he’s put himself in danger jumping in but I am proud of him. “They definitely saved his le, there is no doubt about that.”The tragedy came as temperatures soared to around C on Tuesday as Britains heatwave continues.Officials from the Royal Berkshire Fire and Rescue Service said crews were at the riverside for almost three-and-a-half hours.A spokesman said: We are urging residents across Berkshire to take care near water.As the warm weather continues, it may be tempting to swim in open water, but there are many dangers involved.One of the main risks when entering the water is cold water shock, eventhe weather is warm.You also do not know what is beneath the surface – there could be unseen currents and reeds, which could pull you under.”LPA Commander for Windsor  Maidenhead, Superintendent Colin Hudson, said: “Officers have been working tirelessly with our partners to locate the man who entered the water yesterday, and have now tragically found a body.“We are grateful for the support we received from both Berkshire and Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Services, South Central Ambulance Service, and Berkshire Lowland Search and Rescue.“I would also like to thank members of the public who provided information as well as assistance to my officers.“I would like to thank them for their patience while officers investigated this incident, and we will be leaving the scene shortly.“I am very sorry to have to bring this sad news.“Our thoughts are with both men’s families during this very upsetting time.”GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I mean, I’ve only been able to see Dear Evan Hansen  times so far.And Christmas won’t be the same without the uniquely British tradition of the winter panto. How will all those former boyband stars fund their showbiz lestyles for another year Sadly, post-Covid restrictions look particularly cruel to the arts.Those dastardly droplets mean singing is banned and the idea of packing out a historic theatre where the tiny seats mean you are virtually sitting on top of your neighbour just won’t cut it.But in the middle of an international health emergency it’s all too easy to dismiss the importance of stage shows, movies, the TV industry, festivals and concerts.The attitude seems to be: “We’re dying, goddammit, the economy is cratering, don’t talk to me about the bloody theatre!”But that approach will mean Britain is cakewalking into a cultural catastrophe that could wipe off decades of creative progress, end our modern domination of the arts and entertainment and see the closure of most historic theatres before the end of the year.If that is yet another horrid consequence of Covid-, a disease most likely spread because of a despicable Chinese wet market, I will be fuming.Dame Judi Denchs warning that theatres may not open again in her letime is as stark as it is horrying.It would wipe out £.billion of annual ticket sales, see , good folk lose their jobs and damage tourism.While the pressure is building by the day on the Government to launch yet another unprecedented rescue package, I think that’s only part of the answer.Entertainment is a big-money industry dominated by super-wealthy moguls who have a responsibility to look after as many of their loyal staff and young creatives as humanly possible.Now is the time for other celebrities and businesspeople who have earned a small fortune from the creative industries to give back.Where are all those Hollywood stars, with hundreds of millions in the bank, who rush to perform on the West End stage to be seen as a real actor, dahling Surely they could donate a tiny portion of their wealth to set up a private rescue fund for theatres For example, Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the South Park creators who are behind The Book Of Mormon, are worth a billion bucks.JK Rowling, whose Harry Potter play The Cursed Child is at the Palace Theatre, has a £million fortune.We Will Rock You producer Robert de Niro has £million in the bank, Sister Act producer and star Whoopi Goldberg £million, and West End favourite Dame Helen Mirren £million.I could name a hundred other multi-millionaire stars who have used the West End to enhance their careers who owe it to the backroom staff on the breadline to be part of the solution.Thankfully, the king of theatre — Lord Lloyd-Webber — has, as ever, proved inspirational and innovative.Without being asked, he is putting his money where his mouth is to PROVE to the Government that it is possible to safely reopen theatres WITHOUT ANY social distancing by using enhanced precautions such as temperature checks on the door and face masks for all audience members.The Government must listen to him and embrace his case study of Phantom Of The Opera, which has remained open in South Korea throughout the pandemic with no issues.Otherwise, we risk the curtain coming down for good.BACKING down so quickly on extending Sunday trading hours was a disappointing move forced by Tory backbenchers.While on first glance the idea of allowing supermarkets and other shops to stay open longer on our day of rest sounds unappealing to many workers, the reality is that this change would have probably saved many jobs in the long run.It’s nonsensical that on one day of the week most Tescos can only open for six hours, while international delivery services such as Amazon continue to decimate their business, especially now with social-distancing measures making it even more unappealing to spend time lining up outside.By contrast, the other night I was able to order an Amazon Prime Now delivery to arrive at my house at pm on a Sunday night.I’d ordered an Uber Eats takeaway from McDonald’s two hours earlier.The archaic current trading hours laws were introduced in , the year Jeff Bezos created a fledgling online book store called Amazon.Like it or not, that business has created a dferent world of consumerism.Compromises to allow workers the option not to take on more Sunday work, leaving the additional hours to those who want to earn extra cash, could make the necessary move more palatable.But let’s not avoid having the debate.THE Culture Secretary has so much on his plate that Shirley Ballas used an innovative approach to attract his attention this week – and it worked.Launching an impassioned plea to Oliver Dowden to “safely open” ballroom dance studios on my talkRADIO Drivetime show, the Strictly Come Dancing judge teased: “If Oliver is out there, I don’t even mind having a cha-cha-cha with him to show him it is possible to social distance.”Clearly the power of the Queen of Latin remains undiminished.Within hours, Oliver had tweeted: “Shirley, as a Strictly fan, I’m happy to talk about how we can get dancing going safely again. Great offer on the cha-cha-cha – I’ll get practising.”Expect dance studios to be back in business imminently, then.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Being from the UK, it’s one of those gigs I think everyone wants to do. Hopefully next year.“But no f***ing way am I camping. No way. I’d have to build a house for it to work.“I’ve been to so many festivals with my mates but I’ve not done any camping stuff.“I’ve got the worst OCD so I wouldn’t be camping at all. That’s probably why I don’t have crazy stories from festivals.”Essex-born Jonas, whose real name is Guy James Robin, has cemented himself as one of the biggest names in dance music in the past five years, selling more than million records.Today he’s back with summer anthem Naked, featuring US singer MAX, but it won’t be part of a bigger collection after he decided releasing full albums is no longer for him.Jonas said: “I’m not going to be doing an album any time soon. I really enjoy doing singles. I can move quickly with them, especially in the world that I’m in, because the trends are forever changing.“I’m not planning to saturate the market with loads of records, it’s just about putting Naked out and that being my biggest record to date, I hope.”Jonas hopes the song will be “uplting” for people as we come out of lockdown. But as someone who knows nightclubs better than anyone , he insisted there is no chance they can reopen anytime soon.He explained: “Clubs will not work, how can you tell , drunk people to stand a metre or two metres apart  It’s never going to f***ing work.“It wouldn’t work with meI’d had a few drinks. I wouldn’t even know what two metres is at that point.”SHE is usually a Glasto regular and it’s a good bet you will find her partying into the early hours, but Rita Ora will have to make do with her back garden this weekend.The How To Be Lonely singer shared this photo on Instagram while sunbathing at home in her bra in the scorching temperatures.But she didn’t put as much thought into what she’d be wearing as she would have doneshe was heading to Somerset.She captioned the snap: “Can’t find my bikini.”It must have been a welcome relief for her to get outside though, having spent lockdown working hard on new music.She posted another photo of her home studio, where it was C, and wrote: “Hope you are all having fun outside enjoying the sun, meanwhile we’re cutting vocals with no air con.”Just think about all the tunes you’ll have to perform by the time you hit Worthy Farm next year, Rita.The superstar had said her album would be coming in September but her manager has now confirmed it is being pushed back, partly because the coronavirus crisis prevented her from finishing it.Jonathan Dickins said: “It isn’t coming in September. It’ll be ready when it’s ready.“We’re all in the same boat. You’re doing stuff and then suddenly the world stops.“It’ll come when it’s ready. We have music but we’re still working.”It’s been five years since her third album  was released, while January will mark a decade since her breakthrough record  which sold million copies to become one of the biggest records of all time.If Adele has taught us anything with her music, it’s that it will certainly be worth the wait.LITTLE MIX’s Jesy Nelson probably wouldn’t get very far across Worthy Farm in these shoes.She showed off slippers made to look like her pet pooches on Instagram, amid hopes the girl group could be signed up for next year’s festival.They are expected to have released their sixth album by then and could be a perfect signing for a team eager for more female artists.Jesy said in : “We would love to do Glastonbury, it would be incredible for us to do that. I think we’d be able to get a new audience that maybe we don’t have, people who aren’t too sure about Little Mix. We could prove them wrong, change their mind.”The singer, whose song Blue Jumper is out today, was picked up while supporting the band on tour but almost didn’t get to play for a music boss in the crowd.She said: “I’d gone over a little bit on my set. I was about to do my one hit and the stage director said, ‘You need to finish now’.“The head of Universal had just arrived. Richard ran over and was like, ‘No, let her play another’.”FOO FIGHTERS’ incredible  headline set is among a load of performances stream-ing through iPlayer over the weekend. You can also see Beyonce, David Bowie, Blur, George Ezra, Arctic Monkeys and more.THIS year’s festival was due to be the biggest yet but organiser Emily Eavis has insisted ticket holders are in for a bumper event when it s next year.She said they are hoping to roll over much of this year’s line-up, but had already booked loads of acts for , which may even mean making the festival longer.Emily said: “We’re rolling two festivals together for . We’ve got a hell of a lot of surprises and things that we were planning for the thand we’re going to try to get those things going for next year.“Logistically it’s a little bit complicated because we’d already pencilled in many of the acts for . It was one of those very unusual years where you’re quite far ahead, two years ahead, on the line-up. So we’re trying to work out how much we can fit into next year.“We’ve had lots of amazing letters from people with ideas of how we could make it into like a two-week holiday or run over three weekends. There’s lots of ideas going.”Taylor Swt Kendrick Lamar and Sir Paul McCartney were due to headline this weekend and Emily is hoping they will all be back, especially Beatles legend Paul.She said on BBC  Music: “I really hope he’ll be back next year singing it from the Pyramid and we’ll all be in tears, going, ‘It’s happened, we’re back’.”Me too.SIMON BOYLE - COLDPLAY : THEIR fourth time as headline act and they proved to be one of the greatest ever. CHRIS MARTIN and co won over even the most sceptical festivalgoer and had people in tears with their performance, complete with confetti, light-up bracelets and fireworks.JOE KASPER - DAVE : IT wasn’t just his fantastic performance but meeting his fan Alex Mann, who he got up from the crowd to rap his song Thiago Silva. It was enough to convert workmates I had dragged along to become fans of the Mercury Prize winner and, dare I say, grime.HOWELL DAVIES - LORDE : AT only , she proved to be a cut above when she delivered a standout set, partly from within a huge glass box suspended on stage. The Kiwi’s rousing tracks were lapped up and her visuals included dancers, lasers and clouds of smoke.ELLIE HENMAN - LEWIS CAPALDI : THE moment he swaggered on dressed as Noel Gallagher, I knew this set would be my highlight. At the end he told the massive crowd: “If you haven’t enjoyed it keep it to your f***ing self.” Safe to say, everyone loved it.KESHA has released a tribute to Marc Bolan of T.Rex, who headlined the first Glasto in .

Gradually build up time spent apart.Animals have sensitive noses and using pet-specic cleaning products in the home can be helpful to reduce their anxiety.Making sure there are no harsh smells will lower tension levels and allows your pet to relax. .Keep cat litter trays clean, and for very attached pets, especially puppies, leaving something with your scent on, like a T-shirt or old towel, can be soothing.Playing gentle music at a low volume can help to distract from any unfamiliar noises that may worry them.There are even pet podcasts available.Pets who knew le before lockdown should slip back into previous family routines eventually.Cats are already more solitary creatures, and dogs should cope wellyou prepare them properly.However, puppies that have only ever known lockdown, or dogs that have become too used to your company, may find it more challenging.A good way to help them adjust is by pretending to go back to work. Put on office clothes or a school unorm and act out your pre-lockdown morning routines.Go through the motions of leaving for work. Pick up your car keys, settle your pet, then close the door and leave them, evenyou only go and sit in the garden or take a walk.You might feel silly, but this can be really helpful for your pet, especiallythey have only ever seen you in your “off-duty”, stay-home outfits.When you come back in it’s vital that you wait until your pet is calm before greeting them, whether that takes five minutes or five hours.Don’t join in OTT celebrations or encourage reunion “zoomies”, as long- term this can enhance anxious behaviour and increase stress levels.By taking things slowly your pet won’t find the transition back to post-lockdown le too dficult.However,furry friends don’t seem to be settling well and you encounter signs of anxiety, such as toilet issues, high heart rates, constant chewing or scratching, it’s worth seeking advice from a qualied animal behaviourist apbc.org.uk or your vet.A remote camera can give clues to situations you might not be aware of, such as noises, that could be troubling your pet in your absence.With everyone at home constantly during lockdown, our pets may have struggled to rest properly.Cats famously like to snooze but dogs also need up to  hours of sleep a day and may have found lockdown exhausting.Sometimes pets are actually anxious because our constant company means they are over-tired and over-stimulated and now can’t think straight.For all pets it is up to us to ensure they are not disturbed when they are taking time out.Cats are generally good at taking themselves off to cat nap so just leave them to rest, but dogs often need a bit more help to switch off.Don’t fuss over them while they catch some sleep and help children to understand that when their best friend is snoozing, they need to be left in peace.For dogs in particular, lockdown may have changed their exercise routines dramatically, with some getting more frequent or far longer walks than previously.Start to readjust this now, to correlate daily timetables with your regular routines ing.If you normally walk your dog at specic times of the day, such as before and after work, then resume going for walkies on this schedule.Oryou normally use a dog walker or have help from another person during the day, make the effort to introduce them now, especiallyyou have a pet who hasn’t met them yet.If you are one of the many new pet owners who got a puppy or kitten during lockdown you’ve had a lovely honeymoon period to bond with your new buddy.However, it also means it’s likely your pet has never spent any time home alone.Before leaving you new addition solo, you must do sufficient training to ensure your puppy or kitten understands that being separated from you is OK.With puppies, build up slowly to ensure they are happy and get used to the idea of being handled by other people and socialising with other dogs.You can stay with your pupthey are more confident with you around but don’t allow them to be clingy and always reward positive, confident behaviour.For cats, six months is the ideal age to start training with a cat flapyou plan to use one.Professional help with training is now permitted again under government rules and is strongly advised.A bored pet can be an anxious pet. If they are under-stimulated their minds wander and your home can suffer the consequences – so keep them busy.For dogs, toys stuffed with treats, or scattering snacks into their bed to hunt, will give them something to do.There are also tutorials online for making home-made games and toys.For cats, include circuits and teasers to prevent your furniture being damaged.Rotate dferent ones daily, so there is always something new for your pet to investigate and play with.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Music cannot be quarantined. ⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesOur ability to appreciate music is a vital part of being human. We’re born with automated brain responses to music. Our deep emotional connection with the songs we know and love lasts a letime, even in late stage dementia and they play us out during our funerals.However, even during all this musical activity there was one place where these songs couldn’t venture – in all the online fitness and health classes.   Even Joe Wicks the king of fitness is unable to use the music we know and love in his online workouts, because a simple suitable licence doesn’t yet exist. George Ezra’s mum called her son recently to ask him to urge his record company to give Joe special permission to use his music.There’s also a noticeable absence of music in NHS hospitals and care homes due to the lack of a simple and affordable single licence. Based on the science that I’ll explain below, I believe this situation is compromising the success of wellness programmes, holding back the health of the nation and exacerbating the issue of underlying health problems that have resulted in tens of thousands of deaths in the UK during the global pandemic.We need to accept that our approaches to health simply haven’t worked and are unlikely to do so. We need to take a radically dferent approach and we need to do it fast. Fitness industry revenues have continued to climb, but so have average waistlines, because these figures include people who pay gym membership but never go there, and buy all the fitness gear we now wear as everyday normal clothing. It’s time to take drastic action. The UK’s poor obesity and diabetes figures have contributed to us witnessing the highest death rate in Europe. Sothe standard promotion of nutrition and exercise don’t convince the nation to move more, what do we try next Well, science shows that music has very powerful effects on the brain as well as the body. It’s no coincidence that you see sports stars and athletes wearing headphones during training and competition warm ups. The elite sports world knows that music is an incredible tool. Music motivates us to move , reduces feelings of pain and fatigue, and turns a clinical environment into a relaxed and fun experience. But here’s the critical point: research consistently shows that music we know and love amplies the effects in our brain. Therefore, the hit songs we’ve grown up with influence us more than ‘soundalike’ versions. That’s why you say, “I LOVE this song!. Yet health professionals delivering online classes are only allowed to use “license free” music or soundalike re-recordings of well-known songs. I want the real thing and so do all other human brains! We need to simply access to hit songs for fitness and health professionals.Online is the new offline. We’re all now doing lots more online and will continue to do so. That includes workouts. It’s the easiest way to engage people. We need a new music licence that health professionals can easily buy so they can legally and affordably use hit songs in their work. Withholding hit songs from health professionals is like giving Usain Bolt a pair of wellies to run a m race. We need to give fitness and health pros the best possible kit to maximise their success in engaging the nation to move more – and that includes the music the nation loves.So I’m calling out to the UK public and decision makers to urge the music industry to quickly create two new music licences: one that health and fitness professionals can buy to use music in online classes and one that the Department for Health can buy to use music across the NHS. I truly believe that this will not only help transform the health of the nation but also provide a new health revenue stream for the music industry while we wait to see what the shape of live music will look like in our future socially-distant world. There’s a growing number of people within the music industry who want to see this happen, but these conversations are slow. Let’s act fast. Lives are at stake.

Bin Laden, who headed the terror group at the time of the   attacks, was killed in a raid on a compound in the city of Abottabad, northern Pakistan in May . Analysts have long argued that Bin Laden could not have been in the town without the knowledge of at least some figures within Pakistans security services and government.Previous raids on locations where he was thought to be hiding out had also failed after suspected tip-offs, and a decision was taken by the Obama administration not to inform the Pakistan authorities ahead of the operation. During a speech laying out his governments budget plans, Khan said: We sided with the US in the war on terror but they came here and killed him, martyred him.[They] used abusive language against us [and] did not inform us [of the raid], despite the fact that we lost , people in the war on terror.As in the Christian world, the word martyr is often used in Islam to describe a person who died for their religious beliefs.The word is frequently used as a term of honour by terrorist groups like al-Qaeda for members killed in battles, airstrikes, or suicide bombings. Khans use of the word drew sharp criticism from opposition leaders in Pakistan. Khwaja Mohammed As, the National Assembly Leader for opposition party The Pakistan Muslim League, said: [Bin Laden] ruined my country but [Khan] is calling him a martyr.Al-Qaeda is believed to be responsible for numerous attacks and attempted attacks inside Pakistan. Khan also told the parliament that the US had sought to use Pakistan as a scapegoat for their failure to defeat the Taliban and bring stability to neighbouring Afghanistan. US officials have frequently accused Pakistan of supporting the Afghan Taliban in order to maintain influence in Afghanistan as part of a powerplay against India.

The aircraft touched the runway surface on its engines,” the inquiry found.In the wake of the crash Pakistan’s aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said that human error on the part of the pilot and co-pilot as well as air traffic control caused the plane crash.The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout they were having a conversation about corona.The [virus] was on their minds. Their families were affected and they were having a discussion about it.Civil Aviation Authority of Pakistan report catalogues a series of blunders made by the crew.Data from the flight recorders shows that the landing gear was selected as “down” during part of the planes descent.But later when the plane was much nearer to the ground the landing gear lever was selected as “up”. The reasons for this ‘gear up’ selection have not been determined cockpit-voice recordings reveal warnings that the landing-gear was not down were “disregarded”, says the inquiry.Air traffic controllers also failed to notice the wheels weren’t down.When the crew realised what had happened the pilots initially applied reverse-thrust and braking, as the engines scraped along the runway.They were unable to halt the plane to perform a ‘go around’ and take off as they belatedly put the landing gear down.The A initially climbed away, with its crew planning to make another approach but engines “failed one by one”, says the inquiry.The aircraft came down in a built-up area about ,m from the runway threshold.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You see a black Jesus, or a Chinese Jesus, or a Middle Eastern Jesus - which of course is the most accurate - or a Fijian Jesus, he said.His points were made in response to being askedthe “way the Western church portrays Jesus needs to be thought about again”.The clergyman told how monuments across the CofE, including Canterbury Cathedral, were being looked at “very carefully” to seethey all “should be there”. Rev Welby urged campaigners to show forgiveness for the “trespasses” of people immortalised in the form of statues, rather than tearing them down. He said: “We can only do thatweve got justice, which means the statue needs to be put in context. Some will have to come down.”He added: “Some names will have to change. I mean, the church, goodness me, you know, you just go around Canterbury Cathedral, theres monuments everywhere, or Westminster Abbey, and were looking at all that, and some will have to come down.“But yes, there can be forgiveness, I hope and pray as we come together, but onlytheres justice.“If we change the way we behave now, and say this was then and we learned from that, and change how were going to be in the future, internationally, as well.”Rev Welby said: “Were going to be looking very carefully and putting them in context and seeingthey all should be there.”He said it is “what people do at times like this,” adding: And its a good thing, but there has to be, for forgiveness, there has to be this turning round, this conversion, the Pope called it.“The change of heart that says we learned from them not to be like that, and to change the way we are in the future.”Dozens of sculptures line the walls of the magnicent Cathedral in Canterbury, ranging from William, Duke of Normandy to Queen Elizabeth II.It is unclear which statues will be reviewed, and Lambeth Palace did not immediately respond to request for clarication.In , retired medical artist Richard Neave recreated the face of Jesus by studying Semite skulls using modern-day forensic techniques.His portrait shows the Son of God may have had a wide face, dark eyes, a bushy beard and short curly hair, as well as a tanned complexion.These features would likely have been typical of Middle Eastern Jews in the Galilee area of northern Israel.Dr Neave stressed the portrait was that of an adult man living at the same time, in the same place as Jesus.The absence of a physical description of Jesus in the Bible has left his appearance open to suggestion with Caucasian men dominating likenesses of him in Western culture.The earliest depictions showed him as a typical Roman man, wearing a tunic with short hair and no beard - with his facial hair first said to have made an appearance in AD.Medieval art in Europe typically showed him with brown hair and pale skin - an image strengthened during the Renaissance, by works including Leonardo da Vinci The Last Supper painting.In  white American Ted Neeley played the Messiah in the film version of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s Jesus Christ Superstar musical.In  white Brit Robert Powell played the lead role in TV show Jesus of Nazareth before American Jim Cavaziel played the figure in The Passion of the Christ.Jesus has also been depicted as Latino or an Aboriginal.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The global animal welfare organisation is calling for all tourists to avoid captive elephant venues that offer these forms of interactions when tourism resumes post-coronavirus.“We are calling on the travel industry to revise their wildle policies and stop offering exploitative experiences to their customers,” Ben Pearson, Head of Campaigns at World Animal Protection, Australia said. “Elephant riding and other interactions, like shows and bathing, support acute animal cruelty.“We want to expose the true suffering elephants endure for a letime just so travellers can have their ‘once in a letime’ holiday experience.”Mr Pearson said that once travel opens up again, tourists should avoid such practices.“Tourism has come to a halt, but it will re-build, and this is the ideal opportunity to create a responsible and resilient future for wild animals,” he said. Another video released by the World Animal Protection shows three emaciated elephants that are forced to dance on their hind legs in front of a crowd of tourists.One elephant was forced to lt a tourist up with its trunk while visibly wincing in agony.It is tourists demands for such acts of “entertainment” that drives up the number of captive elephants in Asian countries. There are approximately , captive elephants that have undergone cruel training in Thailand alone.As a sustainable, long-term solution, World Animal Protection is advocating for a captive breeding ban on elephants to ensure future generations are spared this trauma.Elephant-friendly venues work on an observation-only model, not allowing direct interaction between elephants and tourists, but still providing jobs and a valuable income to local people such as elephant keepers, also known as mahouts.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s a great privilege to be involved in what we are doing for the country, he says. It’s an immensely proud moment for me personally, and for the business, to be involved in this. I worked without a day’s break for nine weeks to get everything up and running and stable.  There are times in the military when it doesn’t matter how long you go to work for, you do your job because it absolutely needs doing. That’s exactly where we are today: the job needs doing and thereforeit’s a Friday night, Saturday morning, it doesn’t matter.

Men working as social carers, factory workers, security guards, cabbies and more have more than double the risk of death as men in the general population. For women, carers and sales assistants were more likely to die than other women in the population. And deprivation appears to play a big role. Of men in elementary jobs - the highest-risk group - those in deprived neighbourhoods were more than three times more likely to die with Covid-. The data was released today by the Office for National Statistics , which examined , deaths involving Covid- of working-age people in England and Wales between March  and May . Nearly two-thirds of these deaths were among men.  The data found that men working in elementary occupationshad some of the highest rates of death involving Covid-, with . deaths per , men. Security guards alone had the highest rate, with  deaths per ,. Dr Jenner Dixon, Chief Executive at the Health Foundation, said: Today’s ONS figures highlight yet again that COVID- is not a great leveller. People in low-paid occupations, those living in more deprived areas and people from black and minority ethnic communities [are] at signicantly higher risk of dying from the virus than the general population.John Phillips, Acting General Secretary of the GMB union, said:  These gruesome figures show why key workers urgently need much better protection in the workplace. “The fact that low paid workers are particularly at risk highlights the gaping inequality in our society.Nobody wants to get Britain back working more than GMB, but it has to be done safely. The Governmentaposs current guidance is simply not fit to halt this horrying death toll.”Here is what the figures say.  Coronavirus death rates social care workers were statistically signicantly higher than others of the same age and sex.  deaths involving COVID- among social care workers were registered between  March and  May . That means a rate of . deaths per , menand . deaths per , women . That compares to . deaths per , men and . deaths per , women from Covid in the general working-age population. So what about among health care workers – including doctors, nurses and midwives, nurse assistants, paramedics, ambulance staff, and hospital porters  The ONS found these men had a statistically signicant higher rate of death at . deaths per , men. Among women, though, the rate was . deaths per , women - which the ONS said was not statistically signicantly higher than the general population of women. Beyond the NHS and care, a massive range of jobs are more likely to have men dying of coronavirus  Six of the nine aposmajor occupational groupsapos had a aposstatistically signicantapos higher death rate than other men in the working-age population, according to the figures for England and Wales.

It’s understood Mr Starmer’s predecessor, Jeremy Corbyn, took part in the meeting which was held over video conferencing.It said it had also raised the issue of the freedom of party members to speak out on Israel. The Labour leaderaposs office declined to comment on the talks, saying it had been a private meeting. The Socialist Campaign Group of Labour MPs made it clear that Rebecca Long-Bailey should not have been sacked and should be reinstated, the statement said. The imminent annexation of the West Bank by Israelaposs government was discussed and the need for the Labour Party, MPs, party members and supporters to speak out against Israelaposs illegal annexation and ongoing human rights abuses by the government of Israel was raised. This was a businesslike exchange of views which took place in a mutually respectful manner. A spokesperson for Mr Starmer said last night: “The article Rebecca shared earlier today contained an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. As leader of the Labour Party, Keir has been clear that restoring trust with the Jewish community is a number one priority. Anti-Semitism takes many dferent forms and it is important that we all are vigilant against it. Actress Maxine Peake said she wanted to clary her comments in the interview that was shared by Ms Long-Bailey, leading to her removal from the shadow cabinet. Ms Peake had claimed police linked to the death of George Floyd in the US had learned their tactics from the Israeli secret services, which has been branded an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory.In a Twitter post, Ms Peake said she was inaccurate in her assumption of US police training. She said: I feel itaposs important for me to clary that, when talking to The Independent, I was inaccurate in my assumption of American Police training  its sources.

Heaving scenes on Bournemouth Beach yesterday prompted the council to declare a major incident - and warn people not to travel to Sandbanks. But No said today that in general, as long as social distancing rules are followed, people do not need to stop going to the beach in England. And Downing Street passed the buck to councils, not the government, to issue any direct orders to close popular spots. Matt Hancock claimed last night we have that power to shut beaches entirely. Yet today Downing Street rowed back on his comments. A No spokesman said: I believe Matt Hancock, when he spoke, was referring to the powers to impose localised lockdowns. We have been clear throughout [they] may need to be the casewe see case numbers rise in a particular area. When it comes to directly shutting beaches, he added: Local authorities are best-placed to make these decisions on a case-by-case basis. Any local lockdowns could close schools, shops and public spaces like beaches - but crucially, they would likely only come after a spike in the number of cases. Askedbeaches should be closed pre-emptively, the spokesman repeatedly said it was for local authorities to decide. Boris Johnson today warned people against taking liberties with social distancing rules, saying it could lead to a serious spike in infections. Speaking during a visit to a restaurant in east London ahead of an easing of lockdown on July , the Prime Minister said: If you look at whataposs happening where in the world where people have been coming out of lockdown. Iaposm afraid what youaposre also seeing is people taking too many liberties with the guidance, mingling too much, not observing social distancing. So in some parts of the world - I wonapost name them - you have got spikes, really serious spikes, in the instance of the disease. So it is crucial that people understand that on July  we get this right, we do this in a balanced way. No also stood by Boris Johnsonaposs claims this week that coastal resorts should show some guts and roll out the welcome mat.  The PMaposs words speak for themselves, the spokesman said. We want people to be able to enjoy the open space that we have in this country and take exercise where they need it. “But we also at the same time need to ensure that we’re following the social distancing guidelines that e have set out on a number of occasions.” Askedthe Tory leader took any responsibility at all for the scenes in Bournemouth, the spokesman said: We published the roadmap in May that set out the government’s plan for the easement of lockdown.  “As the PM and other ministers have said repeatedly, we want people to be able to enjoy outside spaces and we want them to be able to go to and enjoy leisure facilities such as the beach. “But we’ve also been clear we need to ensure we don’t see case numbers start to rise again, and therefore we continue to ask people to abide by the social distancing guidelines. Thousands travelled to the coast and packed out the beach, flouting social distancing guidelines as they squeezed together in the C temperatures. The overcrowded beaches caused chaos along Englandaposs coastline - despite authorities pleas to stay away as the UKaposs official coronavirus death toll tops ,.  Environment Secretary George Eustice warned there is “clearly an increased risk” for people packing Bournemouth Beach and it was of concern. But he said the government is very reluctant to shut beaches - saying it would only happenabsolutely necessary. And he predicted the hordes of people would reduce once this weekaposs hot weather begins to cool down. Local MP Tobias Ellwood, speaking from Bournemouth beach, said: This place was deluged and social distancing went out the window and thataposs why a major incident was declared, because the local authority and indeed the police couldnapost cope.

Six walk-in centres are being trialled in Newcastle, Rochdale, Leeds, Brent, Newham and Slough. The exact location of the centres has not been confirmed by officials but one is understood to be on a basketball court, and there have been reports they will spring up in empty shops and car parks. A source at the Department of Health and Social Care said officials were working on walk through testing sites in England for people without cars. The source said that previously the push was to have testing sites out of the way so there were not huge numbers of potentially infected people travelling into the centre of towns. Health Secretary Matt Hancock welcomed the opening of six new walk through testing sites - urging the whole country to get tested. The Department of Health and Social Caresaid the number of mobile testing units was set to double to  by the end of July. And new priority postboxes will be set up for at-home tests by  July.Mr Hancock said: “It has never been easier to get a free coronavirus test, and our new walk-in centres are yet another way to get one.“If you have symptoms, however mild, please get tested now to help stop the spread of the virus and protect the people around you. “The biggest network of diagnostic testing in UK history is ready and able to offer a test to anyone, anywhere in the country. In England, NHS Test and Trace is there to help those testing positive to trace their recent contacts and advise those at risk to stay at home, ultimately saving lives. “It is encouraging to see transmission of the virus is going down, but we all still have a part to play to limit this further. Getting tested as soon as you develop symptoms is an essential step to protect the most vulnerable and help us to safely ease lockdown measures.” The Prime Ministeraposs official spokesman said: We have already been setting up mobile testing units to serve communities where needed. “We want to ensure testing is available in places which are accessible and work for the public across the country. And they said the right guidance and advice would be available to ensure safety at the centres. ‘Major concerns’ remained over the Government’s coronavirus test and trace system last night as the government revealed a quarter of people who test positive are not contacted.  The latest figures show % of peoplewho tested positive for Covid- between May  to June  and who had been transferred to the tracing system were not reached. Shadow health minister Justin Madders said the latest Test and Trace figures raise major concerns. He said: To have a quarter of those who test positive not contacted three weeks into the aposworld-beatingapos system is not good enough and urgently needs to be addressed. Expert opinion shows that to defeat this virus we need a fully ing test and trace system, so these latest figures still raise major concerns the week before lockdown measures are eased further, especially without a working app.” The % figure includes people who the service was unable to reach because there had been no response to text, email and call reminders. It also includes people who were reached but refused to give details of close contacts. Another  people, % of the total, did not provide contact details when they were tested. A total of , people who tested positive for Covid- in England had their case transferred to the contact tracing system during the first three weeks of its operation, according to figures from the Department of Health  Social Care. Of this total, , peoplewere reached and asked to provide details of recent contacts. Mr Madders said: “It is staggering that hundreds of people are not submitting their details into the system in the first place. “Surely that should be one simple thing that can be fixed. Ministers need to level with the public about how they are going to tackle these real and serious issues as a matter of urgency. Boris Johnson promised a “world-beating” test and trace system would be up and running by the beginning of this month .And Matt Hancock promised a test and trace app would be up and running by the middle of May. The original version of the NHSX app, on which £ million had already been spent, was scrapped last week.

Local families and young children had plenty of space to spread out on the sand compared to the chaotic scenes from yesterday when the beach was rammed. It was possible to take a comfortable stroll along the promenade without worrying about social distancing. Ice-cream kiosk workers were left twiddling their thumbs as there were barely any customers to serve.The slightly overcast weather has also helped keep the hordes of day-trippers away. Roads which were gridlocked yesterday had a steady flow of traffic today and there were plenty of parking spaces available in the resortaposs car parks. Meanwhile, Bournemouth Christchurch and Poole Council revealed over  tonnes of rubbish that had been left strewn across the beach had ben cleared in the last  hours. Jill Beck, , a retired sales administrator from Bournemouth, said: The last couple of days were just madness. The amount of rubbish left was disgusting.   I think a lot of people are just selfish. I live here but I stayed away because there were too many people. Thataposs why Iaposve come down today, as I hoped the weather would keep people away.  The council and police have come under fire for not being prepared for the deluge of visitors on the hottest day of the year and for doing more to stop the influx. Retired English teacher Bryan McGuiness, , who has lived in Bournemouth for  years, said: It was disgusting. Weaposre in the middle of a pandemic yet , people came down - itaposs the height of stupidity. Why didnapost the police put up roadblocks to stop visitors. They surely should have expected it on the hottest day of the year.Iaposm sure weaposll see a surge of coronavirus cases because of it.One local business owner, which didnapost want to be named, said the council should have been better prepared after huge crowds flocked to Bournemouth on the end of May bank holiday. They said declaring a major incident was apospointlessapos as the police didnapost do anything to stop people coming to the beach. They said: The council should definitely have planned for this after what happened at the end of May. They should have blocked the roads and introduced larger fines for parking illegally. A £ fine for parking illegally in a spot which blocks ambulance access is not going to stop someone doing it. Declaring a major incident at pm was absolutely pointless. The police didnapost stop anyone coming on the beach, or remove people. There was no big announcement. There was no contingency plan in place from what I could see. Mark Cribb, who runs the Urban Beach hotel and Urban Reef restaurant in Bournemouth, fears the events of yesterday will put staycationers off from coming this summer. He described the councilaposs decision to declare a major incident as an over-reaction which trigged negative worldwide headlines.  He said: People are being encouraged not to go abroad this year and take a staycation instead and Bournemouth is one of the premier resorts in the country that will capitalise on that. Butyou were sat at home in the Midlands watching the images of people sat on top of each other on the beach surrounded by the police you are probably going to be put off booking a holiday here. You always get pockets of people around Bournemouth Pier in a  metre area but we have  miles of beach here and the rest of it wasnapost crowded yesterday. The council need better inform people that there is plenty of space where when the area around the pier is full. Maybe in the future they can be better prepared by setting up a flexible park and ride facility on the edge of the town at short notice for when a hot weekend is forecast. But for the council to declare a major incident which led to a load of police officers arriving on the beach to deal with a large family having an ice cream I felt was an overreaction. The response was like a nuclear war had been declared. I had relatives in Australia contact me to ask what was happening. David Morley, chairman of the Sandbanks Community Group, said the council should have done more to prepare for the influx after the last extremely busy day they had in May.  He called on the council to put more temporary seasonal resources into things like rubbish collection to prevent the recent scenes happening again. Mr Morley has sent a seven-point plan to the council chief executive outlining what he thinks needs to be put in place. He said: I think the council had their head in the sand, it was inevitable this was going to happen after the last one. They have had four weeks to prepare and they did not use that time well. They underestimated the scale of the task and we have a lot of questions.  What was interesting was once they declared the major incident within an hour the place was flooded with police who quickly got a grip of it - sorted the traffic and got rid of troublemakers. The attitude of all these people who had driven from Birmingham and London and parked illegally was apositaposs a £ fine, so what, thataposs fine for a dayaposs parking at the beach.apos From the moment the council realised itaposs going to be a very busy day - and you can tell in advance by the weather forecast - they have got to have a signicant police presence to control access and use their discretionary powers. They need to close the car park when itaposs full and keep it closed and they should have a tow away policy and aggressively remove any cars parked illegally. Itaposs got to be zero tolerance because as soon as one car parks on double yellow lines they all think they can do it. Yesterday Banks Road had cars parked on both sides of the road all the way down so emergency vehicles could not get through. We want to work with the council but itaposs dficult when they wonapost engage with us. The council said they did a good job yesterday but I think a lot of people at Sandbanks would disagree, it was like a war zone. The misery people went through for almost  hours was unbelievable, it was lawless.

Around  people gather in Sorrel Park, Birmingham, last night for the second loud party in a week. A furious resident said she repeatedly called West Midlands Police but was told just before pm that it could not be shut down.The woman said girls dumped glass outside her home and she caught them urinating, Birmingham Live reports.Erdington MP Jack Dromey spoke of his anger at households being disturbed again by the gathering - held in clear defiance of lockdown social distance rules. It happened as West Midlands Police Chief Constable Dave Thompson urged people not to attend such events following a rave near Lichfield, Staffordshire, earlier this month. CC Thompson tweeted: Really tough I know but it’s creating a risk of infection but more seriously large unlicensed events are dangerous. A number of examples across the country. Let’s not see that in our region.  A resident said on Thursday night: There are about  people there now. Egerton Road is blocked off by cars. I have just caught three girls urinating on my property and leaving behind broken glass. The road is blocked off with cars. If an ambulance needed to come out of the back entrance of the ambulance hub they would not be able to get through.  I have made several calls to the police -  and  to be told on my last call at :pm that they don’t have the man power to close it down now. I asked why they didn’t do anything before hand when there was only  people. It’s an utter disgrace. Mr Dromey said: Totally unacceptable that twice in a week hundreds of people have flocked to Sorrel Park in breach of social distancing regulations, disturbing residents and leaving a mountain of rubbish.

However itaposs unclear whether sheaposs actually met them. In her book Meghan and Harry: The Real Story, Lady C says a source spilled the beans on Harryaposs best mate Charlie Van Straubenzeeaposs wedding to Daisy Jenks.The Sussexes were photographed at the wedding, which fell on Meghanaposs birthday, and the Duchess was seen hugging, chatting and laughing with guests.Lady C claims the Duchess froze out all the other guests at celebration, and that she has cost Harry most of his friends. She writes: A girl went up to Meghan, introduced herself, and said how beautul she thought she was. She said she knew it was Meghanaposs birthday and wished her a happy birthday. Meghan looked at her asshe had committed a great faux pas by speaking to her and walked off. It was so cold. Another girl told Meghan how much she admired her, and how wonderful she thought she was that she and Harry were married and how well she thought she was doing. She told her she was rooting for them and wished them well. Meghanaposs response  She looked her up and down, turned away without saying a word her out for the rest of the wedding breakfast.Meghan wore a £ Club Monaco navy blue short-sleeved dress featuring a pleated colour block skirt and matching fascinator.The shoes were from Aquazzura, a popular brand for the Duchess who wore shoes from the same designer on the evening of her own wedding day.

If youaposre writing an impartial proper biography, you speak to everyone around them who really know them, you do not need, unless youaposre a minister of propaganda, to have input from the person. Phillip said after her salacious book about Princess Diana, he could not imagine that any of the royals would want to speak to Lady C anyway.

In the clip, Meghan and Harry can be seen chatting to guests and the Duchess can be heard admiring one womanaposs necklace.

The punch-up on the Tynemouth beach was caught on camera, and shows dozens of young people in a fracas as they flouted social distancing rules. The incident King Edwardaposs Bay, North Tynside, yesterday during the hottest day of the year. In the clip, circulating on social media, people can be seen fighting on the sand around what appears to be a volleyball net at the north east England beach. Some of the young men can be seen tearing off their shirts as they square up to each other.Click here for the latest coronavirus news and updates One is captured punching another man from behind, who drops and is briefly laid out on the sand as people crowd around him. They punch and push as more young men and women join the fray, shoving each other. Some try to hold the fighters back as smaller groups come to blows. Two men then spill out into the sand, as onlookers sitting in large groups watch the melee. Someone can be heard shouting “stop, stop” as the dust-up continues for the two minutes of filming and spills out into the crowds.  Northumbria Police said eight males were arrested after the force was called to reports of people excessively drinking, fighting and causing general disorder at beaches in the area yesterday. All but one remained in custody today. Those held included a -year-old boy arrest on suspicion of common assault, and four males arrested on suspicion of drunk and disorderly, aged , ,  and .A -year-old man was arrested on suspicion of affray and a -year-old man was arrested on suspicion of breach of the peace. A -year-old man was arrested on suspicion of fail to comply, and was cautioned.Northumbria Police and Crime Commissioner, Kim McGuinness said: “The majority of people seeing the scenes from Tynemouth yesterday have, like me, been left feeling angry and let down. A small, senseless minority have abused the easing of some restrictions, descended on our beaches in large groups and caused unwelcome trouble that spoils things for everyone . “Iaposm pleased the quick response from our officers broke up the disorder and I hope these arrests spell out loud and clear that firm action will be taken against those responsible.  North Tyneside’s Mayor, Norma Redfearn said: “I was extremely disappointed to hear about the behaviour of some at our coast yesterday. “This was a small minority, but they need to understand their actions cause real concern for our visitors and residents. Our staff are working harder than ever before to keep our award-winning coastline clean and tidy, and a safe place to visit. It simply isn’t acceptable.” Chronicle Live reports the crowds of thousands who flocked out to the areaaposs beaches in the C temperatures in the north east left piles of litter behind.Empty beer cans, broken glass and dirty nappies blighted the sands this morning. Crowds had to be dispersed in a bid in some areas to stop the litter being swept out to sea, and volunteers and council workers were out cleaning up the mess this morning. The disorder at Tynemouth came on the same day major incidents were declared at three spots including Bournemouth Beach. Massive crowds rammed seasides yesterday as the temperatures reached C in some parts of the UK, leaving authorities furious.

The -year-old spruced up the newly-installed faux-turf using a £ cordless Dyson vacuum cleaner. Sue said: “Grass hoovered. Now to turn this garden into something exciting for the kids.” Sue and her husband Noel, , from Morecambe, Lancashire, had been teasing fans about their big project for a few days - before making the grand reveal. In their vlog, the bar is seen fully stocked with beer, spirits and even bar snacks - and of course some non-alcoholic drinks for their huge brood of children. The parents documented their garden transformation in March, as Noel said: “We’ve got a bit of a project on the go. “We’re changing this from real grass to fake grass just to make it a lot cleaner for the kids.”  Sue had her first baby, Chris, when she was just . She gave birth to her latest addition Heidie at the beginning of April. Last week, pregnant daughter Millie revealed more details of her pregnancy - as well as showing off an adorable nursery ready for baby Ophelia. In the clip she said the Baby girlaposs nursery coming along nicely.  She showed the room ready with a white cot with a pink blanket draped over the side - as well as silver ornamental letters spelling out Opheliaaposs name.

Senior scientists advising ministers are convinced new infections are “flat, maybe up a bit” in recent weeks and are calling on Brits not to assume “it’s party time”. They remain at around , new confirmed cases a day as newly released Sage papers suggest ministers may agree this is an “acceptable incidence” level. Scientists on the Independent Sage group announced that staying at current levels would lead to an extra , deaths. It comes as the Government is about to initiate a major further lting of lockdown measures reopening pubs and allowing larger groups to meet up. A senior Government scientic adviser said: “This is not party time, this is time to go very carefully with these new release of measures.” He added: “Determining acceptable incidence is a matter for Government.” The Office for National Statisticssurveillance study estimated on Thursday that new infections were steady at more than , a day in the last fortnight for which data is available. They had been falling since April. However this was contradicted by separate figures published by the Government that cases were still falling at between % and % a day. The uncertainty came on a day images were taken around the country of packed beaches and violent street gatherings. The Government adviser said: “It’s quite possible this is a true flattening and it might be down to increased contacts.” Looking at the number of confirmed cases following a positive test, there are around , new cases a day.  More papers were released by the Scientic Advisory Group for Emergencieson Friday including a draft note dated May . It recommended: “Decreasing daily incidence of symptomatic cases in all regions across the UK until the target acceptable incidence is reached, then incidence kept below that target. “This target is yet to be specied and needs to be spelt out. We suggest , new symptomatic swab +ve cases per day in the UK.” It then added that this acceptable level would be “policy decision”. It comes after latest daily deaths of people after testing positive were at  on Thursday. This took the official UK death toll to ,.  The Independent Sage group of scientists yesterday told an online media briefing yesterday Britain was lting lockdown too soon and could follow the US in triggering a huge new spike. Prof Christina Pagel, of University College London, said: “New daily infections have stopped their downward trend and have been level for the last few weeks. “I think Chris Whitty said recently that he was expecting this kind of level to carry on for about another nine months in to next year. “If we carry on with  to  deaths a day that’s over , deaths. “I think we really, really need to keep that downward trend.” It also estimated that NHS Test and Trace is only reaching a third of symptomatic Covid- cases and obtaining details of contacts.

In his role of heir to the throne, the Queenaposs oldest son is entitled to the surplus generated by the Duchyaposs vast portfolio of land, buildings and financial investments.  Charles uses his Duchy income to pay for his official duties, his London office and charitable work.He also funds the public duties of Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and some of William and Kateaposs private costs.He will have done the same for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex from his - income. However the coronavirus pandemic means his income next year could take a serious hit, which could be bad news for the Sussexes, who quit the royal family at the end of the financial year. At the time, it was confirmed Charles would continue to make private financial contributions to Sussexes as they began their new le in the US. But it is not known whether this is coming from Charlesapos Duchy money or his other private sources such as any inheritance or private investment. In the - financial year, Charles annual private income from the hereditary estate rose by £, - .% - from £,, in - to £,,. However itaposs likely that next year will see a huge drop in profits due to the coronavirus pandemic, the secretary and keeper Alastair Martin has warned. He said: The lockdown resulting from Covid- was only in place for one week of the financial year that this report covers. There is therefore very limited financial impact on these results. As to -, it is too early in the new financial year to be able to say with any confidence what the impact on our financial performance will be, but, despite having a particularly well-ersied asset base, we fully expect the revenue surplus to be down by a signicant amount, in large part due to our trading enterprises being closed. He added: We have not availed ourselves of the ious government pandemic support schemes but have continued to pay all staff.  Republic, which campaigns for an elected head of state, called for the Government to take control of the estate and stop the prince keeping the surplus.Graham Smith, chief executive of the pressure group, said: There is simply no justication for this ludicrous amount of money to be thrown at Charles when public services are stretched and local communities are impacted by the coronavirus.Itaposs time the Duchy was rolled back into the Crown Estate and its income served the British people, not one prince. He added: We do not owe Charles a living. This nonsense has to stop. The total worth of the Duchyaposs assets - amounting to more than £ billion - has dropped by nearly £ million. It fell from £,,, to £,,,, but much of the decrease is linked to valuation of the Duchyaposs investment property at the end of March amid the Covid- outbreak. The report said valuation experts were taking into account the uncertain property market and had cited that less certainty, and a higher degree of caution, should be attached to the valuations. The Duchy said that the volatility and uncertainty posed no short or long term financial threat to the asset values of its properties. The private landed estate was created in  by Edward III to support his son and heir Prince Edward, known as the Black Prince, and all his subsequent heirs. It extends across  counties in England and Wales and includes the Oval cricket ground and , acres of Dartmoor. Mr Martin said the coronavirus crisis had caused signicant personal and financial disruption for many Duchy tenants, particularly in the Isles of Scilly and Cornwall, where the economy is reliant on tourism and hospitality. He highlighted the uncertain future and pledged to work with the tenants to help them in the wake of the pandemic.  It is unclear how the coming year will unfold. During this dficult and anxious time for the Duchy family, we will continue to maintain close links with all our tenants and work with them to re-establish, where possible, their livelihoods, he said. Rent deferrals have been agreed with many tenants, he added. The report also highlighted legislative hiatus over the UKaposs departure from the EU as having an impact. Uncertainty arising from this hiatus makes planning and investment decisions more complex. This is an area of deep concern for our agricultural tenants in particular, it said.

Unfortunately, a thoughtless minority let the sun go to their heads. Bournemouth had to declare a major incident after being overwhelmed by visitors.Other resorts saw staff abused and their beaches strewn with litter and detritus. Photographs showed there were frequent breaches of the two-metre rule. There are now fears the behaviour of a selfish few could cause a second Covid wave.

Having promised a zero tolerance approach to anti-Semitism he was as good as his word with his sacking of Rebecca Long-Bailey. Allies of the former Shadow Education Secretary feel she has been hard done by and the move could reignite isions in Labour. But the party leader should be applauded for taking a firm stand on an issue that has become a stain on his party’s reputation.

Philip Mantle has been left baffled and excited by the sighting in Poland. Jason Gleave, a photo expert, has scrutinised the snaps and says they are genuine.The spinning-top-shaped UFO was spotted by a man riding his bike in a remote area near the village of Jastrowo, roughly  miles from Warsaw.It made a strange rustling sound as it rubbed against the top of a tree before it disappeared. The freaked-out witness took pictures of the scene before rushing home where, to his amazement, he had captured the UFO on five frames. He sent the snaps to Polish ufologist and journalist Robert Bernatowicz, but is keeping his name secret. The man fears he may have suffered aposmissing timeapos - when UFO witnesses report a gap in their memory which sometimes, under hypnosis, turns out to be an alien abduction experience. Mr Bernatowicz said: He is afraid to give his real name and surname. “Why  In Poland talking about UFOs means that people will take you as a person with mental problems.  The witness reports that he saw a UFO then took the photographs and then has a break in his memory of what happened next. Bernatowicz has now turned to Mr Mantle, formerly Director of Investigations for the British UFO Research Association, who has probed hundreds of cases since his interest began in . Mr Mantle of Pontefract, West Yorks, said: I have worked on a number of alleged UFO photo-cases down the years with most of them turning out to either be something convention or a hoax. He sent the pictures to former RAF man Mr Gleave who now specialises in UFO photo analysis. And Mr Gleave believes the pictures have not been photoshopped or tampered with and the UFO is a genuine object hovering around ft off the ground.  Mr Gleave, who has also worked for British Aerospace Airbus ision, said: I was amazed at such a high quality they were. “I overlaid the five separate images to confirm the movement of the object. It appeared to move in a small radius of approximately  feet, staying within approximately - feet altitude from ground level. Also very noticeable and helpful regarding the analysis process was the mass of foliage etc, this was very productive to ascertain perspective relative to the object and its surroundings and tree line positions. The unknown camera operator appeared to have taken the photographs from five slightly dferent positions in each of the images but all within an approximate few feet distance from each other as recognisable foliage and tree branches are seen in each. Other important factors come into play regarding the images, locationSun positioning, time of daynot only trees etc but the object itself, without this information makes it more dficult to give a more accurate conclusion.  The object itself appears to have structure and be metallic in appearance, exhibiting a larger main circular base body tapering upwards to a pointed apexbelow the larger circular base a smaller domed protrusion is seen. “Also the shadow of the object on the ground is not detected, which makes me assume the Sun is behind the camera operator thus positioning the shadow off towards the distant foliage . I have also embossed one of the images showing an enlarged and enhanced view of the object which is exhibiting no device or cabling system to suspend the object.

Now we have modern facilities, I think it is somewhere players want to be.”Having Cormack Park has undoubtedly helped with the transition back from the coronavirus shutdown.Aberdeen have been back at socially-distanced training for nearly two weeks now.The club secured a Covid- testing machine, which they have on site to produce regular and rapid testing.There are also daily temperature checks. Players do not have access to the building at Cormack Park yet.McInnes admits it is an alien and strange environment for players, but has praised them for the way they have rapidly adapted.He said: “The players have been fantastic and as a club everything has gone really smoothly.“The players have had to adapt, but they have done it well. The staff planned it well, the medical staff have ensured everyone canproperly.“It’s strange that you don’t have the contact with them.“They arrive in their cars, wait until they get tested and then wander out inidually.“We have been working in two groups at the minute, last week it was three groups, so you are doing the same sessions.“It’s quite taxing, but it’s enjoyable to be back.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

Action is needed and the bullies must be confronted. That they were allowed to behave in this way for so long is the real shocker.Their own managers have questions to answer. Why was this not nipped in the bud  Is there an ongoing lack of management training and support Whatever the reasons, it has to stop now.Minard folk were surprised to find themselves in the papers, on television and on the radio this week.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited. The charity has created a free pack full of tips, ideas and videos to help people host their own virtual picnic.You can hold your picnic in your garden, on your balcony or on the living room floor.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this.

But the COVID- lockdown interrupted proceedings.This season’s Scottish Cup was a bit of a disappointment with Star exiting the competition in the second round after losing out to a vastly improved Dumbarton United side -. On the plus side, the first round saw Star take on Paisley League team Pollok FC and an excellent performance saw Star run out convincing winners -, one of only four defeats suffered by Pollok in all competitions.In the West Region Cup, Star progressed to the quarter-final again. A first round bye, a convincing - win against Cambuslang FA then a walkover saw the Lochgilphead youths face Paisley League A Division team Erskine.In a hard-fought encounter, Star matched Erskine for most of the game but with only  players available they couldn’t get the breakthrough they needed and eventually lost -.Star started their league campaign in September with a competitive match against new team Thorn, who transferred from Paisley A Division. Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for

Theyrsquore because of public reaction and public perception of Tourettersquos.ldquoThe fact that Irsquom ticking doesnrsquot make me depressed and it doesnrsquot make me anxious.\"Itrsquos how other people react. Itrsquos only such a huge part of my le because of other people.ldquoItrsquos instinctive for people to turn around and look, but it doesnrsquot take away from the fact that it makes me feel uncomfortable and embarrassed over something that I cannot control.It was not only the tics that made Jack stand out from the crowd during childhood.As a gay teenager, he says he struggled to make any male friends because of his sexuality, which he has never hidden.And the struggles, although manesting in dferent forms, have continued into young adult le.As a result of years of relentless twitching and involuntary leg movements, Jack is battling chronic muscle pain and nausea.Cognitive behaviour therapy reiki reflexology ndash Jack has tried everything to relieve the pain but to little avail.He is prescribed strong painkillers, and at times has had to keep his neck in a brace because of his tics.,params: .pushWhen attempting to enter bars or nightclubs, bouncers sometimes reject him because they believe he is under the influence of illegal drugs.Alcohol consumption can trigger his tics, making them more prominent and frequent.Even in university lectures, he sometimes must call out people for continually turning around and staring at him, despite knowing his condition.Jack insists that suffering from Tourette syndrome has given him a ldquothick skin\".He has always felt fully supported by his parents but has chosen to be independent from a young age, refusing to let his condition prevent him from doing the things he wants to achieve.Attending doctors appointments on his own from the age of , Jack preferred to handle everything by himself.In his third year at Peebles High School, Jack ran a public campaign and was successfully elected as a Member of the Scottish Youth Parliamentfor the region.He said: ldquoI ran because Irsquove always been interested in social issues and wanted to meet like-minded people, which I sometimes felt starved of growing up.ldquoI think I would be a really confident, extroverted guy without my tics ndash they are the one thing holding me back.Since his darkest days battling anxiety and depression, Jack has made friends andhad part-time jobs in bars in Peebles and Edinburgh.Mental health struggles may have stolen parts of Jacks childhood ndash and he continues to live in the spotlight of Tourettersquos ndash but it hasnrsquot stopped him embracing student le."},{"url":null,"title":"bournemouth-major-incident-thousands-pack-beaches-south-coast","story":"A MAJORincident has been declared after thousands of people flocked to the beach in southern England.The sun-seekers - defying official advice -descended onBournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council beaches on the hottest day of the year so far.A multi-agency emergency response has now been activated to co-ordinate resources across the area.Council leader Vikki Slade said: ldquoWe are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches, particularly at Bournemouth and Sandbanks, in the last - hours.\"The irresponsible behaviour and actions of so many people is just shocking and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe.\"We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.Services were left completely overstretched as visitors arrived in large volumes resulting in widespread problems of illegal parking, excessive waste, anti-social behaviour, gridlock on roads and prohibited overnight camping.BCP Council issued  parking enforcement fines ndash the highest on record ndash and responded to many reports of cars parking and causing an obstruction.Roads in and out of the area were heavily congested into the early hours.Crews received widespread abuse and intimidation as they attempted to empty overflowing bins on the seafront.

It can also cause confusion and cloud judgement.

Not today. The mask might have lain there for weeks, but it felt better to leave it for someone with rubber gloves to deal with. In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off. Learning to do that now will require mentally airbrushing out the red flags in the scene before us, be it perspex screens, the distance between tables, or a proleration of nosebags. Itrsquos not impossible, but it will be quite a feat.To get into training, Irsquove written this column while wearing a paper mask. Itrsquos not a flattering sight. With every breath the screen has come in and out of focus as my glasses fog up. That is not good either. On the bright side, however, the contact lens industry looks set to take off.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

The First Minister insists she is putting safety first.Scotland will not be following the ldquoreckless relaxation of lockdown pursued by heartless English Tories, who are only interested in the bottom line. Such at least is the political message the Scottish government hopes to convey.In reality, itrsquos not entirely clear what is happening in Scotland about social distancing. Jason Leitch, the National Clinical Director, told BBC Radio yesterday that he expected the two metre rule to be relaxed very soon.:Scotlands two-metre social distancing rule will change, according to Jason LeitchAnd John Swinney later announced that he is aiming for schools to go back to full time teaching on th August, which also suggests lockdown is not long for this world. The Labour MSP Iain Gray called this the ldquomother and father of ministerial climb-downs.Only last week Mr Swinney had been talking about a year of ldquoblended learning and no exams. This was under his assumption that the two metre rule would be still be adhered to over the summer and into the next school year.His u-turn may also be a broad wink to the hospitality industry that Scotland will be following England in the not too distant future. They should plan for a one metre rule and not give up the ghost.Letrsquos hope they get the message, because only % of pubs and % of restaurants say they can survive with two metre social distancing, according to the Scottish Tourism Alliance.Ms Sturgeon says she is no longer bothered about the R number ndash the infection rate that she said last month was her guiding policy. The number of infections is now so small that R is largely meaningless.So,the disease is disappearing fast, and the infection rate is irrelevant, why is Scotland sticking with the two-metre rule at all  Are we following the science or not Nicola Sturgeon suggested yesterday that the scientic advice from SAGE may not entirely concur with Boris Johnsonrsquos decision yesterday to liberate the nation from its Covid ldquohibernation.The former government Chief Scientic Adviser, Sir David King, chair of the ldquoindependent SAGE group, is pretty sure that the official SAGE scientists are not on side. He says it is ldquofar too soon to ease the two-metre rule and that this will increase infections and lead to more deaths.However, the science isnrsquot exactly rock solid on two metres. The World Health Organisation, which government critics often claim is a better advice-giver than SAGE, suggests a one metre rule is safe. WHO says that the risk of catching the disease falls by % over that distance.China, Denmark and more importantly our nearest neighbour France are also in the one metre camp.There is evidence that risk falls by at least a further %you are standing two metres distant. But the risk of transmission depends on many factors: distance is only a part of it. Wearing masks, for example, almost certainly makes one metre equivalent to two. Outdoors, there seems little dference between one and two metres, and even indoors itrsquos no guarantee of immunity.A study cited by the BBC from the Chinese city of Guangzhou, looked at a cluster of infections in a restaurant which was using the one metre rule. Half of the people who came down with the disease were discovered to have been sitting more than two metres away from the primary source of the infection.:Sturgeon prepares to accelerate Scotlands exit from lockdown - but two-metre rule stays for nowAir flow and ventilation seem to be a big factor. Bad ventilation can super spread this virus. On the other hand, sophisticated air conditioning, such as on aircraft with HEPA filters, might actually suppress Covid , especiallypassengers are wearing masks.Theof time you are in contact with a person with Covid- also seems to be a major factor. Just donrsquot hang around, is the message. Indeed, wersquore told thatyou want to hold a conversation with someone you should really stand back to back. Which would be most interesting at a conference or reception ndash assuming we ever have them again.Professor Linda Bauld, of Public Health at Edinburgh University says politicians should ldquonot to get too hung up about distance. There is just too much going on to make this into an inviolable rule ndash like the R number which politicians obsessed about until recently.This at any rate is the view of the UK government. Boris Johnson believes that the costs of relaxing the two-metre rule are far outweighed by the likely costs of not relaxing it. This isnrsquot just a financial calculus ndash putting profits before health.Not allowing the schools toto anything resembling normality is likely to have a signicant impact on the long term health and wellbeing of young people. Similarly, not opening bars, restaurants and leisure activities means depriving many more young people of jobs and security ndash major factors in mental health.It is simply not possible to conduct anything resembling normal le with a two metre rule.

Flagging up the statement Nicola Sturgeon made yesterday, the PM gazed into his crystal ball and predicted it would be ldquouncannily similar to the one that Irsquove just given.He was right, to some extent. The beer gardens of Scotland shall, like those in England, open. Hairdressers will snip, friends and family will meet indoors, cinemas will screen films. While the FM did not go as far as Mr Johnson in lting the two metre rule, that looks likely to follow next week. Between this and the U-turn on schools, the pace of change is positively dizzying. It is like going on an extended ride on the waltzers.:PM takes a swipe at Sturgeon for uncannily similar briefingsEngland, under Mr Johnsonrsquos plan, will go further and faster. If anyone doubts how nakedly populist the PM is being, just take a look at the date for the easing of lockdown to begin ndash July , Independence Day in the US. When it comes to Scotland, independence remains a four letter word. Otherwise, Downing Street is delighted to celebrate the concept.But here we are, getting ahead of ourselves. As the Prime Minister made clear, the virus is still out there, andit becomes clear that there is a surge in new cases lockdown restrictions could be reimposed.Really, Mr Johnson, who do you think you are kidding  Now that people are only too aware of how miserable le in lockdown can be, it would take a brave and uniquely gted premier to persuade the public back into that jail cell, and we know Mr Johnson is neither.He is acting quickly because of the economic catastrophe we, and the rest of the world, are facing. And to please his own backbenchers and party backers, of course. One might have a sneaking admiration for himhe came straight out and admitted to the latter, instead of trying to convince us that he is acting according to a well-thought out plan. If the strategy was that oven-ready, businesses in England would not have been hammering on Downing Streetrsquos door on Tuesday seeking clarication.As the PM spoke at what was to be the last daily briefing, Chris Whitty, Englandrsquos chief medical officer, and Sir Patrick Vallance, chief scientic adviser, displayed obvious caution. When it came to the relaxation of the two metre rule they did not so much socially distance themselves from Mr Johnson as figuratively pick up their podiums and move to a neighbouring county. Professor Whittyrsquos assessment was frank. ldquoIf people donrsquot take the mitigation seriously,people hear a distorted version of whatrsquos being said that says lsquoThis is all fine, itrsquos gone away,rsquo yes we will get an uptick ndash for sure.He is not the only one concerned. A letter to the British Medical Journal, signed by the leaders of all the major medical and nursing bodies, warned that ldquothe available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. We know the truth of that already from the experiences of Germany and South Korea, two countries massively more successful than the UK in dealing with the pandemic.The letter urged the UK Government to look at how well prepared the country is for a second wave. That warning must be heeded. Much has been made by Governments across the UK of how they have been dealing with unprecedented and fast-moving events that they could not have seen coming.That was always debatable . As the virus spread from China to mainland Europe it was plain what was needed and what worked. Yet the lockdown came too slowly and the testing strategy was abandoned too quickly. Being unprepared for a second wave will be inexcusable, and that goes for Edinburgh as much as London, Belfast and Cardf.It is fear of a second wave that has been cited as the reason for Nicola Sturgeonrsquos more hesitant approach to easing the lockdown. The FM has indeed played cautious cop to Mr Johnsonrsquos all-over-the-shop cop, the Juliet Bravo to his Jack Regan of The Sweeney.Both have made mistakes. There has been too much hiding behind the skirts of science instead of taking the lead. Too many pronouncements made from podiums instead of finding out what it has really been like living in lockdown.:Guy Stenhouse:  Comparing Boris Johnson and Nicola Sturgeon is an interesting exerciseThat is why there was such anger over the travels of Catherine Calderwood and Dominic Cummings. It is also why the policy of blended learning was never going to survive contact with reality.From the start of this crisis people have wanted to be treated like grown ups. Edinburgh and London are finally catching up with that. There needs to be more straight talking about the risks and dangers that lie ahead. Key to charting a way through them, and getting ahead of a second wave, is a fully ing system to test, track and isolate. Let us not take our eye off that prize.Mr Johnson has more need for candour than the First Minister. Of the two, she has been the more forthright and credible. As such, only the wilder elements in her party would even think of calling for her to gothere is a second wave that could have been prevented.You can bet your last mask, however, that should the worst happen in England the Conservatives will dump Mr Johnson. They have never really warmed to him and they certainly do not trust him. He was sufficiently appealing to a large enough swathe of the electorate in England to win a General Election and save their seats, and that was what mattered to them.Then the virus arrived and showed that they had been right all along about his weaknesses. He was lazy, ill-prepared, and indecisive. A follower when a leader was needed.If there is one thing on which all sides can agree is that in time there must be an inquiry into the handling of this crisis. How much easier for Mr Johnsonrsquos partythey could blame their mistakes on someone who had departed for the backbenches.

If you were looking for an archetypal hard-bitten tabloid hack who embodied the highs and lows of the trade, then Iain Calder was your man.The former Daily Record reporter was something of a star in Scandalous! The Tabloid that Changed America, a look at the rise and plummet of the National Enquirer. Cynical, sharp, bursting with stories ndash had you requested him from central casting you would have sent him back for being too much of a cliche.But that was the Enquirer, according to this superb Storyville documentary: always too much for its own good.Mark Landsmanrsquos -minute film swung between two attitudes to the paper and what it had brought to journalism.The first, typied by Carl Bernstein, was censorious. The Enquirer should be looked at in the realm of popular culture rather than journalism, snfed the Watergate warrior by way of an introduction.But then the story of its origins and early operations began and the film was off to the races, half awed by the tale and more than a little amused.Bought in the s with mob money , the title was owned outright by Generoso Pope Junior, the son of an Italian newspaperman. Legend has it that ldquoGene was driving along a highway when he saw people rubbernecking an accident. The Enquirer had found the first of its specialisms: gore porn. Circulation went up to one million but Pope wanted  million. To do that the paper had to go where readers went, into the supermarkets. Out went the gore and in came celebrity news, gossip, dogs, medical oddities, psychics, UFOs and general wackadoodle doo. Stories were to be ldquoexploded, sensationalised, and for that Pope needed the best, some might say worst, in the business: Fleet and McFleet Streetrsquos finest.Calder led the exodus. By age  he had worked on the Falkirk Sentinel, the Stirling Journal, Falkirk Mail, and the Daily Record . Unable to find the skills and attitude he wanted among the American media, Calder recruited from home. It was a second colonisation of America, and the locals reacted about as well as they did the last time the Brits came.The main change ushered in by the Enquirer was that it paid for information. From this, the film argued, the rot set in. Irsquom not sure American journalism was always that holier than thou hitherto, but the Enquirer certainly encouraged others to follow its methods and madness. Why  Because it was phenomenally successful. The edition with a photo of Elvis in his coffin sold seven million.Some scandals were filed away, as when a female reporter found out about Bill Cosbyrsquos many infidelities. Calder spiked the story to get softer interviews from the star. ldquoI was making trades that would make our readers happier, said Calder today.For a time, where the Enquirer led the mainstream media followed, particularly on OJ Simpson.But when it got it wrong it got it dreadfully wrong, as when the paper ran a picture of Dianathe day before the Princess died in Paris. From there it was a quick slide into further infamy. And then The Donald showed up. The paper, under new ownership, began to ldquocatch and kill stories, a lot of them unfavourable to candidate Trump as he became. The cover up, says Bernstein, was the ldquoultimate corruption.Terric use of archive, a dream cast of talking heads, and a solid, clear narrative made Scandalous this weekrsquos must see documentary.The Enquirer would not touch The Great British Sewing Bee with a metre stick. The reality show, which reached its final last night, has been far too nice to attract tabloid attention. Why, these contestants even helped each other outthere was a problem.While it was short on anything approaching real drama, the GBSB had enough going for it in genial host Joe Lycett, a worthy winner in s enthusiast Dr Clare, and judges, Esme Young and Patrick Grant, who knew their stuff. I particularly enjoyed Young reminiscing about sitting on a window ledge with Bowie watching the Notting Hill carnival go by.

Current evidence supports the two-metre guidance in many locations, occupations and industries because of airborne as well as large droplet transmission. Past research underestimates viral airborne risks. Evidence from clusters supports more caution. The R rate is still not low enough across the UK for change but it is as low as it is partly because of the two-metre distancing.There is also still limited evidence to support a reduction below two metres and the latest WHO-funded study on one and two metres is not conclusive and has been attacked as inadequate. Yet even that acknowledges two metres is more protective than one.Current evidence supports the general importance of the combined use of social distancing, use of masks and other PPE and handwashing, not removing or reducing parts of this strategy. There must also be continued employment, wage protection and suspension of punitive sickness absence and performance management system, to encourage safe practices including self-isolation.We have not yet seen the review that the Prime Minister apparently used to make his decision. This is not transparent and informed decision-making.

Ma Stewart, being of a certain age, had to stay at home and avoid the grocery store so Ive been doing her shopping every week since the lockdown. In the run up to Easter, little extras appeared on the shopping list, such as yellow food colouring or baking powder.Id almost entire forgotten I was due a birthday until, about three weeks before, icing sugar was suddenly requested. Each ingredient meant for a celebration cake, buried in the list weeks in advance.Back in March, as it became clear that something momentous was afoot, items began disappearing from supermarket shelves. Among the many things seared in the national memory from this extraordinary time will be the Great Loo Roll Rush of .Tinned items soon followed. Beans, soup, canned tuna - good luck to you. Soap, hand sanitiser, bleach. Practical items for people planning to be stuck at home with mouths to feed and germs to kill.If the whole toilet paper panic was inexplicable, what came next was logical but still a bit of a surprise. Where was all the flour The supermarkets had none, and when they did get some in stock there was a frantic rush on it. People were sharing tips in community Facebook pages about where had a supply in stock and offering to trade it, like a finely milled currency.Ditto yeast. Photographs of sachets of yeast appeared on these social media pages too, offers to post it out at inflated prices or do contactless handovers in odd places in exchange for a bag of self-raising.Twitter became one long thread of sourdough starter discussions. How to get them going, how to keep them going, how to move on when the frothing stopped and the starter ended.There were people giving names to their starters , posting photos of them on social media, even creating Instragram accounts solely for their off-white pots of yeast.Even simple homebaking has an air of performance in the age of social media but then, people are bored at home and a few tweets is as decent a use of time as anything .As bulk buyers left the baking aisle bare, millers were working around the clock, genuinely milling flour  hours a day, seven days a week, to keep up with demand. Usually, two million bags of flour are produced every week but during lockdown this doubled to four million.Interestingly, it wasnt the lack of flour that was the problem: it was the lack of packaging. There werent enough small bags to keep up with demand and not enough capacity to pack them.In my local supermarket things came to such a pass that, not only were the flour shelves bare, the shop eventually removed the shelves too so there was an empty cavity where they had previously been.Perhaps this was to quash quickly any rising anticipation that maybe some flour existed tucked away at the back.As the baking trend continued to rise, supermarkets innovated. Some sold kg bags of flour and, incredibly, people bought them. Other stores decanted the kg sacks into smaller brown paper bags and let shoppers have them for p or so.Of course, local corner stores had flour all along, as well as all the other staples wed been scrambling to grab in the big stores. A friend would come to my local shop for his flour and leave with several bags of self-raising only after standing through a lecture in Middle Eastern politics from the chatty shopkeeper.Lockdown has meant an increase in time and an increase in time has meant the ability to use local shops, a trend we should hope continues.But the baking thing. What was it about  Time, again. Our lives are built now around work. Where my grandmothers generation of women would routinely be at home with the children, and where baking was an everyday staple, our economic model now depends on both parents working and those kitchen skills have slid away.Baking bread or cakes, once a chore to work through, has become a romanticised task - all about self-care and mindfulness, as much as the basic need for sustenance. Keeping a sourdough starter alive takes work and commitment, regular feeding. AndInstragram is to be believed, regular conversations with your frothing paste.A sourdough loaf must be done in strict, timed stages, giving shape to the day. Eventhats all you do from morning til night, those otherwise wayward hours are structured.Baking bread takes mental and physical focus, kneading, folding, a patient wait for rise. Folding again. The smell of baking bread as the chemistry of heat does its thing, an edible science experiment. You are in control of transforming a selection of basic ingredients into something wonderful, something solid when all  is shting and unpredictable.I have always enjoyed baking. It is a small act of love to create something delicious for someone  and, while I do resist the notion of self-care, being a grizzled old cynic, its satisfying to bake yourself a treat.This has been quite a boon of lockdown easing - friends keep showing up with home baking. Early on there were brownies left on my doorstep. Ma Stewart has made me beautul cakes with her carefully squirrelled away ingredients. My friend Dan dropped me off a picnic for my birthday with two fresh baguettes hed made, another lockdown baking convert.Another birthday gt was an extraordinary ice cream cake, three flavours wrapped in a giant chocolate chip brownie casing. Ive been gted several fresh loaves from neighbours who overestimated what they needed.To bake and be baked for are both basic and exalted things at once.

Every single one of our  local authorities has had cases of trafficking or exploitation. In , there were over  cases of people being trafficked or exploited in Scotland. That number looks set to rise this year. And without question there are many more cases that have gone unreported.Modern slavery takes many forms. Its victims are both men and women, adult and child. There are cases of both sexual and labour exploitation. Its victims can be born-and-bred in Scotland, have moved here years ago, or only just arrived. Modern slavery takes place in our cities, towns, villages and countryside. Often, it takes place in plain sight.All over Scotland, there are women trafficked into sexual exploitation, forced into prostitution by traffickers. They work in appalling conditions, at great risk, terrorised and traumatised by their traffickers and the men who pay for sex. Other victims have been found working for illegally low wages ndashthey are paid at all ndash in nail bars, car washes, construction sites, and where.:Behind closed doors, gangrsquos family traded in victimsrsquo miseryThey have their wages withheld, and their lack of English and support networks is exploited. Other victims are locked into dangerous environments to cultivate cannabis plants, used by their exploiters to transport drugs around the country, or forced to beg on our streets.It gets worse. Despite causing dficulties for us all, the coronavirus lockdown is a gt to traffickers. Many victims are being forced by their traffickers to take greater risks than ever. They may be forced to work in conditions without social distancing, or prevented from accessing healthcare, or be compelled to take risks with their health to earn money for their traffickers.And the lockdown has made it harder for us to find those people who need our help: their traffickers have moved them off the streets, and public services are stretched as we deal with the coronavirus crisis.Furthermore, councils are increasingly concerned that the economic impact of the crisis will make even more people vulnerable to exploitation. Thousands of people in Scotland have lost their job, or seen their incomes disappear.Traffickers will be moving in, to prey on the most vulnerable: forcing them to work in unsafe conditions or for illegal wages, or by tricking people into a debt they have to work to pay off, but never can. Furthermore, many migrants in Scotland have lost their job in the crisis. Even those who are entitled to benefits may not know their rights, or how to negotiate our systems of public support, and they may not have developed personal support networks of their own. The risk of exploitation is great.More must be done to protect victims, and potential victims, from modern slavery ndash and we all have a role to play. Scotlandrsquos councils are doing all we can to combat this brutal exploitation taking place in our communities.Guidance developed by Cosla for local authorities was launched by spokesperson Councillor Kelly Parry in , to enable staff to spot the signs that someone has been trafficked and provide them with the critical support they need. We work closely with the police, NHS and other bodies to disrupt traffickers and help victims.:Neil Mackay: Amid covid and racism hellipwe want to build a better world, letrsquos start with police interrogating Prince AndrewCouncils are embedded in our communities, so we are working locally to spot the signs of modern slavery. Tackling this horrendous crime means working in partnership with a range of stakeholders. Councils, schools, the police, border force, charities and community groups all have a critical role to play.And so too do members of the public. Anyone who sees anything that appears to be an emergency should dial . If it is not an emergency, but a cause for concern, dial . If unsure, it is always right to call  rather than not reporting at all. Human trafficking is a hidden crime, which means that the outside signs can be hard to spot. Businesses need to check their supply chains and report suspicious activity. The more information the authorities have, the better the response.There is currently a national debate about the role of slavery in Scotlandrsquos past. We must also remember that modern slavery is part of Scotlandrsquos present.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Elaine Tulloch, chief executive of Destination Orkney Ltd, said: “We were delighted with the response our recent call to action received from our -strong membership. The four new directors, who have now been co-opted onto our board, bring a range of valuable skills and experience to the table and we very much look forward to working with them during these critical months ahead. “Having a strong board presence, which is fully representative of the trade, is essential as we develop recovery plans with local partners, agencies and regional and national governments.”Orkney’s tourism industry, worth over £ million a year to the islands’ economy, has been hard hit by the COVID- crisis.During the pandemic, Destination Orkney Ltd has been keeping its members up to date with information on COVID- support and available funding streams, offering guidance, and lobbying locally and nationally, while sharing updates from the Scottish Tourism Alliance, Scottish Government, VisitScotland and other national bodies.In order to develop COVID- Orkney recovery plans with partners, Destination Orkney Ltd has also established an industry recovery group to discuss matters such as reopening, communication and marketing, as well as identying future resource and investment needs and opportunities. copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Caravans and self-contained accommodation which does not share services to be permitted, with caution to respect rural communities and the islands.July  — Outdoor restaurant and dining services and beer gardens to open.July  — Extension likely to be made to socialising with other households.

The Deputy First Minister said that, when the part-time #blended# plan for schooling had been developed, he and his colleagues could not have anticipated such an improvement in infection levels. The #blended# model will remain a contingency plan, should infection rates dramatically increase or progress against the virus slow.#I must stress that this is the aim the government is working towards, but it remains conditional on scientic and health advice,# Mr Swinney explained.#If we continue to make progress on the route we envisage, we may have successfully achieved — or be well on the way to achieving — Phase Four.#It is this more positive outlook that means the Scottish Government can make this updated planning assumption for schools.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

Lets hope I am proved wrong for the greater good of everybody  The way that poll is set up will skew the result in favour of the wind farm.WIth respect, a #gas-fired power station# on its own is not a possible option since a substantial amount of renewable energy is already installed and it won#t be going away, any time soon. Renewable energy, of course, must have a grid link and a fully-specied standbyplant to cover cable failures. Having two options involving a gas-fired power station obviously splits the vote for that option.Firstly:I am really confused about what this poll is supposed to achieve at this stage in the process and why,it#s important, the Shetland Times didn#t hold it  years ago.It seems that the Shetland public have already voted to reject the Shetland Times# wording of this question so I think it#s time to withdraw the poll and re-launch a new one.Might I suggest that the ST editors consult John Tulloch and an equally well qualied renewables engineer over the wording of the new question so that the public can vote on TWO clear options that are technically feasible, otherwise, it is a wasted exercise.

Swinney said the full-timewould be “conditional on infection rates being sufficiently low to continue to control the virus, public health and testing systems being in place and protective measures and risk assessments being carried out in schools”.For weeks teachers and other education staff have been preparing plans and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for re-opening in August.They had done so in the expectation that school capacity would be limited, with two metre social distancing rules remaining in place.Many parents has expressed concerns about the impact of the continued lack of classroom time would have on their children.In Skye parents were told last week that due to the guidelines and school transport constraints many Portree High pupils would only be able to attend for one day a week.Councillor John Finlayson, Chair of the Highland Council’s Education Committee welcomed Mr Swinney’s announcement, but said more detailed guidance and information on new resources would be required.He said: “The announcement by the Deputy First Minister that the planning assumption will now be for a fullto school for all pupils in Augustit is safe to do so, is very welcome news for everyone and it reflects the aspirations that have been communicated to me over recent days by so many parents.“The education of our young people is extremely important in terms of their educational, mental and social development, as well as their future opportunities and outcomes.“I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our school staff and our parents and pupils for their hard work and collaboration throughout the period of lockdown and especially over recent weeks when they have been developing plans topupils to school taking account of the rules that are currently in place.“It has been a very dficult time in many ways for all.He added: “It should not be forgotten that a fullto education in August will only be possible with continued adherence to national guidance and scientic advice and everyone has played an important role in helping to suppress the virus in our community.“We cannot become complacent.”The Scottish teaching union called for “appropriate mitigations” to protect staff and pupils.EIS General Secretary, Larry Flanagan said: #This means looking at measures already being used where such as mandatory face coverings, protective perspex shields, proactive testing of teachers and an appropriate level of physical distancing between pupils and most certainly between pupils and staff, alongside continued protections for vulnerable groups.”Mr Swinney revealed that an additional £ million will be invested over the next two years to tackle the impact of lockdown on schools and pupils, including ensuring every current probationer teacher who meets the standard for full registration having a teaching post for the year ahead.Education Scotland has also agreed to work with E-Sgoil, the digital training  pioneered in the Western Isles, to develop a national e-learning provision for all senior phase pupils to access lessons online from qualied teachers.Mr Swinney said: “Since May, because of the efforts of ordinary

downward trend in Covid- deaths since the end of -th April, and intensive care cases now stand at a fraction of what they were.“If we stay on track,we all continue to do what is right, andwe can

More perplexing was the apparent lack of imagination or government will to procure the extra resources, staff, transport and buildings that may have allowed more children towhile observing physical distancing.Eventually, political and parental pressure # combined with more encouraging news on the suppression of the virus # led to this week’s climbdown.But questions remain as to how the revised arrangements will work.In a week where it emerged that Covid- could cost Highland Council nearly £ million, it is understandable that education chair John Finlayson is frustrated over the allocation of resources.As opposed to every request having first to be evaluated in Edinburgh, he urged the Scottish Government to “give the local authorities the additional funding so they can get on with things”.“Time is short,” the former headmaster added.We should also recognise that teachers will have every right to feel aggrieved.For weeks they and other education colleagues have been preparing plans, liaising with parents and helping to kit out classrooms to ready themselves for a socially distant re-opening in August.Yet days before the end of term, they are now heading for a summer of uncertainty and face having to come up with a new set of operating guidelines.At a time when measures have still to be reduced for the wider public, teachers have been told that social distancing in schools will not apply at all.As EIS General Secretary Larry Flanagan pointed out this week: “Why would it be mandatory to wear a face covering on public transport but not in a classroom “Why would a till assistant be protected by a Perspex sheet but not a teacher “There cannot be a social distancing rule for outside of schools and a dferent one for inside classrooms.”In some quarters the teachers’ unions have been accused of being obstructive to the prospect of schools re-opening.But in the face of a virus which has shown just how much society depends on these key workers, they are right to stand up for the interests of their members.The trade union faced similar criticism the last time they called for a teachers’ pay-rise.Would anyone, especially parents after more than three months of classes at the kitchen table, argue against that now The West Highland Free Press online shop is taking no new orders until th July .Sorry for any inconvenience this may cause."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3168924.jpg--.jpg?1591864132000\n","title":"nie meter readers ready to call again","story":"NIE Networks is to resume its meter reading activities across Northern Ireland after the service was temporarily paused due to COVID- restrictions.

Meter readers will be able to take readings from meters located in outside positions as normal.NIE Networks is urging customers to protect its meter readers and themselves by continuing to observe social distancing protocols. Ben Cupples, Meter Reading Manager at NIE Networks, explained the importance of recording a precise meter reading for the customer.“Providing a precise meter reading will ensure that your electricity bills accurately reflect your consumption,” he said. “Our meter readers will call to your home and will record the reading you provide while we wait.“If you are unable to read your meter for any reason oryou are not at home when we call, we will leave a card with information on how to submit your meter reading online via the NIE Networks website, via email or over the phone.”Mr Cupples explained that while meter reading activity would resume it would only be carried out with the health and safety of the public and meter readers in mind.“The safety of our employees and customers is our utmost priority. “If you see our meter readers out and about, we would ask that you please help them by standing at least two metres away. Likewise, we will stand at least two metres from customers’ doors at all times.“We are continually reviewing how we undertake our meter reading activities in light of COVID- and we are looking forward to being able to resume our normal way of working with customers at some stage, but we will only make that decision when it’s safe to do so.” NIE Networks is reminding customers that you only need to submit your reading to either NIE Networks or your supplier – there is no need to do it twice.

Victor Leonard, chairman of the international youth football competition at which Rashford was twice a winner with Manchester United, has always been impressed with the manner in which the young England international striker has handled himself. As Rashford vowed to continue helping those in need after successfully forcing the government to reverse its decision not to provide free school meal vouchers during the summer, Mr. Leonard described the footballer as an inspiration to everyone. He added: “We first came across Marcus in the Manchester United squads that came across to Northern Ireland to compete in our tournaments. “He was a smash hit as United went on to win the Premier section in  and  but you could not help but admire the way, even at a young age, Marcus conducted himself. “We have been across to United many times and it was always very clear how highly regarded he was as a player and a person.” Rashford came off the bench in United’s  final victory over County Tyrone at Ballymena Showgrounds and started when the Red Devils triumphed  months later against defending champions Vendee from France. Victor added: “I think he is an inspiration to everyone. He has been so passionate about this issue but gone about attempting to bring change in a highly commendable manner. “He is a credit to his family and his club and we at STATSports SuperCupNI are privileged that he is one of our tournament graduates who has gone on to achieve greatness in his football career and also through his campaigning for something in which he believes so fervently. “Hopefully he will continue to be an inspiration to all of us.” Rashford has raised about poundm to supply around three million meals to vulnerable people while working with charity FareShare UK during the coronavirus lockdown. In an emotional open letter to MPs, Rashford drew on his own experience of relying on free school meals and food banks growing up. He said his story was all too familiar for families in England.

Undoubtedly a major part of the reason has been the common sense of the public which has helped to dramatically curtail the spread of the coronavirus.However, it would not seem too much of a stretch of imagination to suggest that strong lobbying from ious sectors of the economy has also hastened the relaxations. Essentially, the new normal will be largely in place by the end of August, while earlier it had been anticipated that some sectors would not be ing until possibly December.The move to reduce social distancing from two metres to one from Monday carries an obviously greater risk of infection being spread. It is not only the distance involved, but also the time spent in the company of another person at that distance which multiplies the risk factor.The timing of the reopening of some facilities - for example betting shops, tattoo parlours, spas and massage and therapy facilities coming at least  days earlier than reopening libraries - seems a trle strange, although the economic benefit of the commercial premises is obvious.It would be churlish not to congratulate the Executive for its determination to get the economy ing again to some extent as quickly as possible. The politicians clearly have listened to business interests and put the ball in their court.It must also be recognised that the relaxation of the rules is accompanied by a health warning. Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was clear that action would be takenthere was any indication that infections were spiking again, especially as we head towards the winter months, which is always a danger period, pandemic or no pandemic.The public and the business owners must continue to show the common sense and adherence to basic hygiene rules which have worked so far in containing the virus.

Mr Maskey wrote: If the Assembly passes this resolution to enable the commission to develop any new determination, the commission is mindful of the need to ensure that any provisions both comply with wider good practice and ensure value for money in the use of public resources. Rigorous processes will continue to be in place to ensure that members demonstratethat all expenditure is in accordance with the rules regarding such allowances before they are reimbursed. Mr Maskey added these are complex matters which the commission considered in detail. The commission believes that this approach will retain the core principle of decisions on members# salaries and pensions being decided independently, while allowing some of the dficulties members have experienced in providing constituency services over recent years to be addressed, he wrote.Belfast Related Content\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news northern-ireland c .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_bfa-df-f-a-fbdbefab_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Northern IrelandProposal for Stormont body to set MLA expenses to be consideredA proposal for a Stormont body to set expenses for MLAs is being considered.Most ReadNoah Donohoe: Police say investigation still #very much a missing persons enquiry#Northern Ireland hairdresser in plea to public over £ quoteMalachi O#DohertyOpinionMichelle O#Neill said to know Bobby Storey was to love him.

Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

Hannah Richardson has grown up in Derry and is well-known in the local rock music scene as lead singer guitarist in three-piece rock band CHERYM. Her mother is a white Irish woman and father a black Sierra Leonean. Until now the -year-old has found the topic of racism dficult to address. But she felt duty-bound to speak out following the Black Lives Matter protests and subsequent stories in the Derry News. Nurse Beverly Simpson addressed the rally in Derry on June  then shared her family’s experience of racism in the city. googletag.cmd.push Last week, pharmacist Nkele Mushapho said she has been subjected to racism in the workplace with people requesting an ‘Irish pharmacist’ and constantly questioning her advice. Ms Richardson was ‘shocked’ that people commenting underneath those stories seemed unaware of racism in the city and were in some cases denying its existence. She has encountered racism since the age of  in nursery school and can’t understand the dismissive attitudes of some people. “There are a lot of people who are in denial about the fact that racism exists here,” she said. “I’ve lived here my whole le, it is a lovely place to live, the people here are fantastic. googletag.cmd.push “However, yes, there are a lot of racist people that live in Northern Ireland and Derry as well. “Racism is so common that I now have a tendency to just get on with it because you know it’s going to happen again the next time you go out. It becomes normal.” She was raised by a white mother and all her friends are predominantly white. Until now, she has never felt the need to make public her views. But the experience of Ms Mushapho struck a chord and she couldn’t believe people were disregarding her account. “I was reading those comments going, ‘seriously, you don’t know how bad it is’. I know that not all people from here are racist, or have anything against black people, but a lot of people are ignorant to the idea of racism. “A lot of people here find it acceptable to use racial slurs or casual racism because there’s never really been that many black people about to correct them or tell them otherwise - that ‘yes, that is offensive’.” COMPASSION Ms Richardson has natural afro hair which has attracted negative attention in the past: “I used to be fine with wearing it out, loud and proud and happy days, but recently every single time that I would wear my natural hair as opposed to having weaves or wearing a hat, somebody would say something about me. “Whether it be, ‘are you on your holidays or where are you from ’ “I was walking through Foyle Street recently when some boy came right up to me and screamed Mo Salah in my face. “It’s every weekend, every single day I leave the house with my hair like that I would say it happens. “It’s really, really tough. So, it is shocking to see people being so dismissive of other people’s experiences because I assumed everybody knew that it was like this but they clearly don’t.” The -year-old believes that now is the right time for everyone to have conversations about race. She was dismayed by comments underneath a post by former politician Pat Ramsey a number of years ago in which he shared a story of racist abuse directed at a group of black people visiting the city. On nights out people are ‘the worst’ because they see a group of black people and approach them, she said. At times it can be positive but on other occasions ‘slurs are thrown about’. Looking back, Ms Richardson ponders whether she should’ve engaged with people commenting under Pat Ramsey’s post. However, the most recent comments with people saying Ms Mushapho was ‘lying’, ‘Derry is not like that’, ‘Irish people have history of oppression and wouldn’t act in such a way’ couldn’t go unaddressed, Ms Richardson said. “Your own experience of oppression should not ever take away from the experiences of black people,anything it should make you more compassionate towards another minority suffering from racism. “Is it because people can’t relate to black struggle that they have to turn the oppression back on themselves. “We need to take a look at what’s going on under our noses.” PROGRESSIVE In her view, it is right to shine a spotlight on injustices everywhere but she believes it is wrong to overlook what is happening in the city by directing comments at Ms Mushapho such as ‘racism exists in South Africa too’. “That’s like saying, ‘your experience doesn’t matter to me, take a look at your own people’”, Ms Richardson added. She despises use of the word ‘coloured’ saying it is completely inappropriate when describing a black person. Experts on racism say it is regarded as a highly offensive racial slur which recalls a time when casual racism was a part of everyday le. In the US, because of the countrys era of racial segregation, it is among the most offensive words for describing a black person. Ms Richardson believes some people in Derry are intentionally racist but many others are completely unaware, they lack a basic understanding of what terms are racist. She explained: “A lot of us are ignorant on the subject, you might have made racist remarks in the past but you yourself might not be racist. “As long as you learn from that racist remark, take what you can from it and accept you may have offended someone then that’s a good progressive way to be.” Reflecting on the way forward, she concluded: “Does racism exist in Northern Ireland  Totally. “Does it exist in Derry  Aye. “Don’t be afraid to ask questions, to ask other black people “Stop disregarding people’s experiences of racism. “Let’s think about what can we do to make sure Derry is anti-racist, as opposed to just being against racism, what can we do to make this a better place ”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Robert McCullough has taken on the important role. Speaking last month, he said: “Since the beginning of March, Danske Bank has provided poundmillion in overall business lending, including poundmillion through the UK government-backed Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme and poundmillion on the Bounce Back Loan Scheme.” The UK Government’s Bounce Back Loan Scheme grants finance of up to pound, to small and medium-sized businesses, interest-free for the first  months. Meanwhile, for companies with a turnover of up to poundmillion, the UK-wide Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme allows them to access up to poundmillion where the UK Government will pay interest and any fees for the first  months. googletag.cmd.push Danske Bank has also been able to provide relief of up to poundmillion to large businesses via the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme. As the largest bank in Northern Ireland, Danske Bank supports companies in a wide iety of sectors, such as retailers Lunn’s Jewellers, manufacturers The Signature Works and in tourism, family-run bus company Airporter.  poundM LENDING: Danske Bank’s Robert McCullough Robert said: “Businesses in some industries have managed to adapt quickly to a new reality of remote working and social distancing, while others have regrettably seen trade grind to a halt. “The unprecedented measures announced by the government will help a lot of companies to survive and we are hopeful the majority will ultimately recover.” The bank was able to launch each of the Schemes on day one, the majority of applications being approved through an easy, automated process. “Getting this financial support in place in Northern Ireland was the result of a huge effort from teams across the Danske Bank and we continue to work hard to make sure the process is as good as it should be and that we can get money to our customers quickly. “There is no doubt that we have an important role to play in the weeks and months ahead to get Northern Ireland moving again. “We have the commitment and the capacity to continue to support customers, the community and the wider economy.”  FINDING A SOLUTION: Staff working at the Sunamp site in East Lothian When the Covid- pandemic arrived the chief executive officer of East Lothian firm Sunamp, knew the company could respond. Andrew Bissellsaid: “A week into lockdown I woke up in the middle of the night and just thought ‘we have to do something that makes the business relevant in this crisis’.” Mr Bissell turned to Sunamp’s innovative technology, developed in partnership with the University of Edinburgh. The company has led the way in the manufacture of heat batteries that store heat energy rather than electricity like conventional batteries. The applications of the technology span several industries, but the company’s focus has so far been on offering a product that replaces the hot water tank in heating systems with something smaller and more efficient. Recognising the potential of the technology in the context of Covid-, Sunamp was one of more than , companies to apply for grant funding from Innovate UK, the UK Government’s innovation agency. In April, Innovate UK launched the Fast Start initiative, with poundm of funding available to companies responding to the pandemic with some form of innovation. In the end, Sunamp was one of  companies to secure a grant.  The pound, award is being used to develop mobile handwash units that can be installed in locations where people lack access to hygiene facilities that can help prevent the spread of Covid-. Mr Bissell said: “You don’t need hot water to wash your hands, but it is much more comfortable. “Right now, we’re dealing with the virus in the summer time, but as we head into winter,you have to wash your hands outside a railway station or supermarket or vaccination centre, it will be much more pleasant to have warm water.” The idea has gained traction with Sunamp’s clients, with inquiries coming in rapidly even though the finished product is still in development. Mr Bissell said: “Covid- is a global problem so there’s widespread interest. “Sunamp has partnerships and licensing arrangements with businesses all around the world through which it sells its heat batteries, so the ambition for the mobile units is international.” For Mr Bissell, the appeal of the project is that in addition to its obvious commercial potential, there’s a real societal benefit. “There is no minimising the negatives of Covid-,” he said. “But there are many people stepping and doing amazing things.” Working with everything from gas boilers to solar and heat pumps, Sunamp says its Heat Batteries deliver hot water with efficiency and proven savings of up to  per cent on utility bills in residential, commercial or industrial settings. The types of support on offer to help your company… Here are some examples of the support available for businesses and workers. middot The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has enabled businesses to put employees on a period of temporary leaveand apply for a UK Government grant to cover  per cent of those workers’ usual monthly wage costs, up to pound, a month. middot The Self-Employment Income Support Scheme will allow eligible self-employed iniduals to claim a taxable grant of  per cent of their average monthly profits, up to pound,. middot UK VAT-registered firms have been given the option to defer VAT payments until the end of June.

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A spokesperson for St. Columb’s College encouraged people to get involved today. “Both of these young men are sadly missed by staff and students at the College. “Oran was a pleasant young man - a true gentleman in the making.

Outside of school, he played an active role in his local GAA club and enjoyed socialising with friends when not working on cars with his father. googletag.cmd.push “Oran showed extreme courage and faith throughout his illness and his loss has left its mark on those who remember him fondly. “Aodhaacuten was such a genuine, lovely person and brought a smile to everyone he was around. He was a dream of a young fella. He was a fantastic hurler and loved representing his club and county. Family, friends and team mates held him in high esteem and he is sorely missed by us all.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

St Marys Grammar School, Magherafelt, confirmed they intend to use the transfer test, known as the GL Entrance Assessment. In a statement, the school said they are aware of the unprecedented circumstances of this year. After y consideration of the issues, the Board of Governors of St Marys Grammar School intends to use academic selection in its admissions criteria for pupils wishing to transfer to the school in September , it read. The GL Entrance Assessment will be conducted in accordance with the most up-to-date Public Health Agency guidance available to schools at that time. googletag.cmd.push The school are part ofa group called the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium , who have taken measures to mitigate some of the disruption caused by Covid- this academic year. The group released a statement claiming marking and standardising approaches will ensure comparable outcomes to previous years. It will not, for example, be harder to achieve an A grade this year, it read. Every year, regardless of how many pupils sit the Entrance Assessment or of whether the papers prove to be slightly easier or more dficult than a previous year, the marking and standardisation processes ensure that similar proportions of pupils will achieve similar grades. googletag.cmd.push St Marys added that they have a contingency plan in the event of the Entrance Assessment not being able to take place. They said: Should it be required, the implementation of this plan will include alternative admission criteria, the details of which will be published for parents at that time. Any change of circumstances would have to be considered in the local context, acted upon and communicated to parents at the earliest possible date. St Columbs and Thornhill in Derry city are among a number of schools that have opted against asking prospective pupils to take the transfer test this year. Both are also members of the PPTC. Another County Derry member, Rainey Endowed in Magherafelt, are yet to publicly announce their arrangements, but astatement from the PPTC is available on their website, detailing information about transfer arrangements.

The Unity of Purpose group was in the news earlier this month when it called for the postponement of a Black Lives Matter rally which was held in Derrys Guildhall Square on June . In a statement, which was issued through the City Centre Initiative in Derry, the group said they understood and supported the reasons for the rally, but added that they believed it should be called off due to public safety concerns in relation to the coronavirus pandemic. However, despite the appeal, the rally went ahead and police subsequently issued  fines to people taking part in the protest. googletag.cmd.push In its recent statement, a spokesperson for theUnityofPurposegroup said it consists of local MPs, MLAs, the Mayor and statutory and business leaders within Derry. In the wake of the Black Lives Matters rally,Shaun Harkin and Eamonn McCann, People Before Profit councillors on the local council, criticised the stance of the Unity of Purpose group and called for the group to disband. The Unity of Purpose group did not respond to the councillors criticisms. Speaking at todays monthly meeting of the council, independent councillor Gary Donnelly accused the group of being very very selective on what they comment on. There have been a lot things that have happened in this city during the time that this group has been about and they have issued no statements. he said. googletag.cmd.push My concern is that they are not accountable, they dont respond and there is a council connection that I am deeply concerned about. I have seen photographs with councillors and I have seen photographs with council officers and I want to try and get some clarication on that. I want clarication on funding. Do we fund them directly or indirectly  I know there is a link to them through the City Centre Initiative. Far from saying what they say they do on the tin, their actions have led to people becoming more marginalised and excluded, added Cllr Donnelly. Speaking at todays meeting, Councillor Eamonn McCann described the Unity of Purpose group as a faceless organisation. He said it was unusual that there no inidual names attached to the recent statement issued by the group. Does this group have a policy document that we can look at  Does it have a constitution  Does it have a set of aims or a mission statement  Becausewe dont see that we are unable to work out in what way the opposition to the Black Lives Matter rally comes within their remit, said Cllr McCann. Cllr Donnelly proposed that the council carry out a report into connections between the council and the Unity of Purpose group. The matter was put to a vote and the proposal was carried, after  councillors voted to support it. Six councillors voted against the proposal.

While a more defined timeline is now in place, clubs should onlywhen they are ready to do so,saidIRFU Rugby Development DirectorColin McEntee. We have already seen a handful of clubs put a Covid- Club Health  Safety Plan in place and resume with reduced activities and we are delighted to see players being active again and reconnecting with their clubs. Given the restricted nature of these activities, we don’t see any clubs being left behind as we continue to work towards ato competition in September. I encourage all clubs to plan for that time with the highest safety standards in mind. PLAYER WELFARE  INJURY PREVENTION Workload volume and activity should be strictly controlled throughout these stages. This will be critical in terms of injury prevention as well as minimizing the risk of COVID- infection. IRFU Medical DirectorRod McLoughlinsaid: We must remember at all times that COVID- has not been eliminated from this island. It is critical that clubs continue to minimise risk and adhere to all public health measures in place. Rugby will onlyin a meaningful waywe adopt the right behaviours that will keep ourselves, our teammates and our club mates safe. He also urged clubs to take extra care with injury prevention measures for players. It has been over  days since any club player has been involved in competitive rugby and we have seen from other team sports that have ed earlier than rugby that there is an increased risk of injury. That means clubs will have to be extra cautious around the training loads they are putting in place. Player welfare still applies around injury prevention just as much as it does in terms of Covid-. PAPERLESS PRE-RETURN TO RUGBY PERSONAL ASSESSMENT DECLARATION FORM Clubs can avail of a new paperless Pre-Return To Rugby Personal Assessment Declaration Form week commencing theJuly th.The online version of the form will be available as part of the new RugbyConnect system. The form is an essential document in Covid- Health  Safety Planning. It confirms that a club member is not suffering from any Covid- Symptoms, been in close contact with anyone who is self-isolating or has travelled from another country in the past  days. PPE SUPPLEMENTARY KITS FOR CLUBS The IRFU will issue supplementary PPE Kits to clubs to assist in the implementation of their COVID- Club Health  Safety Plans. Each club can expect to receive a PPE Kit to their designated COVID- Club Safety Officer contact from the week commencingth June.

Those behind the ambitious project are confident that the ious stories will appeal to both locals and visitors alike.Other interpretative  will tell of the emigration of families from Saintfield to the United States over the last  years, using the example of the three Maffett brothers who left Leggygowan for America, the first in , followed by a further two brothers in .It is one of their descendants, David Moffett, who has made this precious community asset possible.Saintfield Development Association officials, who played a lead role in securing the new community centre, approached the owners of the Windmill Road field and began protracted negotiations to secure the site, with the all-important funding to acquire the land obtained through Mr Moffettrsquos generous donation.A successful business executive with a well-known company in America, his family had links with the area dating back to the early th century, with Mr Moffettrsquos ancestral, family including James and Isabella Maffett and their children, buried in the graveyard at Saintfield Parish Church.Explaining the background to the heritage park proposal, a spokesman for the Development Association explained that a successful funding bid was submitted to the Heritage Lottery Fund for money to carry out necessary feasibility studies on the field.ldquoThese studies have since been completed to the satisfaction of the funder and have shown that there are no impediments for the field to be developed as a community heritage park, he explained.ldquoThese studies will also provide evidence for the necessary planning application for the change of use of the field from agricultural to community use.The spokesman also confirmed that consultants who carried out the feasibility studies of the field also compiled a list of proposals for the development which include measures to obviate as much as possible any disruption or annoyance to neighbouring residents through noise or anti-social behaviour.Public consultation on the proposals will be undertaken once the current pandemic restrictions are sufficiently eased and, following this process, the Development Association intends to raise the funds needed to implement the agreed proposals by applying for suitable grants.There will also be community fundraising.In addition, Newry, Mourne and Down Council has been asked to approve a new link being created between the community centre and proposed heritage park. The issue was under discussion prior to the coronavirus pandemic.Rowallane councillor Robert Burgess has praised all those involved in the project and hopes that the remaining pieces in the development jigsaw fall into place.ldquoThis is a terric development that not only local people can enjoy, but one which visitors to the town can also enjoy and learn so much about Saintfield and its people, he said.ldquoWe are fortunate to have the new community centre up and running and developing a new heritage park would represent further success for the town. Great credit must go Saintfield Heritage Society and townrsquos hardworking Development Association.Cllr Burgess added Saintfield was ldquovery fortunate to have extremely committed community iniduals who have the town and its people very much at heart.Full details of the proposes heritage park proposal are available at discoversaintfield..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Butler look after royalty and presidents  ","story":"FRANCIS McBriar has been a butler to four generations of the Royal Family, served US and Irish presidents and Northern Ireland Secretaries of State.However, he has only one mantra in his mind every time he dons his smart unorm mdash and that is he treats everyone the same.The farmerrsquos son who lives just outside Saintfield with his we Heather has butlered for  years. For those in the know, hersquos the man to reach out foryou have a special occasion or dinner event coming up.Regularly employed by the Earl of Erne at his Fermanagh residence, Crom Castle, Francis was recently featured doing what he does best in the RTE food series, Lords and Ladles.The  year-old was introduced to Hillsborough Castle, the Royal Familyrsquos official residence when they are in Northern Ireland, by the castlersquos late and highly regarded former house manager, David Anderson.ldquoI wouldnrsquot be where I am today without David Anderson, itrsquos as simple as that, said Francis.ldquoWe met through First Saintfield Church which David joined when he moved into the area. We were part of a group looking after senior people of the congregation and we would have worked together hosting dinners and bus outings and so on.ldquoOne day David turned to me and said, lsquoFrancis you are a very adaptable person, you could be a great help to meyou would like to bersquo.ldquoI was invited up to Hillsborough Castle to work with him and things just took off from there. I enjoy working with people and always went out with the intention of helping others and to make sure that they enjoyed their day, or their dinner. I also always found it easy to chat away to people.At that time, Francis was working as a distribution manager for a group of fashion shops and was the father of three young children with no thoughts of a future career in butlering.Today, he works mostly at Crom Castle and, closer to home, at Montalto House in Ballynahinch, but also looks after an American family when they travel to the British Isles.They take Francis wherever they go, sometimes to the Scottish Highlands and hopefully inSeptember to their Dorset property.ldquoIrsquom hoping that it still happens, admits Francis, whose work, like many others, has been affected by the Covid- pandemic.ldquoI really enjoy it and I love to travel. It doesnrsquot bother me being away from home for maybe several weeks at a time. My family are grown up with families of their own and I think my we is quite content to see me going out and about as she gets her head showered.He and Heather have three children, Robert, Anita and James, and a grandchild, George, who will be one year old soon. A second grandchild is due any day now.Having, in his words, ldquolooked after the late Queen Mother, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh, their children and Prince Charlesrsquo children, the likes of President Bush, Irish presidents Mary McAleese and Michael D Higgins, Francis admits his disappointment at missing out on meeting Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.He said: ldquoItrsquos been lovely to look after the Royal Family and a few years ago I was invited up to look after Prince William. I was so looking forward to looking after the couple but unfortunately that was the day the Duchess announced she was pregnant with Prince Louis and couldnrsquot fly over. So I missed that opportunity and would have loved to have met Kate.He believes that having served royalty, he can serve anyone and his nerve has never let him down so far.ldquoI think perhaps once you have attended to the people at Hillsborough Castle, it takes any nerves away, said Francis. ldquoYou think wellI can serve the Queen, then I can serve anyone. No-one is better than anyone  in my eyes. I just go in and do my best for whoever Irsquom looking after.For most people, the role of butler is quite rare today but in the days of stately and larger homes a bulter was the head male servant in a large household and his job was to manage the work of all the other servants.Francis agrees that his role is similar to that of the most famous butler in recent times, Carson, from the hit TV series and movie, Downton Abbey.ldquoThe whole point of being a butler is be unobtrusive but close at hand in the backgroundyou are needed. You need to judge when not to overstay your welcome when you are at the table.ldquoWhat happens there, stays there. I suppose I have developed a reputation for being discreet and I try to be. I would never tell others the conversations I hear around the table. As far as Irsquom concerned, everything is private.ldquoI treat everyone the same, no matter what their position in le, These people are paying my wages. I believe that nobody is better than anyone . If they are there at the table, then Irsquom there to look after them.Unlike Carson, who had to extract Lady Mary out of a number of compromising situations, Francis has never come across anyone who was the worst for wear for drink or found in an embarrassing situation.ldquoI must admit that in the circles I would be in, Irsquove never come across anyone over-indulging. My job is really to be able to turn my hand to anything and to look after people. The butler is really in charge of the household. When I go to work at Crom Castle, the Earl tells me lsquoFrancis, yoursquore in charge, itrsquos over to yoursquo.Working with some of the best chefs around, Francis admits that hersquos been treated to some delicious dining experiences through his work.ldquoI honestly donrsquot see what I do as work.

It must seek to bind together the town centre with the outlying housing developments and consequently look to improve the economic and social wellbeing of the local community.Cllr Curran agreed that the Irish Street site offered a ldquounique opportunity for the development of business, employment and tourism.He thanked council committees and Department for Infrastructure for supporting the project.He said: ldquoThe Irish Street project represents the single biggest change to the town centre in a generation. It has the potential to transform Downpatrick and itrsquos vital everyone works together to make the regeneration proposal a major success.ldquoThe planned redevelopment is one of the most important projects ever proposed for Downpatrick and it is vital to make the most of the opportunities it presents.

However,we use DNA technology to catch dog owners who allow their pets to foul public areas, their identity will be made publicthey end up in court, he continued.ldquoDog fouling problem is a highly contentious issue and, without doubt, one of the single most complained about problems across our district. It is something that we have not yet to got to grips with, but perhaps the new initiative under consideration will change that.Cllr Walker said it was important to remember that the overwhelming majority of dog owners across the district cleaned up after their pets, but there was a hardcore who did not.He added: ldquoWe have talked about this issue for years and the problem has not diminished in any way. People are looking to politicians and the council for leadership and it is vital that we do everything we can to address this problem.Another Rowallane councillor, Kathryn Owen, has welcomed agreement to pursue the DNA issue, explaining that while this particular suggestion had been been brought to the council many times in the past, it was always rejected.She said that going down the route of DNA testing would remove the need for CCTV cameras to be erected to capture video evidence or the need for witness statements to nab offenders.Cllr Owen said that despite the refusal to examine DNA testing in the past, there is now a ldquochange in tone and acceptance to explore this particular option.She added: ldquoI was delighted to support this course of action proposed by Cllr Patrick Brown as something drastic needs to be done.ldquoIt is a terrible shame that it has come to this.

Phil, who used to wear XL shirts and had a waistline of  inches, was recently ill with what was thought to be Covid-. He believes that while it was unpleasant and he was knocked off his feet, he’s not sure he would have survivedhe hadn’t lost weight. He said: “I dread to think how my body would have responded.

His main worry was that would he die in his sleep and his body couldn’t be removed from the third floor of his parents’ house.Phil, who has slimmed from st .lbs to st lbs in three years, said: “I was always bigger than my peers – I remember at school being called out by my PE teacher for being too big to play football. “The weight really started to pile on though when I started university. My size meant my le became increasingly insular and I made up a iety of excuses not to go out.“I’d avoid gatherings like parties and weddings because I just felt so uncomfortable. I knew I wouldn’t fit into a plane seat so I never travelled, even though I really wanted to. Apart from my job as a civil servant, I didn’t really do anything except hide away and eat. It was a very lonely time.”Phil Kayes with his partner Nicole MullhollandPhil realised he had to do something about his weight when his mother was diagnosed with terminal cancer: “Mum was facing her fourth cancer battle which sadly turned out to be her last. The news sort of spurred me into action and I knew this time I had to try and be as healthy as I could – not just for her but for me as well. “I was also worried thatmy mum did pass away, I wouldn’t be able to be one of her pallbearers, which was heart-breaking. She died in October , by which point I’d lost five stones. I know she’d be really proudshe could see me now.”Since halving his bodyweight, Phil has become more active and has started cycling again after a near -year absence from the activity. He said the best thing to happen to him since shedding  stone is meeting his partner, Nicole Mullholland, on an online dating app. Since the temporary suspension of its , community groups, Slimming World has launched a virtual weight-loss service to continue to support members.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

in the borough.By The NewsroomFriday, th June , : pm\"\"Photo by Aaron McCracken HarrisonsThe matter was raised at a Council’s monthly meeting by UUP Alderman Jim Speers who asked when caravan sites across the borough would be reopening.“Gosford generates businesses for Markethill and we want to see that opening up as well as a site in Clare Glen,” said the Alderman.“A lot of people will want to be out and about andit can be done safely at these sites, it should be.”In response to these comments, Council’s strategic director,Mark Parkinson, confirmed caravan sites at both Gosford Forest Park and Clare Glen would open from Friday, June .“Gosford will open on June  and so will Clare Glen,” said Mr Parkinson.“The site at Kinnego will reopen on Friday, July , and at all these sites the caravan, camping, toilet and shower facilities will be available.”SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon askedthose who had made bookings before the outbreak of the COVID- pandemic and subsequently had their bookings cancelled, were being contacted to ensure they could still avail of the service.“Some people had booked their slots at these sites early in January and paid for them,” said Cllr O’Hanlon. “They were quickly refunded during the outbreak and that was good and the right thing to do but have we made contact with those people now “They had been on the ball and made their bookings early, it wouldbe a shamethey were now to miss out, when the sites have reopened, through no real fault of their own.”His question went unanswered on the night and when the Local Democracy Reporting Service asked Council for an answer, a spokesperson said it is working to accommodateall bookings.“As Council begins to reopen its caravanning and camping facilities at Clare Glen, Gosford Forest Park and Kinnego Marina, we are working with the public to accommodateall bookings where possible based on reduced capacity and in compliance with social distancing and PHA guidance,” said a Council spokesperson.“We will continue to keep this under review.”\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\"
