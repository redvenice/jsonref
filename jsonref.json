He asked each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one, and they returned to the location to replicate the image. The project aims to provide a platform, allowing others to acknowledge their loss, and to celebrate the person they loveDeath has a stigma and the burden of grief can hold us captive if we let it. May this be a process through which a loved one can be remembered and through which memories can be relived. Even though the pain of the loss may remain, may this go some way in relieving the hurt and the stigma of death and act as a public declaration that death has lost its sting.I ask each participant to find a photograph of themselves with their lost loved one. We then return to the location of the original photograph to replicate the image.It is a chance to think back and remember, to tell the story of that day and of the person that they have lost. Imagery allows for expression beyond what we can speak of. I hope it is an experience that contributes to the restorative process in overcoming the painful impact of loss.We all have a different experience of loss that can reveal itself in many ways. Sometimes it’s a response that is quite clear for those around you to see. Perhaps there are lots of emotions that they just don’t know how to let out, they’re not sure how they should be feeling or whether it’s right to be having certain angry or complicated thoughts.It’s not about having the best photo, saying the right thing or having the answers, I just want to give people a chance to speak about their experience of loss.My aim was that the combination of the photos we took and the conversations we had, we would be able to portray a deep personal story. This allows other people who are struggling and going through similar experiences to look through and find strength and comfort in the story, knowing that other people have been through it and are confident enough to share their story.I lost my father to prostate cancer in December 2009. When my dad died, it wounded me in the deepest part of my being. The loss shaped the following few years of my life and will continue to do so, but I don’t have to let it define who I am. Through this time, it was really helpful to be able to talk about my dad. I wanted to share with others about the person he was, the emotions I was feeling as I processed the grief, and talk about the influence he had – and continues to have – on my life. Those conversations were often hard and few and far between, mainly because people just didn’t quite know how to respond.I’m Alistair, and my dad was James. The original picture was from the beach at Swanage in Dorset. I’m not sure how old I was there, but it was a family holiday. We loved to go down there and find a pitch for the day, Mum and Dad would soak up the sun and me and Tim, my brother, would build sandcastles and splash around, and repeat until we had to go home.He was a very loving father, he provided for his family, looked after us. He taught me a lot of principles about always doing the best, always trying to be the nicest person and to make sure that others were looked after and cared for. When you look back you realise you’ve been prepared by your parents to live your life. Dad always just wanted to treat others how he’d want to be treated.When we got the dementia diagnosis, several years ago, we had noticed over time that he was getting more forgetful. He wouldn’t use my name, he was losing his hearing, his vision wasn’t great and I lost him as a dad over those years. I still loved him as my dad, but I knew I wasn’t necessarily going to get that reciprocated, which was tough. He still offered to help when I mentioned to him about moving flat he’d say “well let me know if you need a hand”. I think that’s just his character through and through and I always just try to emulate that.I went to see him in the care home and I said to the staff that I’d like to volunteer in the garden if possible, even if he wasn’t aware of me being there, I could just help out and spend some time with him, but then we went into lockdown and that was the last time I saw him when he was awake and alert.When the Covid thing came along, it was like losing him for a second time, but this time, obviously, for the last time. It was difficult because I had kind of processed losing him in a mental sense, and now I was losing him in a physical sense.I did get to see him before he passed away and it was just a completely different experience because I had to wear all the PPE. In the past, I’d just always assumed he’d be there for years to come and you don’t think about it ever being the last time, whereas I went there, got dressed up and they said you’ve got 15 minutes. It was horrible having this countdown clock, where you have this time limit on how long you have left with someone. I just set it on my watch and it’s just counting down. I was thinking, I’ve got 30 seconds left with my dad, 20 seconds left, 10 seconds left. What do I do? What do I say? And I just panicked.It made me reflect on how many times I’ve seen or called my parents and thought that maybe I’m quite busy and I haven’t really got time for this, but I’ll see them next week. I’ve gone away thinking that it’s OK that I didn’t see them for very long today because I’ll see them in the future.It’s given me a real appreciation for just taking a second to appreciate that when you’re with family or a friend, that you don’t know necessarily when you might see them again and that’s why you have to make the most of the time you have with them. I’m trying to act on it in a positive way, rather than just thinking about why I feel that way because of Dad.It’s absolutely OK to cry and be a blubbering mess sometimes. If you try to stop it, you’ll feel a lot worse. I know that particularly for men there’s this societal pressure to be a strong support and a rock for people, but for your own sake, for men and women, to let your body do what it needs to do. You want to cry because your brain is telling you that you need to process this, to not fight it but to let it happen, then you’ll feel that pressure is unloaded.My name is Jonathan. The picture of myself and dad was taken on Christmas Eve 2019. We’d had Christmas together for the previous 54 years and it was a tradition we never broke. It was a fabulous event, we went out for a meal and then came back and exchanged gifts here.My dad was 88 and he was getting old, things were failing. As a son it’s really upsetting when parents get older. I would do anything to try and make his life easier. I saw that he was walking badly and he said that the flesh on his feet was getting thinner and thinner and it was painful to walk. He’d never been into a Nike store, but he hobbled in, and then pretty soon we were having him trying on lots of pairs and we fitted him up with a pair of Nike Air Max. He was virtually running around the store, which was really lovely, really heartening. I felt as though I’d knocked off 10 or 15 years!He was so busy, I couldn’t keep up with him. I’m half his age, but he was out every night of the week. He would attend choirs, he was in the Greater Manchester Police Choir, the church choir, he was in Probus. I just don’t think he liked being at home.He was the person I’d known longest in my life, he was always there. He was a bit like Switzerland, he never really offered a view, but he was always there to support me and catch me if I fell or tripped. It’s three months since he died and I’ve spent the last three months going to call him every day. So it’s been difficult.He was the 12th coronavirus victim in the UK, so it was right at the very start. The health service and society as a whole didn’t know what to do. They didn’t know how to process and deal with the virus at that stage. So that was really difficult, because we couldn’t go to see him. We were only allowed to see him at the very end with lots of protective equipment, but if he hadn’t have had the coronavirus he probably would have been here today, because they would have treated his underlying health issues. It’s really, really difficult.He died on Friday 13th, which I just couldn’t believe. The last time I saw him, we’d had a chat and I’d said what a cool dad he was, that he’d done a really good job, and he said, “No, I don’t think I was that good”, which I thought was really sweet. I said goodbye to him and went into the anteroom, where I had to take off all the protective equipment. I was halfway through taking it off and he called me back, but I couldn’t go back because the room had a positive air pressure, so I’ll never know what he wanted me for. That went with him to the grave.It sounds really strange, but it’ll be very odd when the pandemic ends, because it has felt like a very intimate time, in that we went into shutdown and I could think about my dad’s experience, but it was like a shared experience with the whole of the world. I dread to think of other families going through the same thing that we went through. When someone dies of cancer or a heart attack, it’s dreadful, but that’s the moment. Whereas my dad died on the 13 March and from that point on, coronavirus has been on the news every minute of every hour of every day. It was like someone sticking a knife into the wound all the time, there was no escaping from it. As a family we felt properly battered.Normally if you suffer a bereavement you have the support of family and friends, and we couldn’t go and see anyone. We were in lockdown before the country, in our own lockdown, so it’s been a very lonely time. Every step along the way was difficult, it felt as though we were unfortunate pioneers. The first funeral director that we went to wouldn’t deal with us. It’s been unusual.At his funeral, we only had 10 people there and I liked it because it was nice and quiet. I’d discovered tapes of him singing so we actually played him singing a song on the way out and it made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up. That was really magical.My name is Philip and the photograph is of me and my parents. We bought this caravan in 2016, and they were very much part of our lives, so they would come for a weekend. We are in the very north of Anglesey. If you think of the island as a clock, then we’re at 1 o’clock, overlooking the most northerly lighthouse, Point Lynas.My dad was a travelling salesman for James Stewart and Co in Ardwick, opposite Manchester Apollo. His turf was Moss Side. He used to sell from a catalogue going door to door and he was well known in the area. He did that for 30-odd years.My mum brought us up, two boys who liked to fight and liked to be boys. She was also the bursar at the Ryleys school in Alderley Edge, and was very into amateur dramatics, so was part of the Wilmslow Green Room Society. She was in a lot of plays, then did a lot of backstage and in her older years did a lot of wardrobe, so there’s a team of six that meet every Tuesday to talk and sort the wardrobes out.Mum had coughs, she definitely had Covid.She was fit and healthy, walking a mile a day, in the drama group. Dad was playing golf and doing the garden, but he died of a broken heart, basically. Even though he did test positive, he never had a cough or any real symptoms. I lost both parents in 48 hours. My family is my world, so the only reassurance is that we were telling them to stay in, eat and have the paracetamol and do what the doctor says, that they’d get through it and to be strong.My brother still lived with my parents and had to give CPR to both of them. They were in lockdown, so even after both parents dying, Peter had to stay in the house for another five days and we weren’t allowed to visit. It’s all that stuff that you don’t hear about and have no idea what people are going through. To this day, he has not had any symptoms. He’s never been tested, nobody approached him, but he’s never had a day of illness. We were only allowed 10 people at the funeral when we could have had 200. We printed 100 orders of service and posted them out to different people, just so there was something for them to share on the day. We did a video, so we can share that with people, but obviously nobody got the funeral that they wanted.For the first three weeks after my parents died, I became a bit of a counsellor. People would ring me up and I’d have to explain everything and say well, we have to look for the silver lining in it all, we have to find something every day that helps and is a positive. We’ve done that, we have managed to find that glimmer, even little quirky things, memories of them, thoughts of them.I suppose the only comfort is that there isn’t an answer. There isn’t something that we could or should have done to make the result anything different than what it was, because nobody had that knowledge. Everybody was scared and there are still friends of my mum and dad that haven’t gone out.We summed it up quite nicely in that if somebody else came into the room, that person became the most important person. So it was never about them, they were the host and hostess. Drop everything, someone’s come in, what can I do for you, get you a drink, something to eat, oven on, and we’ll look after you, tell us what’s going on in your life, is there something we can help with?I used to sit and watch every United game with my dad, we were avid football fans and we’d chat away, so the first time I watched United I put a glass of white wine next to me. That’s what makes it tough sometimes, those chats, those little bits that fill in your week. It’s good to talk it out, you have to do that.I’m just so pleased that they saw both my daughters get firsts, graduate and be in the jobs they want to be in. They burst with pride about my girls. I’ve tried to do the best to acknowledge them and pay them tribute, and if we can be half the people they were, then we’re doing a good job."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8d7e0bf020385a47d51b259f390f24c6b68ddad6/419_222_2721_1632/master/2721.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4632d1b8d55753fa79efb627847a603","title":"picture essay america 1930s post office murals","story":"Photographer Justin Hamel stumbled on a Great Depression-era mural one day in a New York post office, and was intrigued to learn there are 1,200 of them across the countryThe instinct to try to boost morale during a time of hardship and suffering resonates today as we face the pandemic and economic recession.Modeled on the 1933 Public Works Art Project, the federal government created the Treasury Section of Painting and Sculpture a year later (the name was subsequently changed to the Section of Fine Arts).These programs were designed to employ artists.The mission of the post office murals was multifaceted – to boost morale in communities, employ artists by the thousands and create world-class art that was accessible to everyone. The murals revolved around local folklore, landscapes, industry and, unsurprisingly, mail delivery. They told the story of life across the United States.The first mural I photographed occurred by happenstance – I stumbled upon a mural depicting the 1932 Winter Olympics in Lake Placid, New York. From there the project slowly grew, as I traveled around the country seeking out the unique art of the post office mural.I’ve now photographed about 325 inidual murals though I don’t have an actual tally.From the magnificent depiction of steam engines being built in the post office in Willard, Ohio, to a serene pondside landscape hanging in the sheriff’s office in Dale county, Alabama, or covered wagons crossing a stream in Crawford, Nebraska, each new mural I discovered offered an engaging view into the local histories of the world around us.In small towns everywhere, history was painted by people who arrived in America seeking a better life. Many of the artists employed by the Section were immigrants. José Aceves, a Mexican-American artist, painted the classic western scene Big City News in Borger, Texas.New and Old Methods of Transportation, showing how the rapid pace at which technology was changing rural towns, was painted by the Polish-American Bernard Zakheim in Mineola, Texas. In a Virginia post office lobby, you’ll find a factory valley landscape entitled Appalachia by Lucienne Bloch, a Swiss-born immigrant.As today’s national discussion in the US has shifted towards institutional racism and the place of art and statues commemorating the United States’ racist history, many post office murals are coming under scrutiny for the way they portray the colonization and slavery. Hollis Holbrook’s John Elliot Speaks to the Natick Indians depicts Native Americans enslaved by Puritans while John Elliot preaches Christianity to them.The city of Natick was founded as the first of many “praying towns” by the Massachusetts Bay Colony, where Native Americans would be forced to learn Christianity.However, the controversy surrounding post office murals is arguably nothing new. In the 1950s, a handful of artists were made to testify under the House committee on un-American activities for their celebration of labor and political undertones.Victor Arnautoff’s historic 10-panel The Life of Washington mural at the George Washington high school in San Francisco is in the midst of a fierce fight to be preserved, hidden or destroyed due to its depictions of George Washington as a slave owner and the dead Native Americans the country was founded upon. Hundreds of murals created under the Section of Fine Arts and the broader Works Progress Administration have been lost or purposely destroyed over the years.The Section of Fine Arts created roughly 1,400 murals and sculptures in federal buildings, not entirely post offices. The PWAP, Treasury Relief Art and Federal Art Project commissioned thousands of other paintings, posters, general art classes, etc, including post office murals.All wrapped into one, it is undoubtedly the largest public art project in the US. The most recent politicization of the post office has brought renewed focus to the ways the postal service is crucial to everyday life. Perhaps an unexpected consequence, scaling back hours and funding will also put this unparalleled collection of public art at risk.• Justin Hamel is a documentary and editorial photographer in El Paso, Texas, working at the intersections of climate, labor and migration."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8829c9aaceee8d7d6c89ad59f8993f368775fa8f/0_198_3543_2127/master/3543.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d12c27d0ee1dbfff0a5410a1215374c8","title":"the big picture a tender family moment with jfk","story":"A candid shot of the young senator by Life magazine’s Ed Clark portrayed him as a man to lead a new generation into a new decadeEd Clark, a Life magazine staff photographer, was commissioned to photograph the Kennedy family at home in Georgetown in 1958. JFK was campaigning to be elected to a second term as Massachusetts’s senator and, if successful, there were strong rumours that he would make a run for the presidency in 1960. After several days taking pictures of husband and wife, Clark asked over lunch at the house if he could get a picture of the senator with his baby daughter, Caroline. “Jackie said no,” he recalled, “that she was upstairs asleep. But Jack bounded up the stairs, and I followed.”Clark took a spontaneous roll of film up in the nursery. It included this picture capturing the moment Caroline woke up, wide-eyed with delight to see her father. The nation was starting to share that excitement. Clark’s cover story for Life did much to advance the growing conviction that Kennedy was a leader for a new generation and a new decade. Up until that moment, presidents were far more likely to be grandparents than new dads, and family photographs were largely awkwardly staged compositions.Clark, who was based in Tennessee, had made his name in the aftermath of war, photographing the Nuremberg trials, and the bombed-out ruins of Germany and France. In 1962, aged only 51 and at the height of his powers, he was forced to give up his career at Life because of failing eyesight. A new surgical procedure partly restored his vision in 1980 and he returned to photography for the remaining 20 years of his life. The picture of Caroline Kennedy in her crib is included in a new book taken from the photographer’s personal archive. When he became president, JFK hung Clark’s picture in pride of place in the Oval Office Jackie purchased 75 prints.

I mean, it was always a bit surprising, but a massive economic downturn coupled with millions of people suffering olfactory shutdown might hit sales, you’d think. But then maybe people are buying them to check they haven’t got the coronavirus?After all, smell is the sense that it’s easiest to be unaware of losing. It’s not like going blind, which people tend to notice almost immediately. The same goes for sudden hearing loss – even in a library, it would be obvious. But, thanks to the general hygiene standards that obtained even pre-lockdown, we’re quite often in situations that don’t smell of much. No one wants to self-isolate for no reason, so perhaps lighting a candle and hoping for a reassuring gush of lavender or sandalwood is the solution favoured by those too proud to push out a fart.This sounds like an admirable scheme and the descriptions of the candles on the website are great: “The Local”, which “evokes the classic British boozer” and “lingers like the melancholy ramblings of an old inebriate” “The Cinema” which boasts “salt popcorn”, “a fug of recirculated air” and “just the faintest whisper of third base in the back row” and “The Festival” which features “sun-warmed cider”, “dew-damp sleeping bag” and “the merest shimmer of distant Portaloo”.This made me laugh but left me concerned that the candles’ smell might also be funny. It’s well known that scents are unsettlingly evocative, and great bursts of nostalgia can be caused in the brain merely by walking into a room where someone has used the same floor cleaner as your primary school, or the bar at college, or that holiday rental in Brittany. The smell of good times can certainly bring them powerfully to mind, but is that really what you want in your living room if the thing that was good about the times wasn’t really the smell?After all, the smell doesn’t actually bring the times back. It reminds you of them, but also that they’re gone. So is that soothing or just upsetting? Is nostalgia nice? That’s the question it comes down to. “It depends” is probably the answer – it’s the answer to most deep questions, in my experience. Nostalgia is certainly not always nice – you only want so much of it, I reckon, or you become crushed by the unbearable poignancy of the passage of time. So is it helpful to have smelly candles generating more of it? Isn’t enough of it naturally occurring? And shouldn’t candles stick to just smelling unemotionally pleasant rather than probably a bit manky but in a way that makes you want to cry?Maybe these candles do basically just smell nice and the descriptions are mainly a joke, or the sort of extreme inference that a professional smeller might make about aspects of a relatively normal perfume, like wine tasters do when they talk about burnt tyres or earth or berries when the word they’re looking for is “wine”. I doubt it though. Paul Firmin, co-founder of Earl of East, is very scathing about conventional scented candles using wacky names, saying of the candle “This Smells Like My Vagina” from Gwyneth Paltrow’s range: “That was just a marketing ploy – the scent is like a floral scent! If we were creating the scent of a local it has to smell like a pub or what’s the point?”There does seem to be a bit of a trend for candles that smell of aspects of life rather than perfume. The retailer Loaf offers a selection including “Summer Holiday”, “Pencil Sharpenings” and “Granny’s Garden” (which sounds like it belongs in Gwyneth Paltrow’s range) and “perfume publisher” Frédéric Malle’s website offers “Chez Monsieur” – “Monsieur emerges from the shadows of the library, smoking in his armchair and reading the paper” (that does sound whiffy) – and “Notre Dame”, which “recreates the atmosphere of evening mass in a Parisian church”. Using decorative fire to evoke a building so nearly destroyed by it.I’m suspicious of candles for that reason: the fire. It makes me nervous and I’m always keen to blow them out, which makes a nicer smell than any scented candle, in my view. Maybe Earl of East could make a scented candle that smelt like an extinguished candle when it was still burning? That would confuse me.How baffled they’d be to learn that, while science granted humankind the miracle of flame-free heat and light, everyone still lights loads of candles anyway. We put them on thousands of restaurant tables, we light them to make a nice smell, we turn off radiators and put firelighters under dry logs just for the picturesque crackle, we arrange tea lights round our baths, we barbecue for fun. We may wash our hands regularly, wear masks in shops and maintain a 2m distance where possible, but we literally play with fire."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26e7af271e89c3d34b77b9bb2da4943f9a285b97/757_209_3565_2139/master/3565.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=6b5c5e1be7add12957d4d3b57b715e35","title":"teachers and parents across the uk share your thoughts on the reopening of schools","story":"We’d like to hear from people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland about returning to schools, and those in Scotland about how it has beenWith just weeks to go until children return to school in England and Wales, and less than a week until the first cohort of students in Northern Ireland return for the start of the new academic year, protective measures in schools remain fiercely contested.Many teachers have criticised the government’s ‘bubble’ group scheme and social distancing measures, while some unions have called for teachers to be able to choose to use face coverings, against government advice.

But when results were unveiled, there was shock and anger at what looked like clear injustices After all end-of-year exams were scrapped, students in England with offers of university places were awaiting their A-level results with more trepidation than usual. Rather than being judged by their exam performance, their grades had been assigned by a computer model that took into account their previous achievements and that of their school.  As Laura McInerney tells Mythili Rao, while at first glance the results last week looked in line with a normal school year, glaring anomalies and what looked to be huge injustices emerged. As pressure built on the government to explain itself, ministers went silent before the education secretary emerged on Monday to announce a major U-turn.  Students who had been downgraded could now use the grades their schools had predicted. But as university places fill up, some are finding it is too little too late.

The four-day event is free but virtual visitors are urged to help families struggling to afford to eat and relying on food banks by making a donation to its charity partner, the food redistribution charity FareShare.Hosting the so-called Love Canned Food festival is Michelin-starred TV chef Phil Vickery, who, in a live cook-along session, will be rustling up a five-bean (canned, of course) dal.“My parents grew up in the war years and, as a treat, my grandma used to serve up canned salmon with pickled onions – apparently the height of sophistication,” he said. “Today, I like to use tinned vegetables such as spinach, potatoes and chickpeas to make a quick and tasty curry, while a rice pilaf made with canned pork is also a favourite.”Also beamed in live from his kitchen will be budget chef Miguel Barclay – he claims to be able to create a gourmet meal for £1 – who believes “quick and easy recipes with a twist” are central to the longer-term revival of tinned foods. “I am a big fan of corned beef,” he says, “but for a long time it has been relegated to the bottom supermarket shelf. It’s becoming a lot cooler now, and one of my favourite recipes is a shakshuka-style Mexican corned-beef hash, which is finished off with little fried eggs and fresh herbs. It taps into the whole ‘yolk porn’ trend on social media.”On the eve of the return of schools, another cookalong will feature blogger Emily Leary (A Mummy Too) and Adam Shaw (At Dad’s Table) to share tips for lunchboxes and family meals.Nick Saltmarsh, managing director of Hodmedod, a Suffolk-based pioneer of British-grown pulses and grains – both dried and canned – said: “We’ve long thought that cans are underappreciated as a way of preserving cooked food, not least because the cans themselves are very easy and efficient to recycle.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e83434dce533d0be796cc88f14e6093717360b7e/0_1831_5508_3303/master/5508.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=8733aa830d2b024ec8af0e3cb0e91f7d","title":"patrice evra silence is a you cant be in silence any more","story":"Former France and Manchester United defender on dressing up as a panda to combat racism and his admiration for Alex Ferguson “Sometimes I don’t want to talk about all these things because, inside, I’m crying,” Patrice Evra says as we sit on his favourite bench in London. The former Manchester United defender shields his eyes on the hottest day of the summer as we look over the Thames in a discreet corner of Battersea. Evra has led me to his secret bench because we can talk here for more than two hours about his complex life.Evra is well-known for his Instagram videos in which he shouts “I love this game” while singing along to Marvin Gaye, with or without Paul Pogba, or wearing a Panda costume as his gleeful way of undercutting racism. “I want to spread that positive message,” he says while acknowledging his own “dark energy”. After being racially abused he kicked one of his club’s fans at Marseille in 2017. Evra was also insulted in racial terms by Luis Suárez in 2011. He played in four Champions League finals and was one of Alex Ferguson’s favourite players in five Premier League-winning campaigns.But so much has happened in a strange and difficult year that Evra asked to do this interview. He often makes me laugh but, now, he is sombre. He remembers how, as one of 24 children in his family, he had to beg and steal on the streets of Paris. The 39-year-old also recalls how the prejudice that tested him during his career continues today. “Silence is a crime,” Evra says. “You can’t be in silence any more.”Evra grew up in Les Ulis, a gritty commune in Paris where his feisty spark was forged. He is now fluent in six languages but his early opportunities were limited. “The first time I learn about people of colour at school it was to do with slavery. In France you talk about the revolution and Napoleon. But when you talk about people with coloured skin it’s slavery. Even now I’ve got friends who say: ‘Patrice, we love you. But it will be difficult if my daughter or son is with a coloured guy or woman because my grandparents won’t accept it.’ But those people have to be strong like I’ve been strong all my life.“I know it’s not easy. One of my brothers is called Mamadou. When he calls for a job, as soon as he says Mamadou they hang up. He changed his name to Claude and got some jobs. But it’s not enough to say no to racism. Let’s educate people.”Evra points to a raggedy pigeon drifting across the grey river. “I like this so much,” he says. “Sitting here, talking like this, looking at the pigeons.” This is Evra’s engaging way. He grips my arm or whoops whenever something thrills him.“When I went to Sicily I was 17,” he says, remembering his first professional club, Marsala, in Serie C, in 1998. “A kid and his dad keep looking at me. They come close and the dad said: ‘Can I have a picture?’ I think: ‘Wow. I’m already famous.’ The kid start to touch my skin. His dad says: ‘But why didn’t you wash your body?’”Was it the first time they saw a black person in Sicily? “Exactly. I was not angry as they were not educated. My teammates were the same. They welcomed me but they ask: ‘Do you know how to use your phone?’ I call this ignorance so I wasn’t sad. I loved Sicily and the people.

When I do the message against racism I dress up in a panda costume because I want to educate the kids. The panda bear is black, white and chubby. I want kids to be like that panda. Be cool, be funny but respect everyone.”Did Salvioni find out? “No,” Evra exclaims. “I ran the other way. A year later I started playing left-wing. Then the left-back is injured in a game. Salvioni say: ‘Patrice, go left-back.’ I play an amazing game and we won 2–1. The next game he said: ‘Patrice, left-back.’ I said: ‘No. I’m not a left-back.’ He said: ‘OK, someone else play.’ I decided to try. Salvioni said: ‘You’re going to become the best left-back in the world because you hate that position.’”“The new generation are softer than we used to be. I give you an example. At half-time we’re beating Tottenham 2-0. Everyone’s saying: ‘Patrice, you’re playing amazing.’ The worst is when Ferguson stays quiet. He was quiet that day for five minutes. He looks straight in my eyes. ‘Patrice, do you think you’re playing good?’ I say: ‘Yeah.’ Ferguson says: ‘I saw you pass the ball back to Van der Saar.’“‘Yes, boss, but just one.’ He said: ‘If you pass the ball back again I take you off because this is one of your worst games.’“My eyes start burning because I don’t like the injustice. We won 4-0 and the next day I go to Ferguson’s office. ‘Hello, son, what’s the problem?’ ‘Boss, the problem is yesterday.’ Ferguson says: ‘Patrice, some players were disrespecting the opposition. I wanted everyone focused. I picked you to give them the message because you’re strong.’”When the manager wanted to rest him against Stoke, Evra told Ferguson: “I will rest when I die. I’m playing this game.” Ferguson replied: “Sorry, I’ve already picked the team.” Evra remained adamant that only he could outjump Peter Crouch in the Stoke attack. “He didn’t say anything,” Evra says of Ferguson. “The day of the game he put the team up and I was starting. I played a great game. Afterwards he shakes my hand and say: ‘Patrice, you’ve got balls.’“We are still so close now. I speak to the boss three times a month and his nephews love my videos. One day he texted me: ‘Patrice, I love that video.’ I say: ‘Boss, one day you give me the hairdryer, now you’re laughing about my videos.’”Before the Champions League final in 2008, when United beat Chelsea, Ferguson “gave the best speech ever. He didn’t talk football. He said: ‘Imagine Patrice with his 24 brothers and sisters. His parents have to feed them all on a bad street.’ He talked about Rooney growing up in a tough part of Liverpool. Carlos Tevez coming from Argentina. He talked about difficulties for other players. He then said: ‘This is my victory. We have already won the Champions League. Enjoy the game.’ Even now I’m having goosebumps.“When Ferguson left, United lost their DNA, their philosophy. He was inspiring so much respect, so much fear, and if any player starts thinking he is bigger than the team then he destroyed you. The players always wanted to play for Ferguson. I tried my best for David Moyes but I knew it would be a disaster because players won’t respect him like that. It was a mission impossible.”Evra’s former wife, Sandra, wanted to leave Manchester and he agreed to accept an offer from Juventus in 2014 – only to decide he might stay once he heard that Antonio Conte, who wanted to entice him to Turin, would become Italy’s manager. Ed Woodward, United’s executive vice-chairman, triggered an option to extend Evra’s contract for a year.A year later, in June 2015, Evra played for Juventus in the Champions League final. “My ex-wife said: ‘See? Manchester are nearly in the Championship and you’re in this final.’ I love Juventus but I said: ‘Even if they’re in the Championship, I prefer to be at United. Nothing can replace my love for them.’”“United can’t challenge Liverpool or Man City. Not yet. There’s been massive damage but we’re moving in the right direction. When they wanted to sign Bruno Fernandes, Ole texted me. I asked for advice from Cristiano Ronaldo. Cristiano says: ‘Bruno’s a good guy and very professional.’ I say: ‘Ole, I’ve spoken with Cristiano. Let’s go for it.’ And Fernandes had a massive impact. Without him I don’t think we would have qualified for the Champions League.”Pogba has seemed more settled recently but he is often a controversial figure. “Paul’s really misunderstood. People talk more about his hairstyle but he’s a great kid, a shy boy actually. It was important for Fernandes to relieve that attention on Paul. It wasn’t fair. Paul is a happy person and we have been close so long. He Facetimed me yesterday at 11.30pm. I said: ‘Paul, I’m in bed. Let me sleep.’”It feels like a new start for Evra now he is separated from his wife. “We were together 25 years and have two children. But after some difficult times we were no longer sharing the same roof. We would only meet around family moments. It’s never nice to orce but I have a new love and positive energy with Margaux.”Margaux, his fiancee, is a Danish model whom Evra takes me to meet at their apartment. She is warm and friendly and Evra says: “She makes me softer. She controls my fire, that dark energy. I am tranquil now.”When Jamie Carragher apologised to him recently for Liverpool’s actions, Evra was “so surprised but grateful. I also received a letter from Liverpool’s owner apologising. People were trying to distract me and say: ‘This happened nine years ago. They’re taking the piss.’ But it’s better late than never. I forgive and have more respect for Liverpool.”The abuse he suffered from one of his club’s fans at Marseille, and Evra’s violent reaction, was more upsetting. “He said I am a monkey and he was threatening to cut my throat, and the throats of my kids. I reacted because I’m human. I have since done a lot of meditation and it helps.”He is keen to deny accusations of sexism when he applauded, in a seemingly patronising way, the well-researched punditry of Eni Aluko during the 2018 World Cup. “When someone is good, I clap. She was very good and knows football. It was unfair to say I was patronising because I know the strength of women. My mum had 13 kids and educated every single one. Even when she lost her leg she became stronger. My mum is my hero. So I want to do so much to promote women in football. I also feel very strongly about the rights of gay people and want to support them in football and life.”Evra is “involved in many projects from my foundation to two orphanages in Senegal. But a Premier League team contacted my agent to see if I will play again. They saw how fit I am in my videos.”Evra insists on driving me from Battersea to Clapham Junction. Sunshine streams across an afternoon framed by the world’s current uncertainty and I wonder if Evra, who has fire and ice within him, could fulfil Ferguson’s prediction? “I sacrificed my life a lot being a footballer. A manager makes a double sacrifice. Right now I want to make people laugh and think.”It feels like a happy and reflective pause for the man who kicked out against racism, won many titles in different countries, played 81 times for France, bonded with Ferguson, crooned What’s Going On to Marvin Gaye and impersonated a panda. From Les Ulis to Battersea, it’s been an incredible journey. The next step, for Patrice Evra, could be just as interesting."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/db26817697e5785ad8b8986b83b06799ab3978cc/226_471_5015_3009/master/5015.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a9ed8dab0956e13f496cb7a5507b56a6","title":"scrapping two legged ties could be future of champions league says uefa","story":"Uefa president Aleksander Ceferin says the single-game knockout format, used in the Champions League this year from the quarter-final onwards, has produced more exciting football than the usual two-legged games and could be revisited in the future.The format was changed in order to allow the competition to be completed in a shorter time- after the Covid-19 pandemic halted play for several months across Europe in March. Eight clubs headed to Lisbon and the final will be contested later on Sunday, pitting Bayern Munich against PSG.“We were forced to do it but in the end we see that we found out something new.

Argentina led Belgium 1-0 in their 2014 World Cup quarter‑final. They were in control, playing well. The forward line, as usual, felt a mismatch of extremely talented but not particularly complementary players, but with a solid and well-balanced midfield, it didn’t really seem to matter. Then Ángel Di María pulled his hamstring.Di María had a vital role in Alejandro Sabella’s side. Javier Mascherano mopped up in front of the back four. Lucas Biglia scuttled around alongside him. And to the left of the three Di María shuttled to the forward line, the vital link between two otherwise disparate units. His role wasn’t glamorous. He was easily overlooked. But once he was gone, his importance became obvious. Enzo Pérez, a far more defensive presence, replaced him. Argentina won the game and went on to reach the final, but in the five hours of football they played at that World Cup after Di María’s injury, they didn’t score another goal.In football’s modern world of glitz and glamour, when it feels as though the super-clubs prefer to sign celebrities rather than submit to the rigours of following a coherent tactical plan, there is an irony in Di María finally beginning to be appreciated at the club that, for so long, was the market leader in placing star quality over structure – and the reverse of that is also true: Di María’s increasing prominence is evidence of PSG’s growing maturity. If they are to win the Champions League, it will almost certainly require Di María to keep Joshua Kimmich quiet and to exploit Bayern Munich’s aggressively high line.For years, it seems, Di María has been underappreciated. Perhaps it’s because he doesn’t look much like a footballer (although he does, from certain angles, bear a striking resemblance to Franz Kafka). He does not have the eye-catching footwork or goals return of many of his teammates. But he does have a remarkable capacity to link one line of a team to another, starting either as a forward or in midfield, and functioning as a bridge from one to the other.In Tuesday’s 3-0 semi-final victory over RB Leipzig, he set up two goals with impeccable crosses and scored the other. But more than that was what he ensured didn’t happen. Against Atalanta, when he had been suspended, a gulf had opened between the front three and the other seven outfielders. Against RB Leipzig, PSG pressed more and the team was far more compact.But this wasn’t even the first Champions League semi-final Di María has dominated. In the second leg in 2014, it was, as much as anything else, his countering ability, his intuition of when to carry the ball and when to offload it, that allowed Real Madrid to unpick Bayern as they won 4-0 at the Allianz.He was the Uefa man of the match in the victory over Atlético in the final as well. Di María had made decisive contributions to the last two games as Madrid clinched la décima, and yet that summer he left. The club has always claimed it was because of the excessive demands of his agent – but that agent is Jorge Mendes, which made Di María’s continued presence at Madrid problematic after the departure the previous summer of José Mourinho, who had lobbied hard for his signing in 2010. Before the final, Madrid asked him not to risk his hamstring as they wanted to sell him to make way for the more obviously marketable James Rodríguez, who bears no resemblance to any gloomy Bohemian modernist.So, having few options, Di María ended up at Manchester United, where he had never really wanted to go. The tendency is to remember Di María’s loss of form and the acrimony that surrounded his departure. But he started the season well and, in 20 league starts, registered three goals and a remarkable 10 assists. The downturn was perhaps in part caused by his frustration at the restrictions placed on him by Louis van Gaal, followed by a break-in at his home that left him fearing for the safety of his family. Di María is naturally introspective and that, combined with struggles with the language, contributed to a general loss of confidence and morale.With Argentina, the situation is more complicated. Di María has won more than 100 caps, some achievement given the wealth of attacking options available to them, but he has undoubtedly been tainted by the years of failure, and the strangely stodgy football a concatenation of brilliant attacking talent habitually produces. There’s no obvious reason that the front three of Lionel Messi, Sergio Agüero and Di María that won Olympic gold in 2008 shouldn’t have brought similar success in the senior game, but it never quite has.While manager after manager has seen Di María and his versatility as part of the solution, there’s a constituency of fans and journalists who have begun to wonder if he’s actually part of the problem. And perhaps he is, but it’s also the case that his unflashy style makes it harder instantly to recall a goal or a run or a pass that could be entered as evidence for the defence.And so to France, where PSG’s resources so dwarf everybody else’s that statistics become so distorted as to be meaningless. Di María’s goals return has shot up from one every seven games in the rest of his career to one in every three – but so it should. But far more significant is his less conspicuous contribution.Di María is one of the very few to have played with Messi, Cristiano Ronaldo and Neymar. He has thrived with each of them. He is unselfish, makes covering runs, creates space and compensates for their sporadic approach to pressing. It is easy to see why coaches, other than Van Gaal, appreciate an industrious player who naturally balances a side. Then, every now and again, he has a game like he did against Leipzig, and offers a reminder that he’s also an exceptional talent in his own right. To borrow from John Milton, they also serve, who only run about lots in tactically intelligent and selfless patterns."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/346342873e48e84d0c1e5e7ed864100c0224866a/0_8_3222_1933/master/3222.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8181d25cf3421e9845f7dd2b4362573c","title":"psg face their moment knowing they have already won the cynical long game","story":"Whatever happens in the Champions League final, the 10-year plan of the French club’s super-rich Qatari owners has paid off“Football is not for sale,” Aleksander Ceferin pronounced, famously, at a Uefa conference two years ago, in the process exploring the depth, width and delicate inner workings of just how wrong one earnest-looking man at a podium can be.Cut back to the real world. In the current, rather improbable timeline, Uefa is preparing to stage a biosecure Champions League final with no other purpose than the effective retailing of TV rights.As the season narrows to its end in Lisbon there is also a fair chance Ceferin will be required to present club football’s grandest trophy to the representatives of Paris Saint-Germain, a club for whom happiness is a £400m attacking duo, a platoon of loophole-savvy lawyers, and a vast sovereign wealth fund geared entirely towards inflationary on-field success. You’re right, Alex old chap. Football isn’t for sale. It’s already been bought. And no, we won’t be needing a receipt.Sunday night’s Champions League final has been billed as many things. Old, respectable money versus new, insurgent, unpalatable money. Bayern’s high-grade collectivism versus a bolt-on but increasingly compelling PSG attack.Either way, Paris Saint-Germain as European champions is an extraordinary prospect on many levels, a possibility fraught with some very obvious black holes, dead ends and brain-frazzling mental gymnastics.Questions like: how can something as contrived, as fundamentally inane as a nation-state propaganda machine, translate into such an engrossing on-field presence? How exactly has Neymar, disdained as a gadfly and choker, accused of wasting his talent in the lukewarm air of Ligue 1, emerged as the most effective attacking player of this midsummer mini-tournament? And is there really any difference between Bayern’s entrenched economic privilege and an expertly enacted plot to buy a little global influence, a little visibility, a little insurance against the backdrop of a gulf region cold war?There are some obvious answers to this. PSG may have a wonderful attacking unit, boisterous home support and an increasingly successful business plan. There may be an epidemic of moral failings elsewhere in Big Football. This is an industry where, let’s face it, nobody is ever really clean. But the fact remains the PSG project is something new and, at its heart, deeply cynical.The entire success of this model has relied on loophole-wangling and accounting tricks. PSG’s transfer activity has distorted the market, normalising obscene expenditure. Above all, the world’s most uplifting form of public entertainment has been used as a nakedly political tool by a morally questionable state governed by a super-rich inherited monarchy.It may seem joyless to state these things so baldly on the verge of the club’s greatest game. But sport plays tricks. It garlands its winners with righteousness. It covers the cracks and the holes with the beauty of the spectacle. Never mind the splendour of the show. The fact remains that this model of football – soft-power tool, spendthrift glory, plaything of the overclass – is a shortcut to another world entirely.At which point, it is worth remembering how we got here. In November it will be exactly 10 years since the world’s richest per capita nation launched its pincer assault on world football via Paris and Zurich. The lunch meeting hosted by Nicolas Sarkozy at the Élysée Palace, the French president’s official residence, on 23 November 2010 has become a kind of dark legend in the years since. Also present at the Élysée were Michel Platini, the owners of flat-broke middleweights PSG, and Qatar’s Crown Prince Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani, an alumnus of both Sandhurst and Harrow.Ten days after this apparently innocent summit meeting, Qatar stunned the world by winning the vote to host the 2022 World Cup. They were aided by Platini unexpectedly switching his vote to the tiny desert state with the superheated summer climate. Shortly after that same lunch, Qatar’s bid to buy PSG was approved by the French government. A TV rights deal with the newly created Qatari channel BeIn Sports would follow, helping the entire French league avoid a slide into financial peril.Neymar remains the most significant element in all of this, a figure around whom so many of these contradictions coalesce. Has there ever been a more isive, more personally reviled high-end attacking footballer? Neymar remains, along with Kylian Mbappé, the heart of this entire enterprise: not just as a visible, and indeed literal ambassador for Qatar’s grand plan, but also as the key on-field presence.Mbappé calls his No 10 “the best passer in the world”. Despite the crowing of the English commentary team over a rusty couple of games, Neymar is also a relentless goals and assists machine. From the start of this mini summer knockout the discussion in the Paris dressing room has been about his will to power, his absolute conviction that this will be PSG’s year. We should, as they say, all be such a choker.At the same time Neymar’s transfer remains a deeply dubious episode, a living rebuke to the entire project. The decision to sign him was made as Qatar was being blockaded by its neighbours. This was an act of overt political flag-waving, at a time when Qatar was also cutting huge trade deals with various western powers.Witness also the sheer devastating arrogance of paying twice the existing world record fee, or the fiddling with the edges of the deal to avoid any problems with regulations.Or the “loan” arrangement that allowed Mbappé to arrive the same summer – all prima facie evidence of Qatar’s willingness to stomp right across the delicate micro-climate of football finances to secure their PR coup, their Bank of Qatar ambassador, their social media mouthpiece to the world.And yet, it has also worked. There is every chance Neymar will have the craft and the drive to bring that 10-year project to its logical end on Sunday night.For now Bayern Munich remain favourites. The speed, power and clarity of their game of sprints has looked irresistible at times. They have an imperious, classical No 9. They have that reassuring Red Train air of certainty.They have Thomas Müller, socks rolled down, floating into those familiar awkward, gangly spaces. So far, so much the same as it ever was. In many ways a Bayern win would represent a kind of safe place for European football in this season without maps.No doubt there are plenty looking on, including within Uefa, who would prefer such an outcome. In reality that 10-year plan has pretty much come to fruition whatever the result at the Estádio da Luz. The real goal was always visibility, engagement, a political presence, a manipulation of the spectacle. From that perspective PSG’s owners have in effect already won."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/63866dec705d978cea8460590ace50658276aed1/0_28_2700_1620/master/2700.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=1f2fd90c23d1fc3665812624c2c07196","title":"living in the uk are you planning to move out of a city or urban area","story":"We would like to hear from people who are moving to smaller towns or more rural areas and what their reasons areAre you planning on moving out of a city?Some have noticed an increase in people wanting to move out of cities amid an increase in home working and a desire for more outside space.Whether you are buying or renting, if you are moving out of a city centre to a more suburban or rural area, we would like to hear from you.

But biologist Merlin Sheldrake is on a mission to change thatAs a boy, Merlin Sheldrake really loved the autumn. In the garden of his parents’ house – he grew up a few moments from Hampstead Heath, which is where he and I are walking right now, on an overcast summer morning – the leaves would fall from a big chestnut tree, forming gentle drifts into which he liked nothing more than to hurl himself. Wriggling around until he was fully submerged, Sheldrake would lie there, quite content, “buried in the rustle, lost in curious smells”. As he writes in his wondrous new book, Entangled Life, these autumnal piles were both places to hide and worlds to explore.But as the months passed, they shrank: reaching into them, trying to find out why, he would pull out matter that looked more like soil than leaves. What was going on? Turning to his father for an answer (he is the son of Rupert Sheldrake, the controversial science writer best known for proposing the concept of “morphic resonance”) was how he first came to learn about decomposition, and thus it is to these rotting leaves that we may trace his original interest in the “neglected megascience” of mycology – the study of fungi – even if neglect is a relative term. “In east Asia, fungi have been loved and revered for thousands of years,” he says. “In China, there are temples to the man who worked out how to cultivate shiitake mushrooms. But yes, in the west it has been neglected.”There are, he thinks, two reasons for this. The first is straightforward: only recently have technologies been available that allow scientists fully to investigate the fungal world to open up the hidden realms that lie beneath us, invisible to the eye. The second is historical. “There is an entrenched disciplinary bias,” he says. “Fungi weren’t seen as their own kingdom of life until the 60s. Mycologists were put in a corner of the plant sciences department, rather than in their own fungal sciences department. This had a huge impact – if you’re not training researchers, it will be neglected.” Outside science, many people, if not most, associate fungi only with mushrooms. “And they are ephemeral,” he says. “It’s as if we could only see the flowers and fruit of a tree, and not the rest of it: its leaves, stems and roots.” He shakes his curls. “Fungal taxonomy has been a total mess for ages. Linnaeus described it as chaos, a scandal of art. Through the middle ages and into the 18th century, people had no grasp at all of it. They thought mushrooms came up where lightning struck – that you could tell which one was going to kill you by boiling it with a wooden spoon.”Even now, the non-mycologist often experiences a strange ambivalence when it comes to fungi, one that can encompass both disgust and fear, and a powerful attraction there’s a reason why Raymond Briggs called his smelliest character Fungus the Bogeyman. In Entangled Life, Sheldrake describes the horror stirred in Gwen Raverat’s Aunt Etty by the pungent and suggestively shaped stinkhorn mushroom, Phallus impudicus (Raverat, the engraver and memoirist, was the granddaughter of Charles Darwin). Etty would, Raverat recalled in 1952, “sniff her way” through her local wood, armed with a special stick with which she used to poke the stinkhorns into her basket. She would then take them home and burn them “in deepest secrecy on the drawing room fire with the door locked – because of the morals of the maids”. As Sheldrake notes, her exploits would have spread the stinkhorns’ spores far more effectively than any number of the flies that, attracted by their stench, usually do this work.But Entangled Life, which arrives garlanded with praise from nature writers Robert Macfarlane and Helen Macdonald, is an astonishing book that could alter our perceptions of fungi for ever.It seems somehow to tip the natural world upside down. The science it relates is complex. For his work on underground fungal networks in Panamanian forests, Sheldrake received a PhD in tropical ecology from Cambridge University. His principal interest is in mycorrhizal fungi, which are the kind that live in symbiosis with plants. Such fungi send out gossamer-fine tubes called hyphae, which weave into the tips of plant roots at cellular level in this way, inidual plants are joined to one another by an underground network – a vast, highly intricate, collaborative structure that has been dubbed the Wood Wide Web. But he also has a gift for making difficult ideas easily comprehensible. His enthusiasm for mycology is not only passionate it’s grounded in his conviction that, in the future, fungi will play an ever more crucial role in our understanding of the environment, in a range of new technologies from building materials to sustainable food, packaging products to alternative “leather”, and in our relationship with waste.Hyphae make mycelium, the mass of branching that comprises the vegetative part of a fungus. But they also make more specialised structures, such as mushrooms – organs that can perform astonishing feats. When some explosively discharge their spores, they accelerate 10,000 times faster than a space shuttle after launch. Others can push their way through asphalt and lift paving stones. One study estimated that if a single hypha was as wide as a human hand, it would be able to lift an 8 tonne bus. If you teased apart the mycelium found in a gram of soil and laid it end to end, it could stretch anywhere from 100 metres to 10 kilometres.For some time now, Sheldrake and I have been sitting on a bench, close to some trees – a spot that, as dog walkers pass by, invites the question of how the public should best behave towards the fungal realm. “We need to stop spraying fungicide,” he says. “A few strokes of a pen could make that illegal. But for our own part? Well, there are citizen scientists who report on the presence of mushrooms at certain times of year, and show how they’re responding to climate change. That’s a good thing to do. Fungal conservation is in its infancy. In 2018, just 56 species were on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red list, compared to tens of thousands of plants and animals. Beyond that, if you’re picking mushrooms, don’t take them all: leave some behind, and try not to damage the networks by digging around in the ground.”There are plenty of ways we might connect with fungi, not least by eating them. As he worked on Entangled Life, Sheldrake ate mushrooms every day: “It was a way of reminding myself that I was talking about living things that I’m part of the metabolic cycles I was writing about.” Once he was in possession of a physical copy of the book, he then grew some mushrooms on it. “They were delicious,” he wrote, when he posted a film of himself cooking them on his Twitter account. “I couldn’t taste any off-notes, which suggests that the fungus has fully metabolised the text.” He particularly likes lion’s mane mushrooms, which taste a little like lobster or crab. He and his brother, Cosmo, are also into fermentation, and have a small lab in their parents’ garden, where they make sauerkraut, kimchee, pickles and beetroot kvass (an eastern European drink usually made from fermented rye bread). “It’s very life-giving,” he says.Sheldrake isn’t currently affiliated with any institution. “I’ve got lots of scientific papers to publish,” he says, before we begin walking to the station. “And there are so many experiments to be done. I need some funding. But I’m reluctant to re-enter the academic world, that constant round of applying for grants.” Might he start his own company? “Yes, there’s that, too.” In his book, he writes almost as admiringly of Paul Stamets, a man who may have done more than anyone else to popularise fungal topics outside university departments (Stamets runs a multimillion-dollar fungal business, Fungi Perfecti his TED talk, “Six Ways That Mushrooms Can Save the World”, has been watched millions of times), as he does of Sir David Read, an emeritus professor of plant science at Sheffield University, and the man who, in the 1980s, was the first scientist to show conclusively that carbon could pass between green plants through fungal connections. It seems wholly possible that Sheldrake may indeed remain outside academia that part of his mission in the future may have to do as much with the communication of science as with science itself.Explaining mycology to the lay person isn’t easy. While everyone knows what a bird is, or a tree, the language of the microbial realm is unfamiliar, and its elements largely invisible to the naked eye. But he seems, if not exactly to relish this challenge (he’s not about, I think, to become the new David Bellamy), then to understand the importance of rising to it. Either way, the shores of this far corner of biology seem to suit him. “At university, plant sciences were slightly marginalised,” he says, softly. “But that also meant that you had more space, and I always liked that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5c811799485876f4f36762961030bf7c997c86f6/0_8_5116_3071/master/5116.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6327c29ca07d94954a3fe5772783ed7e","title":"england v pakistan third test day three live","story":"27th over: Pakistan 57-4 (Azhar 20, Fawad 11) In commentary, they’re spending time insulting each other’s appearance, which tells you that things have slowed down in the middle. Azhar, though, turns Woakes around the corner for two then pulls him for one, and I wonder at what point Anderson will return to complete his all-10. “Years ago my mother worked in a bank,” says Alex McGillivray, “and would come home and regale us with stories of all kinds of weird, hilarious names - P. Sample, P. Brain, MT Wallett, Aaron Micock etc, but perhaps the best went like this:‘Good morning, Lloyd’s Bank.’‘Oh hello, my name is Strange.’‘Ok ... what is it?’In fairness, your mum did start it by calling him Lloyd’s Bank. 26th over: Pakistan 56-4 (Azhar 17, Fawad 11) This is an iffy over from Archer, but his fifth ball is good, leaping off a length and addressing Faward in the midriff. “Not enough good ones,” says Warne, and he’s right. Maiden. “When I first came to Turkey in 1987 (before internet and everyone with computers),” says Phil West, “I filled in a form to be in the Istanbul Phone Book – remember those? One small problem, Turkish does not have the letter W - although it did have a place on Turkish typewriters. Now that QWERTY is standard for computer companies this is no longer an issue, but I digress.The new book duly arrived, I turned to the “W” section and low and behold, I was not in it. Eventually I found my entry under VVest P, under the VVashington and above the VVhite.”I wonder what they did with Breaking Bad. 25th over: Pakistan 56-4 (Azhar 17, Fawad 11) Fawad squirts Woakes into the on side for one I’m not sure what shot he was attempting there, but I’m certain it wasn’t the one that he played. A leg bye follows, then a leaping force wide of gully for two, and an edge through slip for three. Fawad is racking them up now! 24th over: Pakistan 49-4 (Azhar 17, Fawad 5) Archer delays taking off his jersey for as long as possible, as you might, then Azhar glances his loosener for four. He responds superbly, with an unexpected yorker – it’s far too good, squaring the batsman French-cricket style and bashing the pad. Archer thinks he’s got him, but his appeal is rejected and there’s no review – rightly so, because the ball was going down. “Way way back at junior school,” says Tony White, “when ink was really ink and wells were topped up by the week’s ink monitor, in the term after Christmas a fellow oik brought a bottle of aftershave into school to dose around as his father had found it unserviceable.It smelled of battery acid. And we were at a loss of how to make use of this enticing element. Until ... someone poured a few drops into an inkwell. Instantly the combination frothed up and out onto the desk. A calm seriousness kicked in, the mess was wiped clean and we waited for the first lesson after break.At a suitably boring period the chemical experiment was repeated :‘Sir, sir, SIR, look’‘Is it poisonous?’‘Crikey!!’‘I feel sick!’‘I think I’m going to faint ..’We milked it.The headmaster was sought, all inkwells were changed, an inquisition held... no culprits. But suspicions.The second attempt was not treated in the same way. Detention times 26 boys.”23rd over: Pakistan 45-4 (Azhar 13, Fawad 5) The lights are on, the sky is grey, some swing bowling, to make the day, as Buddy Holly didn’t sing. And Woakes immediately finds some away movement, before a no ball and a three, caressed square by Azhar, make this the most profitable over of the day so far. Still, though, it’s heartening to see Ollie Pope charging and ing to save the boundary and prevent the lead from dwindling to to a mere 539. “I once went into a Starbucks and gave them my surname,” says John Starbuck. “They didn’t believe me until I showed them ID, then gave me a large size espresso but only charged for a small one.”The nepotism on which Britain was built, right there. It looks like it’ll be Woakes with the ball, England’s third-change opening bowler. There are still 85 overs to be bowled in the day. Tea will be at 3.55pm BST, and we can play till 7.30 pm. “A fair few years ago,” says Damian (with an ‘a’) Clarke, “I booked a hotel in Aberystwyth, and as usual, dictated ‘Clarke with an e’ to the receptionist on the phone. When we got there there was no booking for us, and as the hotel was full, we were forced to seek an alternative. Happily it turned out much nicer, but on arriving home after the holiday, I chased it up with the original. After a while, it was admitted that they had a booked no show, under the name of Clark Withany. My colleagues still call me Mr. Withany.”Lucky you only gave a surname eh? I once went into Starbucks and spelt out my surname. The cup had “James Deltaechobravo” scrawled on the side says James Debens. The cup had ‘James Deltaechobravo’ scrawled on the side.”Amazing, must’ve felt like you were in this photo.“Hi,” begins Paul Ward ominously. “‘What larks’ first appears in chapter 27, in Biddy’s letter to Pip.”Assuming there’s no more weather. The players are taking an early lunch.“Regarding the old tale of a child swinging on a chair and breaking their neck,” says Ben O’Connell, “I can say with some certainty that it is alive and well. Having taught primary and secondary I’ve been guilty of using a version of it many a time however the older students are wise to it now and understand why it’s said. Some go along with the charade, while others see it for the largely ineffective tool that it is.Meanwhile, Jimmy may wear 613 but he’s the 614th player to play Test-match cricket for England. But I do like the poetry of him finishing with a total identical to a shirt number he wore for his whole career (and better than 9 in many ways!)”.I assume Alan Jones is the other one? My exegesis is that we’re all schoolkids even once we’ve left school. “Your York Notes haven’t led you too far astray,” says Adrian Armstrong. “From Chapter 57: ‘Which dear old Pip, old chap,’ said Joe, ‘you and me was ever friends. And when you’re well enough to go out for a ride - what larks!’So in that context, the phrase anticipates future merriment. As in: “‘And when Jofra and Mark are fit enough to bowl together at the Gabba,’ said Joe...”.Magwitch and Compeyson won’t know what’s hit them. Patrice Evra is a footballer, yes, but this isn’t really about football. “On the subject of sarcastic schoolkids (over 21),” says Adam Simpson, “a favourite saying round our way back in the day was, ‘I got this chair from Shackletons, you know’ whenever anyone had to sit on a particularly uncomfortable school chair. It was inspired by this classic TV advert. To give some cricketing context, we were used to experiencing discomfort, this being around the time of the 1989.”Tangentially, is the swinging on a school chair broken-neck epidemic still going? Or was that a purely 80sIt’s extremely grey out there, greyer than John Major’s Spitting Image puppet. “Greetings from Slovakia,” says George Browne. “Where it is also raining. Just so you know.”My mum knew a woman with your surname. She once told someone is was “Browne, with an ‘e’, then received post addressed to “Mrs Brownwitheney.”Pakistan trail England by 542 runs, with six first-innings wickets intact. Seriously. I don’t think this’ll be a long stoppage. During the last one, I took a few minutes to clean my kitchen skylight, which had been vandalised by a passing bird. I wonder what Mrs Harris has in store for me next! It’s going to be one of those days, I’m afraid, but at least we get the amusement of Sturt Broad having the ball taken from him just as he was about to end the Pakistan innings with six lbws in six balls. 22nd over: Pakistan 41-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 5) Archer into the attack – I wonder if his extra pace might force Fawad to go through his movements quicker than he’d like. But he’s not there with his pace quite yet, although Fawad is still mad keen to get down the other end when he lays bat on ball Azhar rightly sends him back. Archer then goes around the wicket to bowl his final delivery, which completes a maiden. “Enjoying the coverage,” says Keith Fisken, “and to build on James’s theme, Anderson has long since passed mine and Tarzan’s favourite Mazda, the 323...”I was always more a fan of the double sport turbo cleansing super-duper nitro producer 8325600. 21st over: Pakistan 41-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 5) Fawad takes another single and then Anderson diddles Azhar like he’s a child on reins, enticing him to play forward then spiriting the ball past the back with late away swing. That was too good. “So glad to read this snippet from Great Expectations!” says Diana Powell. “A favourite saying of mine - what larks.”A favourite saying of a generation of sarcastic schoolkids, I shouldn’t wonder, though I must confess that I joined it with “dear old Pip, dear old chap”. I can’t say for sure, as I only read York Notes, but I don’t think the two lines appear in the book together. Does enjambement exist in prose? 20th over: Pakistan 40-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 4) Broad is desperate for a wicket here, though that’s not saying much he was probably spent nine months in the womb appealing to his placenta. Maiden. “I can’t remember the series but I remember when Stokes suddenly became a world class batsman and it coincided with him having the confidence to face a lot of balls and still be there to cash in later,” emails John Busby Buttler is such a talent. Like Stokes before him it looks like he has gone away and worked hard to develop his defensive technique. This summer he has had the confidence to leave and defend. Hopefully, Buttler can keep building on his batting success this summer and have stellar test career. Credit is due to the England setup which seem to have realisedremembered how to bat to have success in test cricket and given Buttler time to develop as a player.”I think South Africa 2017 was when he started to appreciate just how good he was, but the consistent scoring probably started in the 2019 West Indies tour. 19th over: Pakistan 40-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 4) Fawad turns Anderson off his pads for two, Woakes chasing about the boundary to keep Pakistan to two. “The heavens just opened here in Stubbington, about five miles south-east of the Rose Bowl,” says Brad McMillan. “Only for a few minutes mind, so the groundsmen will do well to get the covers on before the shower stops ... if it hits at all, given the prevailing wind is from the south west, and the weather is often erted by the Isle of Wight.Anyway, this is my first (and probably last) attempt at being an actual weather forecaster, so from now I’ll concentrate on watching Jimmy end this innings on 597, with Broad and Archer sharing the next six wickets between them.”18th over: Pakistan 38-4 (Azhar 10, Fawad 2) Broad is working himself into his spell. Azhar shoves his first ball for two towards cover and Broad charges in in response, almost inciting an edge, but Azhar keeps his bat to himself, just about. “When Jimmy gets to 606,” says Ian Forth, “I would love it if he ran to the camera and pulled up his shirt to reveal a tee showing a smiling David Mellor with a pair of BBC headphones on.”Mellor, goodness me. What a carry-on that was. 17th over: Pakistan 36-4 (Azhar 8, Fawad 2) Azhar bumps Anderson to mid off and they run one. This is a huge innings for him because ultimately the most important aspect of captaincy is leading from the front and he’s not done much of that lately. Lunch, by the way, is now at 1.30pm BST. 16th over: Pakistan 35-4 (Azhar 7, Fawad 2) Broad persuades Fawad to edge, but the ball drops short of Sibley Dom Dom at three. The cordon is stood pretty close, though, so recriminations are disappointingly absent and a single apiece follows. “Sir Jimmy seems to favour the same shade (Oilslick Tortoiseshell) as Sir Paul McCartney,” says James Debens, “who spends a pretty penny getting his coiffure colorised on the Sussex coast. It’s the most popular hair dye after Bono’s Blue-Black Quink edition.”Quink, now that takes me back – most specifically to the ploy of puncturing that little rubber bag inside Parker pens, or the plastic cartridges, with a compass, so that they leaked inside the owner’s pencil case. What larks, dear old Pip, dear old chap, 15th over: Pakistan 33-4 (Azhar 6, Fawad 1) A quiet over, just one run from it, to Fawad, knocked towards cover. At first glance, his stance looks perfect for an outswinger, but by the time he actually plays the ball he’s in a fairly normal position. No, Stuart, it did not straighten, and was missing the wickets. 14th over: Pakistan 32-4 (Azhar 6, Fawad 0) Broad takes the ball looking to hold down an end, so that Jimmy can get his all 10. Azhar gets one to backward square, then Fawad nurdles his first Test run since 1890 ... no he doesn’t, it’s a leg bye. Broad hurtles in again, and THERE IT IS! THE CELEBRAPPEAL! OH YES, THAT IS VINTAGE! Not out says the umpire, but Broad prevails on Root to review. “I would love Anderson to reach 626, which is my favourite Mazda model,” says James Debens. “I can’t fit in the MX-5, and the 3 couldn’t pull the skin off a rice pudding. The Mazda 626 rides well and when she picks up her skirts, she really can shift. She was known as the Capella in Japan this means ‘she-goat’ in Latin.”I don’t think I’ve ever understood fewer words of an email.

It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes.

While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year. Meanwhile, buon appetito.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment. With Malfy Gin, you can create the most authentic Italian style aperitivo hour. Try a Malfy Gin Rosa G\u0026ampT by mixing a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with Mediterranean tonic in a copa glass over ice and garnishing with a pink grapefruit wheel. Or, for an added touch of sophistication, mix a measure of Malfy Gin Rosa with 50ml prosecco and 50ml San Pellegrino Arraciata Rossa over ice in a wine glass, and garnish with an orange wheel, strawberry slice and sprig of thyme to create a Amalfi Sunset Spritz.Front-room festivalsIf you missed glamping it up at Glasto or living it up at Latitude this summer, there’s nothing to stop you recreating that festival feeling right in your front room. This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities. So as the weather warms up, it’s time to cast off your lockdown look and raise a glass of Malfy Gin in style.Locally sourced picnicsWith public transport still only used for essential travel and some of our favourite parks and gardens closed, we’re exploring the green spaces closer to home for a suitable patch of grass on which to spread our blankets.The best-dressed picnic baskets are filled with treats that support local producers, from honey collected by local beekeepers and veg from the farmer’s market, to unique small-batch cheeses and British charcuterie sliced on to artisanal sourdough. Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots. Choose from tours offering 360-degree views of popular destinations such as Tokyo or Machu Picchu, or watch a live stream from San Diego Zoo or California’s Monterey Bay Aquarium.You can even take a treadmill walk through the Colosseum – made even more authentic by concocting a refreshing gin spritz with Malfy Gin Rosa to take with you on your virtual tour.CottagecoreAnyone not ensconced in a countryside pad with an acre or two of garden attached is currently looking enviously towards the idyllic-looking lockdowns of those who are. As even the most ardent city-dweller wrests with sourdough starters and homemade crumpets, we’re being calmed by a trend that has been dubbed “cottagecore” – an aesthetic oozing with images of perfect-looking pies, vases filled with wildflowers and verdant countryside. Get the look by adding some floral frocks or shirts to your wardrobe.Malfy Gin is available to purchase in selected Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Morrisons, Asda, M\u0026ampS, Waitrose and Co-op stores, as well as Ocado and the Malfy Gin Amazon brand storePlease drink Malfy Gin responsibly.

Just Ignore Him begins with you looking at them, after driving away from your childhood home. Why start there?Because that’s when the sky fell in a bit. I also thought, ah, I now have an angle to my book – I can take a course of action in the present day on behalf of the boy that I was.How was that as a process?Full of fear. I had lots of conversations with friends, trusted readers, lots of one-on-ones in restaurants in London, and many said: “Look, are you sure you want to do this? Are you sure you want to go public?” But I knew I wanted to tell the world about my story, and my mother’s story. I also wanted to tell people they could talk about their own stories, even if they had never talked about them before. I’ve become a huge enemy of silence and secrecy. I regard them as the twin evils.You also reveal that your mother wasn’t told she was terminally ill when she was dying in hospital. This was your father’s wish. Is it fair to say that this is a book about what men have been allowed to get away with within their families, and within society?Yes. My book is very much about that. It’s relevant that I’m a father now, too. Seeing my sons pass through the ages that I was when my mother died, when my father did what he did… it’s mind-boggling, terrifying. I also learned through writing my book about how men deploy that power. It’s not always about literal strength or aggression, although that can be useful. Sometimes it’s about that person looking for pity or painting themselves as a victim. Sometimes really wicked people can present really well.Did it feel cathartic to explore that?Not at all. It felt like going into the fire. Stop running, Alan. Stop hiding. It’s time to face the fire.You also realised that parts of your comedy career were influenced by her.I hadn’t forgotten that I used to do this thing that made my mother laugh – lying on the floor, moving my legs around like windscreen wipers. But while writing the book, I realised that in all these routines in my 20s, I’d end up lying on the floor, too. I mean, it’s a very unusual thing for a standup comedian to do, to relinquish that position of power and authority. I did a lot of gigs with Jack Dee, and he never lay on the floor once. Eddie Izzard did everything else, but even he didn’t do that!How was writing a book different from writing standup?Comedy is the topsoil. This was digging into the bedrock. Sometimes comedy is moving, touching and affecting, but it’s not normally a punch in the eye.In the book you talk about reporting your father to the police in 2017, and his court case. This was as his Alzheimer’s disease was progressing. Is  he still alive?As far as I know, yes. He’s in a nursing home. My sister keeps me updated if I ask her.Your uncle also died of dementia. Did this family history of memory loss influence your need to record your experiences in detail?I think so, but this book is also for my kids. People have said: “God, you want your kids to read this?” And absolutely I do, when they’re old enough. Knowledge about your life is a gift to children. My littlest boy is always asking: “Where did you go on holiday when you were little, Daddy? What did you have for tea? Which Marvel character did you like?” And I’ll be “the Hulk and Spiderman, of course”, and he’s really pleased with that information. Thinking of that need further down the line was a motivation for me.Have your kids influenced you creatively?Not enough. They’ve made me more aware of my bad behaviour!How has the pandemic affected you?Covid has been catastrophic for me, my industry and my friends. I’m personally afraid to be in a pub, so the idea of sitting in a room with a hundred people laughing out everything from their lungs… it’s heartbreaking. A friend of mine was very seriously ill with it – he’s OK now, but I know how scary it is. More than anything, I’m furious about the government. I’m furious we locked down so late. I’m furious that they said, very proudly, that they had a rehearsal for a pandemic in 2016, which was an absolute shit-show, then they learned none of the lessons. And to tell people to go to work, without the kit they need not to die at work, then applaud them on the pavement… it’s beyond shameful. It’s enraging.Lots of male comics of your generation are writing emotional books. Why?We’re all doing this as iniduals, obviously, not all emailing each other going, you doing this? Oh, me too! But we’re all living in the same soup, and I’ve learned over the years that if you’ve had an idea to do something, then someone else definitely has, too. But I think it’s interesting that this is happening when no one is really looking for white middle-aged men.What do you mean?I mean we’ve had it all our own way for a very long time. When I auditioned to be Jonathan Creek, I was one of 38 white men. When I made the pilot for QI, I was one of five white men on the panel. I was one of five white men on lots of panels, for years. Nowadays, there is a movement to redress the balance, and publishers are looking for more women and people of colour, and in the middle of all that, here are white middle-aged men writing about their actual life, emotions and feelings. They’ve stopped trying to concoct a version of themselves to present to the world. They’ve started to tell the truth.What do you hope for for your book?Overwhelmingly positive reactions from allcomers. Favourable critical reviews. Lots of readers who enjoy the jokes, are moved at the moving bits, and aren’t unkind, as people often are. I also hope it helps people break away from family secrets. That is what I really want it to do.• Just Ignore Him is published on 1 September by Little, Brown (£18.99). To order a copy go to bookshop.

In fresh guidelines developed in cooperation with UNICEF it said children should wear “a mask under the same conditions as adults, in particular when they cannot guarantee at least a one-metre distance from others and there is widespread transmission in the area”.The advice came as South Korea reported 332 new cases on Saturday, including 315 local infections. The figure is the highest since 8 March, when it recorded 367 infections.All of the country’s 17 major cities and provinces reported cases for the first time since January, Yonhap reported. It said stricter social distancing rules would be imposed outside the greater Seoul area, from Sunday. The government had previously raised social distancing rules in Seoul, Incheon and Gyeonggi province to level two in the three-tier system.Karaoke bars, clubs and computer cafes were ordered to close and Sunday church services have been banned.South Africa’s Covid-19 infections passed 600,000 on Friday, although the number of new cases has been declining since a peak in July. Despite imposing one of the world’s toughest lockdowns at the end of March, when the country had only a few hundred cases, South Africa saw a surge in coronavirus infections that has left it the hardest hit on the continent.The government eased lockdown restrictions this week to allow most of the economy to re-open. But President Cyril Ramaphosa cautioned that cases could surge if people failed to maintain vigilance.Brazil reported 30,355 new cases of the coronavirus and 1,054 deaths, the health ministry said on Friday. Despite this, the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a virtual press conference that there was a “clear downward trend in many parts of Brazil”.The country has recorded nearly 6,900 deaths and more than 290,000 cases in the last seven days, according to the UN health agency: “The acceleration of cases has stabilised but there’s still a very high number of cases and a large number of deaths,” Ryan said.“Credit to the health workers and the communities in Brazil for taking the necessary actions to stabilise the situation,” he said.“We’re in that difficult period in Brazil where it looks like things could be getting better. The question is: is this a lull, can this be continued and can we see that downward trend?”Brazil has more than 3.5m cases of Covid-19 since the pandemic began, while the official death toll is more than 113,00.In Europe Germany, France, Spain and Italy, all saw infection levels rise to rates not seen in months, sparking fears over a second wave on the continent.In Spain’s capital Madrid, officials recommended people in the most affected areas stay at home to help curb the spread as the country registered more than 8,000 new cases in 24 hours. The figure was a 1,000-case jump on the previous day.France reported 4,500 new cases on Friday, the second consecutive day of more than 4,000 new infections –numbers not seen since May – with metropolitan areas accounting for most of those infections.Germany reported 2,034 cases on Saturday, its highest daily cases since 25 April.

By Sunday India’s death toll had reached 56,706.The country’s health ministry said the key to fighting Covid-19 was shaping the country’s recovery rate, which it mapped out in a tweet. Last week India carried out a million tests on a single day for the first time.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 397 new infections Sunday, up from the previous day’s 332 and marking more than a week of daily three-digit rises.Three-quarters of the new cases were in the capital and surrounding areas, and one quarter in provincial areas. Yonhap reported that it was the first time in recent weeks that 100 cases had been reported outside the capital.The new figure, the highest since early March, coincided with new social distancing measures outside the capital, Seoul. They ban in-person church meetings and nightclubs, buffets and cyber cafes are all closed.Health authorities say they may eventually deploy the toughest stage-three social-distancing rules, where schools and business are urged to close, if the rate of increase in new infections does not slow soon.Mexico’s death toll has passed 60,000 and its infections rose past 550,000. Mexico is now the third worst country for fatalities, only behind Brazil (114,000) and the US (176,000). However Mexico is only seventh in terms of infections.Despite the figures, the government declared this week that the coronavirus scourge was in “sustained decline” in Mexico. On Saturday the country recorded 644 deaths, the second lowest figure this month.The worst-hit Latin American country, Brazil, on Saturday recorded 50,032 new cases of coronavirus. The country has so far seen more than 3.5 million cases of the virus.In the Australian state of Victoria, which has been battling a major outbreak, a further 208 new cases were reported as the national death toll passed 500.The state’s chief health officer, Dr Brett Sutton, said the trajectory of the outbreak was decreasing. “We are not going to see three-hundreds or four-hundreds again – not under my watch,” he said. Seventeen deaths were also reported, including 11 in age care facilities.Victoria is now halfway through a six-week period of hard lockdowns. The premier Daniel Andrews said if the state was to open up early, the freedom enjoyed by people would be short-lived and a third wave would be inevitable.“There’s going to be a massive job of repair but we are up to that,” Andrews said.In New Zealand, which until two weeks ago had gone 100 days without a locally transmitted case, the health ministry reported just one new infection in the community. The case was a household contact of someone already identified in the Auckland cluster.There are now 151 people linked to the city’s cluster who have been moved into managed quarantine facilities, including 82 positive cases.In other developments:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50f0d4000bd520ec65be81863502ea45f6aaeb4d/0_306_4267_2560/master/4267.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=68085f089845735df8c571ed9a2470be","title":"coronavirus live news india nears 3m cases as australian state of queensland to announce two new cases","story":"Italy reported 1,071 new infections on Saturday PHE report into levels of transmission in schools released Australian deaths pass 500AFP has this report from Rakhine state in Myanmar:Rohingya in Myanmar’s conflict-wracked Rakhine state are concerned a coronavirus outbreak could reach their overcrowded camps, after a spate of infections sent the state capital into lockdown.Nearly 130,000 Rohingya Muslims live in what Amnesty International describes as “apartheid” conditions in camps around Sittwe.The city has recorded 48 cases in the past week, making up more than 10 percent of the about 400 cases so far registered in Myanmar.“We are extremely worried about the virus because we are living in limbo and it won’t be easy to control,” said Rohingya Kyaw Kyaw.Authorities visited the Thae Chaung camp this week to talk about social distancing – an impossibility as 10 families typically squeeze into a single house – and gave out hand sanitiser and face masks.“But if the lockdown is for a long time, we will ... need help,” Kyaw Kyaw told AFP, adding that everyone in the camps had locked themselves indoors.Sittwe’s streets were empty Sunday, with masked residents encountering barricaded roads as they tried to run errands.Street vendors hawked plastic face shields and surgical masks.An overnight curfew order has been in place since Friday, while all public transport - including domestic flights - into the capital was suspended.Rakhine state has long been a flashpoint for ethnic and religious conflict.The embattled Rohingya Muslim minority are widely regarded as foreign “Bengalis,” despite having lived in Myanmar for generations. They lack citizenship rights and their freedom of movement is restricted across the country.A local Rakhine parliamentarian this week blamed the Rohingya for the virus spread in a Facebook post that was later taken down.Some 750,000 Rohingya fled to neighbouring Bangladesh following a military crackdown in 2017 - operations that Myanmar is currently facing genocide charges for at the UN’s top court.Further north in the state, the military is also battling the Arakan Army, a rebel group seeking more autonomy for the state’s ethnic Rakhine Buddhists, and violent clashes have displaced thousands of civilians from their homes.In Mrauk-U – where three cases were found this week – Rakhine residents feared a halt to food donations to the displacement camps, said camp leader Hla Maung Oo.“We have nowhere to run if the virus becomes widespread because we also can’t go back to our villages,” he told AFP.Four months ago, South Korea was basking in international praise for containing the coronavirus pandemic. But now it stands on the brink of a second serious outbreak, and much of the blame is again being directed at the country’s evangelical churches.Health authorities say a recent surge in cases traced to Sarang Jeil, an ultra-conservative church in Seoul, have contributed to an outbreak that is now affecting major cities across the country. Some members of its congregation also attended a large anti-government rally in the capital last weekend that officials believe could have helped the virus spread.Read the full report:Here is a clip of England’s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty explaining why failing to return children to school in September would pose a greater risk to them than catching Covid-19.Following the release of Public Health England’s report into Covid-19 transmission within schools, a union boss has urged the government to issue schools clear guidance for dealing with outbreaks. Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary the National Education Union (NEU), said: Government advice needs to cover the possible self-isolation of bubbles and, in extremis, moving to rotas or to more limited opening.It needs to cover advice to heads about the protections needed for staff in high-risk categories if infection rates rise.Government should be employing more teachers and seeking extra teaching spaces to allow education to continue in a Covid-secure manner if infections rise.Travellers from the UK to France are required to self-certify that they are not suffering coronavirus symptoms or have been in contact with a confirmed case within 14 days preceding travel.The requirement to self-certify has been added to the UK government’s travel advice for those visiting France. Meanwhile, those travelling to the UK from France must still quarantine for 14-days after France was removed from the travel corridor list from August 15. Russia aims to ramp up production of its potential Covid-19 vaccine to between 1.5 million and 2 million doses a month by the end of the year, Reuters reports. Industry minister Denis Manturov said on Sunday that the nation hopes to eventually produce 6m doses a month, according to the RIA news agency.There has been a rising chorus of concern among scientists over Russia’s vaccine, stemming from its opaque development and the lack of mass testing. Earlier this month, virologist Kevin Gilligan warned of the potential for an inadequately tested vaccine to be “disease-enhancing” – making the situation worse than not doing any vaccination at all. Russia has described claims its potential vaccine is unsafe as groundless.Large-scale testing of the vaccine, developed by Moscow’s Gamaleya institute, is due to start in Russia next week. When 18-year-old Nia Bolland returns to Cambridge University in September, it will be a very different environment to the one she dreamed about in sixth-form.Bolland, who’s just finished her first year of a human, social and political sciences degree, returned home for lockdown with her family in Herefordshire, where she’s been studying remotely. “At Cambridge we’re quite lucky, because we have ‘supervisions’, which are basically 60-90-minute-long lessons in very small groups of between one and five people,” she says. “This means that lectures being cancelled hasn’t mattered as much as it might at other unis.”Read the full report:A total of 67 coronavirus cases and 30 outbreaks were detected in schools across England in June, according to Public Health England.The health agency on Sunday released the findings of a study into levels of coronavirus transmission in educational settings following their reopening on June 1.It found that Covid-19 infections and outbreaks were “uncommon”. In June, the number of children attending any educational setting increased from 475,000 to more than 1.6 million. The report adds that there is a strong correlation between the regional incidence of Covid-19 and the number of outbreaks in educational settings, which “emphasises the importance of controlling community transmission”.The 67 cases occurred mainly in primary school and early years settings and were made up of 30 students and 37 staff. No children were admitted to hospital, but one teacher was hospitalised and was admitted to intensive care for respiratory support. German finance minister Olaf Scholz said the European Union’s recovery package is a long-term measure rather than a short-term coronavirus crisis fix, contradicting chancellor Angela Merkel, AFP reports.“The recovery fund is a real step forward for Germany and for Europe, one we won’t go back on,” Scholz, who is also the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) candidate to succeed Merkel in 2021 elections, told the Funke newspaper group on Sunday.Steps taken under the plan, including EU nations agreeing to jointly issue debt “represent fundamental changes, perhaps the biggest changes since the introduction of the euro” single currency around the turn of the millennium, Scholz said.“These steps forward will inevitably lead to a debate about joint resources for the EU, something that’s a condition for an improved European Union that works better,” he added.Long and intense debates were needed before the 27 EU countries reached agreement in July on their historic 750-billion-euro recovery scheme, more than half of which will be paid out as direct grants.For the first time, leaders gave their green light to joint debt – an idea Germany had long rejected until the Covid-19 pandemic hobbled many European economies that had already spent a decade struggling to recover from the last financial crisis.Scholz added that the way voting works at EU level should be reformed to make reaching decisions easier.“The EU must be able to act collectively,” he said. “For that we need to have qualified majority voting in foreign and budgetary policy, rather than enforced unanimity.”Dr Dominic Pimenta resigned from his cardiology post after Boris Johnson’s chief advisor made his controversial car journey. Was it the right decision? Alex Moshakis speaks to Pimenta three months on to find out:"},{"url":null,"title":"back to school but to what we ve been in purgatory since march","story":"The principalMatt Melvin, principal of St Etchen’s National School in Kinnegad, Co Westmeath, is busy spray-painting social distancing warning signs onto the tarmac of the playground.There are smiley faces with “stay safe” slogans multicoloured footprints spaced two metres apart jaunty signs reminding pupils to sanitise their hands at the dispensers.It’s a delicate balancing act: welcoming back anxious students after a six-month enforced absence – as well as warning them that school life has changed dramatically.“We’re trying to set a tone to show that we’re conscious of safety. But we’re also trying to welcome and reassure children and give them time to settle into the routine of school again.”Like all other schools, the rhythm of the school day at St Etchen’s will change radically.There will be staggered entry and exit times each day for classes parents will be asked to remain in their cars when dropping off children pupils will be grouped into pods and class bubbles teachers will be asked to stay in their classroom at break-time swimming, football, athletics, drama and music will all cease until it is safe to do so school tours and field trips will be put on ice.It will all take its toll on school life – but Melvin feels they are small sacrifices to help reopen schools.“There’s normally great excitement and optimism in the yard in the morning,” says Melvin.“There’s lots of hustle and bustle. Parents meet up and shoot the breeze . . . it will be a shame to lose that, but the changes are very doable.”“It’s a terrible shame to have to curtail all our after-school activities. The range and scope of them is what defines us as a school. It sells us to the wider community. What will happen to music, the choir, tin-whistle practice? It’s hard to know.”Melvin says St Etchen’s is, in many ways, a microcosm of Irish society – and will face the kind of challenges that most schools will encounter.“We’re a erse school – about 20 per cent are non-Catholic, 15 per cent are non-Irish national. We’ve the children who will go onto Clongowes and the ones who might end up selling drugs. We’ve all the problems and advantages of Irish society.”He wonders, for example, how the class bubble system will operate in practice, especially given that children from similar backgrounds or nationalities – but different classes – often hang out together in the yard.“A lot of the conversation among parents and children is, ‘who’ll be in my child’s pod’, or ‘who won’t be’,” he says.The school is finally due to reopen fully on Thursday, August 27th. The school secretary and caretaker\u0026nbsphave played a vital role in getting the school ready.\u0026nbspMelvin is looking\u0026nbspforward to the big day.“It’s feels like we’ve been in purgatory since March . . . finally, we’ll get to reopen. There is huge anticipation among the kids to get back. They’ll be delighted. There’s excitement and apprehension. We want it all to go well. We won’t want to be the school that doesn’t do something right and causes the whole house of cards to fall.”The junior infantEva Belle Bradshaw (4) is worried about her first day in big school.She’s not too concerned about going to a strange school, with children she doesn’t know, or lots of rules around hand-washing and distancing. No, she’s worried that her mammy will miss her too much.“So, I drew a picture of mammy and me, playing football. It’s on the livingroom wall. It’s there in case she misses me when I’m at school,” she says.It’s a reminder, she says, of how parents are often more anxious around the reopening of schools than the children.“We’re definitely more worried than she is. We’ve tried to shelter her from any concerns connected with coronavirus, or the chance of school shutting down if there’s a second wave. But she’s just excited to be going to school and finally getting to meet new friends and socialise,” says Julie, a mother of two from Arklow, Co Wicklow.The first day of school is likely to be very different for parents of junior infants.While mothers and fathers traditionally accompany their children into class on the first day, with teary photographs, followed by teas and coffees with other parents, none of this will happen this year.In most cases, children will be met at the school gates by a teacher or principal, who will guide them into their new classroom.Parents, in most schools, are being asked to stay off the school premises this year, unless there are exceptional reasons.The first day in school may also be a bigger jolt for many children.In recent years, junior infants have tended to breeze into school on their first day. With two years of preschool under their belt, they are well accustomed to the classroom and being separated from their parents.But most of this year’s cohort of new junior infants have been out of early years settings for six months – an eternity for children of this age. They have also missed out on familiarisation visits to school. Tearful goodbyes at the school gates, then, look much more likely this year.In Eva Belle’s case, however, her parents feel she’ll be fine.“We’re fortunate that she’s a confident child and very sociable. She’ll be glad to see other children. I have friends who are very concerned for their children and worry about how they’ll cope after spending so much time at home.“In terms of the first day, we’re disappointed we won’t be able to be in the classroom on the first day, but it is what it is.”The teacherChristelle Bekombo feels a tinge of excitement, laced with apprehension, when she thinks about returning to the classroom.“It’s been such a long time. There is a side of me that is really excited. This is the job I chose to do,” says the 26-year-old French teacher. “But I do worry about how all the changes will affect teaching: the communications, the distance, all of that.”Teaching, she says, isn’t simply standing at the top of the class dispensing wisdom: it’s about trust, relationship-building, engagement.“Proximity to students is an important part of teaching for me,” she says. “If a student is struggling, you sit in beside them and show them how to do the exercise. It shows a level of care and interest. So, I’d be worried that some will fall behind and feel that I’m not treating them as being important.“For first years, especially. They’ve come from primary where they are used to teachers providing help on a one-to-one basis. So, I just hope there are other ways we can make all students feel valued and important in the classroom.”The fact that secondary students are being required to wear face masks may also hinder some of the natural communication in class.Bekombo, originally from Cameroon, is relatively new to teaching.She fully qualified last March just as her school – Le Chéile Secondary School in Tyrrelstown, northwest Dublin – shut down.Teaching online, she says, was very hard.Even though the school was fortunate in that all children had iPads, it still meant approaching and preparing for teaching in new ways. It was also a struggle to engage all students.“There are so many different learners. Some learn best from listening to you in class, others absorb video or songs online better. You could see online that some were falling back and not logging into classes enough. As a teacher, you want all your students to be a success and fulfil their potential. So, it was hard to see some falling behind.”She says her emphasis will be on getting those at-risk students back in class and consolidating their learning before moving on to new topics. Learning loss, she says, will be inevitable.“The old saying is that practice makes perfect. If you haven’t practiced, it will be a challenge. Some will struggle, but that’s my job to help them catch up.“I’d be more worried about students psychologically. Everything stopped so suddenly for then. They now have to adapt to a new routine.”As for any worries for her health back in the classroom? She’s not too worried.“I’m very fortunate. I’m not a frontline nurse. So, I’m not so much worried as excited. I just want to get back to the job that I love.”The first-year studentOlivia Lyons’s last day of primary school ended abruptly when her class was preparing a game show in Irish for Seachtain na Gaeilge.“Then, the teachers came in and gave us sweets and said we’d be shutting down the school for two weeks . . . I had a feeling then that we might not be coming back in,” says the 12-year-old, from Kilmore in north Dublin.There was an initial exhilaration – followed by a dawning realisation of what they had lost: friendships, graduation ceremonies and end-of-school milestones.“I found being out of the class hard. I missed school and seeing my friends and classmates in the yard,” she says.The remote learning which replaced the classroom was okay – but it wasn’t the same.“I had ClassDojo on my phone and we were given work for a week, or a project to do. I found it easy to get done, but others’ didn’t . . . it was harder to learn new things. We did projects and new stuff, just not as much as we would have.”Despite the challenges, she feels school ended on a high: teachers organised a virtual graduation ceremony. All her classmates took part in a online talent show. The pupils got robes and commemorative hoodies with all their names on it.“It was a nice touch – they tried really hard to make it really nice,” she says,Now, she’s preparing for her first day in secondary school.Even in normal times it might be daunting – but this time there are a host of other uncertainties.“I’m not sure what school will be like,” she says. “I’m not used to wearing a face mask. And it will be weird and awkward seeing friends, or making new ones while staying one or two metres apart. It might be harder to get to know people.”There will also be changes getting to school. Secondary students will be asked to wear face masks on school buses and stay seated close to the same people each day.For a while, she says, she did feel sad about how school life is going to be different for her generation – but she’s got over that.“It did feel unfair at the start. It would nice if everyone got a nice ending and a good start in secondary. But we can’t change anything,” she says.“I’ve met up with a good few friends after the lockdown. We went to the shops and to the park to play football. We’re back playing matches now, and a lot of the girls on my team will be going to my secondary school.”The special needs assistantIn a world of social distancing, Carol McSherry’s role as a special needs assistant requires working side-by-side with vulnerable children.“We’re there for the care and safety of children. It can be pupils with epilepsy, diabetes. Many are immuno-compromised. If some of these children got Covid-19, it would be catastrophic,” says McSherry, who is based in Co Meath.“We’re helping some children with toileting or intimate care needs. We’re helping children to be included in the class, assisting them with pencil grip, looking out for trip hazards.”This support cannot be carried out at a distance – so the latest public health guidelines advised wearing a visor or face mask when physical distancing is not possible.The official guidance is vague, she says, so it will be a case of adapting to inidual circumstances.Another unanswered question is whether she will be assigned to a class bubble and required to avoid mixing with children outside it. But this, she says, simply won’t be possible.“There is no way I can be based in just one class. Most special needs assistants support several children in a school across different classes,” she says,“I think sometimes that the people who make these decisions don’t realise the work we need to do behind the scenes.”What is encouraging, she says, is that schools which reopened to support children with special needs during the summer – known as July provision – were able to make the new rules work.“I did the summer programme myself for two weeks, wearing a mask and it worked. It wasn’t ideal – I ended up having to read books upside down, and couldn’t point to things easily. It was awkward, but doable.”She also has worries about how classes will cope with rising levels of sick leave among staff. Despite these concerns, she is looking forward to the school gates reopening and life returning to the classroom.“I want to go back to school. I love my job. Some of my best friends are on the staff. I miss all that. I just want the reopening to go as safely as possible,” she says.The Leaving Cert studentEmer Neville from Clonmel in Co Tipperary saw the stress and turmoil which Leaving Cert students went through earlier this year.Having missed a large chunk of schooling during fifth year, she is worried that sixth years are facing into a year of anxiety and uncertainty. “I’m quite nervous about it – especially being a Leaving Cert student. I feel we’ve been pushed under the rug a bit and ignored,” she says.Her biggest worry is trying to make up for lost time – and the fear of being penalised in the exams as a result. Remote learning, she says, was a real struggle.“It was really difficult. I found it hard to sit and concentrate on the work when there was a pandemic going on in the background. It meant trying to teach yourself about subjects. Zoom was a whole new concept, but many teachers didn’t have it so there was a lot of sending us notes.”The isolation didn’t make matters easier.“It was strange and the social aspect of it was really hard: not getting to see your friends . . . in more recent times, we meet up, but there are friends and classmates that I’ve lost contact with.”That said, she’s eager to get back to school and catch up with her class.School life will be very different. All students at the school have been issued with two face masks. The schools will be festooned with warning signs and hand sanitisers. She’ll be assigned to a base class, to limit mixing with other students.“I’m really excited to get back and see friends. It’s hard to see how the one- or two-metre rule will work in classrooms in practice. There is that danger that you pick up the virus.“The worry is that you would pass it onto a vulnerable family member. Some of my friends with at-risk family members feel petrified about that and feel they’d never forgive themselves.”She would like to see special measures being taken this year to recognise the unique position that this year’s Leaving Cert students are in,“I just hope we don’t face the same uncertainty and that they have a plan. I think they should either cut the curriculum in half or go down the route of predicted grading. We just want to avoid the stress that last year’s sixth years faced.”The child with special needsFive-year-old Arlo Sweeney lives just around the corner from the large primary school which his older brother attends.He should be due to start his first day of school in a few days, but there is no place for him.The 700-pupil school says it cannot accommodate him, while he has been refused places in many other schools across the south Dublin area.That is because Arlo has been diagnosed with autism and schools say they do not have the expertise to meet his needs.“You can hear the children in the playground from our house, that’s how close the school is,” says his mother Róisín Kelly.“But there is no special class in the school and there is nothing in the south Dublin area. The system is so discriminatory. If you have a child with additional needs, you are made to fight for everything.”Arlo is one of dozens of children with special or additional needs in south Dublin who do not have a school place for the coming school year.And for those with special needs who are lucky enough to have school places, school closures have hit them hardest of all.Deprived of routine and support, many parents report that their children have regressed and lost out on key skills which have taken them years to acquire,In Arlo’s case, he has been assessed as requiring a special class, attached to a mainstream school, which typically has six students to one teacher and two special needs assistants.While it is one of the most affluent areas of the State, campaigners say there is a “black hole” in the provision of special classes.“The only explanation I can see is league tables. Or else there is an assumption that people in more affluent areas can privately educate their children. But that’s not an option – there are no special classes in private primary schools,” says Kelly.For now, she says Arlo will have to avail of home tuition. Luckily, she says, parents have banded together to provide this with other children in a preschool setting. It means that Arlo will likely be almost seven years or age when he finally starts primary.“It’s not necessarily such as bad thing. Even if a place was found at the last minute for him, I’d worry that the class might not have a qualified teacher and wouldn’t function for the first six months with all the Covid-19 disruption,” she says.“Our only wish now is that he’s gets to be educated in his local community, like his older brother. That remains our wish for him during his time in education. I want him to reach his potential, whatever that is. He just needs access to his basic human right.”The familyAfter six long months, the Dempsey family is getting uniforms pressed and school bags prepped for what feels like a momentous occasion.Even in normal times, the new school year would be a big deal, says Lorraine Dempsey.Of her four daughters, Hannah (5) is starting junior infants Freya (13) is starting secondary school Sadhbh (16) is in senior cycle and her twin Rianna, who has cerebral palsy and an intellectual disability, returns to her special school.But the fact that they have spent so long out of the classroom and are facing into very changed school settings makes this year’s return to school uncertain, anxious – and exciting.“It’s been such a long break so there will be a lot of settling back in to do. There’s anxiety of different kinds,” she says.“For my youngest, it’s adjusting to primary school. My 13-year-old wonders if she’ll be able to make friends and is anxious in an excited kind of way, For Sadhbh, it’s more on the academic side of things and missing out on the curriculum. And with Rianna, it’s about keeping her safe and taking precautions to make sure Covid doesn’t make its way into the home.”She worries that the level of disruption to school will be huge.Even before Covid-19, it felt like there was always a family member with a cold or sniffle. With public health guidelines advising against going to school with any potential coronavirus symptoms, she expects it will be a stop-start kind of year.“We’re all so interdependent, so that will be very strange. No one knows exactly how it will pan out, so it’s hard to plan or offer reassurances that everything will be okay.”While her daughters might normally get the bus, she’s not sure how this work out or what health precautions are in place – so she’ll drive some of them to school in the first few weeks.Dempsey says she hopes schools will put a big emphasis on fun activities and wellbeing to help settle students back into education.“There is a great level of excitement about seeing friends and meeting up with classmates . . . I just hope they get a chance to enjoy that, given everything they’ve been through.”Carl O\u0027Brien is Education Editor of The .

Photograph: MaxwellsThe Government has agreed to recall the Dáil in the wake of the controversy over the Oireachtas Golf Society dinner and criticism by the opposition of public messaging surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.In a statement, the Government said: “The Taoiseach, Tánaiste, and Minister Eamon Ryan have agreed that the Dáil should be recalled following the reopening of schools. The Taoiseach will make this request to the Ceann Comhairle on Monday.”The Dáil had been due to complete a six-week recess, returning on September 15th. Schools are due to re-open from the end of next week, meaning the Dáil is likely to return at least a week early.However, Labour leader Alan Kelly said there was no reason why the Dáil could not return this Tuesday.“Announcing in the middle of the night a recall of the Dáil that won’t happen for over a week sums up the chaos at the heart of this government,” he said.“A delayed return of the Dáil is not acceptable, and it should come back this Tuesday, 25th August.“We have too much to discuss,” he said.“It makes no sense that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and Minister Ryan are prepared to wait over a week in the hope this storm will pass.”The Taoiseach had on Friday rebuffed opposition demands to recall the Dáil, saying the Government’s priority was to ensure a safe reopening of schools this week.Opposition parties had been seeking an early resumption of sittings amid criticism of, not only of the golf dinner but also, the Government’s handling of new public health advice issued last week.There were claims the new regulations, which among other things extended restaurant opening hours by 30 minutes while returning sports events behind closed doors, were incoherent and caused confusion.Minister for Education Norma Foley is also under pressure to reassure parents and teachers that schools are properly prepared for their reopening.Since June 29th indoor gatherings have been restricted to 50 people under the Government’s public health controls.Further restrictions announced last week identified only weddings and artistic and cultural events as being allowed to have groups of up to 50.Moreover, the latest regulations say tables in restaurants should not exceed six people, from no more than three households.“The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste did speak with the Commissioner today and asked him to consider his position,” a Government spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action.”The move puts Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade in doubt and is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office. Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Mr Hogan and Mr Woulfe were among more than 80 people who attended last Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway.Attendees have come under pressure to also disclose the length of time they were present at the event.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.Four speechesOne of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches. Among those to speak were the society’s captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish the society’s president and former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy and Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family, who shared a table at the event.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.On the question of a possible breach in the 105-minute time limit for events, Sinn Féin leader Mary Lou McDonald told The : “The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4336812.1598182344!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"phil hogan issues full and unreserved apology over golf dinner","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEU Commissioner and former Fine Gael TD Phil Hogan was among the attendees at the Oireachtas Golf Society event. File image: Dara Mac DónaillThe European Commissioner Phil Hogan has issued a fresh apology for attending this week’s controversial Oireachtas Golf Society dinner but has stopped short of resigning.In a statement on Sunday, Mr Hogan said: “I wish to apologise fully and unreservedly for attending the Oireachtas golf society dinner on Wednesday night last.“I want, in particular, to apologise to the wonderful healthcare workers, who continue to put their lives on the line to combat Covid-19 and all people who have lost loved ones during this pandemic. I acknowledge my actions have touched a nerve for the people of Ireland, something for which I am profoundly sorry.“I realise fully the unnecessary stress, risk and offense caused to the people of Ireland by my attendance at such an event, at such a difficult time for all, and I am extremely sorry for this.“I acknowledge that the issue is far bigger than compliance with rules and regulations and adherence to legalities and procedures. All of us must display solidarity as we try to stamp out this common plague.“I thus offer this fulsome and profound apology, at this difficult time for all people, as the world as a whole combats Covid-19.“I spoke to both the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste yesterday and I have listened carefully to their views, which I respect. I have been reporting to the President of the European Commission on all these matters in recent days.”On Saturday Taoiseach Micheál Martin and Tánaiste Leo Varadkar asked Mr Hogan to “consider his position” as EU Commissioner after attending the event.“They both believe that the event should never have been held, that the Commissioner’s apology came late and that he still needs to give a full account and explanations of his action,” a Government spokesperson said on Saturday.Mr Hogan’s future as European Commissioner for Trade remains in doubt and the intervention on Saturday by the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is also likely to increase pressure on Supreme Court judge Séamus Woulfe, who was also in attendance at the golf dinner.Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar have not spoken to European Commission president Ursula Von der Leyen, who would have the power to remove Mr Hogan from office.On Sunday, Labour leader Alan Kelly urged the Taoiseach and Tánaiste to “inform” Ms Von der Leyen “that they no longer have confidence” in Mr Hogan and that he should resign.Mr Hogan’s appointment as Commissioner was ratified by the European Parliament after being nominated by the previous government.Event durationMeanwhile, the Oireachtas Golf Society is coming under further pressure to disclose the length of time more than 80 people were gathered at the dinner.Under Covid-19 restrictions announced by Mr Martin and Mr Varadkar two weeks ago, restaurants were required to close at 11pm, with diners allowed only an hour and 45 minutes for their meals.Revised restrictions announced last Tuesday – the night before the now infamous golf dinner – extended the closing time until 11.30pm, with table numbers capped at six people.One of those in attendance at Wednesday night’s dinner at the Station House Hotel in Clifden, Co Galway, said it started shortly after 9pm.There were a choice of three starters, including soup, pate and “some vegetarian or salady thing”, followed by a choice of three main courses, including salmon and lamb, and a choice of three desserts.After the meal there were four separate speeches, including from society captain and Independent TD Noel Grealish.The society’s president and former Fianna Fáil TD and senator Donie Cassidy also made a speech, followed by Fianna Fáil councillor Donagh Killilea, who spoke on behalf of his family, who shared a table at the event.The dinner was organised to pay tribute to his late father, the former Fianna Fáil MEP and TD Mark Killilea, as well as mark the society’s 50th anniversary.The now resigned minister for agriculture Dara Calleary also made a speech commemorating the late Mr Killilea.There was also a prize-giving, and according to one person present, families of winners took time to take photos.It is understood former Fine Gael minister Mr Hogan won one of the prizes, a George Foreman grill.One attendee couldn’t recall what time people left the function room, saying some stayed on to talk afterwards before everyone “scattered”.“It’s impossible to say, I wasn’t conscious of time,” said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity.‘Multiple breaches’Sinn Féin president Mary Lou McDonald told The  she was concerned “to hear reports of multiple breaches of public health guidelines” at the event.“We know the number of attendees exceeded the limit, but it has now been alleged that the event also lasted far longer than the time limit permitted,” she said.“The public needs to know if multiple breaches of the guidelines occurred.“I would ask those present at the dinner to clarify whether the length of time was compliant with the regulations and to be clear about how many regulation breaches took place. The attendees must be up-front about what happened and how the rules were breached. ”Ms McDonald said the Irish public was “understandably concerned about what happened and this drip feed of information and allegations risks undermining confidence in the public health guidelines at this critical time in the fight against Covid-19”.Some attendees stayed at rooms in the hotel where the dinner took place and others stayed in at least two other hotels in the town. Some remained on at the hotel lounge in the lobby afterwards.“We were assured everything was in order,” one said.“It was a cock up anyway, with the benefit of hindsight. The dinner shouldn’t have taken place.”As well as the more than 80 attendees, there was “a pile” of staff, with one or two waiters assigned to each table, according to one of the diners.Restrictions state staff should be included when calculating maximum numbers, meaning the gathering was several multiples of the latest allowed number of six for indoor gatherings, and comfortably more than the previous cap of 50.Mr Cassidy has said he will fully cooperate with a Garda investigation into the affair.Under Covid-19 regulations it is a criminal offence to organise an event with a larger number of people than is permitted by the regulations.All-expenses tripThe scandal is not the first time the Oireachtas Golf Society has courted controversy.In the summer of 2010, the society went on an all-expenses paid trip to Turkey for official celebrations of the 90th anniversary of the Turkish parliament, which had organised a golf tournament for parliamentarians from around the globe.Among those travelling were Mr Cassidy, Mr Grealish and then Carlow Kilkenny TD Mr Hogan.Then leader of the Seanad Mr Cassidy was forced to deny claims on his return that he had refused to reopen the Upper House alongside the Dáil the same week because he and his golfing colleagues were staying at the five star Sueno Hotels Golf Belek resort in the popular coastal resort Antalya.“I gave up my whole bloody weekend in the name of Ireland,” he said of his trip to Turkey at the time."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Health condition \u0026lsquovery worrying\u0026rsquo after drinking tea that allies believe was laced with poisonDecision to transfer Kremlin critic ill with suspected poisoning after day of lobbyingProtests over last two months most serious threat yet to prime minister\u0026rsquos administrationLack of foreign visitors has facilitated increase in poaching and loss of revenueReport by US intelligence agencies sheds light on actions \u0026ndash and inactions \u0026ndash that created global crisisTens of thousands evacuated as record-breaking rains hit country\u0026rsquos southwestCountry entering dangerous new phase of rising infections in small towns and villagesUS president \u0026lsquopatently wrong\u0026rsquo when telling Minnesota crowd New Zealand situation \u0026lsquoterrible\u0026rsquoPolling put back by four weeks as 49 Covid-19 cases recorded in AucklandStudent-led demonstrations gain momentum testing laws protecting royal familyCovid-19 outbreak spreads to more than 30 people and extends beyond capitalJacinda Ardern sounds warning as number of cases in locked-down Auckland rises to 17Hundreds of police had raided Apple Daily in move decried as assault on press freedom\u0026lsquoGoing hard, going early with lockdown is still the best response,\u0026rsquo Jacinda Ardern saysReturn to nationwide restrictions announced by PM Jacinda Ardern in surprise press conferenceReaders queue from 2am to buy pro-democracy tabloid after owner Jimmy Lai\u0026rsquos arrestFair Work Commission\u0026rsquos decision that man made \u0026lsquooffensive\u0026rsquo video overturned on appealMaria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4335701.1598013937!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit uk time wasting makes deal unlikely says barnier","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit negotiator Michel Barnier: “Frankly I am disappointed and I am worried.”  Photograph: Yves HermanPOOLAFP via Getty ImagesThe EU’s Brexit negotiator has warned that valuable time is being wasted in trade talks with the UK as he accused his British counterparts of failing to make progress on topics of key interest to Europe during the latest round of trade negotiations. Michel Barnier said he was disappointed, concerned and surprised by the lack of progress displayed in discussions that took place in Brussels this week, reiterating that at this stage an agreement between the two sides still looked unlikely and that there was a risk the two sides would fail to ratify a deal by the end of the year. “Too often this week it felt as if we were going backwards more than forwards,” Mr Barnier said at a press conference following the conclusion of the latest negotiations. “I simply do not understand why we are wasting valuable time.” The failure to advance the discussions that began on Tuesday evening leaves only a narrow window in which to agree the text of a trade agreement, translate it into multiple European languages and obtain ratification before the post-Brexit transition period ends on December 31st. While both the UK and EU insist they want a deal, EU officials decried a lack of momentum on the British side in the wake of Thursday’s session, with one describing it as “puzzling”. David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, acknowledged in a separate statement that there had been “little progress” during the week’s talks, but he also insisted that a deal remained possible even if it would not be easy to achieve.State aid and fisheriesThe EU wants the two sides to push towards a common understanding on the topics of state aid and fisheries, rather than leaving these highly sensitive topics until later in the talks, but British negotiators are seeking to advance to a legal text in other areas where the two sides are closer together.Lord Frost criticised the EU’s approach on Friday. “The EU is still insisting not only that we must accept continuity with EU state aid and fisheries policy, but also that this must be agreed before any further substantive work can be done in any other area of the negotiation, including on legal texts,” he said. “This makes it unnecessarily difficult to make progress.”Mr Barnier complained that he was not seeing any willingness on the UK side to take on board the EU’s priorities, adding that the need for a “level playing field” that ensures fair competition in areas including state aid would not go away and was a non-negotiable precondition to any trade deal.“No international agreement was ever reached without the parties agreeing to common rules,” he said. The notion of a zero-tariff, zero-quota agreement without level playing field provisions and a balanced deal on fisheries was a “non-starter” for the EU, and the absence of progress in these areas was blocking everything, he warned.British negotiating officials said the talks were stalling due to the problematic issues of fishing and state aid, over which they accused the EU of seeking to maintain the status quo.“What is frustrating is that Barnier wants to see us continuing arrangements very like those we had as members of the EU. The principle of ‘Brexit means Brexit’ is a good one and should be applied across the board,” the official said.“The process block now is that we must accept their position on state aid and fisheries before we can talk about anything else. We’re obviously not going to do that, so we’re frozen.”Key concernsMr Barnier confirmed that the UK had presented a draft legal text for the trade deal during the round of talks, but he added that this had not addressed the EU’s key concerns, serving instead as a reminder of the UK’s existing positions.Lord Frost added that the UK was seeking a relationship that ensures Britain regains “sovereign control of our own laws, borders, and waters” and is similar to other agreements struck by the EU elsewhere. “When the EU accepts this reality in all areas of the negotiation, it will be much easier to make progress.” A dinner between Mr Barnier and Lord Frost was held on Thursday evening after negotiations concluded, which officials suggested was tense following the lack of progress. “It was a very nice dinner, we had courteous and friendly discussions but we didn’t hide the difficulties between us,” one inidual said. – Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Photograph: Olivier DoulieryAFP via Getty ImagesIt was late afternoon on February 2nd, the eve of the Iowa caucuses. We were jammed into a high-school gymnasium in Des Moines, the state capital, for Joe Biden’s closing rally.No one thought he would win the primary season’s talismanic opening contest the following day. Nor was he expected to come close to beating Bernie Sanders, the socialist Vermonter, in New Hampshire the next week. Though he was still ahead in the national polls, the 77-year-old former vice-president was treated as yesterday’s news.A crowd of several hundred was waiting unexpectantly. Biden entered roughly half an hour late, accompanied by a phalanx of retired politicians: John Kerry (76), the former secretary of state Chris Dodd (75), the retired senator from Connecticut Tom Vilsack (69), former governor of Iowa and Harold Schaitberger (73), president of the International Association of Firefighters.The oxygen seemed to drain from the room. As Biden’s surrogates spoke one after the other, the air got progressively thinner. By the time the candidate got up to speak, it was positively embalmed. “This is like a wake,” joked one veteran television anchor. Biden’s low-key soliloquy did little to lift the energy.Such are the limits of conventional wisdom. Twenty-seven days later, Biden grabbed the Democratic mantle after sweeping the South Carolina primary. With the notable exception of Sanders, who fought on for another five weeks, most of the rest of the field dropped out and endorsed him. It was a breathtaking twist.With hindsight, Biden officials say they always knew he would be the Democratic nominee. They were playing the long game. “We made a decision from the start not to listen to the loudest voices on Twitter,” says Stef Feldman, Biden’s policy director. That was not how many sounded at the time. When I asked a Biden staffer in Des Moines about the campaign’s mood, he used the TV anchor’s same funereal analogy.Who could blame them? Biden’s long history of running for the White House offered no cause for hope. Over a  of more than 32 years, he had not won a single primary. In 1987, he crashed out months before the voting began, having been accused of plagiarising a speech by Neil Kinnock, leader of the British Labour party.In 2008, he quit after having won just 0.9 per cent of the Iowa caucus vote. “At that point, most people thought his presidential career was over,” says Shailagh Murray, then a journalist with the Washington Post, who went on to become Biden’s deputy chief of staff. He had at least another 12 years to go. Nobody that night imagined that Barack Obama, winner of the Iowa caucus, would go on to pick Biden as his ­running mate.Ceremonial presidentThe vicissitudes of Biden’s 50 years in politics ought to make anyone sceptical of forecasts for this November. In the absence of time machines, we can only go by the numbers. Both the betting markets (about two to one in Biden’s favour) and the polls (an average eight-percentage-point lead over Donald Trump) suggest Biden will be America’s 46th president.What manner of president would he make? Half of Washington claims to know the man well. At a year above the median US male’s life expectancy, many expect him to be a ceremonial president. Even Biden’s close friends admit his energy and power of recall are not what they were.His would be a restorationist presidency – an erasure of what he is fond of describing as the Trumpian “aberration”. Others, notably Trump, depict him as a geriatric prisoner of the Democratic Party’s left. Most agree that whatever his agenda, and whatever the time of day, he would probably still talk too much.The word “logorrhea” (a tendency to extreme loquacity) has recently come into fashion. Biden’s campaign is keen to emphasise he would not, like Trump, be the “Twitterer-in-chief”.Those who know him the best – many of whom spoke to me for this profile – are in little doubt about the character he would bring to the presidency. Their Biden may stray too readily into schmaltz. But his empathy for people is real. In this pandemic-blighted election year, that quality could count for a lot.“Biden is the same guy I first met in 1969 – he was full of piss and vinegar,” says Louis Susman, a Chicago-based investor and former ambassador to the UK. “He doesn’t suffer from inner demons, he doesn’t bear grudges and he loves being around people.”Should he make it to the White House, Biden would have completed the longest marathon in US political history. No other serious figure has tried this long to make it over the finishing line in recent history.A majority of Americans were not born when Biden first entered national politics. At 30, he was the fifth youngest senator in the country’s history after he won office in 1972. Biden’s 48-year political career is older than John F Kennedy, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama when they were elected.Yet he sounds remarkably similar today to the ambitious, blue-collar Irish-American that he was then. Staffers tried and failed to get him to avoid using words such as “record player” during the 2020 primaries. Calling someone a “horse’s ass” is no longer thought to be cutting. In an interview with Kitty Kelley in 1974, Biden worried about being seen as a “gay young bachelor” around Washington – by which he meant “happy”, not “LGBTQ”.So popular are Biden’s anachronisms that there is even a “Biden insult bot” – a Twitter algorithm – to which fans can turn. “You got something stuck in your craw, you milk-swillin’ circus peanut,” reads one tweet. “Shut your piehole, you hood-winked britch soiler,” reads another.‘Amtrak Joe’Most American voters already know of the ­tragedy that struck Biden in his early career. A few weeks after he was elected to the Senate, he lost his wife Neilia and one-year-old daughter, Naomi, in a car crash while they were Christmas shopping in Delaware, his home state.His sons, Beau, aged three, and Hunter, aged two, survived but were hospitalised with severe injuries. Most people would have disintegrated. Biden considered not taking his Senate seat. In the end, he was persuaded to be sworn in at the hospital beside one of his sons. He said he could only continue in politics if he saw his kids every morning and night.Thus was born “Amtrak Joe” – the senator who took the 90-minute journey each evening from Washington to Wilmington to say goodnight to his sons. He commuted until 2008, long after the boys had grown up. Subtracting a tenth of nights for other travel, and nearly half the year for recess and weekends, I calculate that Biden spent at least 21,000 hours – or three years of his life – on that train.“He knew the names of every conductor and they all loved him,” says Paul Laudicina, Biden’s legislative director between 1977 and 1982. “Often, he would still be talking when he boarded, and I would go to Wilmington with him and then cross the platform and come straight back.”In the 1974 Kelley interview, the famously acerbic journalist said Biden “reeks of decency”. He nevertheless managed to sound almost Trumpian about his deceased wife. “Let me show you my favourite picture of her,” he says, holding up a snapshot of Neilia in a bikini. “She had the best body of any woman I ever saw. She looks better than a Playboy bunny, doesn’t she?” Kelley described his office as a shrine to Neilia.Biden recently conceded that he has been too invasive of women’s personal space – “handsiness” has also entered the DC lexicon. Unlike some of his contemporaries, however, he has not been dogged by rumours of infidelity. A former Senate staffer, Tara Reade, accused him earlier this year of sexually assaulting her in a corridor in 1993. Biden denies it and her story has been criticised as inconsistent.In 1977 Biden married Jill Tracy Jacobs, a teacher based in Wilmington. On their first date he dressed in a jacket. When he dropped her back home he shook her hand. According to What it Takes, the ­celebrated 1988 campaign book by the late ­Richard Ben Cramer, Jill said she could not believe such men still existed. “Jill is Biden’s least appreciated strength,” says Susman, who often hosted the Bidens for Thanksgiving in his Nantucket home.Much of Biden’s sense of gravity comes from her. Even when her husband was vice-president, Jill Biden continued to teach every day at a community college in Northern Virginia. When he left office in 2017, the Bidens’ net worth was less than $500,000. They still hadn’t paid off the mortgage on their Wilmington home.Irish-Catholic and handsomeUntil he was rescued from near-certain genteel decline by Obama, Biden was defined by his disastrous 1988 presidential bid. Most of the people who helped him on that jinxed quest, including Ted Kaufman, his long-running chief of staff, Michael Donilon, his chief strategist today, and Donilon’s brother Tom, Biden’s foreign-policy adviser, are still around him.They are mostly Irish-American and very tight-knit. Cathy Russell, Tom Donilon’s wife, was Jill Biden’s chief of staff when she was “second lady”. Her husband is tipped as a possible secretary of state. Kaufman is running Biden’s presidential transition – that long and rickety bridge between victory and inauguration.In the 1988 campaign, Biden tried to present himself as the new John F Kennedy – young, Irish-Catholic and handsome. It never quite took hold. Then he saw a video of Kinnock’s soaring oratory – “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to get to university?” That was the middle-class poetry Biden had been lacking – the story of how the sons and daughters of coal miners had been lifted up by the welfare state, Britain’s version of the New Deal.“He grabbed that tape and took it home he inhaled the thing,” wrote Cramer. “It was like when Barbra Streisand came on the radio – Kinnock was singing Joe’s song.” For the most part, Biden credited Kinnock’s words. But the rival Michael Dukakis campaign found one tape where Biden had not. They leaked it.Suddenly, Biden was inundated with calls asking whether his grandfather had been a coal miner (none of his forebears had been). “It looked like Joe didn’t just steal the words, it looked like he ripped off Kinnock’s life,” Cramer wrote. A few months after dropping out, Biden had a near-fatal ­aneurysm. Then another. He was given a 50-50 chance of ­surviving the first nine-hour operation.“Joe wouldn’t be alive today if he had still been running for president,” says Kaufman. “He wouldn’t have had the time to get his headaches checked out.” Or, as Biden said when he emerged from the anaesthetic: “Now I know why the campaign ended like it did.” For what it’s worth, Kinnock’s Labour Party lost the election too.Emotional antennaeBiden’s 2008 loss left less of a mark on him, partly because he became vice-president less than a year later. “How could you begrudge losing to Barack Obama?” says Murray. “Obama was like The Beatles.”The campaign Biden still regrets was the one that he didn’t fight in 2016. His reluctance stemmed from another tragedy, the death in 2015 of his son Beau from brain cancer. But he had little encouragement from Obama, who had already committed to backing Hillary Clinton. Biden’s internal polls show that he would have beaten Trump. But he had little chance of wresting the crown from Clinton, whose machine he could not hope to match.In his memoir Promise Me, Dad, named after Beau’s request that his father stay in politics, Biden recounts his anger following a Politico story that he was exploiting his son’s death for electoral purposes. “It exceeded even my worst expectations of what the opposition was going to be like,” he wrote. In truth, he could not discuss running without breaking down. “He would literally start to cry every time we raised the subject,” says a Biden ­confidante.In another cycle, Biden’s lachrymosity might have been an albatross. During coronavirus, his emotional antennae look like a virtue. More than 165,000 Americans have now died in the pandemic. That toll is likely to be approaching a quarter of a million by early November.Trump’s inability to express condolences for America’s grieving families could not be further apart from Biden’s. In 2016, anger was the dominant political emotion. In 2020, it feels more like sadness. “If Trump were matter, then Biden is anti-matter – their characters are opposites,” says Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has been advising Biden on constitutional matters since the mid-1980s.When Biden was vice-president, Norm Ornstein, a veteran Congressional watcher, lost his son in a tragic accident. “The moment he heard, Biden telephoned and spent an hour on the phone with me and my wife, talking us through it,” says ­Ornstein. “The next day I received a handwritten letter of condolence from him. There is nothing fake about his sympathy. He feels it deeply.”Andrew Yang, the maverick hit of the Democratic primaries, says: “When most people hadn’t figured out who I was, Joe took me aside and was very gracious and friendly. This was just as true when things were going badly for him – he’s always steady and good-natured, in public and in private.”‘Shoot. Me. Now’Some in Biden’s world admit they have one or two concerns about the election and beyond. Chief of these is his tendency to make gaffes. In that sense, the lockdown has a silver lining: there is no campaign trail to avoid. Zoom is easier to manage.When Obama was elected to the US Senate in 2004, Biden invited him to join the foreign relations committee, of which he was chairman. Having listened to a trademark Biden disquisition, Obama scribbled a note and handed it to a staffer. It read: “Shoot. Me. Now.”When the two men were discussing how they would handle their White House relationship, Obama said: “I want your advice Joe, I just want it in 10-minute, not 60-minute, increments.” For the most part, Biden complied.Sometimes, he could not help himself. The term “Bidenism” – self-inflicted public humiliation – has long been in currency. “Stand up Chuck, let ’em see ya,” Biden once said to a Missouri state senator in a wheelchair. “Folks, I can tell you, I’ve known eight presidents, three of them intimately,” he said in praise of Obama, adding: “I promise you, the president has a big stick, I promise you,” in a mangled rendition of Theodore Roosevelt’s dictum about speaking softly and carrying a big stick.Fear of such miscues saw the Obama camp “quarantine” Biden for most of the 2012 re-election campaign. This year’s actual quarantine could thus be helpful.Many in Biden world are betting that his choice of Kamala Harris as running mate will immunise him against a record of racial gaffes. Earlier this year, Biden apologised after saying that “you ain’t black” if you would consider voting against him. As a mixed-race American of Indian and Jamaican heritage, the Harris pick will buy Biden more protection.Given Biden’s age, she is far likelier than most running mates to become president. As Biden discovered in the primaries, she also knows how to throw a punch.It is hard to find anyone in Biden’s circle who is losing sleep over three debates with Trump later this year. As Biden showed in 2008 with Sarah Palin and in 2012 with Paul Ryan – the Republican running mates of John McCain and Mitt Romney – he is a surprisingly taut debater.Trump, meanwhile, seems to be afflicted with his own severe dose of logorrhea. His recent boast in a Fox News interview that he recalled five words in order in a cognitive test was greeted with mockery. “I have two words for you,” says a senior adviser, when I ask about Biden’s age and prolixity: “Donald Trump. ”Biden’s peopleNor is the campaign worried about Twitter. When I asked two Biden officials whether he composed his own tweets, or would know how to send one, I got an unexpectedly constipated response: “No one has ever asked us that.” It turns out that Biden does not physically send his own tweets but is involved with their substance.Their second concern is ageing. At 74, Trump is only a smidgen younger than Biden. The difference with Trump is the people with whom Biden would surround himself. Chief among these is Ron Klain, a long-standing Biden aide who is likely to be White House chief of staff. Tony Blinken would probably be his national security adviser.Other top-job contenders would include Tom Donilon and Susan Rice (successive national security advisers to Obama), Kurt Campbell (who ran Asia policy for Obama), Jake Sullivan (who leads Biden’s campaign policy), Nick Burns, a former under secretary of state, and Bill Burns (no relation), a former deputy secretary of state. Michèle Flournoy, a former under secretary of defence, is tipped as a likely Pentagon chief.One adviser predicted that Biden would choose Romney, the Republican senator from Utah, as his secretary of state. That would annoy Vladimir Putin’s Russia, whom Romney described as America’s “number one geopolitical foe”. It would also upset most Democrats for very different reasons.Either way, the contrast between Biden’s friends and the parade of often bizarre cameos that have staffed the Trump administration is glaring. The current president is now on his fourth chief of staff and sixth national security adviser. By contrast, most of Biden’s coterie have known him for decades.“What leaps out about Biden’s people is their competence,” says John Podesta, a senior official in both the Clinton and Obama White Houses. “Neither he nor his team need training wheels.”There are also lingering worries about Hunter Biden, who has long been a source of concern for his father. “Joe has a total blind spot about Hunter,” says a close family friend.Hunter was discharged from the US Navy because he tested positive for cocaine. He launched various business ventures while his father was vice-president. He was accused of monetising the Biden name and subsequently got a seat on the board of a Ukrainian gas company.Trump’s attempts to extort Ukraine to supply Biden opposition research resulted in his impeachment last year (though he was acquitted by the Senate). “The campaign just has to keep Hunter out of the picture,” says the friend.Radical platformWhat would Biden actually do in office? Tackling the pandemic would be the first, second and third priority of any incoming president. Little can happen while the US economy is under semi-­permanent lockdown.Beyond that his economic platform is radical by the standards of any recent Democratic president, including Obama. “We would have the largest mobilisation of investments since world war two,” says Feldman. “We would start by putting pandemic logistics and supply on a war footing.”Some people compare the gargantuan challenges of today to 1932, when Franklin D Roosevelt won the election in the middle of the Great Depression. In spite of running a fairly bland campaign, FDR then embarked on a streak of “bold, persistent experimentation” that would remake America.But the differences are more interesting. For all its ravages, coronavirus is not as intractable as the Great Depression. By next January, the world should be closer to having a vaccine. Biden would also be fulfilling the first rule of any job – always follow an under-performer.He could achieve a lot in his first 100 days simply by covering the basics, such as launching a national coronavirus plan, shunning Twitter and not insulting foreign leaders. “If you have an American president at foreign summits eating with his mouth closed and not throwing cutlery around, the world will give him a standing ovation,” says one adviser and friend.Low-hanging foreign-policy fruit that Biden would pluck in his opening days include rejoining the World Health Organisation, the Paris agreement on climate change and the Iran nuclear deal, says Jake Sullivan. He would also convene a global summit to tackle Covid-19.Domestic steps would include stopping work on the US-Mexico border wall (such as it is), setting up a daily coronavirus briefing led by Dr Anthony Fauci or Ron Klain (who led Obama’s Ebola team) and picking an attorney general who would embrace planks of Black Lives Matter’s criminal-justice reform agenda.In his dealings both with Republicans and foreign leaders, Biden would place great stock in personal chemistry. Enjoying the company of people is one area where Biden is as different to Obama as he is to Trump. “The thing that Biden most likes is what Obama liked the least – the ­personal stuff,” says Podesta. Nick Burns says Biden revels in the “constant gardening” of diplomacy – talking frequently to his counterparts.Wishful thinkingSceptics point out that today’s Republican Party is unrecognisable to the one with which Biden grew up. Should he emerge intact from transition with a paranoid Trump, the chances of the defeated party working with him will be slim. Woke nativism will prove a more durable pathogen than Covid-19.Moreover, Biden’s global honeymoon would be unlikely to last long. Most people view his musings about restoring the status quo ante – going back to the world before Trump – as wishful thinking, not that geopolitical trends were particularly stable during the Obama years.China looms far larger today than it did in 2016. Biden’s favourite European, Angela Merkel, Germany’s chancellor, is due to retire by next year. And Biden will neither be inclined – nor likely in a position – to offer Britain’s Boris Johnson the US-UK trade deal he craves.Tony Blinken, Biden’s senior foreign policy adviser, says Biden’s scepticism about Obama’s ineffectual Afghanistan surge looks better and better in hindsight. “I respect Gates tremendously but he just wanted approval for his Afghanistan plan and Biden disagreed,” he says. Biden was in favour of US intervention in Bosnia in 1995, he adds, to convey that Biden is not some ­inveterate peacenik.But Biden’s biggest migraine would probably be at home. In the coming weeks, Trump is likely to make a lot of Biden’s “socialist” agenda – the hundreds of billions he has pledged to spend on everything from college education to rural broadband.Should Biden follow Obama’s example and pick Wall Street-friendly economic advisers, the left’s distrust would soon resurface. Last week, Lawrence Summers, Obama’s chief economic adviser and Bill Clinton’s Treasury secretary, ruled out joining a Biden administration. “My time in government is behind me,” he told the Aspen Security Forum.Happy passengerTo many people’s surprise, the left has largely fallen into line. Bernie Sanders dropped nearly all his most-cherished demands to agree a joint platform with Biden. This is in stark contrast to Sanders’s stand-offish – and simmeringly uneasy – ceasefire with Hillary Clinton in 2016.An estimated one-fifth of Sanders’s supporters in 2016 either sat on their hands or voted for Trump. Biden has not adopted a universal basic income, Medicare for all or a wealth tax – Sanders’s top three priorities.Yet the Vermont senator seems to be a happy passenger on Amtrak Joe’s train. Their policies may differ but their values are not miles apart. “Biden believes that his ultimate calling is to make life better for the middle class,” says Jared Bernstein, an economic adviser. “His watchword is ‘dignity.’” Ted Kaufman adds: “Biden and Bernie may disagree ideologically but they respect each other’s integrity.”Might such charms work on Republicans? I spoke to many people in Biden’s world and none thought the Republican leopard was likely to change its spots. One said: “Joe is still a romantic about the Senate. He will have to learn the hard way.”The omens for old-fashioned Biden-style bipartisanship are not cheerful. Yet there is an improbability to Biden’s odyssey that should give anyone pause. The lyrics may be corny. The music is not. It is an odd mix of Shakespearean tragedy and Shakespearean comedy.I have heard people describe Biden as the embodiment of America’s can-do spirit. Shailagh Murray called him a “spiritual optimist”. A campaign official talked of his “strategic empathy”. I have also heard people call Biden a “clown”, including a former Obama official.Biden loves to talk of when “the man meets the moment”. The joke is that he has said this about himself every time he has run for office. There has never been a moment where Biden does not think he should be residing in the White House.But like a stopped clock, perhaps this time he is right. “Life is about choices, right?” says a former senior CIA official who has interacted with Biden over more than three decades. “Biden or Trump?” He admitted that he occasionally saw Biden as a “mediocre” politician. But he added that Biden always struck him as fundamentally decent, which sounds like a subversive quality in today’s Washington.“Even if you thought that Biden was mediocre,” he continued, “you would take mediocre over catastrophic every time.”– Copyright The Financial Times Limited 2020Full coverage of the US presidential election 2020Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"new zealands lust lockdown latest example vapid political virtue","story":"Progressive mythology always demands a socialist valhalla a nation to be idealised and held as up an inspiration. For years, Scandinavia, and particularly Sweden, played this role. The stereotype was never entirely accurate Scandinavian social democracy is a far cry from full-throated socialism, yet it remained influential.In the face of the pandemic, however, the tables have turned now it is the libertarian Right who are lining up to applaud Swedish exceptionalism, while progressives liken their controversial strategy to a form of eugenics. With Sweden consigned to the naughty step, the Left needs a new country to fetishise, and they have alighted on New Zealand.This was underway long before the virus arrived, thanks to NZ’s intoxicating combination of centre-left politics and a charismatic, young and importantly, female, leader: Jacinda Ardern. Her decisive leadership following the mass shooting in Christchurch propelled the New Zealand PM to global prominence, and she has since enjoyed fawning media coverage surpassing even the high water-mark of Trudeau-mania.The Left applauded NZ’s “wellbeing budget”, emphasising citizens’ happiness over GDP growth, and cheered when Ardern brought her baby into the UN assembly hall. Their zero-tolerance approach to Covid-19 has been especially influential. A group of weak-minded MPs and peers are currently urging our own Government to pursue a similar aim of total eradication.We should be under no illusion - this is no model for New Zealand to follow, let alone a sophisticated global economy like ours. NZ may have contained the virus, for now at least, registering the lowest mortality rates in the OECD, but it has taken genuinely draconian policies and great economic pain to get there. The Ardern administration is eliminating rights on a scale more reminiscent of authoritarian China than a Western liberal democracy.Last week, the whole of Auckland was sent into lockdown after the government announced a grand total of four new cases in the capital. GDP has taken its biggest slide in three decades. A total ban on foreign arrivals has endured for months, with catastrophic results for tourism, directly employing 8.4 per cent of the workforce. New Zealanders returning from abroad must pay for the privilege of isolating in military-guarded facilities, to the tune of more than £1,500 per head. One man recently received a six-week jail sentence for hugging a friend quarantining in a detention centre.The NZ experience should serve as a cautionary tale about the normalisation of overreach. Though the country has not recorded a single covid death since May, the government decided to postpone the Autumn elections following the small-scale outbreak this month. Progressives, so alert to the subversion of democracy in the USA, had little to say about this extraordinary over-reaction.An elimination strategy has made them hostages to fortune with precedence established, it will be politically toxic to change course. Ardern has ridden high in the polls so far, but if such disruption continues, public appetite for keeping the country virus-free at any cost will surely wane, and the recent outbreak, despite NZ’s geographic isolation and its draconian policy response, suggests no country can postpone the inevitable.The implications of New Zealand’s autarchy go beyond its shores as well. Tourism accounts for a third of jobs in Fiji, Palau and Vanuatu and two thirds of their visitors come from Australia and New Zealand. Yet amid mounting poverty and unemployment, island leaders’ pleadings for air bridges seem barely to have registered with an administration myopically focused on elimination. In seeking to be kind, the Ardern administration has ended up being very cruel indeed.Enthusiasts for this model imply that elimination, like the happiness budget, and like Ardern herself, puts people above the callous vicissitudes of the balance sheet. As we are increasingly finding, the two cannot be so easily disentangled. Excessively harsh lockdowns have become a form of international virtue-signalling something only wealthy nations can afford, but which promises catastrophe for the world’s poorest.Before the recent spike, commentators lauded Ardern as being “on course to eradicate the virus completely.” The ambition was childish and hubristic in the extreme. Until the planet reaches a state of elimination, New Zealand will have to stay in indefinite isolation, with domestic lock-downs a likely fixture of life, perhaps for years to come. The economy cannot bear this for long. Nor can the people.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"report shows covid 19 case across europe numbers tracking raising","story":"A new report from Europe’s main health agency shows Covid-19 case numbers are tracking up, raising the possibility of an impending second wave for Europe.Infection rates across the continent rose continuously for the 31 days to August 19 and reached 37 per 100,000 people in the EUEAA and the UK.The trend has continued, if not worsened, over the last week.The figures, released by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), add to growing concern over a resurgence of coronavirus.Reporting on week 33 of the pandemic, the ECDC found 18 countries reported significant increases in the number of positive cases.This included the UK as well as Austria, Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden.Although part of the increase was linked to increased testing, the proportion of positive tests have been increasing in France, Netherlands, Slovenia and Greece. In total, had a weekly test positivity of 3 per cent or higher.Data for hospitalisations and deaths is more encouraging but not stable.“Hospital andor ICU occupancies andor new admissions due to Covid-19 have recently increased in Bulgaria, Czechia, Greece, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. No other increases have been observed, although data availability varies”, the report said.“Increases in the 14-day Covid-19 death notification rates compared to those reported seven days ago have been observed in two countries (Belgium and Romania)..”While the increasing number of cases is not yet reflected by an increase in deaths across Europe, experts warn this could change as transmission among the young works its way through the population.Spain could offer confirmation, reporting an uptick in deaths in recent days.Authorities in Madrid on Friday advised residents in areas with a high level of coronavirus cases to stay at home as it logged 1,199 infections in 24 hours.The new outbreak is beginning to threaten the health system, with three Madrid hospitals announcing this week that they are starting to cancel operations.Unlike Spain, France and Croatia, Greece so far has avoided being added to the UK’s quarantine red list.Despite this, Greece recorded its highest ever number of cases in one day on August 14, with local lockdowns reintroduced in several areas.Greek tourism chiefs have pleaded with the UK Government not to add the country to the quarantine red list, as it seeks to boost its economy with bookings.British holidaymakers returning from Croatia have this weekend vented their anger at the sudden change in quarantine rules.Transport Secretary Grant Shapps announced on Thursday that travellers returning to the UK from Croatia after 4am on Saturday would have to quarantine for 14 days.Passengers arriving at Heathrow Airport after Saturday\u0027s early morning deadline spoke of having no time to travel back from the country ahead of the deadline.France, Germany and Italy meanwhile all saw their biggest daily rise in cases since the spring this week.The number of new coronavirus infections in Germany topped 2,000 in the past 24 hours, a high not seen since the end of April.Italy reported 1,071 new coronavirus infections in the past 24 hours, the health ministry said on Saturday, exceeding 1,000 cases in a day for the first time since May.Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president, urged people to act on health advice on Saturday after official data showed 2,328 new cases in the past 24 hours.Please help doctors, be careful. We really did not have the first wave (of infections) when it happened in Europe. Now it is coming.Seasonal factors could influence the evolution of the current Covid‐19 pandemic - meaning the situation could worsen as we move into colder months.Experts have predicted human-to-human transmission of the virus will become more widespread in winter.One study estimated that for every one per cent drop in relative humidity, confirmed Covid-19 cases increased by seven to eight per cent.In Britain it was announced on Friday that the R rate may now exceed one - the point at which cases start to grow exponentially - for the first time since the first peak.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"soft bigotry lower standards minority kids","story":"The so-called “anti-racist” movement is inspiring a wave of ignorance and soft bigotry in American schools. I fear that Britain will be next.Uncommon Schools – the world-renowned charter schools whose managing director, Doug Lemov, released the much celebrated Teach Like a Champion book – announced a sudden and complete change of direction this week in order to become “an increasingly anti-racist organisation” that promotes “social justice”.What does this look like in practice? They will no longer enforce a policy encouraging pupils to listen in class ties will no longer be a uniform requirement pupils will be able to wear trainers instead of shoes detentions will no longer be given out for “minor infractions” all staff will be trained in unconscious bias and teachers will be asked to “manage their own emotions in conflict situations”.No doubt these changes are well-intentioned, but they also reinforce the prejudice of low expectations. The idea that black and minority ethnic students can’t be expected to listen to the teacher or to dress smartly is insulting enough, but to suggest that black people cannot be expected to behave and therefore shouldn’t be given detentions is outrageous.Similarly, Kipp charter schools in the US released a statement this week aiming to eliminate systemic racism and “anti-Blackness” with a new set of policies, including the “elimination of inequitable discipline practices”. They will also be retiring their “Work hard. Be nice” slogan. Why? Because it “places value on being compliant and submissive” and “supports the illusion of meritocracy”. In other words, dedication and kindness are fraudulent. This lunacy is already spreading across the Atlantic. Just this week, a lecturer in education from Brunel University London published a series of tweets berating Teach Like a Champion, claiming that for teachers to correct their pupils’ grammar is punitive, discriminatory and oppressive.Come on. Surely it’s a teacher’s duty to ensure all pupils have the knowledge and skills required to express themselves fluently and grammatically in speech and text? We must promote the proper use of language as a universally understood and respected tool of communication. It is my job, as an educator, to set high expectations for all pupils, because that is how they will achieve success.Teach Like a Champion is more than a book it is a methodology, one that promotes high standards for all. That is true equality, and it’s done well for institutions in disadvantaged areas such as Katharine Birbalsingh’s Michaela Community School in Wembley (Work Hard, Be Kind) and Bedford Free School (Respect, Honesty, High Expectations). These are schools that focus on respect and kindness and expect hard work from all, which is why their pupils leave with such high grades.We cannot allow the bigotry of low expectations to take over our schools to the detriment of young people’s education.Calvin Robinson is a school governor and former assistant principal.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/08/23/12/colin-farrell.jpg","title":"colin farrell penguin the batman trailer photo clip","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Irish actor stars in the forthcoming movie opposite Robert Pattinson, Zoe Kravitz and Paul DanoColin Farrell is completely unrecognisable as The Penguin in the first trailer for Matt Reeves’s The Batman. Fans have been tweeting about the dramatic transformation of the Irish actor, who stars opposite Robert Pattinson‘s Batman, as well as Zoe Kravtiz and Paul Dano.While there are plenty of talking points in the clip, which was shared by Reeves at the DC FanDome event on 22 August, it’s Farrell who has everyone worked up. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis appearance, which was achieved with the help of prosthetics, is so different that many fans claimed they didn’t even realise it was him. “The craziest thing about The Batman trailer is that this is Colin Farrell,” one person tweeted.Writer and director Ben Mekler tweeted: “Colin Farrell in prosthetics as a character actor from the NY theater scene who breaks out with a best supporting actor nom for a stand-out role in a Coen Bros movie at age 53 as The Penguin is a vibe.”A number of fans said they had confused Farrell with fellow actor, Curb Your Enthusiasm star Richard Kind.In July, Farrell praised the script for the forthcoming movie and said it is unlike any previous adaptations.“The whole prospect is really exciting,” he said. “I’m ecstatic to be part of that universe. There are certain words that are part of my internal lexicon and those words are Gotham City, Penguin, Joker, Batman, Bruce Wayne, Harvey Dent... all of those things.“I have been watching the Batman films with my kids, but this script is something that feels incredibly original.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Auction: Ai Weiwei’s Small Plate with Flowers, 2014, is among lots including works by Bridget Riley and Yinka Shonibare"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/20/15/weiwei1407a.jpg","title":"help the hungry campaign artwork auction ai weiwei tracey emin","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.\u0026nbspWorks by Ai Weiwei, Tracey Emin and Bridget Riley feature in Sotheby’s sale for food surplus charity The Felix Project “We have only got each other.” What could be more true? At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

Andy McDonald, the shadow secretary for employment rights, was forced to pay the funds back to parliament’s spending watchdog.MPs are allowed to rent out part of their local constituency offices. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut they have to hand the income over to the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA), which was set up in the wake of the expenses scandal a decade ago. The missing payments were uncovered only after IPSA carried out an inquiry into the subletting of MPs’ offices. Under the rules MPs are also required to charge an appropriate fee for renting out the space.MPs offered extra £10,000 to help with cost of working from homeDozens of MPs are thought to sublet their local offices, often to councillors from the same political party. Details released by IPSA under a Freedom of Information (FOI) request show Mr McDonald had let out part of his office to the local Middlesbrough Labour Group.IPSA said that the rent charged had been £250 a year and that Mr McDonald had repaid £750. But a spokesman for Mr McDonald said the real figure repaid had been £500, with the final years’ rent simply handed over at the same time.  A spokesman for McDonald said:  As soon as Andy became aware, he reimbursed the money and now ensures all repayments are made on time. He apologises for the error.A Labour Party spokesman said: The public rightly expect all MPs to follow the rules to the letter and IPSA is right to ensure payments are made on time.The FOI also shows other Labour MPs also had to repay money for their sublet office.

Ian Mearns, the Labour MP for Gateshead also repaid £1,200 after charging rent of £120 a month. The name of his tenant was withheld by IPSA.  Last night Mr Mearns said there had been no deliberate attempt to defraud IPSA.He added: “I had no knowledge there was a problem of this nature and I think it has been dealt with in a routine way by my office management staff”.      The IPSA review looked into the subletting arrangements of 33 MPs, less than one in twenty, suggesting the problem could be a much more widespread.The watchdog conceded that there had been little oversight of the system. All of Westminster\u0027s 650 MPs have now been reminded of their duty to declare any revenue from subletting their offices.An IPSA spokesman said: “Subletting is within the rules and can be beneficial when it enables MPs to have sufficient office space to serve their constituents, whilst also returning some funds to taxpayers.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesGood Law Project’s letter claims the contract was unlawfully granted without any tender process and there was bias in play due to the company owners’ links to Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings. Ofqual’s controversial algorithm to be reviewed, regulatory body saysHow foreseeable was the A-level and GCSE fiasco, really?Government lifts cap on medical student places after A-level chaos A new grading system for qualifications had to be set up this year after exams were cancelled due to coronavirus. The government announced days after A-level results day that A-level and GCSE students could take teacher-assessed grades, following outcry over tens of thousands of A-level results being moderated down.An Ofqual spokesperson told  usual tendering rules did not apply to their contract with Public First  “due to the exceptional circumstances presented by the cancellation of exams” and “due to the need to urgently procure the work”. Good Law Project have said in their letter they believe there was enough time for a procurement process to go ahead after exams were cancelled in March.Exams fiasco ‘will be nothing compared to brewing scandal’ next yearRachel Wolf and James Frayne, the married couple who run Public First, “appear to have close personal and professional connections” with both Mr Gove, the Cabinet Office minister, and Mr Cummings, the UK prime minister’s chief adviser, their letter to Ofqual claims.

Ofqual, Downing Street and the Cabinet Office have been approached by The Independent. Public First turned down a request for comment. An Ofqual spokesperson said: “Ofqual will respond to any correspondence in due course, once it has been received.”A government spokesperson said: “This is categorically untrue.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.It was a moment that had been a long, long time coming, and when it did Kamala Harris grasped it with both hands.On a night freighted with history, the senator from California officially accepted the Democratic Party’s nomination to be vice president, the first woman of colour thus selected by a major party, and only the sixth woman in total in the US ever added to a ticket.In a speech that spread over more 15 minutes, and perhaps representing the de facto keynote address on the third night of the convention despite top billing going to Barack Obama, her words were at once warm and hopeful, yet firm. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesShe paid respect to the political pioneers that had gone before her, breaking the ground that would help allow a black American woman of South Asian heritage, build a career such as hers. And she paid tribute to her family, particularly her mother, Shyamala Gopalan Harris, who came to the US at the age of 18, and raised Kamala and her sister after their parents orced. She died in 2009. Ms Harris said that when her mother gave birth to her, aged just 25, at Kaiser Hospital in Oakland, California, she may have struggled to see just what lay in store for her daughter.DNC 2020“On that day, she probably could have never imagined that I would be standing before you now speaking these words: I accept your nomination for vice president of the United States of America,” she said. Ever since Joe Biden indicated in March of this year that were he to secure the nomination he would choose a woman as his running mate, there had been widespread anticipation he would select a woman of colour. Such a strategy appeared all the more vital and fair, following the killing by police in Minneapolis of an unarmed black man, triggering protests for racial justice that swept not just across the US, but around the world.In selecting the 55-year-old former prosecutor, Mr Biden said his main priority had been to find someone who could step into the job on day one, not merely a sound bite for a 77-year-old man, who will be the nation’s oldest president by far should he defeat Donald Trump in November.In her comments, Ms Harris noted that this week marked the 100th anniversary of the passage of the 19th amendment, which gave some women – white women – the right to vote.“So many of the black women who helped secure that victory were still prohibited from voting, long after its ratification. But they were undeterred,” she said. “Without fanfare or recognition, they organised, testified, rallied, marched, and fought—not just for their vote, but for a seat at the table.” No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

And these women inspired us to pick up the torch, and fight on.”She named several female civil rights and political leaders — “Mary Church Terrell and Mary Mcleod Bethune. Fannie Lou Hamer and Diane Nash. Constance Baker Motley and Shirley Chisholm”. Ms Chisholm was both the first black congresswoman and the first black woman to make a run for the White House, back in 1972.“We’re not often taught their stories,” she added. “But as Americans, we all stand on their shoulders.”Trump’s strategy for dealing with the DNC is about to backfireMichelle Obama to hail Biden’s ‘grit and passion’ Why I can’t shake my disgust about being forced to vote for BidenMichelle Obama’s keynote speech at DNC expected to be major hitHer comments followed by an equally impassioned and hard-edged address by Mr Obama, who probably for the first time in four years in public, criticised Mr Trump by name. He said he feared for the state of the nation’s democracy should he secure a second term.“I did hope, for the sake of our country, that Donald Trump might show some interest in taking the job seriously that he might come to feel the weight of the office and discover some reverence for the democracy that had been placed in his care,” said Mr Obama. “But he never did.“If Mr Obama’s speech was heavy, and sombre, Ms Harris was able to inject a fair degree of energy into her words. Joe Biden will be relying on this verve to drive his campaign in the final three months, across a country beset by anxiety, economic hardship and the challenge of combatting the coronavirus pandemic. “Years from now, this moment will have passed,” said Ms Harris.  “And our children and our grandchildren will look in our eyes and they’re gonna ask us: Where were you when the stakes were so high? And we will tell them, not just how we felt – we will tell them what we did.” Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I can excuse the caution of Boris Johnson and Gavin Williamson deciding it was better to be safe than sorry in the early days of an unknown pandemic.But as the weeks turned into months and Generation Corona effectively lost a school year, I will never forgive the militant teaching unions for keeping them shut regardless of the social cost.It was a partisan play designed to damage a Tory government at a time when politics should not have mattered one iota.Unfortunately, the A-levels mess this week was depressingly inevitable from the moment the school gates slammed shut.A knee-jerk decision to cancel all exams without waiting to seethere was a way they could be sat in a socially distanced manner meant the current crisis was unavoidable.This situation CANNOT ever be repeated — but I’m fearful it’s already happening.Coronavirus is now being used as an excuse not to provide anything slightly dficult or complicated in all areas of our lives.But when it comes to education, the costs of that lazy caution are too great.I don’t know about you, but much of the development I experienced at school was down to my social interactions and extracurricular activities, rather than solely what was taught on the blackboard.Yet many schools are intending to use Covid- to justy axing breakfast and after-school clubs, banning music lessons and school productions, and stopping sports.It breaks my heart to see these opportunities indefinitely wrested from our youngsters with no scientic evidence to back up why.But it is being caused by a desire from adults to avoid ato normality.A King’s College London study this week revealed a majority of the public are supportive of our nightmarish “new normal”, with  per cent believing employees should be able to keep working at home until a vaccine is discovered and administered.This is cloud cuckoo land thinking. While the progress in Russia and at Oxford University looks positive, there is no guarantee we are going to have a vaccine at all.  So here’s an unpleasant newsflash: Covid is going to be part of our lives for many years. After all, smallpox is the only infectious disease to ever have been eradicated.Selfish adults can ruin their own lives by giving in to irrational hysteria, but they shouldn’t be allowed to destroy the fair education of our kids.The fightback against militant education unions, box-ticking bureaucrats and cruel social distancing regulations for students must begin today.MUCH media attention this past week has been focused on Labour MP Dawn Butler’s dubious claim that London cops are institutionally racist because they pulled over her and a black mate, even though they were driving in a vehicle with tinted windows, meaning the officers had NO IDEA of their colour.What’s far more disturbing is the release of new figures showing violent assaults on Met officers have increased by  per cent in the past three months, coinciding with a period of social unrest sparked by coronavirus and Black Lives Matter protests.Our police are under attack from all angles.They are filmed by baying members of the public desperate to show discrimination but unable to release their own body cam footage.They are accused of racism simply for arresting criminals.Andwe’re not careful, they will give up trying to stop many crimes because the potential repercussions aren’t worth it.DISTURBING news for celebrity lovers: The stars you probably think are nice are usually utter horrors in real le and those with bad reputations publicly are often delightful off camera.That’s my experience after two decades reporting on the entertainment industry both here and in Hollywood.So I’m fascinated to see a celebrity not being nice is now an offence that can see them be “cancelled”, becausethat goes on, there won’t be many left on the telly.This week, in one of the biggest celebrity reporting injustices I’ve ever seen, Nadia Sawalha was hit by claims she is nasty behind the scenes.Believe me, I saw it all over ten years working at ITV Daytime, but can vouch that the Loose Women star is one of the kindest and most genuine people I have ever met in the toxic world of showbiz.To suggest she is some sort of fake is beyond the pale.Nadia is adored by everyone backstage, her best friend is one of the broadcaster’s make-up artists, and she cares deeply about the folk she works with.While some TV stars don’t know the names of crew members they’ve worked with for years, Nadia befriends most of them.The vulnerable, self-deprecating, caring and honest-to-a-fault list you see on Loose is the real woman I know and adore.FIRST the US broadcaster HBO axed Gone With The Wind, before introducing a so-called “trigger warning” to the start of the classic film.Now it has sparked further outrage by doing the same thing to the Mel Brooks classic Blazing Saddles.If this woke attack on our culture continues, soon virtually every old film favourite will come with a sombre introduction by a liberal university professor outlining the social ills you’re about to witness.That got me thinking about what will end up being said before my three favourite films of all time :Grease: Contains ious examples of toxic masculinity, with Kenickie inappropriately invoking rape culture when he asks DannySandy “put up a fight”.The Wizard Of Oz: The scarecrow uses make-up to change the colour of his skin in an early example of blackface.The Sound Of Music: Glamorises a handsome young Nazi soldier called Rolf and features emotional abuse by the captain of his children, including the use of a whistle for discipline.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But celebration must be tempered with pragmatism: The scarring effects of lockdown will be felt for months,not years, to come.For a full recovery, we must all make a concerted effort to shore up the economy by going out to work, pubs and the shops.JUSTICE Jeremy Baker, who sentenced Manchester Arena co-conspirator Hashem Abedi to a record  years behind bars, is a credit to our justice system.Working with his brother, bomber Salman Abedi, the depraved criminal inflicted unimaginable suffering on innocent young victims and their families. And he did it in cold blood.Long sentences for convicted terrorists will help eradicate jihadism in Britain. The longer these servants of evil are locked up, the fewer opportunities they have to spread their deathly message.But we must do more.We must force social media giants to silence those who incite terror. We must give police power and resources to monitor suspects. And we must stop terrorists who are abroad ing home.Then, and only then, do we stand a chance of stamping out this poisonous ideology once and for all.WE are delighted that Germany’s attempt to snatch billions of pounds of banking business from Brexit Britain has failed.But it comes as no surprise: It was clear from the off that financial big-wigs wouldn’t dream of trading London for Frankfurt.We hope anti-British doom-mongers who said otherwise are red-faced today.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In the Iowa caucuses, the first electoral contest of the campaign to become his party’s candidate, the -year old finished in a humiliating fth place. “I’m not going to sugarcoat it. We took a gut punch,” Biden declared after the disastrous result. One commentator on the news outlet CNBC was even more scathing: “His presidential hopes are finished.”Yet today, Biden stands on the threshold of the Oval Office. Victory is in his grasp. Having clawed his way back into the primaries and won the Democratic nomination to challenge Donald Trump, he could soon be the most powerful man on Earth. It is certainly his fight to lose. Some nationwide opinion polls put him no less than  points ahead of Trump, whose popularity has taken a battering because of the coronavirus crisis and the consequent economic recession. This week’s Democratic convention, including his own powerful, well-crafted speech last night, will have done nothing to undermine his lead.But with some worrying signs of mental decline, Bidens coronation could mean the reigns of power are actually handed to the hardline leftists around him - rather than to the ageing politician himself.What makes Biden’s comeback all the more remarkable is that his two previous attempts to reach the White House failed so miserably. In  his campaign fell apart after he was exposed plagiarising one of the speeches made by Neil Kinnock during the British General Election the previous year. Some of the passages were lted almost word for word. “Why am I the first Kinnock in a thousand generations to be able to go to university ” asked the Labour Leader.“Why is Joe Biden the first in his family ever to go to university ” asked the Democratic Senator. It does not say much for either Biden’s creativity or his judgement that he had to seek secret inspiration from a socialist mediocrity widely known at Westminster as the Welsh Windbag.In  Biden did even worse, dropping out after a woeful performance in the Iowa Caucuses, where he gained just one per cent of the total vote. During the campaign, he regularly put his foot in his mouth, most notoriously when he described his rival Barack Obama as “the first African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice looking guy”.This year, after Iowa, his chances seemed to be heading in the same sorry direction.But then, in the following months, he gradually emerged as the front-runner. This was mainly because the other leading candidates were seen as either too extreme or too unlikeable. Senator Elizabeth Warren was a hard advocate of toxic identity politics who unconvincingly claimed to have Native American blood. Bernie Sanders was North America’s answer to Jeremy Corbyn, complete with revolutionary economics and brutish tax plans. Peter Buttigieg was a sanctimonious mayor of a small city in Indiana, without any experience of the national stage.In contrast, Biden had not only been a Delaware senator for  years, but had also served as Vice-President throughout Obama’s time in the White House. Through these roles, he had built up a reputation as a moderate, helped by his image as an ordinary, down-to-earth guy rather than a member of the Washington elite.The son of a used car salesman, he was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the place where the US version of Ricky Gervais’s comedy The Office was set. His popular appeal was further enhanced by his personal story of having to cope with agonising grief, which he spelt out in raw, emotive terms last night.The catalogue of anguish includes the loss of his first we and daughter, killed in a car accident in  and the death of his son Beau from brain cancer in . Yet none of this can hide a disturbing reality about Biden, one that makes him profoundly unsuited to be the leader of the free world or the commander-in-chief of the US military.It is something that the Democrats have desperately tried to downplay, along with much of the media. But, the fact is that Joe Biden is in steep mental decline. Already by far the oldest Presidential candidate in history, he shows all the signs of advancing senility. He might be able to read effective from an autocue, as he showed last night, but in other settings, away from the podium, he regularly stumbles over his words, confuses facts, loses his train of thought, and lapses into coherence. His supporters say that he has always been “gaffe-prone” and that is true, but the problem goes much deeper. In the past, Biden could be sharp, even witty, as he showed in his triumphant  Vice-Presidential debate against the Republican Paul Ryan.Today, when speaking off the cuff, he struggles to string basic sentences together.Without the help of a teleprompter, this is a man who mixes up his we and sister, gets the names of countries wrong, and keeps repeating the same phrases. In one bizarre outburst in Iowa, he called a female reporter “a lying, dog-faced pony soldier”. In another contribution, he declared that he will “choose truth over facts”. With a delusional grasp of arithmetic, he has said that million women will be put back to work by his tax credit plan, that million Americans have been killed by guns since , and that million have died from Covid-. That is why, throughout the campaign, his minders have tried to keep him in his Delaware home, almost like a hostage. Major interviews have been banned, public appearances strictly rationed. It is a strategy that his team cynically justy by claiming that they want to protect the -year-old candidate from Covid-. But the determination to shield the potential next President from any accountability makes a mockery of democracy.It might seem bizarre that the Democratic party should march under the tattered standard of such a weakened general. But from the viewpoint of political operators on the left, his decline actually makes him an ideal candidate.His senility might have to be concealed from the public, but it can be ruthlessly exploited in private. Broken and bewildered, Biden is a puppet whose strings can easily be pulled by his hidden masters. Behind the thin veneer of his supposed moderation, the radicals can seize power and enact their hardline policies, like defunding the police, imposing financial reparations for slavery, rewriting American history, confiscating wealth, promoting transgender ideology, extending public ownership, and widening the scope of affirmative action. Precisely because he is now an empty vessel, a Biden Presidency would mean the ruthless enforcement of woke dogma. In fact, its unlikely that he will last a full four-year term. Therefore his Vice President Kamala Harris, an ambitious operator can start preparing for her reign.But perhaps she should not be too hasty. The Democrats’ opportunism could backfire badlyvoters become alienated by the idea of an enfeebled President.After all, the American political structure – in contrast to our Parliamentary system – is built on the concept of a strong executive headed by a powerful, elected head of state. Already Trump, never one to pull his punches, is running adverts that highlight concerns about the “cognitive decline” of “Sleepy Joe”. The commercials seem to be having an impact. Almost  per cent of Americans do not think that Biden will serve a full term, while other polls show the race narrowing. Trump could also be boosted by revulsion at the radical Democrats’ agenda, especially the collusion with urban violence.In  widespread unrest fuelled by the civil rights movement enabled the Republican Richard Nixon to defeat the Democrats under Hubert Humphrey. Famously, Nixon said that the “silent majority”, ignored by the media, had spoken. Today the same public mood could give Trump a second term.It would be no more than the Democrats deserve for their eagerness to hide the real Joe Biden.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Politicians have repeatedly let us down, their lack of clarity is baffling and there still appears to be no coherent plan.I’ve watched as people cared for the sick and mourned their dead, and at times, like many of you, I’ve been overwhelmed by dread.Then I look at my friend and colleague Kate Garraway, who has had to bear the burden of her husband Derek being ambushed by Covid- in April.Kate has been extraordinary, which is why I am furious with those who have criticised her for ing to work, when they have absolutely no idea of what she has been going through. She has decided to step back from GMB for a while to concentrate on Derek and their children and those who have criticised her should be ashamed of themselves for making things even more dficult for the whole family. Derek may now be free of the virus but the after-effects have been catastrophic.The poor man has been in an induced coma, and although now more aware of his surroundings, he is still extremely ill.Kate’s mantra “where there is le, there’s hope”, has kept her going, and I reckon on some level Derek is aware of how much she and their children, Darcy, , and -year-old Billy are willing him to make a recovery.Kate has been astonishingly brave and positive throughout this whole ordeal, although she was tearful this week when talking about Derek’s recent birthday. His family sang Happy Birthday to him via Facebook, which must have been bittersweet for all of them.She has had to maintain a brave face for her children and give them some sort of stability for the past five months.To try to further give their lives a bit more normality, Kate went back to work last month.In fact, she was actively encouraged to do so by doctors who felt it was essential for her wellbeing, and frankly, she has to make a living because she has two children to take care of.I know coming back to presenting duties on Good Morning Britain wasn’t easy for Kate, and there have been a few wobbles when she has given updates on how Derek is doing, but all of us are so proud of the way she has coped.That’s why the nasty, malicious carping from moronic trolls is so upsetting. How dare they have a go at Kate for hosting the show and having the “audacity” to smile and laugh at funny items with her co-hosts. It’s sickening, and no matter how much anyone tries to ignore such malevolent cretins, Kate will have been deeply hurt.I had a horrible feeling this might happen, but thankfully the vast majority of viewers wish her nothing but the best, and would be overjoyed to see Derek on the road to recovery. All of us admire Kate’s courage and honesty and know that even in the darkest of times, it’s vital to hang on to positivity and yes, to even have a giggle at something silly or absurd.Watching their mum back on TV gave much needed routine and stability to Darcy and Billy, especially seeing her smile and having fun. They knew it didn’t mean she is not worried sick about their dad, but were well aware he would want her to continue working and providing for the family.As a journalist, Kate has amassed so much knowledge about Covid- and she has also been tested to her very limits.Typically, she wants to pass on that knowledge to help others and is planning to write a book about her experiences and what she has learned during this tough time. It was always her plan to do a self-help book and she had begun it before the pandemic, but now her wise words will be even more relevant and helpful than ever. I can’t wait for the day when Derek is back home, growing stronger every day and the whole family is finally reunited, and I hope she is back at work with us very soon.Happy Birthday Madonna –  years old, mad as a box of frogs but looking utterly radiant surrounded by her children at a party in Jamaica.She can be infuriating and even downright bonkersbut there’s no one quite like her.She’s a trailblazer, was always a staunch ally for the LGBT community before it was trendy and has always paddled her own canoe.Long may Her Madge continue to reign, especially as right now we need some light relief wherever we can get it. I’M not in the least bit surprised that “dad bods” have become so popular among women of all ages. These are the bodies belonging to men who proudly show off rather cute little pot bellies and love handles.Becoming softer round the edges usually happens to blokes after the birth of a couple of kids, when they start to comfort eat due to lack of sleep and stop being obsessed with going to the gym.These boys trade top-of-the-range bikes and tight Lyrca cycling gear for comfy joggers while pushing a pram, and are all the better for it.Having a dad bod is also seen as a sign of confidence, being happy in your own skin and showing that you enjoy le and that having a weekend pizza and a couple of beers is more than OK.I reckon there’s nothing more off-putting than a man with a ripped six-pack who is no stranger to the mirror and exists on steroids and just steamed vegetables.They are usually dull, self-obsessed and not in the least bit alluring.Dad bods are far less intimidating and much more fun to cuddle. Like a lot of men, famous stars including Leonardo DiCaprio and Zac Efron have developed the Dad Bod during lockdown and have been roundly showing off their new physiques.I think they are far more sexy and desirable than when their cheekbones could cut through a home-made loaf. You have to get the balance right, though. When it tips over into a very large balcony hanging over “the nursery” then that’s no longer a Dad Bod but just a big old beer gut and it shows a man who has simply given up and is on a fast track to obesity and a heart attack. BRITNEY Spears is a grown-up woman with two teenage sons, a hugely successful music career and an adoring fan base. But the -year-old has less freedom than an impoverished girl in a Jane Austen novel.Since her much-publicised meltdown in  – when she went into a beauty salon and shaved her head, looking like a little lost deer caught in the headlights – Britney has had very little control over her le.Her father Jamie has legal “conservatorship” over his daughter, basically deciding where and how she lives her le and conducts her career. He also keeps hold of the purse strings.Last year he stepped away from the role, citing health problems of his own . . . and Britney doesn’t want him back.Thirteen years ago she was clearly suffering with mental health issues and needed her father’s help.But now Britney understandably wants control of her own destiny.This week she decided to fight back and took to the courts to have her human rights and civil liberties restored.But her bid was unsuccessful and she will need to wait until February  before taking further action.She is a fragile woman and obviously needs support. But looking at it from the outside, the kind of control her father exerts over Britney’s le seems way too much.Surely some kind of compromise can be reached, with the situation regularly revised to ensure Britney isn’t left feeling trapped like a songbird in a very gilded cage.I SIMPLY cannot begin to imagine the pain actor John Michie and his family are going through right now.This week, the man who supplied the drugs that killed John’s daughter in  had his manslaughter conviction quashed.Louella Fletcher-Michie had gone to a music festival with her boyfriend, Ceon Broughton, who gave her the hallucinogenic C-P drug and filmed her tripping for hours. Belatedly realising she was in real trouble and crying for her mum, he phoned her family. They rushed to the scene but were too late to save her. Crucially, he did not at any point take her to a medical tent or seek expert help.This week a High Court judge decided that evenhe had called for paramedics, it was not clear Louella would have survived – so Broughton’s appeal against his sentence of eight and a half years was upheld. Broughton has to live with his actions but not from behind bars.Meanwhile, John and his family – who have maintained a dignied silence through the most recent twist of the kne in their tragedy – continue to mourn their lost Louella.For them, it is a le sentence of heartbreak and pain.JUST when you thought reality telly’s Below Deck couldn’t get any better, they go and set a whole series in Tahiti.There are all the usual shenanigans. Entitled and demanding guests, the crew squabbling one minute and at it like rabbits the next and Captain Lee sailing above it all while coming out with hilarious one liners like: “I’m madder than a p***ed-on chicken”, which I plan to use as often as possible in my daily le.Meanwhile, all the action takes place amid the amazing sunrises and stunning sunsets of the South Pacic.It’s no exaggeration to say that this utterly ludicrous, vacuous and extremely daft series has kept me sane during these scary times.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

I co-hosted with the brilliant Jayde Adams, we had turns from Kerry Godliman, Shappi Khorsandi, Nathan Caton and Ed Gamble, and video messages from Aisling Bea and Nish Kumar, audiences watching on Zoom — something no one had ever imagined five months ago — on Facebook, and on Twitch, which I had assumed was an app for people in their twenties to chat each other up and worse.It was a brilliant night and the absolute kicker was that we had people in the room with us laughing .They were told not to overdo it for fear of aerosol transmission, but by God it felt good to have a real flesh-and-blood audience in front of me.Because here’s the thing about stand-up comics — they need an audience the way fish need water or Gavin Williamson needs chaos.But what we’ve discovered over the past couple of months, via these streamed gigs and now via gigs like the one I did on Sunday afternoon, in a car park under a gazebo, is that audiences seem to need stand-up too.It’s incredibly flattering, even for an old stager like me. On Sunday I played to  people prepared to ignore what the weather app on their phone might be saying, bring their camping chairs and sit in a car park in Tring, Herts.The comedians all seemed to savour every second of being on stage, of the delicious business of strangers laughing at their jokes together and sharing a mo-ment, a communal moment that means a lot after all these long months of doing what we’ve been asked and staying apart.Psychologically, what that might say about comedians is maybe not the thing we want to dwell on, what sort of wreck would need the laugh-ter of strangers to get them through the day  Move on!But this weekend’s gigs and the ones now springing up all over the country show that we all need the laughs it seems, the audiences too, and that nothing beats seeing it live, right there in front of you. And we can hear the laughs through the masks, don’t worry. There are more and more gigs springing up now, promoters and venues are innovating like mad, councils are doing everything they can to help get things off the ground.Some of these shows are outdoors, weather permitting affairs, some of them are under marquees and the like. Theatres are just getting going with shows with reduced capacity — at some places they’ll take your temperature on the way in, but it’s worth it for the laughs.Listings are popping up all over social media — you’ll find something near you. Don’t miss out. The shows that have been put together so far have been unforgettable and,nothing ,and when theatres do get up and running again, you can say: “Remember the time we saw this comic in a car park ”There’s something pretty exciting about seeing someone you’d have to go to an arena to see playing in a pub garden, too. Andit rains, well, stf upper lip and a good raincoat should get you through that. Hand on heart, the threat to our business is really worrying, like it is to any other right now, becausethe clubs close they will cut off the chance for new comics to get their acts together — literally — and for the new talent to come through. It’s all right for the likes of me, but the people who were set on going to the Edinburgh Fringe this summer — an event that has produced a ton of the funny people you might be familiar with — won’t get the chance for this year to be their year. Everyone has to start somewhere, andthe venues die, the whole thing dies.And that’s why it has been so amazing to see stuff being put on all over, in courtyards, pub gardens, car parks — even the biggest names can be seen doing their thing under an awning or gazebo — the audiences totally up for it and loving every moment. Because stand-up, like le, will find a way.

And lots of parents have been alarmed to see their children stuck at home, in-active and putting on weight.Mr Fry says: “Schools have to do something about this. We will have to measure pupils next month and again in spring to seewhat has been creeping up during this enforced period of inactivity has been countered by being back at school.”I could not agree more that schools need to do something about this issue. But bringing back weighing kids in schools is problematic.Plenty of people have spoken up about how traumatic they found it being weighed at school, and the humiliation of being told they were overweight.But much worse is how many people have said that was the trigger for a letime of disordered eating.Jameela Jamil, the star of Netflix sitcom The Good Place, says: “Being weighed at school was truly the minute my eating disorder started at . I can trace it back to that exact day.”Cycling champ Elinor Barker, who won gold at the  Rio Olympics, reckons her own experience as an elite athlete shows “lighter is not always better”.She says: “I was the heaviest I’ve ever been when I won the Olympics. At my lightest I could barely get through a training week.”I have not heard anyone credit school weigh-ins with keeping them fit and healthy, with a balanced and positive relationship to food.Weighing children is problematic for so many reasons. It sends the message that they alone are responsible for their weight, when in fact taking care of their bodies with the right food and exercise is as much down to their parents, their school and the adults around them.But also, it becomes a form of body-shaming, and encourages children to focus only on the digits on the scales rather than the much bigger picture.It can plant the seeds of a letime of dficulty around food and is very often counterproductive.There are so many other ways to help children take responsibility for their own health.Schools need to make sports fun, ied and accessible to all children.In particular, they need to find ways to encourage teenage girls to participate, as this is the age when they often drop out of sports.School meals need to be healthy and delicious.And schools need to take meal times seriously and encourage children to do the same.We also need to inspire children to want to be healthy and fit. What about more talks in schools from sportsmen and women on how to exercise and what to eat  They are such good role models.Parents also have a massive role. We lead by example andwe have an unhealthy relationship with food, it’s likely our children will too.If we teach children about what their body needs to work properly, and how to cook tasty, nutritious meals which deliver that, they will be engaged in a positive way that has nothing to do with shame or guilt.HAPPY nd birthday, Madonna.She and toyboy Ahlamalik Williams, celebrated with an extravagant bash at Jamaica’s GoldenEye resort.And anyone who saw photos and videos of her shenanigans could be forgiven for thinking she is half her age.As she left the island, she posted on Instagram: “Thank you Jamaica. We have picked your flowers, eaten your fruit, danced to your music, enjoyed every sunset.”Whatever you think of her, there is something enviable about her ability to make the most of le.I hope I look as good as she does at her age but, more importantly, I hope I am still having as much fun.Some say: “Grow old gracefully.”She proves it is much more fun to grow old disgracefully.Celebrities have the potential to really make an impact and change lives – but not all of them do.So I love the story this week that Taylor Swt has donated more than £, to Vitoria Mario, a Tottenham teenager who started a GoFundMe appeal to become a mathematician, describing herself as a “black -year-old with a dream”.Vitoria, had been offered a place at Warwick University to study maths but could not afford to take it because she did not qualy for a student loan.When Taylor saw Vitoria’s GoFundMe appeal, she gave her the entire amount she had left to raise, along with a message saying: “I am so inspired by your drive and dedication to turning your dreams into reality . . . Good luck with everything you do! Love, Taylor.”Imagine waking up to that message .Cynics might suggest that Taylor does things like this for the publicity.But eventhat is true, who cares Vitoria will never forget this and it will likely change her le for ever.Also, how impressive that she found a way to follow her dreams and get the money she needs to go to university.We could all take a leaf out of the book of Britain’s oldest coronavirus survivor.At the grand old age of , she has revealed her secrets to staying healthy are eating an orange a day and “counting your blessings”.Angela Hutor has lived through both World Wars, as well as the Spanish Flu pandemic of .She caught Covid- in April and was so close to death that her daughter was called to hospital to say her final goodbyes. But Angela bounced back.Her advice this week to family and friends is to keep calm and occupied.Angela, from North London, is adamant Britain “will get through this” – and given all that she has survived, she should know.So let’s all take that on board. This lady has a great attitude, something we should all adopt.Frankie Bridge is under fire for posting a photo of her children watching iPads at the dinner table – with some people up in arms about how unacceptable it is.But perhaps people in glass houses should not throw stones.By which I mean that anyone who has children and wants to have a nice time knows kids are not always great at sitting through long, fancy dinners out.Some people think going out to dinner is a treat and children should learn to behave properly.Butyou ask young kids to sit and wait for their food, they will get restless.And there is a definite argument that going out to dinner should be a treat for the adults too.If that means a bit of screen time for the kids while at the table, well, who am I to judge GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It reveals:Downing Street is pushing hard for a trade deal but is making  contingency plans for an “unruly” exit from the EU transition period at the end of December.With trade talks looking set to go the wire, there is a risk they collapse — putting up trade barriers overnight on  January.In that scenario planners believe France will force “mandatory controls on UK goods from day one” and between  and  per cent of hauliers travelling across the Channel may not be ready for this.That could see flow between Dover and Calais down  per cent for three months, triggering long queues of HGVs in Kent.It could lead to shortages of the  per cent of our food imported from the EU as well as medicines, chemicals for drinking water purication and fuel supply.This could trigger water rationing and even power cuts.Food supply across the country would be hit by panic buying at Christmas, the busiest time of year.There are also increasing fears in Whitehall that Covid- willwith a vengeance in the winter months.The planners warned that “pandemic influenza, severe flooding, a Covid second wave and an unruly exit from the EU transition period could cause a systemic economic crisis with major impact on ­disposable incomes, unemployment, business activity, international trade and market stability.”It could be combined with likely “coordinated industrial action” as well as shortages risking public disorder and a mental health crisis that will hit the poorest hardest. Rising virus infections and hospital admissions would require a possibleto two-metre social distancing rules and further lockdown restrictions “well into ”.But, they fear, public compliance with anti-Covid measures could “steadily wane”.And ministers have been warned the NHS could be overwhelmed by a “one in -year flu scenario alongside even a continuation of the current levels of C and signicantly overwhelmed in any level of second peak”.The document says five per cent of councils in England “are already at high risk of financial failure ­following Covid-”. It means some town halls may go bust and need bailing out or may need to be under direct control of Whitehall.And inflation could “signicantly impact social care providers due to increasing staff and supply costs”.Ministers have also been told to brace for a further  months of virus infections in care homes.There are fears of public disorder as a result of shortages and a major economic slump.The outlook is also bleak for Gibraltar and the Channel Islands, both reliant on imports.Gibraltar could be cut off from Spain and economically crippled and the Channel Islands may need airdrops of medicines and food.Three quarters of UK medicine imports come through Dover, and many have a limited shelf le — making stockpiling dficult. During the pandemic the focus on Covid has led to a slump in animal vaccine production. If the borders are jammed stockpiles could deplete, risking disease among livestock.When confronted by our leaked document the Cabinet Office outlined contingency plans to avoid the chaos:It includes extensive winter planning including an extra £billion for the NHS and an extra £million for social care.Covid- testing capacity will be extended to , a day and billions of items of PPE delivered to health and social care workers.A further £million will be spent on new border and customs infrastructure and new border rules phased in over six months to try to avoid backlogs.There will also be an advertising blitz to get businesses ready for changes and encourage them to prepare supply chains and stockpiling of critical medicines.Data and finance rules will be relaxed to keep firms trading with the EU in the event of No Deal.Cabinet Office boss Michael Gove said: “We got Brexit done with a great deal in January.“And we are working flat out to make sure the UK is ready for the changes and huge opportunities at the end of the year as we regain our political and economic independence for the first time in almost  years. Part of this work includes routine contingency planning for ious scenarios that we do not think will happen but we must be ready for, come what may.“Whether we trade with the EU on terms similar to Canada or to Australia, a brighter future awaits as we forge our own path.”A Government spokesperson added: “As a responsible government we continue to make extensive preparations for a wide range of scenarios, including the reasonable worst case.“This is not a forecast or prediction of what will happen but rather a stretching scenario.

Usuallypeople want to go inside a fenced area, they ask for permission first, but I was not asked at all. It is only polite to ask. He could have put up his tent in the garden of the cottage and there would have been no problem but he didnapost do that.  He could easily have damaged the fence by climbing over it as a short cut. There is a gate a little way up and they could have just used that. Mr Cameron, who has leased the land for  years, marched up to the picturesque spot and confronted the Prime Minister after a friend saw the pictures and tipped him off. He shook his head as he checked the tent and spotted a bundle of charred wood from the remains of the campfire.  Arriving at the cottage, Mr Johnsonaposs security team then promised the farmer to take it down and clear away any rubbish. Mr Cameron said: aposItaposs just that I was not told about it. Officers from politan Police apologised to Mr Cameron and said the PM thought the field was part of the property.

As furious pupils waited for results and then finally took to the streets, Gillian Keegan posted snaps of her hiking, mountain biking and swimming in the French sunshine, even as quarantine rules were tightened on the country. It emerged as pictures also appeared of Boris Johnsonaposs Scottish getaway from which the Prime Minister was also silent about the grades fiasco. Those holiday snaps show the Prime Minister hiking the Scottish Highlands carrying baby Wilfred in a sling as fiancee Carrie Symonds cuddles rescue dog Dilyn. Mrs Keegan is Minister for Apprenticeships and Skills at the Department for Education.And as the exam fiasco reached its climax, she decided to remain in France – even as quarantine restrictions came into effect that would require her to self-isolate for  days when she got back to blighty. According to reports in the Mail on Sunday, on August , two days after the A-level results in England were released, she posted an emoji of a woman shrugging with the caption: We will have to make the most of it [our holiday] as we will be #quarantined for  days when we get back.The posts were aposlikedapos by under fire Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. Both did not respond to the paperaposs request for comment.  But an ally told the Mail on Sunday that Mrs Keegan wasnapost in the wrong. They told the paper she had not hidden the fact she was away and that fellow Minister Michelle Donelan, who shares duties for post- education strategy, had been on duty.But she was slammed by Labour MP Neil Coyle.He said: Gavin Williamson’s incompetence truly knows no bounds. Young people who have been put through hell over the last few weeks will be disgusted to learn that one of the Ministers involved in this mess has been living it up on holiday in France. But instead of Mr Williamson recognising he needed all hands on deck as this exam disaster loomed, he not only let her swan off on holiday, he even liked her holiday snaps."},{"url":null,"title":"tories were football team would","story":"NewsopinionIf the Tories were a football team they would lose - - and none of them resignDuring the floods Boris Johnson was on holiday and during high-level meetings about the virus he was on a weekend break.

During the floods he was on holiday and during high-level meetings about the virus he was on a weekend break. Now, during the collapse of the economy, he’s camping. He’ll emerge from Brexit talks in Brussels, and say: “I’ve no idea what we decided as I was driving round the table in a kiddies’ pedal car.” Angela Merkel will announce that a report on post-Brexit imports was presented to the meeting but Boris Johnson set fire to it as he was bored so they’ve got to start all over again. And Britain has become worst at almost everything. We’ve had the highest rate of fatalities from the virus, the fewest tests, and the worst recession. It’s asthis government is determined we’re always at the bottom. Maybe they look on the internet and scream: “Oh no, India has more people killed by tigers than us. Let a couple out of London Zoo into Camden Market so we can be the worst at that as well.” And none of them ever resign. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson ruined the entire system of school exams, but stays in his job. If any minister was a football manager, their team could lose -, because they’d selected a team of wild flowers. What do you think about this story  Have your say in the comments below. But they would insist: “I see no reason to resign. I have no regrets about putting a bluebell in an attacking midfield role. And I’m sure the forget-me-not will have a better match in goal against Cha.” But somehow they’re still slightly ahead in the opinion polls. How awful do the Conservatives have to get before they go behind  Would it make any dferencePriti Patel deported the -year-old Captain Tom Moore to Zimbabwe because he couldn’t find his passport  If Gavin Williamson outsourced school dinners to the Russian government, until all schoolkids turned a luminous green colour, would that damage them slightly in the polls  Maybe the Conservatives stay in front because Labour leader Keir Starmer may have been sensible and forensic, but most people haven’t noticed him yet. So he needs to make himself recognisable, by making the same points, but instead of making them in parliament, say them on Flog It!  Then he can make lots of forensic points about the Government’s failure to introduce a tracing system for Coronavirus, while finding out the value of a th century butter kne. And millions of pensioners will find out who he is. Instead of making clever points about the failures of the furlough system at Prime Minister’s Questions, that no one watches, he could present a similar speech on MTV’s Top  Grime Artists, interspersing plans for boosting the economy with his views on Stormzy and Skepta.

Mum-of-three Jolene Stanley earns just £ a week but her sideline entering ­competitions means that is where she really cleans up. Jolene said: “From the first competition, I was addicted. “In the first year in , I won £, worth of prizes. “My friends and family joke that I must be the luckiest ­person in the country.” Jolene, , scours the web every day for prize draws and giveaways and has bagged more than £, in toys and treats for her family and friends. Her first massive win came when she was ­pregnant with her eldest son and saw her walk away with a £, top-of-the-range pram.  Since then, Jolene has pocketed everything from gig tickets to flash holidays, scooping so many freebies that last Christmas cost her next to nothing. She takes home between  and  prizes every single month, and says her luckiest streak was in September , when she picked up  prizes. Jolene has one son, Stanley Constable, seven, from a previous relationship, and two children, Ivy, three, and Charlie, one, with her carer ­partner James Houghton, . And they all share in her good fortune. Jolene now calls herself a seasoned “comper” – the term given to someone who enters prize giveaways religiously.  Just two months after she picked up her posh pram, Jolene landed a VIP ­experience driving supercars around a racetrack. She said: “I love winning but it’s not all about the big prizes. I love the little ones too, especially when they come from new brands and small businesses.” At first, although successful, Jolene was not organised. Rather than setting aside a specic time to scour the web for prizes, she checked her phone whenever she had a chance and entered as many competitions as she could.  But, at the start of , she vowed to be more strategic – and that system has brought in ­some reliable wins. Jolene said: “I decided I wanted to win enough to get Christmas for free. So, I started setting aside three nights a week for comping. “I’d categorise the prizes, ­dedicating one day to vouchers, one to toys and one to parenting giveaways. If I spotted something great during the day, I would enter that, too.” Jolene’s approach paid off as in  alone, she won around £, of freebies and managed to get Christmas virtually free, thanks to a pile of fab festive pressies and a deluxe dinner.  She said: “My total spend for Christmas was £. Everything  was taken care of by prizes. “I gave James a bottle of rum, a camping stove and a sock ­subscription and we also had a family day out at Gulliver’s theme park. “I gave Stanley a £ scooter and Ivy a new bike. I also won £ worth of Amazon vouchers, which I used to get stocking fillers. “Then I gave the kids a £ ­climbing frame as a joint present. I got a £ Tesco voucher and a £ LoveShop voucher, which can be used at multiple high street shops, which took care of everything .” One of Jolene’s favourite things about her hobby is that it allows her to spoil her loved ones.  In the past, she has taken friends and family with her on minibreaks, spa weekends, for afternoon tea or out for fancy meals. And once a month, kind-hearted Jolene, from Wivenhoe in Essex, also makes a ­donation to her local food bank. Her best prizes include tickets to a Spice Girls gig, a stay at a five-star resort in Portugal, a £, cooker and a seven-course dinner at a Michelin starred restaurant. Jolene has also bagged £, of ­holiday vouchers, a meal cooked by a private chef and a trip to Scotland. Most of her wins come through Instagram but she also scours Facebook and comping forums. “I make more from comping than I do from my job, she said. “The trip to Portugal will always stand out as one of the best things I’ve ever won. We were picked up from the airport by a private chauffeur and driven to this incredible resort. It was like being a celebrity.” And not only do her wins make ­wonderful surprises for her friends and family, they also make everyday le cheaper."},{"url":null,"title":"eat out help out diners","story":"NewsEat Out To Help Out diners could be eating ingredients that are  months oldRestaurants and pubs being forced to close their doors during the coronavirus lockdown means the food industry has an excess of £million worth of meat, fish and vegetables which can be legally usedShareCommentsByLorraine King:,  AUG Newsthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video eat-out-help-out-full-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : #

Experts are insisting the move is lawful and safe but are urging the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to publicise the move to make diners more aware.Darren Goldney, of the wholesale group Unitas, told the Daily Mail : We don’t want this situation, but these are exceptional times and stocks are going to last another six months.While foods that have gone passed their use by dates cannot be legally sold for health reasons, those that have exceeded the best before date can be eaten afterwards providing it has been stored correctly. This means frozen chicken, lamb, beef, chips and most vegetables can last an extra  months beyond the best before date. Frozen prawns and salmon steaks are good to eat for up to a year. James Bielby, from the British Frozen Food Federation, said: If this food stock is good enough to go to charities, it is good enough for the rest of us.  Defra must take the lead in resolving this. Defra told the Daily Mail it urged food businesses to do all they can to work through the current stockpile of food and avoid waste.Diners have eaten  million discounted meals under the scheme launched by Chancellor Rishi Sunak which means meals are half-price on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday throughout August.Customers can enjoy up to £ off per person per meal but alcohol is excluded.

But I’m coming out of it a dferent woman after the best – and worst – holiday of my le. I’ve been in Chamonix in the French Alps, where I’ve been coming for  years. But I’m used to a gentle kind of escape. Yes, I went on walks, but I left all that extreme outdoorsy stuff and zipwires for other people, especially as I have a fear of heights. Those sorts of adventures were not for me, I thought, and I stayed within the boundaries I’d ­articially created for myself. But since turning  in ­lockdown, I’ve got a new lease of le. I have more energy now than ever before, even though I’m going through the menopause. And I am very aware that we need to do things that make us feel alive and appreciate our time on the planet. Now more than ever. So this holiday, I signed up with a personal trainer, Quentin, for a -day Spartan training programme, which is pretty much the polar opposite of lazing on a beach. I did things that not only exhausted me, they frightened me. It was an hour of training every day, waking up for am, carrying lb on my shoulders and running up a steep hill and wading through ice-cold glacial waters, plus cardio sessions where I wanted to be sick. Pull-ups, weights, climbing walls, monkey bars – it was gruelling. I hated every minute and just when I thought I’d finished, he made me sprint for  more minutes. But you know what  I never stopped. I gritted my teeth, fought the tears and found my inner strength. And when it did finally finish and I was released for the day, I had the biggest sense of pride. I never knew I had such willpower and that my body possessed so much strength. Not bad for . What do you think  Join the debate in our comment section below But in Chamonix I have seen other -year-olds taking on ­ultra-marathons, -year-olds climbing peaks that make you shudder, and -year-olds, men and women, trekking for miles. This valley shatters the ­stereotype of putting your feet up as you get older. Knowing what I was capable of, mentally and physically, led me to have a completely dferent holiday with my kids as well.I went to the waterparks with them and jumped in from dizzying heights. Instead of thinking, “Nope, you daft idiot, you can’t do that”, I was saying, “you can do it!” And I wenton to conquer my fear of heights.With my -year-old son, I climbed ft up into the treetops and did an obstacle course where I had to balance on a thin wire. My heart was in my mouth, it was the most horrible experience of my le, but I did it. And then zip-wired over a beautul lake – I ‘d always thought I could never be one of those people. So many of us are stuck in our comfort zones and give up as we get older. You don’t have to go on an expensive holiday, but you can challenge yourself to do new things, no matter your age. And you should – to truly feel alive. Boris taking the teepee Boris Johnson has disappeared to Scotland on holiday. You’d think he could have waited. You wouldn’t have caught his hero, Churchill, booking a week at Butlin’s during the Battle of Britain. The PM left useless Gavin Williamson to cope with thousands of angry and upset A-level pupils, who needed far more consideration.  The PM has been tracked down to a teepee with his fiancée Carrie Symonds and their baby Wilfred. Let’s hope he’s doing his fair share of dirty nappies because he clearly doesn’t give a s*** about our kids. Food shop risk takes the biscuit More Covid confusion this week – can we catch it from our weekly shop or not  Lab tests have shown it can survive for hours,not days, on ious forms of plastic. And the virus is more stable at lower temperatures, which is how most food finds its way to our shops and doors. But some scientists reckon that outside a lab, the virus cannot survive for long anyway. Hmmm. To be on the safe side, the advice is to sanitise your hands after you get out of the shop – so pick, pack, wash. Then you should wash your hands after handling any packaging and before eating too. Which is a small price to pay for a custard cream. Taylor sums it up Teenager Vitoria Mario couldn’t afford to go to uni to study maths – until Taylor Swt entered the equation. The pop superstar donated £, to her GoFundMe page to help Vitoria smash the £, target she had set to cover her accommodation, food and books at Warwick University. Vitoria moved to London from Portugal four years ago, leaving behind her family. When she arrived, she couldn’t speak English, but has gone on to get two A*s and an A in her A-levels. She’s one smart girl but not eligible for any grants, so had to try her luck online.  She wrote she was a “black girl with a dream” and that dream was to be a mathematician, which would also help her family have a better le. And Taylor paid out to make that possible. But like Vitoria said, her story is not unique. So many talented kids from disadvantaged ­backgrounds can only dream of going to uni. And it would need more than TayTay’s piggy bank to sort that out... perhaps a government that wants to give everyone an equal chance at le  Jawahir set for Match of the Day Jawahir Roble is the first black, female, Muslim, hijab-wearing referee in the UK. A Somalian refugee, she hopes that one day she will be running around the pitch in the Premier League. JJ, as her friends call her, wants to inspire more women to get into refereeing and hopes England ladies will be the best football players in the world. Her parents were not happy with the idea of her playing football at first because she’s a girl and she had to hide her muddy boots when she came home. But their attitude changed when they saw her passion. Only a few tens of thousands of white male minds to change now, JJ. But I reckon she’s the girl for the job and there will soon be a seat for her on Match of the Day. Home school is out Not long to go until the school bell finally rings – and it will be music to my ears. My kids have been with me   since March and, boy, are they ready to shake off their mum and see their friends and teachers. Not being able to run around and have a giggle with their mates has hit them hard. At my son’s high school, they will continue playing cricket, but not rugby or football as they’re contact sports. And my daughter’s primary will have social bubbles to cut down on them bumping into other children. It’s going to be dferent, but I don’t think it will faze them. They all need to get back in the playground, where they belong.

The denim perennial has been in production since  and is a favourite of Hollywood stars and manual workers alike. Second place went to the s-defining Mary Quant-style miniskirt, while Leviaposs denim jackets, UGG boots and Fred Perry polo shirts completed the top five. The poll of , UK adults saw Barbour wax jackets, Ray-Ban Wayfarers and Hunter wellies also feature on the list. Thomas Berry, director of sustainable business for Farfetch, which commissioned the study as part of its drive to raise awareness of sustainable fashion, said: Now more than ever, customers are interested in making considered purchases that will stand the test of time. From pre-owned denim to iconic designer pieces, customers are willing to seek out and to invest in pieces that are conscious, durable and also timeless, regardless of trends. Nearly a fth of those polled named Christian Louboutinaposs famous red-bottomed shoes as an iconic statement piece. Although in terms of memorability, the classy designer shoe only came one place above the gardeneraposs favourite - Crocs. It also emerged that at some point in their lives,  per cent of adults have owned a classic Ralph Lauren polo shirt, and one in six have worn some iconic Nike Air Max trainers.  Half of those polled would still wear any of these memorable trends from years gone by, and three in  have hunted in a charity shop or vintage store to find one specic piece of clothing. Many of the items in the list have been handed down to Brits, who didnapost quite realise what they had, as three in  got rid of items given to them by older relatives, only to regret it later. But just under six in adults now say theyaposd rather have fewer quality pieces in their wardrobe, than lots of cheap items which wouldnapost last as long.  The average adult spends about three hours, and £, a month in charity or vintage clothing stores, with a third actively enjoying aposthe huntapos of finding the perfect garment. More than one in  have even spent a DECADE or longer searching high and low for that one mythical item which will complete their wardrobe.And  per cent agree that fashion is cyclical, and what was once trendy will become trendy again in the future.Despite the desire for more long-lasting clothing, only eight per cent of Brits say they aposalwaysapos shop sustainably, although  per cent apossometimesapos manage to.# The research, conducted via OnePoll, also found  per cent have cut down on clothes shopping in general to reduce their carbon footprint, while  per cent buy from stores which have good green credentials. While a further four in  will be sure to clear space from their wardrobe by giving away old clothes, before buying anything new.Following the findings, Farfetch have created a aposfashion footprintapos tool which gives people the chance to consider the environmental impact of their shopping. Thomas Berry added: The tool allows consumers, when choosing to make a purchase, to consider which materials can reduce the environmental impact of their purchases, and to see the environmental savings of incorporating pre-owned products into their wardrobes. To remind people of the iconic items and test their knowledge, Farfetch have created the ultimate quiz for fashionistas to try out. The top  most iconic fashion items of all time . Leviaposs s .

The alleged attack happened after the woman went out into the car park to deliver food to another customer who had been waiting for his order. She was confronted by a woman who was furious that hers was not ready, and who allegedly became aggressive and violent. The McDonaldaposs worker has not been named, but her daughter spoke out about the alleged incident at a store in Grantham, Linconshire.“My Mum was at work and they had a sudden overflow of cars come in, so some customers were asked to wait in the waiting bays, she told LincolnshireLive.“My mum took some food out to a gentleman who was waiting, and she got abuse hurled at her from the car next to the gentleman because they hadn’t got their food. “The girl then spat at my mum and flung her car door open, so my mum pushed it shut as she knew the girl was angry. “The girl got out the car and was still being abusive and then proceeded to kick and punch my mum. “If... the gentleman who my mum had just given food to didn’t step in, god knows what  could have happened. She added: “My mum has now got an awful bruise on her leg and swollen face.”  The customer had reportedly been asked to wait in a designated area of the car park, as is common practice at many McDonaldaposs restaurants. But the daughter said her mum had told her the customer had only waited three or four minutes before the alleged attack. She claimed her mum had been left bruised and swollen. “They were in the waiting bay literally three to four minutes from what her colleagues have said so it’s not like it was a ridiculous wait, the daughter said.

Harry sparked headlines in July when he told members of the Queen’s Commonwealth Trust that its history must be acknowledged and work done to “right those wrongs”. But in a web call with members last week, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex – president and vice-president of the trust – insisted they were keen to continue the Queen’s legacy. Royal watchers claim it is proof the couple are keen to improve relations with the Royal Family, which have been further soured by the book, Finding Freedom. It is understood the book – which reveals rts between the royals – was written with Harry and Meghan’s ­approval, but left the Queen ­“upset and disappointed”. In the latest web chat, Meghan, , admitted she was “newer to the Commonwealth”, but said: “It wasn’t until joining the family I was able to meet so many young people throughout the Commonwealth. “They came with a question, they always offered a solution and that’s why I’m incredibly proud to work with the QCT, but why it’s the continuation of the legacy of your grandmother.” Speaking from the couple’s new £million home in Calornia, -year-old Harry also heaped praise on his grandmother. He said the Queen, , had achieved everything she wanted to after taking on the “huge responsibility” of the Commonwealth. A source told the Sunday People: “The Queen is fiercely protective of the Commonwealth.She wants her work to carry on through younger family members when she’s gone. “It feels like Harry and Meghan are finally trying to build bridges as I think despite their popularity in certain quarters, it has dawned on them they need the Royal Family more than it needs them.” Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: “When Meghan and Harry last spoke, they made fools of themselves.  They ­managed to ­confuse the ­uncomfortable history of the British Empire with the modern Commonwealth, which caused derision.” Ms Seward also told how the couple’s biggest asset was undoubtedly their family.

It will tackle discrimination like that faced by mixed-race Meghan herself as she grew up in Los Angeles. These are the first details to emerge of a project which the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have pitched to a string of network executives. A TV insider said: “They have suggested a series focusing on the empowerment of women and young girls in today’s world. “It will home in on race issues, something Meghan has always been passionate about. It’s got quite a political stance and will also draw on feminism. “They want the series to continue their vision of empowerment for young people.” Sources say the couple “will appear in it but it’s about ‘normal’ people, not them.” Last week, it emerged the couple pitched the idea to numerous companies in June – when they bought an £million estate in Santa Barbara, Calornia, where they live with son Archie. They intend to serve as joint producers of the project. Harry and Meghan hope to make a fortune with their own film and television production company after their break from the Royal Family. Their plans include providing voiceovers and producing documentaries on worthy issues, such as mental health and climate change. NBC Universal was among the networks that heard Harry and Meghan’s first pitch.They had a meeting with its top bosses – including chairman of content studios Bonnie Hammer, who has known Meghan, , since her days on the US show Suits. Meghan has described Ms Hammer as the woman who changed her le after she cast her in the legal drama. A friend of Meghan told Variety magazine that she has no intention of acting in any projects. The duchess narrated the Disney+ documentary Elephants, which came out in April. Last year Harry, , announced he was partnering with Oprah Winfrey on an Apple TV+ series about mental health.And he is to appear in a Netflix documentary about the Paralympic Games, which will air on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"mirror newspaper tablet offer promotion","story":"NewsGet The Mirror free on tablet for two months*Its packed with breaking news, sport and entertainment - and is perfect during lockdownShareByDave Masters:,  APR Updated:,  APR News\" %, rgba, rgba, url\"News, views and top stories .

Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who claims she was trafficked by financier Jeffrey Epstein, alleges Prince Andrew had sex with her on three separate occasions - including when she was , still a minor under US law. This morning she claimed she was gted to the royal, and voiced her fury on Twitter. She wrote: All the evidence you could poke a stick out and yet the justice system defends a known predator who just happens to be a prince, anyone  would be thrown into jail. He knew I had no choice- he knew I was being trafficked- gted to him. Nothings all right. Running out of hope.  Ms Giuffre, who was pictured with the Duke of York in London in London, has previously said she hopes Andrew is put “in a cell next to his best mate” Ghislaine Maxwell. The former teen ‘sex slave’ of Jeffrey Epstein spoke out after the chief of the politan Police offered to assist US authorities with their investigation into the US paedophile. Dame Cressida Dick said that while the focus of the FBI probe was “clearly” in America, she added the Met would assist US authorities should it be required “at any stage”. The help could include looking at Andrew’s ties to his friends Epstein and Maxwell.Prosecutors in the States claim they have been stonewalled by requests to interview Andrew, , with one prosecutor saying in January the Prince has provided “zero cooperation”. The Duke’s legal team hit back saying they had repeatedly offered his assistance but had been ignored. He categorically denies he had any form of sexual contact or relationship with Ms Giuffre.

According to a royal source the -year-old monarch will not reside at Buckingham Palace but would like to commute to the capitalit is safe to do so.It is believed that this will be the longest absence the Queen has had from Buckingham Palace during her -year reign, the Sunday Times reports.The Queen usually s to London in October after enjoying her annual summer break in Balmoral, but instead, she will reportedlyto Windsor Castle. Both the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been self-isolating at Windsor since March  - four days before the UK went into lockdown. She has reportedly been told that the close-knit bubble of household staff who have been working with her in Windsor is the safest way to reduce the risk of her contracting coronavirus. A royal source said: There is a desire to get Buckingham Palace up and running again as a working palace, but onlyall the relevant advice suggests that it is appropriate to do so. It is believed that plans are being drawn up so the Queen can safely attend commemorations at the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in November.But until the threat of coronavirus is eliminated the Queen will not apparentlyto Buckingham Palace. However, it is thought that she will spend her Christmas break at Sandringham in Norfolk as usual. The news comes after reports that the coronavirus risk means the Queen may not be allowed toto her public duties for years to come.Royal biographer Andrew Morton, , told The Sun in May that he feared the Queen may only be seen on TV or video links rather than in public due to the risk to herself and Prince Philip.The writer, who penned Diana: Her True Story in , told the paper: Itaposs terribly sad but I canapost see how the Queen can resume her usual job. The Covid- virus isnapost going away soon and will be with us for months,not years.  It would be far too risky for the Queen to start meeting people on a regular basis. The stringent measures are expected to upset The Queen as she has said in the past that she has to be seen to be believed.

Nicole said she couldnapost stop laughing when she found the note, and headed straight to Toby Carvery to let them know Tula wasnapost homeless, as reported by HuffPost.They revealed the cat had spent hours meowing at staff and customers for food until someone eventually gave in and shared some of their roast - and had been doing it since lockdown lted. As Nicole left the restaurant, she walked out only to come face-to-face with Tula, who was sat by the patio tables. The owner shared the hilarious story on Facebook, writing: I can imagine sheaposs been trying for the sympathy vote in the hope of getting some meat!She has a lovely home and spends every night with us but thank you Toby customers workers for looking out for her!

Englandaposs chief medical officer believes there is little chance of a vaccine breakthrough before Christmas – and says our best hope now is of finding one before winter .Prof Whitty also warns that the coronavirus R rate could leap above  when childrento school – fuelling fears of more local lockdowns.He and the chief medical officers for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland stressed there were “no risk-free options” and that sending pupils back to class had to be weighed up against keeping them away. The infection risk for children is low, but with , teachers ing to work and parents set to gather at school gates again, the R rate could go back above , with scientists saying spikes are inevitable. And in a TV interview today, Prof Whitty says that would mean localised shutdowns with certain businesses closing – a move that cost Leicester £million. Prof Whitty said: “If it was shops in a particular area we would look at shops. If it was hospitality, we would look at hospitality. We’re trying to keep transmission rates low and do the least social and economic damage.” On Saturday, Prof Whitty warned it would be foolish to plan for this coming winter on the basis of having a coronavirus vaccine. But he told reporters there was a reasonable chance there could be vaccines available before the winter of -.  He said: I would obviously be delightedit came earlier rather than later but Iaposd be quite surprisedwe had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas. Now that may be wrong. A lot of people are doing a huge amount scientically, logistically to make sure thataposs a pessimistic statement, to try and seewe can get a vaccine at extraordinarily fast speed but we have to check it works and we have to make sure itaposs safe and these things do take time. So I thinkwe look forward a year I think the chances are much greater thanwe look forward six months and we need to have that sort of timescale in mind. So planning for the next winter, it would be foolish to plan on the basis we will have a vaccine. We should plan on the basis we will not have a vaccine and thenone does prove to be effective and safe and available then weaposre in a strong position to be able to use it and that will be great, but we should be planning on the basis of what we currently have. Iaposm confident in the long-term in the ability of science to get us out of this hole but I donapost think we can expect it to happen in the next few weeks or even the next few months. Prof Whitty said he was confident in the ability of science to help tackle the virus, but stressed it would take time. He added: Iaposm confident in the long-term in the ability of science to get us out of this hole but I donapost think we can expect it to happen in the next few weeks or even the next few months.  His comments come as he joined the UKaposs chief and deputy chief medical officers to issue a joint statement on schools and childcare reopening. When askedthere were decisions he would have made dferently earlier in the pandemic Prof Whitty said of course but plans had to be made with the information available. He added: There is a long list of things which,we knew at the beginning of this what we know now about this virus, about how it operates and also how the initial epidemic started, of course we would have done dferently and we knew at the time that it would be easier to plan with the huge benefit of hindsight, but you have to plan with the information youaposve got available to you, but yes, of course.

And deciding to reopen schools could push the Covid R rate above . The consequence of that would be more pubs shut, shops closed and local lockdowns. There are even warnings thatinfections get out of hand as a result of children going back, we may be in for another horrendous national lockdown. But, for once, the children aren’t the problem. It’s the grown-ups. Kids get the blame for super-spreading colds and flu, but Covid- does not act like that. Children are unlikely to get it, or become very sickthey do, or pass it on. It’s the , teachers ing to work, and parents gathering at the school gates who pose the greatest risk. So next month, we must brace ourselves for an upturn in illness. That does not make it wrong to get children back into class after more than five months’ absence. It is essential for their wellbeing that their education resumes. Join the debate in our comments section below and tell us what you think  What Chris Whitty and the UK’s other chief medical officers do today is lay out the realities of doing so. Which is more than can be said of Boris Johnson. Since the start of this pandemic, we have had promises of a world-beating this or a ground-breaking that – only for them to end in abject failure. His decision-making has been hesitant and dodgy, his mixed messaging downright dangerous. The PM would have probably done less harm by spending the entire crisis in a Scottish tent. But now he has come out of it, we urge him to start being upfront and honest with the British people. About the likelihood of a second national lockdown. About the real prospects for the economy. About plans for the future now we know Covid will be with us for at least nine months. The British are resilient. We have taken on a deadly invisible enemy. So we can easily take the clear and unnished truth. A sorry story What is it about have-it-all footballers that ends them up in trouble  Take Harry Maguire. He’s worth £million to Manchester United, so it pays him £, a week. With that kind of money he could buy his own deserted island – and do what ever he wants there with his mates. But he chose to holiday on Mykonos instead, where he now faces accusations of resisting arrest, hitting police officers and allegedly trying to bribe himself out of trouble. And now there’s the appalling possibility of doing time in a Greek jail.

The bizarre note left others on social media stunned as they replied with suggestions for revenge, including buying her toddler a drum set, or pots and pans to bang together. It reads: Dear aposneighborapos. You just moved into this neighbourhood a year ago, and I wanted to give you time to correct this problem on your own, but you are apparently too inconsiderate to do so.Every day this week when weather has been nice and windows are open, you proceed to let your small child run free in your backyard and laugh and giggle and carry on without end.This is very disruptive for my two dogs and my bird who sits next to the window and likes to look into your yard. Perhaps you could ask him to tone it down a bit, or at least limit his outside time to - minutes a day so my dogs can be outside without seeing him running around. If this kind of behaviour persists, I WILL CALL THE POLICE.

The -strong flotilla, with vessels as big as a football pitch, has descended on the oceans around the Galapagos Islands – where the rich bioersity offers unique insights into our planet. Scientists fear the fleet puts endangered species at risk both by plundering the oceans and from the , plastic bot­­tles thrown overboard every day. They say the boats, each dangling millions of hooks, are targeting sharks that end up in expensive fin soup in markets across China and Hong Kong. In , officials from Ecuador, which owns the islands, intercepted one with  tonnes of refrigerated shark fins on board. Last week, locals spoke of their anger after finding a young shark washed up on a beach with its dorsal fins hacked off. And a whale shark called Hope that recently vanished was shown by its GPS tracker to have last been where the fleet was. What do you think about the story  Join the debate in our comments section below Esme Plunkett, , a British marine biologist based on the island of Santa Cruz, said: “I’ve never known such anger here. “Locals are devastated to see what these fleets are doing.” Darwin visited the islands in . Studying its unique species helped form his evolution theory. Conservationists say at least  species, including sea lions, turtles and marine iguanas, have been found entangled in plastic bags or lines, or swallowed plastic. Esme said: “In just  minutes I found  Chinese-labelled bottles in the rocks next to the iguanas.“Waste is not unheard of, but this was in good condition with the labels intact. They take hund­reds of years to degrade. “In two years I’ve never seen plastic waste like this.” It is understood the vessels, which claim to be catching squid, have now turned off their tracking devices to avoid being monitored."},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus survives frozen meat fish","story":"NewsCoronavirus survives on frozen meat and fish for three weeks, study findsIn the study, inidual slices of salmon, chicken and pork from supermarkets in Singapore were sliced and a sample of the virus was added to them.

Scientists say this could explain why outbreaks happen in countries that have not had any cases in long periods. In the study, inidual slices of salmon, chicken and pork from supermarkets in Singapore were sliced and a sample of the virus was added to them. They were then stored in freezing temperatures - between C, which is standard refrigeration temperature, and minus C, which is standard freezing temperature.After  days, researchers found the virus was still present in the fish and meat samples, Thereports.Scientists argue transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, but the movement of contaminated items to a region without infections could potentially initiate an outbreak. The study states: An explanation is required for the re-emergence of Covid- outbreaks in regions with apparent local eradication. Recent outbreaks have emerged in Vietnam, New Zealand and parts of China where there had been no cases for some months.  Importation of contaminated food and food packaging is a feasible source for such outbreaks and a source of clusters within existing outbreaks. While it can be confidently argued that transmission via contaminated food is not a major infection route, the potential for movement of contaminated items to a region with no Covid- and initiate an outbreak is an important hypothesis. An infected food handler has the potential to become an index case of a new outbreak.  The international food market is massive and even a very unlikely event could be expected to occur from time to time.  Prof James Wood, head of the Veterinary Medicine department at the University of Cambridge, told The Sunday : “The authors discuss, very sensibly, how it is important that factory workers must be incentivised not to go to work when symptomatic or in contact with Covid- cases.”A pig meat processing plant was shut this week after a coronavirus aposclusterapos was discovered among  workers.The meat plant, Cranswick Country Foods in Cullybackey, near Ballymena in County Antrim in Northern Ireland, mploys around  staff. What do you think about this story  Join the debate below Health Minister Robin Swann described the outbreak as signicant adding that  staff members have tested positive, as well as a smaller number of their contacts. A company spokesperson said: There has been a recent increase in the number of confirmed Covid- cases in Ballymena and the wider region and this has been acknowledged as a community issue.

The giant tumour weighed more than  poundswhen it was removed from the New Delhi-based patient, named Nirmala, on Saturday. Surgeons were forced to operate after the patient developed breathing problems and complained of acute pain in her abdomen. “We had found a progressive tumour in her oy which eventually led to pressure on her intestines,” said Dr Arun Prasad. “Subsequently this led to indigestion and an acute stomach ache.” Prasad added he had never seen such case in his three decades as a medical professional. It took a team of doctors three-and-a-half hours to remove the tumour, which is believed to be one of the biggest ever operated on. In , doctors in the Indian city of Tamil Nadu successfully operated on a kg tumour from another womanaposs oy.  Nirmala also suffered severe anaemia and was unable to walk due to the size of the benign tumour. “With a low level of haemoglobin, this was a major task for the doctors” Prasad said. Doctor Abhishek Tiwari also expressed delight that the patient had quickly recovered. “She is lucky that the organs didn’t fail. Otherwise, such pressure could have proved fatal for the patient,” he said.

Primary school teacher Halie Tennant, , said she felt she had lost her identity, and recalled how she asked her husband to love her no matter what.And she said the coronavirus pandemic had heightened her ordeal, as she was only allowed one visitor for one hour each day during a long recovery process after surgery. Halie, from Hotspur in Victoria, Australia, had gone on a spontaneous camping trip with a friend, but it turned into a nightmare when she dozed off in a camping chair, according to Yahoo.Her friend, who had fallen asleep in her swag, a portable sleeping unit, awoke to a murmuring noise, and to her horror found Halie lying head first in the campfire, making no attempt to move. She pulled Halie out of the fire - almost certainly saving her le - and poured ice cold water on her face to ease the burns. Halie has no recollection of how she ended up in the fire, but believes the chair must have tipped while she was sleeping in it. The pair then drove back to Halieaposs home less than two kilometres away, where her husband Matthew tried to cool her burns as much as possible by running cold water over her face, while an ambulance, an intensive care ambulance and a helicopter made their way to the scene. Halie was rushed to the intensive care unit at The Alfred Hospital in Melbourne, where she was immediately put in a coma. After being in a coma for eight days, Halie was moved to the burns ward to begin her long recovery.  She has spent more than two-and-a-half months in hospital and has gone under the kne six times - including to remove damaged skin and to have skin grafts to her face, neck, eyelids and mouth. Amazingly, Halie says she doesnapost recall feeling any pain after falling into the fire - although she does remember the agony of fearing her husbandaposs reaction. “I donapost remember any pain, she said. I remember asking Mathew to love me no matter what and him saying, ‘yes’. She said Matthew, her mum and her dad took turns to visit while she was in intensive care, describing the limited visiting hours due to Covid as the hardest part of her recovery. After being released from hospital, she had to be readmitted around  days later as her eyelids were not touching - and then surgeons had to operate on her further as her mouth couldnapost open enough for her to eat from a fork or spoon.

I like what Olly Crankshaw brought to the Dee last term and a similar sort should be sought.At the back, a left-sider to push Jordan Marshall and a goalkeeper should be on the shopping list, while a No  to bang in the goals is needed.The clock has started ticking, let’s see what the next month and a half brings. . .Enjoying the privileged position of being able to attend games in person this season has been fantastic but minus fans it’s lacked something.Whether it’s passionate Dees banging on the Tannadice press box window celebrating a derby equaliser or hordes of Arabs heading for away days in the sun, they’ve been missed.It’s certainly earlier than expected but the September  date is promising. Fingers crossed it happens!There’s just no seeing past Bayern Munich for the Champions League is there  The Germans are an absolute powerhouse and, as good as PSG are, I don’t think they stand a chance in the Lisbon finale tomorrow.Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretWyaDSfYoJ\" data-secret\"WyaDSfYoJ\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Football with fans is what it’s all about.“It will be terric to get supporters back and I am really looking forward to getting back to having them in the stadium backing us.“Common sense will tell you that in order for football clubs to grow you need finances and part of that is getting fans through the door.“So I would imagine it will have a positive impact on that front but, as a manager, it’s about having that backing from the stands.”With impeccable timing, Mellon revealed he himself had been unable to attend a game – Tuesday’s Champions League qualying tie between the Hoops and KR Reykjavik at Celtic Park on Tuesday night.He wanted to see Neil Lennon’s men in the flesh ahead of their league clash but Mellon explained: “We tried to get into the Celtic game but we couldn’t get tickets.“Celtic told us Uefa are not allowing anyone in to watch the games.“But with the technology you have now we have been able to watch all the games they have had recently.”Mellon witnessed, albeit virtually, that - thrashing of the Icelandic team and knows this is the greatest challenge his players will have faced since stepping up from the Championship.He said: “Whenever you play the champions in any country you know the challenge will be a big one.“But it is something you want to be involved in and get excited about.“We will be encouraging the players to get involved in all games so this is an opportunity to play in a fantastic game against the champions.“It is all positive because it gives us a chance to see where we are as a club and go attack it.“We believe we can make a positive impact – that is what we are in the Premiership for.“Given the size of this football club, that is what we should we doing. That is what the fans and the owners of the club expect.”The Tangerines have impressed in the way they have nullied threats from their opponents thus far, with Motherwell and Hibs in particular struggling to make headway against a solid midfield.This test is on another level but Mellon said: “We will be trying to find a way to make it dficult for Celtic. Every team has strengths and weaknesses, so we have to get an awful lot right on the day to get a result against Celtic.“But this is football and you always have a chance.”Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee\" title\"#Arsenal ace Kieran Tierney lts lid on ex-Dundee United No Gordon Young#s attempts to sign him, working with Stevie Frail and his debut against Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp arsenal-celtic-kieran-tierney-dundee-united-gordon-young-stevie-frail embed # secretJTZmAXcxG\" data-secret\"JTZmAXcxG\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

Of those,  were in the NHS Grampian area, compared with  in Tayside,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde and four in Lanarkshire. No new deaths had been recorded in the last  hours.At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon described the position in Aberdeen as “an improving situation” and said there was “no evidence” of transmission into Aberdeenshire or Moray.Ms Sturgeon said that when the local lockdown is reviewed on Sunday, the government would look at bringing Aberdeen into line with the rest of the country on some aspects of coronavirus policy, such as casinos and bingo halls reopening.We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”Nicola SturgeonElsewhere in Scotland, such venues are scheduled to come back into use on Monday. Previously, Ms Sturgeon has indicated that she would look at reopening Aberdeen’s non-licensed cafes on Wednesday.“On Sunday… we will review the lockdown restrictions in Aberdeen again,” Ms Sturgeon said. “And at that time we hope that we will be able to set out a firm timetable for the lting of these restrictions.“At that point we will also set out whether some of the changes that were announced more generally for the country yesterday – for example, the reopening of venues like bingo halls – will also apply in Aberdeen.”She added: “We all hope and are optimistic that Aberdeen will be on the road back –not to complete normality then at least as much normality as the rest of the country very soon.”The first minister added that there was “no evidence to suggest there had been wider transmission” beyond the city of Aberdeen.“That is something that has been looked at very carefully, particularly around Aberdeenshire, particularly given some of the travel patterns and proximity of communities there,” the first minister said.Ms Sturgeon said the cluster associated with those who gathered in the city’s pubs was now under control. But there was an “ongoing concern” about cases not associated with the cluster, but things were improving. In total,  cases have been identied in the Grampian Health Board area since the July .Of those,  were associated with the pub-linked cluster, and , contacts have been identied from those  cases. In the last  hours, there had been an additional seven cases not associated with the original cluster.Earlier this week Aberdeen City Council leaders expressed frustration that the city had not been allowed out of its three week lockdown earlier, warning that , jobs were at risk as a result of the coronavirus.Aberdeen City Council co-leader Jenny Laing said: “Of course we have to be mindful of public health, but we also have to be mindful of the economic implications, which could have an impact on public health as well.#It is about balancing competing harms. Economic damage could harm public health through unemployment and poverty. That’s why we thought, in line with the incident management team, that restrictions on travel, household gatherings and hospitality could have been lted earlier.”At her briefing, Ms Sturgeon repeated her warnings about house parties, saying indoor social gatherings were proving one of the major drivers of community transmission of the virus.She said: “That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings.“I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”Economy Secretary Fiona Hyslop repeated her plea for the UK Government#s furlough scheme to be extended, particularly in the hospitality and tourism industries.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

further factories linked to tayside coronavirus cluster as cases discovered across three council areas","story":"Two further factories have been linked to a growing coronavirus outbreak in Tayside, as new figures reveal the region now has the highest risk of local transmission anywhere in Scotland.The number of cases linked to the  Sisters food processing plant in Coupar Angus has risen to , and Nicola Sturgeon confirmed  employees have now tested positive for the virus, along with nine of their contacts.Speaking during the Scottish Government’s daily coronavirus briefing on the day Scotland recorded its second-highest number of new cases since May, Ms Sturgeon said  of the  new positive tests recorded overnight were in Tayside.A total of  of the new cases were in the Grampian health board area,  in Greater Glasgow and Clyde, and four in Lanarkshire.NHS Tayside announced on Thursday that anyone living in a household with a factory worker from the  Sisters site, including children, should self-isolate at home and get tested for Covid- as soon as possible.Ms Sturgeon said not all of the  Sisters workforce live in Coupar Angus so the situation involves people stretched across Perth and Kinross, Angus and Dundee.The first minister also confirmed two contacts #have links to other food processing factories in Tayside”, although it is not yet clear which businesses are affected.#The incident management team is now carrying out risk assessments at both of these sites,#Ms Sturgeon said.#There#s no evidence that this outbreak has spread to either factory at this stage but, as you can imagine, that is something that is being looked at very closely.#Ms Sturgeon said lockdown restrictions similar to the ones introduced in Aberdeen two weeks ago had not been imposed because there was currently #minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside#.However, she said she could not rule out introducing further measures in the future and the situation would be kept under #very close review#.A new method of tracking the outbreak has revealed Perth and Kinross has the highest risk of local coronavirus transmission anywhere in Scotland and may require “greater vigilance” from health officials.The region has  surged past other areas dealing with local outbreaks, including Aberdeen, which became the site of Scotland’s first local lockdown following a cluster linked to pubs and bars in the city.A new Scottish Government report considered whether the current number of Covid- infections exceeds what health officials would expect at this stage of the epidemic, based on a new modelling system from Warwick University.It found six local authority areas – Perth and Kinross, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Angus, Glasgow and Aberdeen – had exceeded expected levels but figures are beginning to trend towards normal.The new method is designed to be more useful than the R number – the average number of people infected by each person – because this figure can be volatile when the overall number of deaths is low.The report states: “While metrics such as the reproductive rate – R number – have been useful in guiding our response to coronavirus so far, the models we use rely on numbers of deaths to track the epidemic.“These have fallen to low levels, which means we need to find new ways to monitor trends in the epidemic.“One of the ways we can do this is to calculate whether the number of confirmed infectionsin each area exceeds the number that was expected, given the number recorded across the country – this is called ‘exceedance’.”Areas with an exceedance level above six are deemed to be at a higher risk of local transmission and may require “greater vigilance”, according to the report.In the week leading up to August , the only areas above this limit were Perth and Kinross, at ., and Dundee, where a number of workers at the  Sisters chicken factory live, at ..Angus came in at ., Aberdeen at ., and levels in Aberdeenshire are beginning to fall back towards background levels.The report stated in most cases the figures are “a reflection of a small number of cases” however, the ongoing nature of the outbreak in Perth and Kinross “may be a cause for concern”.Speaking about lessons learned from the clusters on Friday, Ms Sturgeon said indoor social gatherings are one of the major drivers of community transmission.She warned against defying guidelines on the number of people allowed indoors at once, which she said presented “a very signicant risk”.“That tells us that we need to be incredibly cautious about these kinds of gatherings,# she said. #I want to ask everybody again today to remember the advice that is in place and to comply with it.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including

Every day this week we have had lower numbers than Tayside, and it is clear the people of Aberdeen will be asking themselves why they are in lockdown and other parts of Scotland aren’t.“We have asked four or five times now what the infection rate in the city needs to be before the lockdown can be lted and we have never been able to get an answer from the Scottish Government.“We are only asking for clarity on when we will be able to reopen but they have not been able to tell us.#Mr Lumsden added: “They should be listening to the health professionals on the ground in Aberdeen and the lockdown should have been lted when the IMT recommended. What we are seeing now is lockdown being extended when the numbers are far higher in other parts of the country.“I don’t want to see any local lockdowns that aren’t needed because I know first-hand the harm that’s doing to our local economy. There are lots of businesses who can’t get through this.“There is an unfairness around this lockdown. They have got medical experts on the ground – why are they not listening to them ”The number of cases linked to the cluster which sparked the lockdown is .In her daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon explained the key dference between the Aberdeen cluster and the Tayside outbreak, which began at the  Sisters plant in Coupar Angus, was the risk of community transmission.She said: #Some people may be looking at Aberdeen and Coupar Angus and wondering why exactly the same approach is not being taken, and the key point is that the nature of the steps we take in dferent outbreaks has to depend on and be guided by the nature of the outbreak.#The assessment of the IMT in Coupar Angus is that there is minimal evidence of community transmission in Tayside.#That’s not something we were able to say with any confidence about the outbreak in Aberdeen.#So as things stand, there is a clear focal point for the Coupar Angus outbreak, which was not the case in Aberdeen where the outbreak was associated with a large number of venues across the city.#In each of these cases, and this will continue to be the case in future, we make decisions based on inidual circumstances that we’re dealing with.#In doing so, we take account of the specic risks that need to be addressed, and that is the approach we continue to take as we deal with dferent outbreaks in dferent parts of the country.#The First Minister said she hopes to be able to set out a #firm timetable# for the lting of restrictions tomorrow.In response to Mr Lumsden, a Scottish Government spokeswoman said: “Unfortunately there is no single level of infection that makes these decisions straightforward. We take into account prevalence, rate of positive tests, number of clusters and other factors. No country’s health advisers can  give an infection rate that means we are able to make certain decisions in regard to lting restrictions. There is a range of considerations about whether we can reach the conclusion that the overall situation in Aberdeen is sufficiently under control that we can start to lt the restrictions.“As the First Minister has made clear, we recognise in particular, the impact on businesses in Aberdeen, particularly those impacted by the restrictions and required to close. That’s why we have made available a £m grant support scheme for businesses in Aberdeen City impacted by local measures.#For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancellation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Evening Express website including all Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening Express n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb and ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t tMonthly n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayUnlimited access to all articles on the Evening Express website.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry. Recovery will require our collective efforts and we must act as one to ensure the best possible outcomes for the whole of the visitor economy.Malcolm Roughead, VisitScotland chief executive"},{"url":null,"title":"the time for change is is now july 17 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThis isn’t really a campaign, it’s just the things that we should all be thinking aboutwe want Argyll # and the world – to be a recognisable place for our children and grandchildren to live in.The economic crisis could be seen as an opportunity to get started on the work that we know needs to happen.I think that many people in Argyll could continue to work from home people who have lost their jobs could be retrained, or use their existing skills, to do the work that is necessary for Argyll to become carbon-neutral. Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Control system builders ITI will undertake the design, installation and commissioning of the upgrade across the station’s four units.The power station, constructed in a cavern within Ben Cruachan on the shores of Loch Awe, plays a critical role in stabilising the country’s electricity system throughout the Covid- pandemic due to its flexibility. The plant can generate power in less than a minute when needed and can also store excess electricity from the grid like a giant battery, a service which was called upon when the low electricity demand during the lockdown coincided with periods of high wind power in Scotland.The plant’s reversible turbines pump water from Loch Awe to an upper reservoir on the mountainside to store excess power from the grid. The stored water is then released back through the turbines to generate power quickly and reliably when demand increases."},{"url":null,"title":"huge-asset-borders-closed","story":"THE Girl Guide movement in Scotland has been left ldquoheartbroken after it was announced this week that its Borders-based activity centre would shut for good.The closure of Netherurd House near Blyth Bridge is said to be due to financial dficulty, with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic being the final nail in the coffin.Staff will be made redundant, with the exception of the groundskeeper who will be retained until the estate is sold.Margot Swanston, who has visited Netherurd for  years as a guide and leader, described herself as ldquodevastated.The stunning Georgian mansion and its extensive grounds have served thousands of guides and brownies for more than  years.After finances plummeted five years ago, a review was carried out which resulted in signicant investment to improve facilities and make it more attractive for users.There was an initial increase in bookings, but over the last three years numbers dropped, resulting in fewer users and financial woes.Girlguiding Scotlandrsquos chief commissioner Moira McKenna said: ldquoIn the past, we regularly used to fill the house with adults for county and other training weekends, but this has been declining for at least the last decade.ldquoFewer counties book for training, more of them come for only one night and the numbers from each county are lower than in previous times.ldquoThere is now much more training available online and this has increased dramatically this year with COVID-.ldquoEven before the pandemic came along, Girlguiding was planning to set up a digital hub to provide training online, and whilst we know the value of being together, volunteers across Scotland are finding the online or local training options more convenient in terms of both time and money.ldquoWe had hoped to build external business for mid-week, especially schools, but we were unable to build a wide enough business base to rely on this.ldquoEach year we have tried other avenues including holidays for Trefoil groups, retreats for local churches, private family gatherings and occasional weddings, but overall we could not generate enough routine business to help us improve the finances.ldquoThis was the situation before we were forced to close Netherurd in March due to COVID-, and since then the centre has had no income.A spokesperson for Netherurd House added: ldquoWe want to take this opportunity to say a huge thank you to all the staff and volunteers who have made Netherurd a place of adventure and provided ever-lasting memories for so many girls and young people.ldquoThis is a signicant loss to Girlguiding Scotland and we know many will be upset by this news.ldquoOur priority remains our members and wersquore committed to ensuring that girls and young women can keep having adventure and benefit from all that the outdoors has to offer.Former visitors to Netherurd House took to social media calling the closure a ldquosad day for Girlguiding Scotland.,params: .pushOne woman wrote: ldquoDreadful news.

With recycling centres and charity shops open again therersquos no excuse. Spend the weekend sorting through any unwanted items and donate where you can.For storage solutions, you need to think outside the box ndash literally. Vacuum bags are ideal, they normally come in multipacks of ious sizes and are really cheap. Great for anything soft that is taking up a lot of space. Winter clothes, quilts and blankets can be reduced to a tenth of the size and slide under the bed nicely.If floor space is a problem, then the sky is the limit. Consider storing items that arenrsquot needed on a regular basis above units or wardrobes. Think about shelving units that are tall and slim, rather than long and bulky.Cheap and cheerful plastic, canvas or cardboard boxes can help to keep everything in place while adding a splash of colour and style. Perfect for keeping clutter off the floor.Shelves above radiators are a great way to use otherwise wasted space.If the kids are desperate for some space, a reading nook or kids study area can easily be achieved under the stairs or a window. A simple storage box with a couple of cushions on top will create a comfy seat and can double up as extra storage.Hooks can be attached to pretty much anything like bedroom doors and inside cupboards ndash again keeping items off the floor will create the illusion of more space. In the kitchen, using hooks to hang pots and pans and magnets for knives can free up cupboard space and make a statement.Knowing where things are is half the battle when considering storage options, so think about clear plastic boxes or bags that are easy to see into and can be labelled.Flexible furniture like extendable dining tables, sofa beds and even clothes rails are ideal as they have multiple uses and can be stored away easily when not in use.Let there be lightLighting and mirrors are your friends when it comes to making a smaller room feel bigger. Change large floor lamps for smaller wall lights and when it comes to wall colour, stick to pale colours and swap out heavy curtains with blinds. Luckily, a big tub of value white paint goes a long way. Let in as much light as possible, give the windows a good scrub and update yellowing lightbulbs to bright white.OutdoorsIs it time to rethink that huge sofa set and professional sized goal posts  When buying furniture, think small, light and foldable so that they can be stored away in a shed or cupboard or easily moved around. Updating your garden furniture doesnrsquot need to cost the earth, yoursquoll find some really great bargain sets in supermarkets like Aldi, Asda and Tesco and homeware stores like BM.Another way to make it feel bigger is to simply give it a good tidy. Yoursquoll be surprised at how much space you do have after clearing out those unwanted flowerpots, cutting the grass and trimming back the hedges.Your home is an investment, to be enjoyed for a long time and with these simple but effective ideas, you can enjoy the space you have for longer."},{"url":null,"title":"young-people-scotland-can-get-250-free-starting-new-job","story":"Young people across Scotland could be in line for as much as pound free from the Government for starting a new job, thanks to a new benefit.Its hoped the payment, which is open for applications from today, will help young people with the financial dficulties of starting a new job - including buying new clothes, travel and get childcare.It is estimated around  young people will benefit from the new financial support in its first year.What is the benefit The Job Start Payment is a one-off sum of pound for  to -year-oldsthey have been unemployed for at least six months.The upper age limit rises to  for care leavers and the payment increases to poundthe person has a child.How can I qualy for the payment To qualy for the payment, which will be delivered by Social Security Scotland, the person applying must have received a job offer for paid employment.They must be out of paid work and must have been receiving one of the qualying benefits for six months or more at the time of the job offer:Income-based Jobseekerrsquos AllowanceIncome SupportIncome-related Employment and Support AllowanceUniversal CreditWhat has the Scottish Government said Social Security Secretary Shirley-Anne Somerville said: ldquoI am delighted that our Job Start Payment is today now open for applications it really couldnrsquot come at a better time to support our young people to take up job offers.ldquoYoung people are among those whose job prospects have been hardest hit by this pandemic.

The impact on Olivebank Road would be truly calamitous.The plan will go before a lsquovirtualrsquo meeting of the planning committee after being called off the delegated list by ward councillor Stuart Currie because of the level of local concern.He said: ldquoI have called this application off the list to ensure that all the concerns raised by local residents are discussed and elected members can understand not only the strength of feeling but also the planning issues that exist as a result of this application.Musselburgh  Inveresk Community Council has lodged an objection, citing traffic congestion, emissions, and the facilityrsquos close proximity to local schools as concerns.A public campaign lsquoNo McDonaldrsquos in Musselburghrsquo was also launched in a bid to halt the plan, highlighting concerns such as increased traffic congestion, litter and air pollution.The planning report stated that there were  written representations to the application and, of these,  were objections.It said: ldquoThe councilrsquos road services advise they accept the conclusions of the traffic network modelling exercise, that the traffic impact associated with the proposed development would be minimal and there would be no adverse impact on the operation of the local highway network.ldquoMany written objections are made on the grounds of the proximity of the proposed drive-thru restaurant to Musselburgh Grammar School, and that such a facility promotes unhealthy eating and thus would lead to harmful health consequences.ldquoThe East Lothian Local Development Plan  does not contain any policies restricting the location of drive-thru restaurant facilities to a certain distance from schools, or any other educational establishments.

E-bikes offer a greater mileage for commuting with less physical effort required and a safer means of physical distancing.ldquoE-bike public hire stations, which will be managed by another company, will be installed in Musselburgh at the Brunton Hall and next to Musselburgh Train Station in autumn.ldquoE-bike hire areas in other towns across East Lothian are proposed. In addition, discussions are ongoing with local bike shop businesses as to how they can support the public hire scheme.Public Bike Shareschemes have been introduced across the world, with many using docks which lock the bicycles in and release them for a small fee or with use of a card to users however, their success in the UK has been limited, with vandalism a major concern.In London, Santander Cycles operates a successful scheme which has spread to Swansea and Milton Keynes, with users issued a key to access the bicycles, which cost pound and allow free use for the first  minutes and then charge pound for every additional  minutes.East Lothian Council said that as well as Musselburgh, there were plans to have public hire stations for e-bikes in Haddington town centre and at Prestonpans Railway Station, Longniddry Railway Station, Memorial Square in Prestonpans, Civic Square in Tranent and Memorial Park in Cockenzie, each of which would have capacity for eight bikes.East Lothian MP Kenny MacAskill described the changes as ldquoreclaiming the streets.He said: ldquoThis is a challenge but equally an opportunity, offering other public health improvements, as well as the required social distancing. Reducing air pollution and promoting walking and cycling will have benefits for us all. Providing adequate car parking remains essential, with vehicular access understandably restricted. Itrsquos not easy but it can be done. As communities on the continent have discovered, people reclaiming their streets has benefits for all.Iain Gray, East Lothian MSP, said: ldquoThe substantial increase in the number of people walking and cycling, both locally and across the UK, was one of the positive unintended consequences of lockdown.ldquoThis clearly brings benefits for both the health of the iniduals doing more walking and cycling, and for the environmentit means fewer vehicles on our roads.ldquoTherefore, I welcome measures to encourage and support the continuation of this growth in walking and cycling as we move out of lockdown.ldquoHowever, changes must be designed and implemented with ongoing consultation with the local communities affected.In a report to councillors, Peter Forsyth, the councilrsquos assets manager, revealed ambitions to make the most of the side effects of lockdown.He said: ldquoThe Covid- shutdown has resulted in less air pollution and reduced greenhouse gas emissions primarily due to extensive travel restrictions. Other positive impacts have included reduced energy consumption, and increased walking and cycling. Accordingly, there are opportunities for a lsquoGreen Recoveryrsquo, adapting to new ways of working with increased changes to travel behaviour all in support to the transition to a low carbon economy and low carbon lestyles for the longer term that will enable us to continue to tackle the climate emergency.A council spokesperson said: ldquoAs part of Spaces for People, we are proposing the installation of e-bikes in suitable locations. E-bikes are becoming increasingly popular as an active travel option which could be potentially attractive as an alternative form of clean, green transportation.

What a day!Since then I have seen the otter a couple more times.The Eurasian otter is a secretive, semi-aquatic species with chocolate brown fur, webbed feet, and a powerful tail. Their thick coats are built of two layers of fur: an inner layer that works as insulation, and the outer, waterproof layer. The two-layered system prevents their skin from direct contact with water and subsequent temperature loss.Their nostrils and ears stay closed as otters swim underwater.Despite being excellent swimmers, they cannot hold their breath underwater for long periods the average time underwater is about  seconds as they e.Otters are solitary, territorial animals, that live in underground holes called lsquoholtsrsquo. The size of their territory ies and depends on the quality of the habitat, amount of food and number of possible holts.It is also known that a male otter has a larger territory that can even overlap several female ottersrsquo territories. Otters usually have a well-defined area within their grounds in which they feed, rest and breed.Seeing signs of otters is generally easier than seeing the animals themselves. If you happen to find yourself at the riverbank or a sea loch, look for five-toed footprints and otter droppings , that are left in places such as fallen trees, rocks and weirs.Spraints are easily identiable as they contain visible fish bones and have a characteristic and not particularly unpleasant smell that has been described as ranging from fish to freshly brewed jasmine tea!The otter that you may see at the coast is very often called a lsquosea otterrsquo however, this is the same species as the animals that live further inland.If you would like to share how you get on finding the otters oryou have any rare kind of wildle in your area, I would love to hear from you.Speak to you next month!zanslensfacebook zanslens instagram zans_lens twitter zans_lens"},{"url":null,"title":"tantallon-castle-john-muir-birthplace-among-attractions-reopening","story":"Historic Environment Scotlandhas confirmed that Tantallon Castle, east of North Berwick, will accept visitors with pre-booked tickets from next Friday .A phased reopening of some HES sites across the county has begun, but there is no date yet for when Dirleton Castle could reopen.Both of these county attractions closed in March when lockdown was initiated to combat the coronavirus pandemic.A statement from HES said: ldquoAfter what has felt like historyrsquos longest wait, the easing of certain lockdown restrictions means you and your family can now grab a well-earned change of scenery at a selection of our safe and secure sites.ldquoItrsquos a pleasure to welcome you back and we would like to thank you for your patience and perseverance in staying home during this pandemic.ldquoWhen you arrive at any of our reopening sites, wersquoll need to work together to make sure we are all following the rules and staying protected.Entry tickets for Tantallon Castle can now be pre-booked via the website historicenviron ment.scotWalk-up visitors without an advanced booking will not be able to gain entry.Meanwhile, in another boost for the countyrsquos residents and visitors, the museum telling the story of Dunbarrsquos most famous son has reopened its doors.The John Muir Birthplace Museum welcomed back visitors on Tuesday for the first time since the coronavirus outbreak started.The museum, on the townrsquos High Street, allows visitors to explore the le and legacy of the man recognised as the father of the US national park system, in the house where he was born.Meanwhile, further attractions are also available for visitors to see at the National Museum of Flight, East Fortune.Hangar had already been open, along with the historic airfield and the parachute store.Now, the military aviation and civil aviation hangars have also opened to the public.Lucy Casot, CEO of Museums Galleries Scotland, said: ldquoWith so many of our museums and galleries across Scotland now able to open, therersquos so much to choose from, many with wonderful outdoor spaces to enjoy with the whole family.ldquoItrsquos not just a fun day out museums and galleries have a positive impact on our social wellbeing as well as the local economy, so we are urging everyone to make a point of visiting their favourite museum or gallery.ldquoAdditionally, with many of us staycationing this year, it is a wonderful opportunity to discover more of Scotlandrsquos inspiring museums and galleries."},{"url":null,"title":"retired-musselburgh-nurse-writes-book-caring-people-dementia","story":"Dee Jenkins, , of Eskmills Road, said the main aim of the publication ndash I Remember Dementia ndash was to encourage carers of dementia patients.Born in Dublin in , Mrs Jenkins, who has lived in Musselburgh for  years, came to Scotland in  to enter a religious order, the Novitiate for the Sisters of La Sagesse, at Leuchie House, North Berwick.

Established in  and supported by a unique partnership between the British Council, the Edinburgh International Festival, the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish and UK Governments, it traditionally offers a biennial ministerial forum in which artists and cultural leaders come together with politicians and policy makers to discuss substantial, global issues of mutual interest during the largest annual celebration of the arts in the world ndash the Edinburgh Festivals.The Covid- pandemic prevents hosting the summit at the Scottish Parliament this year. However, the resulting move to a Special Edition entirely online gives us a dferent opportunity, a way to make the Culture Summit even more accessible and available to everyone, be they in business, policy making, politics, economy, the arts, or simply curious. Neither geography nor means is a barrier, all films are freely available on the Culture Summit site from today.In our present circumstances, the summitrsquos title ,The Transformational Power of Culture, seems particularly appropriate. In the midst of a devastating pandemic, governments and cultural leaders alike grapple with unprecedented challenges attempting to save lives and sustain careers. At such times, it is important that a summit such as this, should develop a narrative around the signicance of culture for other facets of human societies.The summitrsquos collaborators in  are actors, theatre directors, choreographers, novelists, librarians, painters, museum curators, musicians and singers. They are also architects, economists, educators, epidemiologists, historians, human rights advocates, medical and social scientists, philanthropists, philosophers and tech entrepreneurs.Very much in this spirit, and by way of an example, when considering an approach to one of our themes, Culture  Education, the summit has chosen to collaborate not only with some amazing young musicians who are part of youth orchestras in Los Angeles and Raploch here in Scotland, but quite deliberately with an economist, an epidemiologist, a neuroscientist and an educational entrepreneur cum philanthropist.This eclectic group of expertise has been enlisted to make the case for why culture matters, and why, from the perspective of health and well-being, economic prosperity, and most important of all, from an humanitarian point of view, it is so vital that culture and creativity together with the encouragement of empathy and emotional intelligence, should play a far greater role in our schools and classrooms.Many of the perspectives of our contributors remind me of the work of the pioneering educational psychologist Howard Gardner, who in , first proposed the concept of multiple intelligence not just linguistic and logical , but spatial, bodily-kinaesthetic, musical, interpersonal and intrapersonal forms of intelligence demonstrated by architects and sculptors, dancers and choreographers, athletes and gymnasts, business leaders, scientists and even politicians.Courtesy of Professor Gardner, the definitions of intelligence become vastly expanded. He argues persuasively that intelligence is not single-minded but multi-faceted. He describes the need for ldquomultiple intelligences to navigate the complex challenges of the world around us.The message for policy makers and politicians is urgent. Beyond the need for hope and inspiration in the lives of young people, there is an emerging body of knowledge from economists to neuroscientists which advocates for educational systems to place far greater emphasis on cultural learning opportunities and creativity from early childhood.Join us in embracing a world of creative potential, demonstrating the critical need for greater recognition of the role of culture as a catalyst to change our future.

Most Govanites would agree and the area is without doubt the one with the strongest sense of identity amongst the cityrsquos older working class districts.Many people would know that Govan was the former World Capital of Shipbuilding where at its height in the ldquoThree Yairds, men produced about a quarter of the worldrsquos tonnage of ships.They might also know that Govan was one of the cradles of the labour movement, with the emergence of trades unions, the co-operative organisations and the Labour Party, with a strong tradition of struggle from the Rent Strikes of World War One, through to the occupation of the shipyards in the early s with the UCS work-in. And would be aware that with the decline of shipbuilding in the last  years, Govan has fallen on hard times, its population reduced to less than , from the figure of , when the burgh was annexed by Glasgow in .But would they know that Govan is considerably older than Glasgow which annexed it  And that for centuries, as an ecclesiastical centre of the ancient Kingdom of Strathclyde, it was more important than the city  Would they know anything about Govanrsquos collection of early Christian incised stones, one of the finest in Scotland and indeed the UK .Possibly not and it might well surprise more than a few that Govan can claim to have the finest collection of A-listed buildings and public sculpture outside the city centre and west end of Glasgow, dating from the time of its economic prosperity and industrial greatness. Those yet ignorant ndash and even those in the know, since Govan is changing and developing after decades of stagnation ndash should hop on that clockwork orangeand disembark at Govan Cross subway station ndash and take the following walkabout round Central Govan as an introduction to hopefully further personal explorations.THE WALK. Around Govan Cross you see the beneficial effects of the Town Centre Action Plan, which at a cost of pound. million ndash a bankerrsquos bonus ndash made an improvement to the area, providing paving, seating, signage ndash and a restoration of the Aitken Fountain. This was an  memorial to Govanrsquos first Medical Officer of Health whose sanitary improvements massively reduced death rate in the mid-th century.As well as many other insignia the fountain sports the coat of arms of the burgh of Govan, established in , which shows ying icons but always a shiprsquos engineer and a shiprsquos carpenter. See how many such emblems you can spot on your ramble ndash and whether you can spot a single Glasgow one!There is much to here but the jewel is the refurbished former British Linen Bank by Salmon  Gillespie, an A-listed tenement from , with a delightful open-crown metal roof. Its sculptures are especially fine look at the one above the door showing two male angels driving a sailing boat by blowing their conches. Here you stand on Water Row, once a Roman road to a Clyde crossing, later the centre of the fishing and weaving community.. Moving west along the Govan Road, on your left is a statue of William Pearce, owner of the Fairfield yard and Govan MP in the s. Coming from the Chatham naval dockyard he brought war work and massive prosperity to Fairfieldrsquos, and to himself, dying worth a present day fortune of pound million. He stands beside Brechinrsquos Bar, a mock baronial building from over a century ago, which was originally Cardellrsquos Temperance Institute.Once when in there the punter next me at the bar turned unannounced and stated, ldquoSee that Noam Chomsky, we had him in here in the Year of Culture. I have never investigated the truth of this, nor of the claim of the regulars of Brechinrsquos that, at chucking out time, the Black Man, as they call the statue, takes a few steps.Opposite Brechinrsquos is located the Pearce Instutute or PI, known as the Heart of Govan. Lady Pearce gave the money for its foundation in memory of her husband and it opened in  as a cultural and social centre, with a theatre, library, billiard room and washing and cooking facilities for the majority who lacked adequate facilities. These were located in the Womenrsquos area, entered by a separate door. Times change, and females can enter the front door nowadays. The A-Listed PI was designed by Edinburgh architect Rowand Anderson in an eclectic style one half Dutch Renaissance, the other Scottish Vernacular. Atop the latter part sits a metal galleon made by the workers of Fairfields, who also contributed much free labour to helping build the. PI... Moving further west we reach the War Memorial to those killed in the First World War, behind which lies another of Govanrsquos glories, the Old Kirk . Space prohibits more than mentioning that this ndash also by Rowan Anderson ndash stands on a site that has probably been one of Christian worship for  years and a pagan one beforehand, and that it contains one of the finest collections of incised early Christian stones in Scotland, over  ndash crosses, grave slabs and the famous Govan Hogbacks as well as thereputed sargophacus of St Constantine. The connections with the Reformationand the Iona Community, add further fascination. .Between here and the next stop, Fairfields, there stands a iety of tenement buildings, some in good repair, some in less ndash and examples of the new tenements built in the last  years. The Lyceum, a former art-deco palace of a cinema is also passed and high up on it is an illustration of the original Lyceum Music Hall, destroyed in a fire. When it opened in , a packed audience heard a performance of Bizetrsquos Carmen. See Govan, see Kulcher.. On reaching ElderStreet on the right, the gates of the former Fairfield Yard, now BAE Systems, loom into view no longer do  men stream in and out of here twice a day the old tramlines which brought goods into the yards are still visible amongst the cobbles. A further walk along Govan Road brings you to the impressive front door of the former offices of the yard, now Fairfield Heritage, hosting a fine display on the history of shipbuilding housed in a building to match. The offices were designed by Keppie and Honeyman, the firm Macintosh later worked for, and though splendid inside, their finest feature is the doorway itself where amongst the usual icons of nymphs and Neptune, stand two le-size sandstone scultures of working men done by Pittendreich Macgillivray. This building is also A-Listed..Though achieving its maximum size under Pearce, the yard became a world leader under the previous owners, the Elders. Crossing the road gives a good view of the office building and also allows entrance to Elder Park, the only piece of ground in central Govan formerly not covered by tenements or industry. The park has a ied collection of sculptures relating to Govanrsquos history and a boating pond. Previously there was also a dairy farm and a small zoo!Just south of the park gates stands a statue of John Elder, leaning on the compound steam engine he invented, which gave Clyde shipbuilding a competitive edge. The statue was exectued by Boehm and is complemented by one of Isabella Elder herself further over in the park. Despite the importance of this place it was shockingly refused a Heritage Lottery grant some years ago ndash while many less worthy were not.Exiting the park is done from behind the library, with its splendid cast iron railings, and very fine frontage. The building was designed by another top Glasgow architect, J.J Burnet, and Govanites are proud of the fact they had a public library in  some years before Glasgow built their ious examples. Inside the building are busts of the Elders, and an interesting painting of pre-industrial Govan by Brotchie. This building is also A -Listed.. Moving back eastalong pedesrianised Langlands Road through an assortment of housing built to replace demolished tenements, brings us to Golspie Street, with its stunning ldquoAmsterdam-style new tenement, and then past the car park for the Govan Shopping Centre till we emerge back at Brechinrsquos and the Black Man with a very clear view of the PI. Back at Govan Cross, visit the excellent Cafe . Rest and reflect that you have only scraped the surface of central Govan, never mind Greater Govan...andyou leave unimpressed, there is no hope for you.Ian R Mitchell is the author of Walking through Glasgowrsquos Industrial Past "},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-hugh-macdonald-never-met-fidelma-feel-like-many-part-life","story":"This later caused her some embarrassment in her role as a waitress on a floating hotel. It was not plain sailing for me, either. Stilettos were not ideally suited for my afternoon duties as centre-half for Blantyre Celtic.This recollection of me as Bambi on horse anaesthetic is highly analogous to my faltering steps into Fidelmarsquos fiefdom. This bailiwick is guarded by an imperious Afghan hound, seems to have a lingering scent of jasmine and the soft echo of the pop of something sparkling.There is a straightforward choice when invading this space. Does one mumble something inane  Or does one acknowledge the absence of Fidelma and confront it head-on with the stark but sincere crudity of a Glasgow kiss  I have only reluctantly discarded the inanities option since it is, after all, my superpower. It has, though, been overwhelmed by the realisation there is something important to be said about absence, particularly in the case of one, specic columnist.There was a moment last week when I read the words of Fidelmarsquos son and was hit by an epiphany with the force of that aforementioned Glasgow kiss. His account of a draining trip to visit his mother in hospital contained what is called a vignette. .It was this: the weary traveller confronts ailing mum. He asks a question. There is no immediate answer. Has he not been recognised \"Was it my face mask  Was she so sick that she did not recognise mehellip  It felt like minutes had passed before she mumbled weakly through her mask, lsquoYou could have at least worn a shirt and maybe some white shorts. Itrsquos such a waste to see you dress badly like the French.rsquo\"Regressing to my superpower of uttering banalities, I told myself that many of her readers would similarly be unacquainted with Fidelma in the narrow terms of physical meetings, private conversations.This points to the brilliance of a certain kind of newspaper column. There are many columnists who make extraordinary claims about their work. They can be the Voice of Anything From Reason To Football to Interpretation of Sanskrit Scrolls.One famous financial columnist was once told by a sub-editor that his latest offering was unintelligible. \"I am writing for three people in England,\" the columnist replied. \"And you are not one of them.\" The three comprised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the governor of the Bank of England and the permanent under-secretary to the Treasury, apparently. This story sounds so authentic to an old hack that it might almost be true.It is certainly irrefutable that many columns totter uneasily on the twin pillars of certainty and unbridled preaching, both based on a solid foundation of ego.Now, Fidelma may be read by the Chancellor of the Exchequer or, I suspect, by the First Minister. But she is not writing for him or her. She is writing for herself. She takes her le with its routine humiliations, its senseless pain and its occasional, and overwhelming joy and presents it to us with an eloquence that is only superseded by her bravery. She tells us every Saturday how she is feeling as a dog sulks, bones complain and her house gently falls down around her.There is anger, contentment, bitterness, resignation, humour, sadness, happiness and even consolation in all of this. The dog finally comes in. The pain usually subsides. And the house  Well, who cares  Itrsquos a house, it has a fridge, it hosts a glass and there is a tincture of something pleasantly numbing in its deepest interior.We ndash or certainly I ndash read all this with a sense of bright satisfaction that sometimes belies the darkness of some of the content. This is because I have been privileged to have been invited into a le. We can share an unflinching gaze at the reality of ageing. As that great Scottish philosopher, Billy Connolly, once intoned: lsquoOld age is not for softies.rsquoThis toughness in Fidelma is enhanced at both her realisation of this truth and her defiance in the face of it. Her superpower, though, is somewhat miraculous. Think of this. A woman lies across the water, fighting against illness. Thousands of people who have never met her, from Bargeddie to Bearsden, from Callander to Cumnock and Carrbridge, wish her well.This offers welcome proof of the capacity for compassion, of the boundless ability we have to reach out to others. We care about a person we have never met. This is a tribute to Fidelmarsquos writing. But it is more than that. Most wondrously, it is a recognition of the trials and triumphs of a shared humanity articulated by a single voice.Thatrsquos some trick, Fidelma.

Physically he was also tall and handsome, totally imperturbable, probably from having faced the worst. He was someone whose best qualities most of us would strive to emulate, and fail. Branwen described him as her rock. He was.I saw him last in February in Glasgow, we went for a drink or two in the Doublet on the edge of his native Partick, then to the Shish Mahal for a curry, where we planned the trip we would never take. The original one, viewed from now, had its moments of high farce.He had told his family that he was going grape-picking in France, instead he was travelling to Paris on a single ticket and a handful of change to pick up explosives to deliver to comrades in Madrid who were planning to blow up Franco and his cabinet on a dais at Real Madridrsquos Bernabeacuteu stadium. The only French he knew was zut alors, which amused his anarchist hosts, and his Spanish was non-existent. He was to wear a bandage on his hand so his contact could recognise him and he had to be taught a phrase ndash me duele la manondash as a coded response.He set out to the south with the plastic explosive taped to his body, hitchhiking and wearing a kilt so that hersquod get lts, which led to reports in the Argentine press that a Scottish transvestite had tried to kill the Caudillo. His last lt in France broke down just short of the Spanish border and Stuart had to push the car across, sweating and hoping the plastic would hold firm, under the gaze of the Guardia Civil in their shiny, patent, three-cornered hats.The mission had been infiltrated by an informer and when Stuart handed over the package to Fernando Carballo Blanco, a carpenter who was constructing the dais and would place the charges, they were swooped on. It was August , A Hard Dayrsquos Night was top of the hit parade and Alec Douglas-Home was Prime Minster, doing economics with matches. The two were convicted on September  in a brief trial before a military tribunal, Blanco given  years.It was undoubtedly international pressure and publicity that deterred the lsquocourtrsquo from passing the customary death sentence for lsquoterrorismrsquo, which was then carried out by garrotte, the medieval process of neck-breaking in a slow mechanical strangulation by a metal collar and a bolt through the neck.Stuart was mildly roughed-up by Francorsquos secret police but he was forced to watch his co-conspirator brutally tortured. Blancorsquos father had been shot and murdered by Francorsquos forces for being a trade unionist, driving his mother mad with grief and ending in an asylum. Although Stuart was released after just less than four years after an appeal by his mother, Blanco served  years. When I was contacted by his niece last week she denied that he had been a hero. ldquoHe just wanted to free the Spanish people, she said.Franco was an unapologetic fascist and dictator who led the overthrow of the Republican government, precipitating the civil war, with the blood of many thousands, and not just combatants, on his hands. As he put it: ldquoOur regime is based on bayonets and blood, not on hypocritical elections.Stuartrsquos memory of the show trial, conducted in Spanish of course which he could not then understand, was of  army officers, heavy with medals, swords on the table in front of them, comprising what passed for a jury in a large, sticky, vaulted room. He said he felt he had been transported into the final act of some grand opera. ldquoI was  years and six weeks old, a boy from working-class Glasgow and Irsquod never been to the opera, he remembered.He learned Spanish in the Carabanchel jail and sat A-levelsand was sent money regularly from Britain but also from Spanish anarchists. The only English names they seemed to know were John, Paul, George and Ringo, so the donations turned up in these names and the authorities thought he was being funded by the Beatles.He was released in , got work as a gas fitter as Britain was converting to North Sea gas and inadvertently almost blew up a large part of Essex when he was unable to stop a massive gas leak.In , after having been arrested and spending  months in jail on remand, Stuart was acquitted of being a member of the Angry Brigade, which had carried out a series of casualty-less explosions against Edward Heathrsquos government. He claimed, and the jury believed him, that the police had planted two detonators in his car. One of the four of the convicted Stoke Newington Eight, John Barker, said later about his own experience, ldquoThe police fitted-up a guilty man.Two years later Stuart and I holidayed in a remote cottage up a narrow, pebbled track outside Oban, where we walked, talked and sank a few malts in the evening round a roaring fire. At the same time a Francoist banker had been kidnapped by an anarchist group and a ransom paid. When Stuart ed to London he was warned by a friendly Special Branch officer that he wasnrsquot safe and should get out of town, which he did with his we Brenda, first to Yorkshire and then the remote Orkney island of Sanday, to a house called Over the Water.Then, the island might have been some prototype of an anarchist society, in that it was peacefully,bibulously, self-governing, with only an occasional police presence coming in by ferry from the mainland, the officersrsquo travel well telegraphed. Irsquom not sure anyone there bothered with car insurance. On one occasion a man was arrested for alleged drunk driving, the local doctor refused to test him and by the time the coppers had somehow managed to hire a boat and take him to the main island he was sober.I visited him and Brenda often, and many an evening was spent in the Kettletoft Hotel bar, often with instruments and a sing-song going, irregardless of conventional closing time, until the last patron exited. On one occasion two bold officers turned up and insisted that the bar was cleared at pm, to the considerable ire and disgruntlement of those of us who considered the evening was just beginning.There was a party to go to and Stuart and some others light-heartedly berated the two policemen now sitting in a car outside with the windows down. While he and they kept the officers occupied someone crept round the back of the car and let the tyres down.We sped off waving.Stuart and Brenda spent seven years on Sanday, Branwen was born there, and from the island he launched his publishing house the Cienfuegos Press , a major publisher of anarchist literature, and a radical newspaper, the Free-Winged Eagle. The local minister of course denounced him as the ldquoanti-Christ.Stuart Christie was born in Partick to a hairdresser and a hard-drinking trawlerman, Albert. He was named Stuart after Bonnie Prince Charlie, ldquothe only man in history to be called after three separate sheepdogs, according to fellow Partiquois Billy Connolly. When he was six his parents went to friends for a drink, his dad was given a glass of sherry which he looked at in disgust, poured down the sink and walked out the door without saying a word. ldquoThe joke was that he had gone for a packet of fags, but thatrsquos the last time we saw him until he turned up  years later, Christie recalls.By then Stuart had a half-sister, Olivia. But the formative influence on him had been his granny Agnes McCulloch Davis, with whom he did most of his growing up on Arran and in Glasgow. He described her as the moral barometer in his le, ldquoand she provided the star I followed. She kept me on the straight and narrow. Well, with a few well-publicised detours!His partial autobiography, a compilation of three self-published volumes, was appropriately called Granny Made Me An Anarchist, in which many of the truths are told. Itrsquos a rollicking account peppered with cultural and political reference points, from the Jeely Piece Song, to Leslie Howard, Buntildeuel and Just William. Itrsquos also extremely funny.He also wrote a trilogy of novels iexclPistoleros! The Chronicles of Farquar McHarg, about a fictional Scottish anarchist born in  who became involved in the Spanish civil war, which weaves in actual happenings and some of the principal villains of the time. Stuart also managed to pack in a degree in history and politics along the way.Brenda Christie died in June last year, nursed by her husband and earlier this year Stuart moved to Colchester to be near daughter Branwen and her girls, his granddaughters Merri and Mo, for too short a time. He had previously fought cancer, this time it was lung cancer which spread to the bone. His suffering was mercully short.Irsquove been with him when hersquos been introduced to people and occasionally the response would be, ldquoNot that Stuart Christie !

This is not a normal year: the UK was faced with tackling coronavirus and saving lives and it meant effectively shutting down large parts of the economy and paying almost  million people not to go to work, at a cost of poundbillion so far. But from August, employers have had to start contributing towards the cost of furlough and the scheme is expected to end in October. The question is: what then The Chancellor Rishi Sunak says there is no possibility of an extension because of the economic cost and he points out that most other countries are making similar moves to phase out their schemes. But one country that isnrsquot is Germany. The government there is expected to announce next week that it will extend Kurzarbeit, which was the model for furlough, from  months to two years and the reason the finance minister Olaf Scholz gave was clear. ldquoThe corona crisis wonrsquot suddenly disappear in the next few weeks, he said.The German finance ministerrsquos logic is hard to refute. The economic damage done by coronavirus will not stop suddenly in October just because the Chancellor has stopped the furlough scheme ndash indeed, the end of furlough will deepen the trouble for many employers and itrsquos likely the real nature and scale of the economic crisis will only become obvious then. There are some businesses that would be perfectly viable in normal circumstances that may go underfurlough is abruptly ended.The picture also looks grim for particular sectors that continue to be badly hit. Some remain completely shut down ndash the countryrsquos theatres and concert venues for example. Others, such as pubs and restaurants, are being forced to operate way below their normal capacity, thereby hitting profits. For these sectors, the furlough scheme will continue to be essential way beyond October and the UK Government should think again about an extension.Naturally, the cost of such an extension is a concern, but it must be weighed against the possible costs of not extending, the biggest of which could be mass unemployment the cost of borrowing has also never been so low ndashever there was a time to borrow for the sake of the economy, this is it. It might also be possible to limit the cost of extending the furlough scheme by targeting it at the areas that need it most.The uncertain effect of withdrawing furlough, and the fact that it will not apply equally across the economy or dferent parts of the UK, also points to a particular dficulty for the Scottish Government. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments have taken slightly dferent decisions at dferent times and yet the devolution settlement means the Scottish Government could not extend furlough in Scotland because it does not have the borrowing powers to fund it. The First Minister has repeatedly complained about this and it is time the UK Government listened.There are other ideas the UK Government should consider as we hopefully move from crisis into containment into recovery. Scrapping or freezing employersrsquo national insurance payments for example. A holiday on business rates would also help the countryrsquos town centres to begin the fight-back. All of it will cost ndash and all of it will have to be paid back in some way in due course ndash but the alternative is a clf-edge in October that will deepen the economic crisis rather than ease it. The scale of the mountain we have to climb is clear and the Scottish and UK governments will have to take unprecedented action for a long time to come yet to ensure we get over it."},{"url":null,"title":"workers-sec-lose-jobs-furlough-scheme-winds","story":"In an e-mail sent to staff and shared with the The Herald, Levy Restaurants - the company which employs hospitality staff at the venue- toldworkers their last furlough payment would be made on September .Valentina Severa Clavell, a worker at Finnieston-basedvenuesaid they had received \"barely any communication and support\".:Scottish Government told to stop savage job cuts at Donald Trumps Turnberry resortWorkers were told that due to the fact live events were not able to continue because ofongoing restrictions, the company would not continue their employment.A Unite hospitality spokesman confirmed the news: \"The way in which Levy Restaurants have treated their staff at Scottish Events Campus is nothing short of disgraceful.There is an alternative to mass redundancy available till at least October  in the Job Retention Scheme.

Unlike many AI voices, it has been given a gender-neutral, north east of England accent.Verena Rieser, Professor in Computer Science at Heriot-Watt University, where researchers will look into methods employed to build conversational agents, said: ldquoWhen people think of Amazonrsquos Alexa, they probably imagine a woman, perhaps in some sort of secretarial position.ldquoWe are askingthey have to be female and so human-like ldquoThen there is the behaviour of these systems when they are asked something thatrsquos not appropriate.ldquoThe danger is that when people interact with these systems they may reinforce gender stereotypes: you are talking to a woman, insulting her and yet she is not even pushing back.The three-year study will involve research on the psychological impacts of the AI voices to be carried out by researchers at Strathclyde University and which will analyse what messages the female AI voices convey and how they might influence behaviour.While a digital education element will also be carried out by researchers at Edinburgh University, which will look at how AI systems are constructed.ldquoWe are interested in finding out why these systems are the way they are andit stems from the fact that the people who build them are not a very erse workforce, added Prof. Rieser.Amazon has previously said test users responded most strongly to a female voice for its Alexa assistant. Microsoft has also said it found a female voice best embodied the qualities expected of a digital assistant ndash helpful, supportive and trustworthy.Meanwhile Google has said that it planned to use a male voice for its assistant, but the technology responded better to a higher pitched female format. Last year it introduced  dferent voices in an effort to introduce more ersity.However, itrsquos possible that the AI voice of the future could be less obliging young secretary and a little more CP.Prof. Rieser added: ldquoThe argument in the original UNESCO report says we dont have to make them human voices, and they could be much more clearly robotic.ldquoBut then,you make them too robotic, does that make them creepy Designing a Feminist Alexa ndash An Exercise in Empathic Design on Thursday, August , is part of the RSE Curious summer programme."},{"url":null,"title":"back-business-aberfoyle","story":"Aberfoyle was celebrating a revival in its fortunes with a host of fledgling businesses opening up, For Sale signs taken down from the main thoroughfare, and a booming number of visitors ing to the once forgotten former tourist mecca.A year later, little could those new businesses have imagined the turbulence they were about to face. With Covid- challenging even the most well--established companies, how could the new kids on the block cope ldquoThe roof fell in, is how Bob Taylor describes it. He and his we had just launched Maggiersquos Aberfoyle Kitchen in Main Street in June  and thought the toughest challenge for them would be the businesses surviving its first winter when the leblood tourist trade dries up in the Stirlingshire village.ldquoEverything obviously fell apart in March and we struggled in the early days, he said. ldquoWe were allowed to stay open because we are a food shop but we decided to close as it was quite scary here.

Businesses stepped up to help vulnerable people and thatrsquos nice to see. We donated one of our bikes to someone who was volunteering to pick up prescriptions. There was a positive atmosphere.He said there had been ldquoincreasing anxiety when more people started arriving but ldquoyou have to balance that with the reality that Aberfoyle relies on visitors. As more family visitors started arriving when lockdown lted the anti-social behaviour and littering that had plagued the village earlier on had eased, he said.The past five or six weeks have seen something of a revival for Aberfoyle with an influx of English tourists.ldquoThere were definitely more tourists from England than normal, he said. ldquoWe are not getting the normal bus tour traffic which has always been a source of visitors but we have been getting a lot of families from the UK who are having their holidays here. Perhaps the staycation trend will be repeated in future years. Hopefully thatrsquos something we can capitalise on.Trevor Geraghty, chairman of the local Strathard Community Council, said that, in some ways, lockdown had boosted local businesses and the local community.He said people were essentially forced to shop locally much more than they ever had and that certain shops in Aberfoyle ndashincluding the Co-op, pharmacy and the butcher ndash had thrived in the early stages of lockdown.ldquoIn remote areas you typically have workers commuting to bigger cities and they do their shopping on their commute he said. ldquoThe Post Office here became a massive leline and had more to do than they ever had. There was tons of community spirit -ndashIntrepidco-ordinated collections for a charity in Glasgow, for example.He admitted that businesses badly affected where were naturally similarly affected in Aberfoyle but said locals made an effort to support local businesses once lockdown started to ease. ldquoThere were absolutely some businesses that did well and probably better than normal in terms of the local community making up, in some way, for the [tourism] drop in businesses, he added. ldquoAnd with people spending more time in their communities [earlier in lockdown] it opened their eyes as to what is on their doorstep ndash cycles they might never have done, or trails they havenrsquot explored.With a new Co-op to take over the vacant garden centre site on Main Street, the ldquoanchor project signals things are still on the up in Aberfoyle, he said. ldquoItrsquos not easy, but itrsquos not all grim.Local councillor Martin Earl said you could be forgiven for thinking ldquothese past few months would have dealt a blow from which such places would struggle to recover from.The truth was ldquofar from it, he said. ldquoThe community spirit, support for local businesses and the determination to pull on through is what we have seen in spades, he added. ldquoAberfoyle, its people and the businesses it supports is in good shape and is going to get better and better.

When protesters took to the streets of Belarus two weeks ago over the disputed election result that saw authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko claim a sixth term, the security forcesrsquo crackdown was uncompromising.Undaunted, the people of Belarus continue to protest in unprecedented numbers, refusing to be cowed by state violence. According to Lukashenko, these are attempts to orchestrate a coup.But the question many are now asking is whether what we are witnessing is the beginning of another ldquocolour revolution, one with the potential to topple the post-Soviet ruler Speaking on Friday, Belarusian opposition politician Svetlana Tikhanovskaya who was forced to leave Belarus right after the vote, said she wouldto the country when she felt it was safe to do so.At a news conference in Lithuania, Tikhanovskaya said the people of Belarus wanted a new election to be held that would be free and fair. If events in the Belarusian capital Minsk these past days are any indicator, then Tikhanovskayarsquos assessment of what many of her fellow countrymen and women want is correct.Just when, though, it would be safe for the opposition leader toto Belarus, perhaps injecting fresh impetus into opposition protests, is another matter entirely.Earlier on Thursday, the Belarusian authorities opened a criminal probe against opposition activists who set up what it called a Co-ordination Council to negotiate the transition of power.The Belarusian prosecutor generalrsquos office said the creation of the council violated the constitution and opened a criminal inquiry against its founders on charges of threatening national security.ldquoThe creation and the activities of the Co-ordination Council are aimed at seizing power and inflicting damage to the national security, prosecutor general Alexander Konyuk was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.The council consists of top associates of Tikhanovskaya as well as rights activists and representatives of striking workers. It also includes the nationrsquos most famous author, Svetlana Alexievich, who won the  Nobel Prize in Literature.In tandem with the criminal probe, the regime has again also beefed up a security presence on the streets of the capital, blocking access to some government buildings and deploying police and paramilitaries in numbers outside major factories where workers have been on strike since early last week.ldquoThere should no longer be any disorder in Minsk of any kind, Lukashenko instructed his security officials, indicating he has no intention of backing down from his -year rule, one of the worldrsquos longest.ldquoPeople are tired. People demand peace and quiet, Lukashenko added. He also confirmed that border controls had been tightened to prevent an influx of ldquofighters and arms, again implying that some kind of armed coup attempt was in the making.One challenge Lukashenko is undoubtedly facing though has come from sections of the countryrsquos state-controlled media on whom the autocrat has long relied to shape public opinion. In the past week, hundreds of employees of state television have gone on strike. Journalists from the leading state-owned daily newspaper, Zvyazda, also joined their broadcast colleagues and put out a statement demanding an end to censorship.Vyacheslav Lomonosov, one of the Belarusian TV employees who joined the strike, said he and his colleagues could no longer tolerate an official ban on reporting the truth about the regimersquos crackdown on protestersldquoThere are people killed, raped, thousands are protesting, while theyrsquore saying everythingrsquos fine in the country and nothing is going on, said Lomonosov.ldquoIt canrsquot be like that, people need to get the truth from TV, the Associated Press reported him as saying.In the first days of the protests following the election, security forces and police deliberately targeted journalists from independent Belarusian news outlets and foreign media, detaining scores, beating some of them, damaging their equipment, and seizing memory cards.Boris Goretsky, vice-president of the Belarusian Association of Journalists, confirmed the  journalists were detained while covering the protests.But it has been ordinary Belarusians who have borne the brunt of the crackdown with at least three reported killed and over , arrested.According to human rights organisations, the fates of many remain unknown two weeks after the election, feeding fears that the authorities are deliberately covering up severe injuries, or worse, carried out by the security forces.Online search services have been organised to help families locate their missing loved ones, according to Radio Free Europe  Radio Liberty RFE RL.One of them, launched by the popular independent media outlet Tut.by with the title Have You Seen This Person  enables people to post images and information about the missing and the circumstances of their disappearance so readers can contribute information or assistance in the search.People can also turn to the Angel Search and Rescue Squad, a non-profit group set up in  that describes itself as the first volunteer movement in Belarus. Its Facebook page features a hotline for readers to call with information about missing iniduals.Last week, RFE RL cited one report by the Angel group posted August  on Facebook. It concerned missing museum director, -year-old Kanstantsin Shyshmakou, who the group says was found dead by members of its team, though it provided no other details of the circumstances.Shyshmakou is said to have been one of two members of his local election commission in the southwestern Belarusian city of Vawkavysk, who refused to sign off on the results of the August  election vote.The Belarus police and Interior Ministry have questioned the veracity of such accounts provided online. In a statement, ministry spokeswoman Volha Chamadanova insisted that such information often turns out to be inaccurate.ldquoThe criminal police of the Interior Ministry have checked the information regarding more than  participants of the unsanctioned ralliesthat has been published on the website Tut.by and in ious social networks, Chamadanova wrote.ldquoThis information is not fully accurate: many of these citizens have been found at home, while the information about them is not removed in a timely fashion from these internet resources.But last week, in accounts given to Deutsche Welle , the German public international broadcaster, several Belarusian women detailed their harrowing experiences during detention and accused the authorities of inflicting torture.One of the women, Olga Pavlova, was a campaign staffer for opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya and was detained for five days. In an interview with DW, Pavlova describes how she was put into a van, filled with other people detained, and sent to prison.ldquoThe men were immediately beaten. There was a Russian woman with us. She demanded access to the Russian ambassador, but she was taken into a neighbouring cell and beaten. They told her she would neverhome, Pavlova recounted.She described how she ended up in a cell designed for four but was packed with  people. When the prisoners asked for a window to be opened, two buckets of water were dumped on them. Those in the cell, she says, nearly suffocated on the evaporating moisture. One of the prisoners suffered from epilepsy, another from diabetes, the DW interview cited her as saying. Pavlova herself had been injured by rubber bullets and stun grenades while working to provide first aid to protesters on the streets.Faced with such intimidation and given what many say is the lack of clarity about what to do next, some observers believe the opposition movement could be seriously undermined. Others point to signs that the momentum of factory and industrial strikes could be waning.According to Sergey Dylevskiy who represents strikers at the giant Minsk tractor plant , about % of workers at the plant are on strike. The rest are too afraid to leave their jobs and support the movement, he said.But other opposition activists insist the lack of any centralised leadership is not a weakness. ldquoWersquore witnessing a unique situation when protests are decentralised and spontaneous, Maria Kolesnikova, a prominent opposition figure told the BBC in Minsk.ldquoI wouldnrsquot say that in order to continue the protests, we must have a leader.Without a clear figurehead, however, it remains uncertain whether the opposition can effectively mobilise those that take to the streets. It raises question, too, whether what we are witnessing is indeed another ldquocolour revolution on a par, say, with what happened in Ukraine.Some regional watchers are wary of such comparisons.ldquoMany commentators are comparing the situation in Belarus to Ukrainersquos Orange and Maidan revolutions in   and  respectively, insists Carl Bildt, former prime minister of Sweden who also previously served as the UNrsquos special envoy for the Balkans. ldquoBut Belarus is not Ukraine, and nor is it particularly helpful to apply the Maidan model to the scene playing out in Minsk and other Belarusian cities and towns.Writing in a recent article for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute , Bildt highlights how the Maidan movement was a direct response to the Ukrainian governmentrsquos attempt to abandon the cause of European integration and reform.The revolutionaries there openly mobilised under the banner of the European Union. In Belarusrsquos case, says Bildt, domestic concerns are clearly playing the ldquomore salient role, and questions about the countryrsquos orientation vis-a-vis Europe or Russia are almost totally absent.Rather than draw parallels with Ukraine, in Belarusrsquos case, Bildt points to the situation being analogous with Armenia in spring  when mass demonstrations led to the resignation there of longtime president Serzh Sargsyan and inaugurated a new democratic era for the country.But other players are closely watching what is unfolding in Belarus, not least Russia and its president Vladimir Putin, himself no fan of colour revolutions and who has warned European leaders against ldquounacceptable meddling in the political crisis in Belarus.Last week, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov reiterated Moscowrsquos intention of protecting its influence over its longtime client state.ldquoWhat is happening in Belarus worries us very muchthinsp ...No-one is making a secret of the fact that this is about geopolitics, the fight for the post-Soviet space, Lavrov insisted.In all, Russia faces a bit of a dilemma over Belarus. That quandary was summed up on Thursday in a Financial Times article that asked the crucial questions as to how Moscow can ldquomaintain control when the dust settles, and through who .This is complicated further by the fact that while relations between Lukashenko and Putin have often been strategic, they have not exactly always been cordial.ldquoThe best option for the Kremlin now is not to sit and wait but to prepare for and manage a succession away from Lukashenko to a regime that would rely, in electoral terms, on the pro-Russian majority of Belarus, was how Dmitri Trenin, head of think tank the Carnegie Moscow Centre summed up the possible way forward for the Kremlin to the FT.But right now, of course, Belarus is not the only thing on Moscowrsquos mind. There is also the outcry over the alleged poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, a foe of Putin and a campaigner against corruption who has arrived in Germany from Siberia for treatment.Back in Belarus though it is the standoff between the regime and opposition that all eyes are focused on. As its stands, some see Lukashenko as having three options.One is wearing down the opposition through intimidation and arrests, though on that front he appears up against it given the scale of protests.Second, he could resort to martial law. Last but not least, he might call on Moscowrsquos help. Which course of action he takes will in great part be determined by what the opposition does next and that remains a dficult call for those on the streets of Minsk.ldquoI think that every person in our country feels fear and is scared now, said Svetlana Tikhanovskaya at a press conference in the Lithuanian capital Vilnius on Friday. ldquoBut it is our mission to step further over our fear and move further, she pleaded to supporters.The question now. however, is whether Tikhanovskaya herself is prepared to do just that andto Belarus. Either way this crisis is only just getting started."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/11728983.jpg?type=article-full","title":"scottish-government-urged-pay-bursary-support-student-paramedics","story":"Labour is calling on ministers to pay a bursary to those studying to become paramedics, in the same way that payments are given to student nurses and midwives.Party education spokesman Iain Gray insisted it was ldquounacceptable that student paramedics are losing out.:REVEALED: Government handed over poundm loan for Ferguson Marine to lsquoersyrsquo ndash knowing it was on brink of collapseThe Scottish Government previously announced nursing and midwery students would receive a bursary of pound, in -, with the money designed to help with the costs of accommodation and living expenses.Mr Gray said: ldquoStudent paramedics are vital to the running of our NHS and have met the challenge of the coronavirus pandemic head-on.ldquoWe cannot thank them enough for their efforts, and yet many student paramedics are living on the breadline.:SNP call for Russia to respect Ukraines independenceldquoThis is unacceptable.

It proposed further extraction of stone from the quarry as well as landscaping and restoration on the site.This was the second hearing of this application by the planning committee. A decision had previously been deferred, pending a site visit by councillors.Consideration was given by committee members to the proposal made by the development and infrastructure department, as well as the concerns raised by objectors. Reasons for objection included:After a y discussion, councillors chose to reject the application. This decision was led by Kirkwall East councillor, David Dawson, who was seconded by West Mainland councillor, Owen Tierney. The reasoning given for this was that the application proposed an extension which extended beyond the quarry#s defined mineral safeguard area, which Councillor Dawson and his colleagues felt was not justied. It was also felt that this extension would result in cumulative adverse impacts to residents living in nearby properties.Though this rejection was unanimously agreed by the planning committee, Kirkwall East councillor, John Ross Scott, formally lodged his objection to the decision taken by members after it had been made.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

HIAL’s previous engagement on the ATMS programme has been on a face-to-face basis. However, Mr Matthew is working with local authorities to determine the best way to engage with community groups given the current restrictions due to Coronavirus.Reference Economic Consultants is currently contacting community representatives as part of the consultation process and Mr Lyon encourages those contacted to engage with the process saying: “It is important that local representatives contribute to the assessment of potential economic and community impacts.“HIAL looks forward to receiving the report with the findings from Reference Economic Consultants following completion of the consultation phase.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I believe that OLA representing the cattle industry in Orkney can have a strong association with Moredun in the future.#Beth Wells, from Moredun, said “Through meetings we have been fortunate to meet many of Orkney’s livestock farmers, who are well known for their high quality beef production and we are delighted to be developing a closer working collaboration with OLA, which will be of huge benefit to both of our organisations.”OLA is a sub-group of HiHealth Herdcare which is a national cattle health scheme. Karen Johnston, from OLA, said: “We are delighted and very honoured to give our members the opportunity to benefit from expert information and support from such a prestigious and well respected organisation.  We are looking forward to seeing how this partnership progresses and the benefits it brings to Orkney farmers.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Unlike student nurses and midwives, however, those training to be a paramedic are not eligible for a bursary, despite being unable to take up part time work.  To add insult to injury, their counterparts in England do receive bursaries.“This lack of a level playing field risks putting off those we need to see coming into our health service.  The current arrangements do little to encourage young people to pursue a career as a paramedic and store up problems for the future.“When I wrote to the Health Secretary recently on behalf of a constituent, I was told the government has no plans to review the funding options for trainee paramedics. Today, Nicola Sturgeon said she would look into the matter, having also been approached by a young constituent, angry at the unequal treatment.“The First Minister needs to recognise that introducing a bursary scheme would make a real dference, not least in widening access to the profession.  It’s time the Scottish Government properly recognised the dedication of our trainee paramedics by putting them on the same footing as trainee nurses and midwives.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

On the Pentland Firth, people are still being forced to pay over the odds.“COVID has inevitably created challenges, but even prior to the pandemic there seemed to be little urgency from the Scottish Government to deliver on its promise. Assurances that Ministers will now ‘pick up the ball again’ are likely to ring hollow with islanders who just want a date for cheaper fares to be introduced.“Meantime, Ministers could help soften the blow from the delayed introduction of RET by using the underspend to cut fares on Orkney’s internal ferry services.

Cànan, ‘S na DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

But what of other aspects What of community resilience, something I suspect will barely register as a priority for most us when deciding on our weekly shop It may be the case that more people will try and grow more of their own food and local produce will, hopefully, be in greater demand.All very welcome. But what’s really needed is a completely fresh approach to our behaviour as consumers.As the pound in our pocket becomes ever more stretched we need to value it in terms of what benefit it can bring to the wider collective # who can it support, what should it support and how can that can bring about greater resilience within our own communities.It’s not radical or revolutionary. It’s just about taking a bit more time and effort to think about where best to spend our cash, especially when it comes to our most basic of needs.It can’t possibly make sense to get your Sunday roast from the supermarketthe same cut of meat is available at your local butcher at a comparable price . And especiallythat butcher has sourced his meat from the crofter down the road.It takes a bit of extra effort to call in at the butcher, for sure, but add in important elements like food miles and provenance and there really is no excuse, except for our own inherent laziness.It has always amazed me how there is any fish at all on the shelves of supermarkets in this part of the world when the local fishmongers offer far higher quality at a lower price.And, in any case, it’s now perfectly possible to buy direct from the fisherman, with many of them now offering sales to the public.That may have come about through the closure of their overseas markets during lockdown, but what better example of necessity being the mother of invention.If west-coast prawns were coveted by sophisticated palates on the Mediterranean, then they should be more than adequate for consumption a bit closer to home.It’s not that long ago that our communities were completely self-reliant in food.We do demand a more discerning choice these days # no-one would want toto a diet made up entirely of fish, mutton and potatoes.But, with an abundance of quality produce on our own doorstep, surely it makes sense to take more advantage of that and in the process create greater community resilience through sourcing from independent, local retailers.If there’s a downside to that approach, I fail to see it.ONE aspect that looks certain to change, certainly for the foreseeable, is that there will be less air travel.Through the lockdown it is estimated that carbon emissions have been reduced by over  per cent by planes being grounded alone.That’s not even taking account of reductions in car journeys and it is a staggering figure from just one simple change.There are certain elements in the environmental lobby who would have you believe that methane emissions from cattle make a signicant contribution to climate change.Never mind that bovineshave roamed the land for thousands of years without causing much harm.Never mind that it’s only the last  or  years, as our economy became ever reliant on fossil fuels, that the damage to our planet has been made.The reduction in air travel will be for economic, more than environmental, reasons.But the staggering statistics of these last few months should at least mean that when it comes to a real determination in tackling environmental damage the finger of blame will be pointed in the right direction.Then again, maybe cows are a much easier target."},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_3301349.jpg--.jpg?1597840898000\n","title":"cullybckey volunteers praised","story":"Volunteers from Cullybackey Community Partnershipwere presented with a certicate from Mayor Councillor Peter Johnston recently to recognise their efforts during this Covid- pandemic.CCP volunteers stepped up to the mark through a number of dferent initiatives to help those most vulnerable in the area in recent months.One of those was the delivery of food parcels to those both in the village and those in outlying rural areas.

An employee at Danske Bank was even disinfecting a cash machine. People had a mixed reaction to the tightened guidelines, and whether the PSNI can or will enforce them.Judith Dickson from the town said she was worried about the rise in Covid- cases in the area but said it#s all our own fault.I think the guidelines will be enforcedthey can andthe police have the manpower, but I don#t think they do, she said. It#s up to people to report it but I don#t think they will.Gavin McCandless, who lives on the outskirts of the town, felt the temporary measures were necessary to keep everyone safe.Meanwhile, Sam Cree, who said he had the virus as far back as January, was in no doubt that a second wave was on its way.After developing a dry cough and losing his sense of taste and smell, Mr Cree was convinced he contracted Covid- but said he has fully recovered.He added that Mr Swann was correct in bringing down the gathering restrictions but was not impressed with the number of people visiting pubs.I just think there will be a second wave and people will have to learn to wear their masks going into shops, he said.Charlotte Weir and her friend Beverley Connor were much more critical of Stormont#s politicians and the PSNI in how they have handled the virus. Are there even enough police to stretch themselves that far and land at people#s doors  Charlotte asked. I just don#t think the politicians have a clue what they#re doing anymore to be honest.Beverley said: I don#t think there#s a chance the police will come in and enforce everything. There#s not enough of them.Bridget Mullen criticised the new lockdown measures and felt that allowing six people into your home is nowhere near as bad as staging a wedding with  to  people.I think the younger people are more lackadaisical because they don#t think it will affect them, she added.

The ruling came in legal challenges by two victims - including Jenner McNern,- to the continued impasse around introducing the scheme with an estimated cost of £mAugust   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThey lost legs, arms or their eyesight, but the victims who gathered outside Belfast High Court never lost heart.Yesterday, their long and exhausting years of struggle finally paid off as a judge declared that The Executive Office had unlawfully refused to advance their pension scheme.Justice McAlinden delivered a scathing ruling that surely made Sinn Fein squirm.Every legal argument advanced on behalf of Deputy First Minister Michelle O#Neill was demolished.Arrant nonsense, a truly shocking proposition, wilful disregard for the rule of law, or abject ignorance of whatmeans in a democratic society were just some of the terms used.How on earth did the party get it legally, politically and morally so wrong  Why fight a battle that you#re destined to lose in both a court of law and the court of public opinion  There was never going to be any other outcome.O#Neill has now agreed to nominate a department and progress the scheme. This embarrassing climbdown forced by the courts could have been avoided.Why did the Deputy First Minister not just do what she was legally obliged to do months ago  She could have saved victims so much additional trauma.You#d expect Sinn Fein to at least be PR savvy. The very powerful images of men and women in wheelchairs, or with white sticks, going into court at the start of the case, should have caused a serious rethink in the party.It argues that the pension scheme discriminates against former republican prisoners. It could have pursued that issue while allowing those who have suffered the most to apply for and receive the pension they#re entitled to.The Shinners were completely isolated on this one at Stormont and beyond. A section of their own base was certainly put out by the scheme#s criteria, but it was by no means a matter which incensed or roused the entire republican community. This wasn#t a nationalist versus unionist issue. The victims behind this legal action were from all sections of the community.There were plenty of people who support justice for the Bloody Sunday families, who believe the state committed many great wrongs over the years, who still wanted the pension paid.As well as Jenner McNern#s legal challenge, a case was also brought by Brian Turley, one of the #Hooded Men# subjected to inhuman and degrading treatment by the British Army in .As a survivor of torture, I was left with long-term injuries as a result of the actions of the state, he said yesterday.The delay in having to wait on my right to a pension can only be described as another form of torture. Turley said O#Neill had no right to stop the pension scheme and described her action as very unprofessional.Words like that wound Sinn Fein. When the party finds itself on the opposite side to a victim of state violence like him it should know that it#s on shaky ground. Negotiations will continue between Stormont and Downing Street over who foots the pensions# bill. Naomi Long#s Justice Department will now be designated to progress the scheme. Victims hope that it will be open for applications before Christmas. I feel elated, said Margaret Yeaman who was blinded in an IRA no-warning bomb in Banbridge in  and who has never seen the faces of her grandchildren.The ruling has brought immense relief, said Mark Kelly, who lost his legs in a  no-warning UVF bomb.It#s like a weight lted off my shoulders, said Philip Gault, left with le-changing injuries as a schoolboy when he was injured in on Bloody Friday in .I should never have had to take this case, said Jenner McNern, who lost her legs in the IRA#s Abercorn bomb that year.As they celebrated their win, the surviving victims remembered those who didn#t live to see it, like Paddy Cassidy and Raymond Trimble who died so recently.It was simultaneously a victory to savour, and to shame so many in society for not delivering for these courageous men and women years ago.

There was no response from Mr Hogan#s representatives last night.Dail to recall earlyThe three Coalition leaders, including the Greens# Eamon Ryan, have also bowed to Opposition pressure and agreed to an early recall of the Dail, which is now expected to sit again at the beginning of September, two weeks earlier than originally planned.The leaders of Fianna Fail and Fine Gael spoke separately with Mr Hogan by phone early yesterday afternoon to convey their feelings about the commissioner#s attendance at the dinner and his response to the controversy. Both men are deeply unhappy with Mr Hogan. Mr Varadkar separately told this newspaper that the commissioner#s apology should have happened sooner. Mr Hogan apologised for attending the dinner on Friday night only after Mr Martin called on him to do so. He had initially refused to express remorse, saying he had been assured that the event complied with public health guidelines.Read More EU commissioner Phil Hogan urged to resign amid golf dinner controversyAs the fallout from last Wednesday#s golf affair reverberates throughout the country, the spotlight will now turn to Supreme Court Judge Seamus Woulfe. Chief Justice Frank Clarke is to speak to Mr Justice Woulfe about his attendance at the controversial dinner.In an article in the Sunday Independent today, Labour leader Alan Kelly calls on Mr Justice Woulfe to reflect on his position.It comes as the Government tried to draw a line under the affair and restore public confidence in measures announced last week to lt Covid- restrictions.Read More Oireachtas Golf Society president apologisesBut with a Garda investigation under way and with the Dail to be recalled ahead of schedule, the Government will struggle to end the controversy. Ministers are currently focused on the reopening of schools and the issuing of Leaving Certicate results.Garda InvestigationA detective superintendent is leading an inquiry into the apparent breach of Covid- restrictions at the gala dinner attended by more than  current and former politicians, judges and lobbyists in Clden#s Station House Hotel in Co Galway.Detectives have already contacted the hotel. They will speak to the event organisers and will access CCTV footage to corroborate accounts of the night in question.The Sunday Independent has also learned that in the first week of July, Mr Hogan travelled from Brussels to the Netherlands to take part in a tournament organised by the Irish Wild Geese Golf Society, which is based in the Belgian capital.There were no travel restrictions between Belgium and the Netherlands at the time, but both countries are deemed unsafe for travel by the Irish Government. The number of new cases per , people in both countries is almost double the rate in Ireland.Read More Last Supper at the top table in Clden: No going to the bar, no chatting with other tables... a damp squibOn July , around three weeks after travelling to the Netherlands for the golf outing, Mr Hogan flew to Ireland where he was required to restrict his movements for two weeks.

But the majority of ordinary people across the country didn#t have the luxury to make such choices for the last five months.MisgivingsThe Sunday Independent has also learned that senior members of the judiciary, including the Chief Justice, have misgivings about Mr Justice Woulfe#s attendance at the gala dinner. Chief Justice Frank Clarke is to speak to Mr Justice Woulfe upon hisfrom holiday in the coming weeks.Mr Woulfe, who was attorney general until the end of June, has apologised for attending the dinner, saying his understanding was that it was within the Government#s Covid- guidelines. He has declined to offer further comment despite attempts to contact him this weekend.A court insider said the lack of support emanating from the judiciary was due to the courts being in recess and reluctance to get involved in public controversies. They do accept his apology is genuine and remorseful, the well-placed source said. But there are misgivings about how he ended up in this situation and the wisdom of it.There are also concerns at senior levels in Government. Having a Supreme Court judge in that room, it doesn#t sit well with me, said one Cabinet minister. Another Cabinet source said the Government will be unable to move on from the controversy until they#re all gone.The Garda investigation is focusing on whether the numbers in attendance at the event exceeded the numbers allowed in regulations. If necessary, detectives may corroborate their accounts with CCTV footage from the premises to confirm the numbers in attendance and that public health measures were in place.Read More Taoiseach: Golfing dinner a ‘monumental’ error of judgmentAccording to one informed source, the guests would only be interviewed about the eventgardai thought it necessary. A file will be sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions when it is completed.The invitations to the event were issued by former Fianna Fail senator Donie Cassidy as president of the Oireachtas Golf Society Committee and by Noel Grealish, the Independent TD, as its captain. In a statement of apology last Friday, Mr Cassidy said he had been legally advised not to make any further comment at this time. He confirmed he will co-operate fully with the Garda investigation.The source said reports that  people attended the event have not been disputed, and the figure is way above the numbers allowed under regulations. The issue, the source said, will be whether the partition wall that ided the room into two separate groups of fewer than  was enough to satisfy the regulations. That will probably be the key issue, he said.Mr Cassidy and Mr Grealish were seen meeting management of the Clden hotel by a party staying in the hotel in early July. One member of the party said the group recognised the politicians who appeared to be having a meeting with management.Former Fine Gael minister and MEP Brian Hayes, now a high-profile banking lobbyist, has apologised unreservedly for attending the dinner.Read More Apologies and anger during fall out from Irish golf society dinnerI am really sorry that I attended and despite the best efforts of people at socially distancing, it should not have happened, the chief executive of the Banking and Payments Federation of Ireland said. Former Independent TD Dr Michael Harty also issued an apology last night for his attendance.Elsewhere, Mr Varadkar has asked one of the Fine Gael attendees at the controversial dinner, Senator Paddy Burke, to step down from the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission where he earns a €, salary top-up.Independent.ieRelated Content.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_afdca-ce-ed-bfe-fabb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_afdca-ce-ed-bfe-fabb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_afdca-ce-ed-bfe-fabb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_afdca-ce-ed-bfe-fabb_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland a .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_afdca-ce-ed-bfe-fabb_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  .\"Republic of IrelandApologies and anger during fall out from Irish golf society dinnerHere is what some key players in Irish public le have said about the parliamentary golf society dinner.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebaa-e-b-bcb-cde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebaa-e-b-bcb-cde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebaa-e-b-bcb-cde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebaa-e-b-bcb-cde_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland ee .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_ebaa-e-b-bcb-cde_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of Ireland‘Justiable and understandable anger’ as two resign over Covid breachThere is “very justiable and understandable anger” across Ireland over a controversial golfing event which led to the resignation of two high profile public representatives.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-f-dc-afbc-cd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-f-dc-afbc-cd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-f-dc-afbc-cd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-f-dc-afbc-cd_ w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland bb .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_c-f-dc-afbc-cd_ w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of IrelandOireachtas Golf Society president apologisesThe president of the Oireachtas Golf Society has apologised unreservedly for the hurt caused by an event during the week.\"data-srcset\"https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fa--a-da-ddaeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fa--a-da-ddaeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fa--a-da-ddaeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fa--a-da-ddaeb_embedded w,https:www.belfasttelegraph news republic-of-ireland f .ece AUTOCROP wh bpanews_fa--a-da-ddaeb_embedded w\" data-sizes\"auto\"  \"Republic of Ireland PremiumLast Supper at the top table in Clden: No going to the bar, no chatting with other tables... a damp squibIrish politicians attending the Clden golf dinner complained about the iding partition - that they couldn#t see the speakers or properly hear what was being said, the Irish Independent has revealed.Most ReadCoronavirus Northern Ireland: No further deaths and  more Covid cases confirmed as eight PSNI officers at one station test positive NI woman Amy Connor found dead in Ibiza hotel roomMcDonald#s plans to open new outlet in BelfastMI#s New IRA sting cuts head off the snake Clubs rally round to wish Linfield#s boss Healy well after fall,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

As a result universities will have to offer additional places with Queens University Belfastsaying it may need up to , extra. That will necessitate the lting of the maximum student numberscap. However, at yesterdays Economy Committee meeting at Stormont, Derry MLAs Gary Middleton and Sinead McLaughlin raised concerns thatthe correct decisions arent made it could lead to further regional imbalance with more students enrolling in Belfast courses. googletag.cmd.push DUP MLA Gary Middleton said there are several hundred unfilled places at Magee. While, SDLP MLA Sinead McLaughlin said thatUlster University wants to see growth at Magee it has to be engineered through the relocation of courses and the university has to invest in the marketing of the campus. The Department for the Economycontrols the number of undergraduate places available at QUB and Ulster Universityfor students from NI and those from outside the UK. Both institutions are allowed to accept between ,-, new undergraduates from Northern Ireland every year The cap exists in Northern Ireland in order to keep tuition fee costs down but results in huge competition for places. googletag.cmd.push It also means that on some courses NI students are expected to get higher grades than their counterparts applying from Great Britain. Derry politicians have called for the MaSN cap to be lted to allow universities to accommodate more students. They’ve insisted that the Magee campus should be prioritised, citing long-promised expansion to , students. However, it is courses that will determine demand and in turn additional places. A UU spokesperson said that it envisages increased demand for Magee courses such as Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence and Personalised Medicine. She commented: “At Ulster University, students are our absolute priority and we will be as flexible as possible in order to accommodate the maximum number of students possible within our existing funding and the additional flexibility already provided by Department for the Economy. “We are actively preparing for the anticipated additional demand by building in additional places for some of our most popular courses including Computer Sciences, Articial Intelligence, Engineering, Law, Accounting, and Personalised Medicine. “To avail of these additional places, we urge students to contact us as soon as possible on    to discuss your options with an advisor.” The DfE pointed out that responsibility for MaSN allocation lies with Higher Education institutions. A spokesperson for the DfE said: “Until the local universities have received access to the full range of revised grades for all applicant students, they will not be able to confirm places for students or otherwise. “As such, until this process has been completed, there is no way of assessing the number of any additional HE places there may be, nor what the impact might be for each HE institution with regards to their respective MaSNs.” She added: “With regards to the MaSN cap, it is allocated on an institutional-level basis and relates to all full-time undergraduate NI and EU domiciled students it is for each institution to decide how to allocate its MaSN across both subject areas and campuses. “The Economy Minister has stated thatshe will be working with Executive colleagues to ensure that additional places and extra resources are put in place to support universities as soon as possible. “Enrolments for previous years are available athttps:www.economy-ni.gov.uk articles higher-education-enrolments”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

There were plenty of smiles, but despite the blistering sunshine, the atmosphere was slightly muted. In any normal year there would have been giddy excitement, pupils slapping congratulations into each others backs. But this is education in a pandemic. The Class of  have already missed out on so much. Their final year was abruptly cut short in March, with the footballers of St Patricks on the brink of a MacRory Cup Final. From March until June in your final year of school may be peak time for exam cramming, but its also a coming-of-age period for young students. googletag.cmd.push Relationships with staff gradually takes on a more collegial feel. There is almost a feeling of being in the trenches together as they prepare together for the exams. Amid our A-Levels, myself and a friend were, not particularly diligently, preparing for a History exam that was set to take place the following day. We had nipped into the shop on the way up from Coleraine town centre and bought a sticky toffee pudding on a whim. The product required heating. Mr Bob Murphy was the most likely to do the needful for us, but when he took a look at the pair of us outside the staff room, he was exasperated. googletag.cmd.push “Boys, this is Mrs McGoldricks exam..” he began. We explained that we were grand for the exam, but would he mind heating up our dessert for us  He came back with a smile and a shake of the head, but with a freshly warmed pudding in hand. Trivial, farcical moments like that are recalled much more easily than any time spent in the exam hall, but s pupils have been denied both academic and pastoral build-up to these milestone exams. They have been disenfranchised, denied ownership of what, in many cases, is a le-changing four months. You cant cram for an exam that isnt happening. Every teacher and school leader Ive spoken to over the last week has highlighted the March to June period as a key moment in exam preparation. Pupils look at how things are going, andthe picture doesnt look great, they know its time to up the ante. Its the sprint at the end of the marathon. Principal Mrs Brenda Mussen addresses the St Patricks College, Maghera, Class of . Weirs decision yesterday afternoon to revert back to teacher predictions on AS and A results is a welcome move, but one that should have come without a four-day delay. The algorithm that would have decided the immediate future of our young people was particularly harsh on comprehensive schools. To use just the previous two years as a benchmark was unfair, particularly given the huge range in results a mixed ability cohort can throw up in any given year. Given the nature of academic selection, the risk of having a below-par set of results in a grammar school is greatly reduced, meaning the system used is already subject to in-built injustice. Results are now back in the hands of teachers and schools, rather than at the mercy of a mathematical equation. Back in the hands of the people who know the pupils. The people best-placed to assess their abilities. The people who spent weeks meticulously preparing their centre-assessed grades. “It was a kick in the teeth when you see students who have been downgraded that should not have been ,” said St Patricks Principal, Mrs Brenda Mussen, last week. This years students had been been kicked in the teeth and handed the bill for the dental work. With all exam boards across the UK now awarding on the basis of teacher judgement, the bill has been belatedly waived. The pupils of County Derry, and the whole of the country, would have been at a competitive disadvantage through no fault of their own. Reverting to teacher predictions for A-Level results at least creates a more level playing field for this years university intake.The writing has been on the wall since last Thursday. It took until yesterday for the Minister to bother to read it.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The colony was one of several built under the terms of the  Irish LandAct to cater for ex-servicemen ing from the First World War. Fty-seven cottages were erected on a .-acre patch of land in the Shantallow area, which had been purchased from Sir John McFarland of Aberfoyle on the Strand Road. The land was bought for £,-- - £, in today’s money - and featured a mixture of semi-detached cottages, blocks of four cottages and one detached cottage. A memorial plaque erected by Derry City Council in . Nigel Henderson, a researcher with History Hub Ulster, has been documenting the locations of the , ex-servicemen’s cottages built in Northern Ireland. “The largest colony or collection of cottages in County Londonderry are the ones at Messines Park,” he told the County Derry Post. “I’ve been going through the records trying to get details of the styles of the houses, how many rooms they had, whether they had toilets and bathrooms and things like that. “Once a family was installed in them, they tended to stay there for le, but there were some issues with evictions due to non-payment of rent. “A lot of the guys coming back from the war weren’t able to keep up employment so they may not have been able to pay the rents. “The rents weren’t exorbitant for their time or the standard of the houses, but the ISSLT , were strict at taking people to court for non-payment of rent. “You had guys who were evicted in the early s and then another ex-serviceman might have moved in again. In Belfast, there were guys on the waiting list as far on as the s.” Early plans show the layout of the ex-servicemens three-bedroom cottages at Messines Park. Initial rent for the houses, designed by Roland Ingolby Smith, chief architect for the NI Ministry of Finance from  to , was nine shillings per week, around £ per week today. On the night the Luftwaffe bombed the city, all  fatalities occurred in a row of houses facing onto the Buncrana Road. Nigel Henderson said the attack on Messines Park was unlikely to have been in the Germans’ plan. Instead, it is thought the nearby docks were their intended target. “What I understand is that they were aiming for the docks. During the Second World War in Derry, there was a naval base there,” he said. “It was a base for the Royal Navy going out on patrols in the North Atlantic, but they overshot and Shantallow was not that far from where the docks would have been. Ten members from the Richmond and Murray families died in the attack, along with -year-old James Collins, his -year-old daughter Ellen and William Alexander McFarland. The youngest victim was -month-old Sheila Murray. Their loss was keenly felt within Messines Park, where a strong community spirit had grown since the houses were erected in June . A map showing the location of the cottages at Messines Park. Residents established a local British Legion branch and an accompanying hall was built just outside the development in . A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton. He was stationed at Finner Camp in County Donegal when he met and married Elizabeth Doherty in  at Glendermott Parish Church. Their daughter Ellen was born in  and was just  when she died. Both were buried in Glendermott Parish Church. William McFarland Born at Fountain Street in Derry City, William Alexander McFarland had been working as a fitter before he enlisted with the Royal Engineers in . He served with Fortress Company at Salonica for over three years and was living at Hawkin Street in the city before he was transferred to Class Z Army Reserve in . William married Elizabeth Reid in  at St Augustine’s Church of Ireland and worked after the war in the Employment Exchange. A member of the Messines Park branch of the British Legion, he was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Force when he died, aged , in the bombing raid. The Murray Family Six members of the Murray family, who lived at  Messines Park, lost their lives in the bombing. William , was born on Donegal Street and married Omagh woman Molly Gormanin  at St Columb’s Catholic Church. William had served with the Guards during World War One and was serving as a sergeant with the Local Defence Volunteers when he died. Four of their children Ita , Kathleen , Philomenaand Sheiladied during the attack. Sheila was the youngest victim. The Richmond Family The  German bomb claimed the lives of four members of the Richmond family. John Richmond was born in  in the Waterside and had been right at the thick of the war. Stationed in China with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers, he landed on Y Beach, Cape Helles, at the start of the Gallipoli land campaign.

A colony of ex-servicemen being settled in Derry has the potential to be controversial when looked at through a contemporary eye, but an atmosphere of co-operation prevailed in the aftermath of the First World War. “I don’t think there was any sectarian sentiment against the houses, because for the guys who had moved in, religious affiliation was not a factor,” explained Nigel. “What was taken into account was how big a family they had, whether they had employment, whether they were wounded or gassed in the war, or the standard of housing they had. “Some of those who died were Protestants and some were Roman Catholics and because it was on the edge of the city, they formed almost a small community of their own. “The attitude was that it didn’t matteryou were a Catholic or a Protestant, a unionist or a nationalist, the guys served together. Both communities had been up for participating. “When those guys came home, the religious affiliation of their ex-servicemen neighbours would not have been a major factor or a cause for concern. “They had served together through a nightmare and living close to other ex-servicemen provided an opportunity for them to talk about their shared experiences. “This was something the veterans seldom did inside their homes or with their families.” While not their intended target, the German bombers would no doubt have felt a sense of schadenfreude at how things panned out. Nigel Henderson is struck by the tragic irony of the ex-servicemen’s demise. “It’s the only part of Derry that was hit in the German air raids, but it just happened to be men who had fought in the First World War who were the principal victims,” he said. “That is the irony of it. They survived the Germans in the trenches of the First World War to then die during the Second World War from aerial bombing.” The victims James and Ellen Collins Father and daughter, James and Ellen Collins, lived at  Messines Park. Sixty-year old James was the oldest victim of the bombing and was originally from Eglinton.

Lissan conceded their first game to Drumsurn and last week surrendered from a position of strength against Doire Trasna. Shea McKernan had the ball in the net within minutes of the start, getting on the end of a slick passing movement to slot home. Rather than building it, eight first half wides was the story of Kieran OKanes young sides exploits. For all their shortcomings, they were well in contention and led by two points, with eight minutes to go. googletag.cmd.push Disaster struck when Stephen Conway, who made a fine first half save from Ciaran McGowan, shanked a kick-out to Eoghan Quigg who passed for Micheaacutel McNaught to strike a hammer blow to the net they never recovered from. At midfield for Lissan is the towering Conor Loane, an All-Ireland winning goalkeeper with Holy Trinity Cookstown, and MacRory Cup medallist Mattie Loughran, who kicked four points last week. The pair dovetailed well together and in Iarlaith Donaghy, they have one of the most exciting players in the county playing at number six. Defender Oran Donnelly wears , but sits back as a sweeper, with the nimble Joey Quinn playing up front with Tiarnach Donaghy. googletag.cmd.push Coming Lissans way this weekend is a Faughanvale side who have posted two wins from as many games and had a tough battle to overcome a Drumsurn side who arguably deserved a draw. Manager Joe Gray has had to come to terms with long-term injuries to Oisin Quinn and Jordan Curran. Michael McLaughlin spent last summer in America, but he is back and forms an inside forward duo with Kevin Martin. Paddy OKane is one of their key players and Lissan may face a kick-back after his quiet outing in the last round. He played off the front two, but their running game almost bypassed their middle sector. Gordon Fahey and Michael Sweeney are a formidable defensive spine, with skipper Conor McGuinness nestled between them as a sweeper - a formation that will mirror the Lissan setup,both managers adopt the same approach this time around. The Vale will also have questions to answer. When Drumsurn went down to  men, Grays side couldnt get their hands on the ball and had to rely on a strong finish. On the flip side, apart from the one they scored, the Vale carved out the best two goal chances over the course of the game. A tough ask for Lissan who cant finish above the bottom. Kieran OKane will have his side well-prepared, but Faughanvale will be fancied to come through. VERDICT: Faughanvale RELATEDJoe Grays reaction to the Vales win over Drumsurn.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

In family, business and community. Devastation and disbelief reached into every corner of County Derry last Friday afternoon, as the news of his sudden death filtered through. Everyone I spoke with over the weekend was just in shock. My thoughts are with his we Anne and the entire family, as they unite in grief. Rarely would you see Hugh without Anne. They went everywhere together. His family were never far behind. My sympathy also goes out to his daughter Maureen, son Carlus, son-in-law Benny, daughter-in-law Maria, his grandchildren Ollie, Leo, Fiadh and Lily Anna. Its not often you go to Owenbeg that you dont see them all there to take in a game, no matter who is playing. googletag.cmd.push Hugh Peter was well-known far from his own townland of Cloane. He was Managing Director of HA Mechanical Services, a company he started in  with his we Anne. Together, they grew the firm from six employees to over . When you think of a local community, the provision of local jobs is unquantiable. The parish of Ballinascreen and the surrounding areas have benefited greatly. In terms of an amateur sport, like GAA, one of the factors rarely mentioned is the importance of clubs not losing players forced to emigrate in search of work. This cant be done without stable employers, without people like Hugh McWilliams. googletag.cmd.push Then there is the sponsorship element. Hugh and Anne have been the Derry GAAs main sponsor since taking over at the end of the  season. They also sponsor the camogie and ladies football teams, while also backing the senior football and hurling leagues. Derrys statement last week was very apt, labelling Hugh as a giant of generosity and all at a time when the HA logo wasnt splashed across the national media like the big hitters of Dublin, Kerry and Kilkenny. Closer to home, HA are also in their fth year as Ballinascreens main sponsor, also across all four codes. Other examples of Hughs generosity went unnoticed, away from having a company brand associated with it. All the local schools benefited from his support, local mental health charity STEPS and St Vincent de Paul. The list could go on. Two years ago, to celebrate  years of HA, he held a family fun day at the local An Raacuteth Dubh Community Centre. From the moment you walked through the gate, everything was on Hughs tab...from the bouncy castles to the refreshments. They also organised a charity golf day and coffee morning, with all three events raising pound,. He bumped the total up himself, so both charities – Cancer Fund for Children and South Derry Downs Syndrome - were presented with cheques for poundk. For such a successful business man, he never forgot where he came from. He wasnt shy about putting something back. And all with modesty, far from any fanfare. One of the most enjoyable years of my le was the summer of , training the Derry minor team. A swing of Damien Reddingtons left boot may have snatched the All-Ireland minor title from our grasp, but I feel much richer for being involved with that group. We had some craic along the way - sailing up and down the M in the big yellow bus, with the tunes belting and the summer opening up in front of us. There was also a special bond with the supporters and parents. It was the first time I met Hugh Peter. He left Carlus to the bus one Saturday morning when we were Ballyshannon bound to play Roscommon in a challenge game. The Rossies had won the All-Ireland the previous year and Hugh was asking how long I thought the Derry minors summer would last. We hadnt a clue. It was one eventful step at a time. Fast forward to September and as I got off the bus and trudged through the lobby of Dublins Crown Plaza after the All-Ireland final heartbreak, Hugh came forward to shake my hand. Defeat was gurgling in the pit of both our stomachs. I cant remember exactly what he said, but, he was thanking us, while relaying how much his son had enjoyed the journey. Years later when John Francis Bradley, who also played on the same minor team, was seriously injured in a car crash and fighting for his le. Ballinascreen club, with Hugh McWilliams at the forefront, arranged a Night for JF. Screen club was packed. You couldnt have turned a sweet in your mouth. In hospital that night, John Francis spoke for the first time since his accident. The next morning Hugh delivered the many items from the auction to the Bradley family and gave him a pathway back into work. The club later handed over the money donated on the night. Another example of giving. You could write a book. A few months after that All-Ireland minor final, Hugh arranged for a gathering of the squad at the Hogan Stand Bar in Moneyneena. There was music, a buffet, craic and Hugh was in his element. It was like closure on the season. I always enjoy calling into the Hogan Stand and the owner, Tempo man Charlie McNally, claims his porter is the best around. If Hugh was there, he would always send a pint down my direction, like he did for many others. He would never accept one back, but would merely invite you into a football debate with him and Pele, his close friend John Scullion. Hugh would love it. The topic was usually - Screen, Slaughtneil, the Derry championship, the county scene and back to Screen again. Often there would be agreement, sometimes there wasnt and the slagging would begin before theydto chatting with their wives Anne and Mary G. The four of them were so close. Tuesday was no doubt tough day for everyone in the McWilliams family circle, in Ballinascreen and beyond as they said their final goodbye. Hugh often coined the phrase its not about being here for a long time, its about being here for a good time. He always had time for a smile, time for a chat and enjoyed le to the full. He will be sadly missed by his family and friends. I count myself lucky to have known him.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

I am very proud that our incoming head boy, Cormac Savage, was at the forefront of this campaign and believe his contribution was pivotal in ensuring that the sense of injustice and unfairness felt by his peers was articulated in a forceful and timely manner.Mr McCann also welcomed confirmation that GCSE grades will be awarded as calculated by schools.ldquoTeachers were asked to exercise professional judgment and engaged in a robust process to ensure that pupil effort and attainment in the period from September  to the unexpected and unprecedented closing of schools in March was rewarded, he said. ldquoA great deal of time and energy was devoted to this task by the staff of St. Patrickrsquos Grammar to ensure that grades were awarded fairly and consistently.Down High principal Maud Perry, said after the initial publication of results last Thursday the school was celebrating its best ever A-Level achievements.ldquoThis was unsurprising, as this particular year group achieved the schoolrsquos best ever AS results last year, she said.ldquoThis was a very dferent year in so many ways, but Down High pupils continue to be among the best qualied of their generation and, beyond the curriculum, our pupils are enriched, socially confident and ready to take their place as leaders of the future in whatever fields they choose. Congratulations to all of the pupils on these fully deserved grades.Shimna Integrated College principal Kevin Lambe congratulated the schoolrsquos ldquowonderful A level students who weathered the storm of this unprecedented year.He said he was delighted that the vast majority of students had already been placed at their first choice of university before the restoration of the teacher assessed grades on Monday afternoon.Mr Lambe said that while there had been considerable controversy about the process of awarding grades this year, he paid tribute to the excellent guidance document CCEA provided and to the commitment and energy his staff brought to the grading process.ldquoI am quite sure that the moderation process was undertaken in good faith, but it caused dreadful damage and heartache across the country, he said. ldquoThe CCEA guidance was sound, the work of teachers was thoroughgoing, the teacher awarded grades were the right ones and I am absolutely delighted that they have been restored.Ballynahinchrsquos Assumption Grammar School said it was delighted with the government U-turn in awarding grades as the original process ldquocaused signicant emotional upheaval which affected students, parents and our staff.ldquoWe are fortunate in that over % of our A students had already accessed their chosen university or workplace and hope that now almost every girl has achieved their true potential and will be able to access a iety of career pathways. Assumption Girls set the highest of standards year on year and we are proud of our Year  Girls who excelled in every subject at every level, said a school statement.ldquoOur AS students now have a solid foundation of grades which will give them the confidence to believe in their own potential to achieve at the highest of levels as they enter A level.

It was also wetter and cooler than average.August has been poor, particularly the last week. I associate late August with the onset of autumn.While the Mediterranean gets hot weather into October and southern England is warm until late September, Northern Ireland summers end early.My late uncle rented a house on the north coast in the last week of each August.

There were growing reports of teenage parties after this time, because there is only so long that people will accept massive restrictionsThe chief medical officer for Northern Ireland, Dr Michael Maguire, said he would recommend such sweeping restrictionsCovid- infections hit  people per , .Robin Swann, the health minister, also gave warning that ato lockdown could not be ruled out,cases keep rising.Dr McBride, as a health official who lacks an elected mandate, was careful to say that it was not ultimately his call. He said that any recommendations would “need to go to the executive at the appropriate time for them to make a decision”. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...That is the traditional protocol. Now, however, western world politicians often defer big decisions to committees or experts, rather than make hard choices themselves.Even the supposedly radical Tory government in London, whichwants to shake up how the UK is governed, has hidden its pandemic decision making behind scientists.The A Level-GCSE fiasco is rooted in the cowardice that led to UK schools being shut earlier than the government wanted, and staying closed for longer.Even now teaching unions and other voices are trying to stop a fullto school next month, when in fact there should have been a push to get pupils back in the weeks after Easter– or at least exam years.There are four broad reasons why ato anything like the general lockdown we experienced after March  is not plausible.• The first is that the nation can’t afford to sustain the furlough schemeIt has already pushed debt to perilous levels. If furlough was extended into next year, there would need to be massive tax increases and spending cuts, including public sector pay cuts .NI politicians have no stomach for such toughness. Even in a financial crisis, Stormont seems only ever inclined to grant pay rises, including a huge recent teacher rise. Councils abused furlough by topping up Treasury funding of % of salaries with ratepayer cash to ensure no staff had any pay reduction.• The second reason lockdown is not feasible is the public mood. The UK government has been fairly criticised for the many things it did wrong over Covid, but few people cite thingsit got right. Its behavioural experts saidlockdown came in too early people would get fed up after a while, and begin to break it. That began to happen after two months. In June there were growing reports of young people socialising in groups .As well as fatigue with restrictions, people began to develop an instinctive sense of the risk of Covid, similar to how we assess car travel .• The third reason lockdown is not feasible is that infection levels do not justy such a massive response.Even the level cited by Dr McBride –  per , cases – is low according to some experts. Prof Carl Heneghan of Oxford’s Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine said epidemic level is five times higher .He said people were failing to understand, and balance, risks.Mr Swann and Dr McBride have accepted such balance over schooling .But such balancing equations should be applied more widely .Few politicians are candid that the Covid risk cannot be cut to zero.Sweden’s former state epidemiologist Prof Johan Giesecke said from the outset that it was not possible to halt Covid’s spread. Recent upsurges in case even in nations that were seen as models of control, such as Germany and South Korea, have vindicated that prediction. • The fourth reason another lockdown is not feasible is specic to NI: Bobby Storey’s funeral shattered Stormont’s authority. There was a cross-party determination to protect Sinn Fein . This meant the first and deputy first ministers cannot preside over press briefings that might reveal suspension of liberty.Instead, the political parties erted attention from the calculating nature of SF leaders’ social distancing breach on June  in westBelfast by backing probes into important but secondary matters such as PSNI and Belfast council handling of the funeral. But in the absence of sanction against hypocritical leaders who set the rules, the damage is irreparable. A population that for months largely obeyed lockdown, including missing funerals of loved ones, watched as republicans were allowed to do as they pleased.• Ben Lowryis News Letter deputy editor• Ben Lowry: Autumn in Northern Ireland always seems to arrive in late August——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

And this year, particularly this month, it seems, those mayflies are ‘torturing‘ the locals because August is the month of the mayfly andit’s a good, warm month they breed in their zillions.I remember having to close up bedroom windows at night andI went to visit my elderly Aunt Lizzie, who lived right on the shore at Ballyronan, she kept a permanently rolled up newspaper which she took everywhere with her.  \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Her laneway was fairly long and when I visited I always dreaded having to cycle though this buzzing throng with mouth closed and breath held until I could reach her front door.The mayflies first arrive in May but this balmy warm August, has been particularly perfect weather for the second generation of little blighters on all shores of the lough. Barbeques  Out of the question. Strolling around the shore on a calm evening  Forget it. The mayflies cover the walls of houses and the windows, for all the world resembling a black plague. My mother would spend her mornings shovelling them away from the doors and windows yes, even those that got inside. When the well-known McGarry Brothers were building boats on the shore not far from BallyronanI recall seeing the dead flies stacked high in their boatyard, the perfect dung heap for locals keen for valuable free compost for their gardens.Tennis, GAA matches, even paddling on the shore was out of the question when the flies took over.The sadness of it all is that most parts of the shores of Lough Neagh are scenically beautul and understandably people want to build homes there. Those who haven’t done their homework and have built a home overlooking the water will get a shock when the first tranche of mayflies arrive.These creatures spread themselves over everything including the highest trees. Fly killing sprays are useless. They come, set up home and don’t die off or go away until it suits them. And, it was that that persuaded me that no matter how much I loved the place I could never live there. I wasn’t even keen to visit the family home until the flies had gone.I try to avoid driving in the area when the mayflies are active as they splatter the windscreen ruining your vision and needing to be scraped off because they harden like glue. Step ouside the car and you’re covered in them.In sense they are not unlike the coronavirus – a first tranche arrives taking lives and scaring us witless. We try to get it under control only for a second lot to move in or at least we have been told to expect one. Even our scientists are fairly certain the virus willwith the cold weather. Our Health Minister Robin Swann has us well warned. So the police needed go looking for beach parties or illegal raves around the shores of Lough Neagh. The mayfly, though harmless, is a thorough pest which comes and goes as it pleases.\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-drMfKT fpqScQ\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-bGbJRg eOOfIS\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-gxMtzJ sc-dfVpRl dLpuYr\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusGetting outFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

For those who believe they are immune they need to know better. This virus can and has taken lives”Minister Swann said recently his department recently has been dealing “with a signicant outbreak in a meat processing plant”.He said  cases were detected in staff and further cases of contact. He said all staff were being tested and many were self-isolating.Dr McBride added that “theof schools could see pressure on the R number”.“If your child has symptoms then keep them at home,” he added. “Get them tested.

In response, we have already put additional measures in place.Last week, we moved to the next phase of our agreed, comprehensive Hygiene Commitment plan which includes increased random testing of team members, who continue to operate within team bubbles.In addition, we are also the first company in Northern Ireland to introduce a Mistpal Cleansing Tunnel for team members and guests entering the Resort for further safety reassurance. This is in addition to already established measures including a nightly, full deep-clean of all areas with hospital-grade sanitiser protectant and decontamination equipment, thermal temperature monitoring, provision of hand sanitisers in all areas and adherence to recommended social distancing guidelines.The health and safety of our team and guests remains paramount and we are grateful for their continued support and also to those guests who have rescheduled their stay as a result of the robust pre-entry testing measures we have in place.”Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has already carried out tests with almost  team members and will continue to conduct random testing and adopt the same stringent protocols already in place in the event that any further positive cases are identied.Since reopening Galgorm Spa  Golf Resort has been focused on safety as a priority and was among the first hotels in the UK to receive the AA COVID Confident Mark for its industry leading health and safety standards.
