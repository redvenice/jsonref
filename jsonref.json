You truly do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on blackface at Halloween or a black person who puts on white face,\u0027 stated Kelly during a roundtable discussion on Halloween costumes last Tuesday.\u0027That was okay when I was a kid, as long as you were dressing like a character.\u0027She then pointed to de Lesseps darkening her features while dressing as Diana Ross.\u0027I don\u0027t see how that is racist on Halloween,\u0027 said Kelly.  \u0027We didn\u0027t want her to leave Fox News\u0027: Lachlan Murdoch says...\u0027Just don\u0027t color your face\u0027: Al Roker takes a dig at Megyn...Heather Locklear facing new legal woes as EMT she \u0027attacked\u0027...EXCLUSIVE - ‘It’s all out war’: Megyn Kelly is looking to...Share this articleIn response to Kelly defending de Lesseps, her panel guest Jacob Soboroff said: \u0027I haven\u0027t seen it, but it sounds pretty racist to me.\u0027Jenna Bush hager then chimed in, adding: \u0027Me too.\u0027Kelly then said: \u0027I can\u0027t keep up with the number of people we\u0027re offending just by being normal people these days.\u0027De Lesseps has not appeared to suffer any fallout from Kelly\u0027s comments, but Roker and Melvin were both very vocal about the impact her words had on them and why they were so hurtful. \u0027The fact is, while she apologized to the staff, she owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country because this is our history, going back to the 1830s,\u0027 said Roker.\u0027Minstrel shows meant to denigrate a race, you know I am old enough to have lived through Amos \u0026amp Andy where you had white people in blackface playing the black characters just magnifying the worst stereotypes about black people.\u0027Then, in a pointed barb at Kelly\u0027s nonchalant comment about why people were so offended by the practice, he stated: \u0027And that\u0027s what the big problem is.\u0027Craig Melvin went a step further, adding: \u0027There was some criticism online that this was political correctness run amok, and that\u0027s silly and its disingenuous and its just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself.\u0027He then went on to say that while Kelly was a friend, her comment was \u0027indefensible.\u0027          Farewell: \u0027NBC staff is shocked that she would reach out to Luann, but say nothing to any of the people she actually offended with her comment,\u0027 explains the source (Kelly above last Wednesday on her final episode oif Today)          Girl code: De Lesseps (above in August on Kelly\u0027s show) has suffered no real fallout from Kelly\u0027s comments but both Al Roker and Craig Melvin were vocal in expressing why her comments were hurtfulDailyMail.com spoke to a number of NBC employees last week whose feelings on the subject ran the gamut from \u0027deeply hurt\u0027 to outright \u0027appalled\u0027 at Kelly\u0027s behavior and reports that she might claim her coverage of the #MeToo movement played a role in her termination. \u0027How dare she? Who the hell does she think she is?\u0027 said one NBC employee\u0027Her blackface comments were bad but falsely playing the #MeToo card is the worst form of white privilege I have ever seen.\u0027And another employee remarked: \u0027She had no respect for the African American staff on her team and her apology was both fake and dismissive.\u0027An insider at the network told DailyMail.com that after a meeting with Kelly and her staff on Wednesday, a number of employees of color on the show voiced their frustration and anger with the host to human resources.\u0027Lots of people were willing to give her a clean slate after the whole white Santa thing, but she showed her true colors this week,\u0027 said the insider.That insider also noted that what Kelly was doing was not only an affront to her black colleagues, but also the men and women of the #MeToo movement. \u0027If she truly had remorse and felt like she was wrong she should take no money and go into hiding. But she’s greedy and entitled,\u0027 noted the first NBC employee who spoke to DailyMail.com.\u0027What the hell does she have to fight for? She’s been fired for being racist on national television. She’s not coming back and she needs to accept that.\u0027On Thursday, the National Association of Black Journalists responded to Kelly\u0027s comments in a statement.\u0027Megyn Kelly\u0027s flip comments on blackface were inexcusable.

Pictured is a map of Britain with a selection of the sites           Among the sites was Gruinard Island, off the west coast of Scotland, where biological warfare testing was carried out. Scientists studied the effects of anthrax by putting the bacteria in bombs and detonating them near a herd of sheep on the island, which slowly killed them. The island was subsequently put off limits to humans until the late 20th Century, when it was decontaminated          An underground bunker called The Paddock, pictured, was built 40ft under a post office in Dollis Hill, north London, and intended to be a back-up should the War Rooms beneath Whitehall be damaged in a Luftwaffe bombing raid. The bunker was bombproof and big enough to house the War Cabinet and 200 staff, but Churchill only ever held one meeting there and is said to have disliked it because it was \u0027damp\u0027 and too far from the city. The land above has since been used for social housing but the bunker still exists and generators and boilers remain inside          Madresfield Court in Worcestershire, pictured, was picked out as a safe house for the Royal Family should they need to be evacuated. If the Battle of Britain had been lost and the Germans had successfully invaded, King George VI and his family would have been moved to the country house because it is secluded in woodland and was far enough away from the sea to mount a strong defence. It was part of a wider plan to move the government to Worcestershire, with other stately homes picked to host Churchill and government officials. A house has been on this spot since the 1400s and has been owned by the Lygon family. It is currently home to Rosalind, Lady MorrisonThey include Gruinard Island, off the west coast of Scotland, where biological warfare tests were carried out by scientists who infected sheep with anthrax.It left the island dangerous to mammals for decades, until it was finally decontaminated in the late 20th Century. Another site was The Paddock in Dollis Hill, north London, an alternative bunker for Prime Minister Winston Churchill, designed to be completely bombproof in case the Whitehall War Rooms were damaged by Luftwaffe bombing raids.REVEALED: Truth behind Netflix drama of Adolf Eichmann\u0027s...\u0027You could feel the machine gun bullets flying past you\u0027:...Faces of brave soldiers who died in the First World War,...Share this articleThe £250,000 shelter, constructed 40ft beneath the post office building in Brook Road, was meant to be a last resort for the prime minister should the Battle of Britain have been lost, and was large enough to house the war cabinet and up to 200 staff.  The cabinet met there twice, in October 1940 and March 1941, but the bunker, which could only be accessed by a concealed door in the post office, was abandoned before the end of the war.Since then, it has been left almost untouched and today all that is left inside it are generators, boilers and the remains of the telephone circuitry which connected it to the rest of Britain\u0027s war-time command infrastructure.          At the outbreak of the war the government became concerned over potential damage to valuable works of art and national treasures from bombing raids or an invasion. After searching for a secret location to store them, officials picked out Manod Quarry in North Wales, pictured, because it was isolated and deep enough to be bomb proof. Underground chambers were then renovated to make them hospitable for the artwork, with air conditioning installed to control the environment and stop them becoming affected by damp          Road and rail access to Manod, pictured, was improved to allow trucks to bring lorry loads of paintings to the quarry. Specially-designed wagons were also built to allow the artworks to be safely transported through the caverns without being damaged. Although the masterpieces were removed when peace returned, the Department of the Environment was unwilling to vacate the site and only left in the 1980s. Speculation mounted over what had been kept there, but when it was reopened all that was found was shelving and old packaging           Clapham South Tube Station was converted into one of eight deep-level shelters built around London to protect the public during Luftwaffe raids. Visitors had to walk down 180 steps to reach the shelter. Other locations included Chancery Lane station on the Central line and Belsize Park, Camden Town, Goodge Street, Stockwell, Clapham North and Clapham Common on the Northern Line. In 1948, the deep shelter at Clapham was used as temporary accommodation for immigrants from the West IndiesMeanwhile Madresfield Court, a country house in Worcestershire, was picked out as a potential safehouse for the Royal Family in the event of a successful German invasion.Should the Germany Army have made it to London, the Royals, including then Princess Elizabeth, would have fled to the mansion, which is secluded among woodland.It was part of a wider plan to move the government to Worcestershire if London became \u0027untenable\u0027 during the war, with more stately homes picked to house Churchill and other government officials. Another  forgotten site is the abandoned Rhydymwyn Valley Works in north Wales where Britain\u0027s World War Two chemical weapons were stored but never used.The site is now a nature reserve but the entrance to the tunnels is still visible with the warning sign \u0027entry to tunnels is dangerous\u0027.Many country houses were requisitioned by the Government to house royalty, politicians and, in some cases, high profile German POWs.            Although it may look like an attractive country manor, Mytchett Place in Surrey, pictured, actually served as a makeshift prison for Hitler\u0027s deputy Rudolf Hess a month after he was captured in Scotland after parachuting into Britain in an attempted peace mission. After initially being detained in the Tower of London, Hess was moved to Mytchett Place in June 1941 and spent 13 months there, even attempting suicide shortly after arriving by throwing himself off a balcony          Hess, pictured centre at the Nuremberg Trials with Hermann Goering, left, and Joachim von Ribbentrop, right, was eventually moved to a hospital in Wales in 1942, where he spent the remainder of the war. After Germany surrendered, Hess, who had been stripped of all titles by Hitler after his unauthorised peace mission, was found guilty of \u0027crimes against peace\u0027 but not war crimes, and was handed a life sentence at Spandau Prison in Berlin          Another quarry to be requisitioned by the British government was Rhydymwyn in Flintshire, Wales, pictured. Neville Chamberlain\u0027s government identified the site as a good location to store chemical weapons should they ever need to be used against Nazi Germany over fears Hitler might attack with mustard gas. Tunnels were then fortified within the quarry in 1939 and by 1943 there were more than 2,000 workers on site          The quarry, pictured from the outside, was later identified as a potential place to store Bank of England gold should Britain be attacked by nuclear weapons. The mustard gas remained stored on site until the late 1950s until it was safely disposed of. The tunnels have been out of use since the early 1990s but were briefly opened to the public for guided tours earlier this yearRudolf Hess, the Deputy Fuhrer of Nazi Germany, was held captive at Mytchett Place, in Mytchett, Surrey, which is now the home of a research company.Hess was transported from the Tower of London to Mytchett Place, known as \u0027Camp Z\u0027, on May 20, 1941.He spent 13 months there and once attempted to commit suicide by throwing himself off a balcony on June 15, 1941.Target maps for the famous Dambusters raid were produced at Hughenden Manor, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and a country house near Lochaber in northern Scotland was taken over for Special Operations Executive training.Quarries in north Wales were used by the National Gallery to hide priceless treasures which were under threat during the Blitz, and tunnels across the country were converted into air raid shelters.In addition, farmers\u0027 fields became dummy and decoy airfields and cities.During the Second World War, thousands of sites across Britain were requisitioned to support the war effort.Command and control centres were generally the best protected and many were indeed bunkers buried beneath ground.          Although its occupants were not as high-profile as some other stately homes, Hughenden Manor in High Wycombe still played a vital role in the war effort. The country house, which once belonged to prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, was used as a intelligence base and codenamed Hillside. RAF and Air Ministry staff produced detailed maps and photos of Germany for raids, including drawing up the plans for the famous Dambusters mission. The house is now owned by the National Trust and is open to the public          Between 1939 and 1946 a secret factory operated at Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome, pictured, which is now Leeds Bradford Airport. It was the largest single factory in Europe and run by aircraft firm Avro and because of the danger from bombing, it was camouflaged as farmland, with grass covering the roof and fake farm buildings erected around the factory, with even a duck pond built. At the height of its operation, more than 17,500 people worked on site 24-hours a day, and it produced almost 700 Lancaster bombers as well as thousands more of other types of aircraft           Arisaig House in the Scottish Highlands, pictured, became the base for the Special Operations Executive during the war, which was Britain\u0027s secret service during the conflict, running sabotage and spying missions behind enemy lines. Arisaig was used for paramilitary training missions in rough terrain  to prepare agents for similar conditions in mainland Europe. Foreign nationals were also trained at the site, and a memorial was unveiled there to Czech and Slovak soldiers in 2009          Ditchley House, pictured, in Oxfordshire, was picked as the alternative residence for Churchill over concerns his homes at Chartwell and Chequers were \u0027too visible\u0027 to German aircraft. Ditchley was considered ideal because of heavy foliage around the building and an obscured access road. Churchill frequently visited the property and even negotiated deals with the US there. He returned to Chequers in 1943 after security improvements were made.

They said to me We have been having a bit of a laugh and a giggle.\u0027When Mr Harris examined it, he said he was shocked to find wavy brickwork that wasn\u0027t straight and looked unsafe.The civil engineer said: \u0027I know all about brickwork. I\u0027m a builder myself, and have run my own company for 36 years,\u0027 he said.He added the walls were \u0027just the start\u0027 and later found he could not open the door with his keys due to a poorly fitted frame.Mr Harris said: \u0027We couldn\u0027t get in.

The deepest level of the quarry hotel is nearly 700 metres (2,297 feet) lower than the top floor of the world\u0027s highest-hotel-to-be, the J Hotel, under construction in Shanghai Tower (right)Because there is a pond at the bottom of the quarry, the air outside the bottom of the hotel is cooled by the water. Therefore, architects have made it possible for the cooler air to be drawn into the building at the deeper floors. As the air is warmed up by people and equipment inside the building, it will get warmer and then rise through the building to vent out at the top floor above the ground, creating a natural air circulation.On the other hand, some of the rock face is exposed in the interior of the building, providing an ideal thermal mass to help regulate the building\u0027s temperature.The InterContinental Hotels Group is yet to release any pictures of InterContinental Shanghai Wonderland.However, guests can now book for stays at the hotel from November 15 and onwards on Chinese travel site Alitrip.

The second episode, next Tuesday, will look at the Battle of the Somme (pictured) in 1916 through its last survivors and families and communities at home who lost loved onesBut the documentary also looks at how those on the home front still had to work long hours in munitions factories and \u0027keep the home fires burning\u0027.The second episode, next Tuesday, will look at the Battle of the Somme in 1916 through its last survivors and families and communities at home who lost loved ones.The third and final episode, due to be shown next Wednesday, tells the stories of battles in 1917 and 1918, including Passchendaele and the Spring Offensive.Florence Green, who joined the war effort in September 1918, was the world\u0027s last surviving First World War veteran when she died in Norfolk in 2012 aged 110.She was the last surviving person to have seen active service in the war following the death of British-born sailor Claude Choules in Australia in 2011 aged 111.Britain\u0027s last survivor of the First World War trenches, Harry Patch - known in his later years as \u0027The Last Fighting Tommy\u0027 - died in 2009 aged 111.

For this year only, seven million special poppies with \u00271918-2018\u0027 in gold leaf will be among them.Earlier this week, it was revealed that the Treasury would make a £10million donation to mark the centenary by supporting veterans with mental health needs.   Florence Green (left) was the world\u0027s last surviving First World War veteran when she died in 2012 aged 110, following the death of British-born sailor Claude Choules (right) in 2011 aged 111          Britain\u0027s last survivor of the First World War trenches, Harry Patch (pictured) - known in his later years as \u0027The Last Fighting Tommy\u0027 - died in 2009 aged 111Yesterday, two life-sized Tommies were unveiled at the US embassy in London to mark the centenary of the end of the First World War.The 6ft statues were revealed by US Ambassador to the UK Robert \u0027Woody\u0027 Johnson and General Lord Dannatt, former chief of the general staff in the British Army.The unveiling of the Soldier Silhouettes commemorated British soldiers and soldiers from the US, known as Doughboys, who served together in the war.One Tommy will guard the embassy foyer and the other will be placed in the consular entrance for the Remembrance period.The Last Tommies will be shown on BBC Four next Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday - with all three episodes running from 9pm until 10pm each evening"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/01/20/51E251D400000578-6341657-The_new_Brisbane_Bullets_NBL_star_boasted_about_having_his_dog_K-a-2_1541105610861.jpg","title":"Brisbane Bullets dog day turns gold","story":"    Basketball star Lamar Patterson has been detained at customs after flying to Australia from the US with his French bulldog in his hand luggage          The new Brisbane Bullets NBL star boasted about having his dog, Kobe, in his bag before he was stopped after arriving in Australia.The case has striking similarity to that of Johnny Depp and his dog Boo, who was smuggled into Australia illegally on his private jet. Patterson travelled with his dog within the US and had inquired about bringing it to Australia, adding the dog to his ticket, Courier Mail reported. It is believed that he was on board an internal flight with American Airlines which allows pets on board, before he jumped on the connecting Qantas flight from Los Angeles to Brisbane.Man whose penis and testicles were bitten off and eaten by...Hermes delivery driver whose FINGER was bitten off by a...Share this articleDuring the flight exchange, the dog went undetected by cabin crew. The Bullets star\u0027s coach Andrej Lemanis, said they accept some responsibility for Patterson\u0027s breaking of the law.\u0027We should take some responsibility....one of the things that obviously we need to communicate in the future,\u0027 he told the publication.  \u0027When he got to the airport, he asked if he could take his dog and the response was \u0027yes\u0027 and it was even on his boarding pass that he was travelling with his dog.

He said it would campaign for Brexit ‘outside the Westminster Bubble’. How far outside the SW1 postcode his Leave.EU donations were originally sourced – Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin and his oligarch allies loom large in this story – is now the business of the National Crime Agency.Banks denies any wrongdoing. Indeed he has always been bullish towards those who have accused him of being a Russian ‘straw man’. His critics are sore Remainer losers, he insists his Twitter feed is headed with the injunction ‘Get Over It.’ Sceptical MPs have been treated by him with public contempt and he is appealing the Electoral Commission’s decision earlier this year to fine the Leave.EU campaign for overspending.In truth the watchdog has enforcement powers akin to those of a toothless chihuahua – a view shared not least by its former chief executive who resigned last month.Arron Banks is now a Tory: Millionaire who bankrolled Ukip...Share this articleBut having found ‘reasonable grounds to suspect’ the tycoon was not the legal ‘true source’ of the £8million loans he made to Better For The Country – the company which ran the Leave.EU campaign – and that he could have committed multiple other suspected criminal offences, the commission has passed the case on to the National Crime Agency.Far from being toothless the NCA, founded to fight serious and organised crime, is the investigatory equivalent of a great white shark. And there is much for its agents to explore, little of which is mundane.Banks’s known Brexit money trail stretches from diamond mines in southern Africa via companies in the offshore tax havens of the Isle of Man and Gibraltar, to the coffers of Leave.EU.          Mr Banks and former UKIP leader Nigel Farage at a party together in 2014But the NCA will no doubt explore further, delving behind the opaque network of his offshore companies. This will include allegations of Russian-orchestrated business ‘sweeteners’ which involved Banks being offered a cut of gold mines in Siberia, Armenia and Guinea. These inducements were reportedly made to him at the start of the Brexit campaign.Such questions would not be asked if Banks – who claims a fortune of £100million – was indisputably a member of the global super-rich.He is undoubtedly wealthy. But for the last 12 months his ability to give away such a large sum of cash to the Brexit campaign has come under scrutiny. He has said his fortune was built on a raft of business successes. Critics – and yes many of them are pro-Remain campaigners – argue that the figures simply don’t stack up.His four diamond mines in South Africa and Lesotho – a region where he has spent considerable time since 2014 – are said to be ailing if not moribund, for example. His insurance companies have owed millions his bank on the Isle of Man was performing ‘poorly’ his stake in a law firm was far smaller than advertised.One investigation calculated the money he had supposedly donated to the Brexit campaign constituted half of his lifetime’s total earnings, which did not make sense.Official action has been slow in coming, if not apathetic.          Mr Banks  with his Russian wife Katya (centre) and his mother-in-lawThe Mail understands that in early 2016 the then home secretary Theresa May declined a request by one of the security services to investigate Banks. The topic was simply too explosive in the run up to the referendum.The Mail has also seen a letter which Ben Gummer MP, at that time minister for the cabinet office, wrote to the Labour MP Ben Bradshaw in February 2017. It was in response to Mr Bradshaw’s expressed fears of external interference in the referendum campaign.‘I can assure you there is no evidence or reasonable grounds for suspicion concerning foreign interference in UK elections or the EU referendum,’ wrote Mr Gummer.‘I am confident that there is negligible risk of a foreign government or agency being able to influence the operational delivery of electoral events in the UK.’Until 2017, stories about Russian influence on Mr Banks extended no further than the fact he was married to Ekaterina Paderina, with whom he has had three children. Miss Paderina, his second wife, originates from the Urals.But there were whispers behind the scenes at Westminster. In early 2017 Banks demanded an apology from a Tory MP who, he claimed, told key figures in the team of President Trump – with whom Banks is close – that he had ‘improper relations’ with the Kremlin.      When questioned about ties with Russian officials Wigmore claimed his initial contact was at the Ukip conference at Doncaster racecourse in 2015 when, as a diplomat accredited to the small central American state of Belize, he discussed the banana industry with someone from the Russian embassy.Wigmore said it was he who instigated the conversation which led to him and Banks dining at the ambassador’s residence.They thought it would be ‘nice’ for Banks’s Russian wife.Asked whether Leave.EU was funded by Russia, Wigmore replied ‘nyet’ - Russian for ‘no’.Banks told the committee that while he had met the gold magnate he had no business interests in Russia – ‘too risky’. He had however given a telephone number for President Trump’s transition team to the Russian ambassador .It was the ‘only thing’ of significance that came out of the meetings – ‘because the Russians wanted to get hold of the transition team’. The grilling ended abruptly when Banks and Wigmore simply walked out. ‘We’ve got places to be, I’m afraid,’ Banks told the MPs.‘I really have to insist. I was told a certain time and we’ve got a lunch appointment that I don’t want to be late for.’ The committee was not impressed.Damian Collins, the its Tory chairman, said last night: ‘Arron Banks and Andy Wigmore have misled the committee on the number of meetings that took place with the Russian embassy and walked out of the committee’s evidence session to avoid scrutiny of the content of the discussions with the Russian embassy.’ He added: ‘From the emails that we have seen, it is evident that Arron Banks had many meetings with Russian officials, including the Russian Ambassador, Alexander Yakovenko, between 2015 and 2017.‘The meetings involved discussions about business deals involving Alrosa, the Russian diamond monopoly, the purchase of gold mines, funded by Sberbank, the Russian-state bank, and the transferring of confidential documents to Russian officials. \u0027Mr Banks seemed to want to hide the extent of his contacts with Russia... Mr Wigmore is a self-confessed liar and, as a result, little significance can be attached to anything that he says. \u0027It is unclear whether Mr Banks profited from business deals arising from meetings arranged by Russian officials.‘We understand that the National Crime Agency is investigating these matters. We believe that they should be given full access to any relevant information that will aid their inquiry.’Last month in a committee room at the House of Commons before a cross party audience including former home secretary Amber Rudd and Stephen Kinnock MP, the Atlantic Council think-tank launched a report titled ‘Democracy in the Crosshairs: How Political Money Laundering Threatened the Democratic Process’.Arron Banks figured heavily in the paper which stated: ‘When weaponised by hostile states with billions of dollars in offshore centres and large, efficient intelligence services, money laundering poses a grave threat to democratic integrity.‘This includes: the use of opaque offshore centres to obscure funds’ origins, the use of fabricated business transactions to transfer funds or covertly enrich iniduals and... the co-opting of “straw men” who count as permissible donors.Neil Barnett, one of the report’s authors, said last night: ‘The NCA’s initiation of a criminal investigation into Arron Banks and his various companies and groups is long overdue. ‘It has been apparent since 2016 that Banks has nowhere near the necessary wealth to donate about £8million. When invited to explain the origin of the funds he has offered various conflicting stories, before settling on “my bank account”. \u0027The law forbids donations from impermissible donors, and only an investigation with legal powers can uncover the truth. Everyone who values democratic integrity should be pleased today.’During his ill-judged select committee appearance, Banks declared: ‘I like to think I’m an evil genius with a white cat that controls the whole of western democracy but clearly that’s nonsense.’ Typical Banks. But the new allegations won’t be so easily dismissed. This week against a background of heightened tension with the Kremlin, the largest Nato exercise since the Cold War has been taking place in Norway.The frontline of the new hostilities is no longer the preserve of soldiers and tanks, however. Eight million pounds is a small price to pay for a military superpower for the break-up of the EU, a rival alliance. The question is, who’s paying? Arron Banks insists it is him alone.    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/01/23/51E2D0B400000578-6344111-The_six_team_members_all_attended_the_closing_ceremony_on_Saturd-a-52_1541113672666.jpg","title":"More half Afghan Invictus Games team refusing leave seek asylum","story":"    More than half of the Afghan Invictus Games team refused to leave Australia and will instead seek asylum in Australia          The six team members all attended the closing ceremony on Saturday night, but by Sunday they had left the team\u0027s hotel          The names of players who chose to stay behind after the Invictus Games are currently unknown\u0027One of them said to me, \u0027\u0027I went and fought, I lost my leg and I lost my brother, my brother was killed, I don\u0027t want to be killed, I don\u0027t want my children to lose parts of their bodies\u0027\u0027,\u0027 Mr Ramaki told SBS.He said the competitors had no intentions of staying in the country, but once they arrived here, everything changed.Performing the Haka and getting Hongi: Prince Harry\u0027s...Goodbye Australia!

Pictured is a map of Britain with a selection of the sites           Among the sites was Gruinard Island, off the west coast of Scotland, where biological warfare testing was carried out. Scientists studied the effects of anthrax by putting the bacteria in bombs and detonating them near a herd of sheep on the island, which slowly killed them. The island was subsequently put off limits to humans until the late 20th Century, when it was decontaminated          An underground bunker called The Paddock, pictured, was built 40ft under a post office in Dollis Hill, north London, and intended to be a back-up should the War Rooms beneath Whitehall be damaged in a Luftwaffe bombing raid. The bunker was bombproof and big enough to house the War Cabinet and 200 staff, but Churchill only ever held one meeting there and is said to have disliked it because it was \u0027damp\u0027 and too far from the city. The land above has since been used for social housing but the bunker still exists and generators and boilers remain inside          Madresfield Court in Worcestershire, pictured, was picked out as a safe house for the Royal Family should they need to be evacuated. If the Battle of Britain had been lost and the Germans had successfully invaded, King George VI and his family would have been moved to the country house because it is secluded in woodland and was far enough away from the sea to mount a strong defence. It was part of a wider plan to move the government to Worcestershire, with other stately homes picked to host Churchill and government officials. A house has been on this spot since the 1400s and has been owned by the Lygon family. It is currently home to Rosalind, Lady MorrisonThey include Gruinard Island, off the west coast of Scotland, where biological warfare tests were carried out by scientists who infected sheep with anthrax.It left the island dangerous to mammals for decades, until it was finally decontaminated in the late 20th Century. Another site was The Paddock in Dollis Hill, north London, an alternative bunker for Prime Minister Winston Churchill, designed to be completely bombproof in case the Whitehall War Rooms were damaged by Luftwaffe bombing raids.REVEALED: Truth behind Netflix drama of Adolf Eichmann\u0027s...\u0027You could feel the machine gun bullets flying past you\u0027:...Faces of brave soldiers who died in the First World War,...Share this articleThe £250,000 shelter, constructed 40ft beneath the post office building in Brook Road, was meant to be a last resort for the prime minister should the Battle of Britain have been lost, and was large enough to house the war cabinet and up to 200 staff.  The cabinet met there twice, in October 1940 and March 1941, but the bunker, which could only be accessed by a concealed door in the post office, was abandoned before the end of the war.Since then, it has been left almost untouched and today all that is left inside it are generators, boilers and the remains of the telephone circuitry which connected it to the rest of Britain\u0027s war-time command infrastructure.          At the outbreak of the war the government became concerned over potential damage to valuable works of art and national treasures from bombing raids or an invasion. After searching for a secret location to store them, officials picked out Manod Quarry in North Wales, pictured, because it was isolated and deep enough to be bomb proof. Underground chambers were then renovated to make them hospitable for the artwork, with air conditioning installed to control the environment and stop them becoming affected by damp          Road and rail access to Manod, pictured, was improved to allow trucks to bring lorry loads of paintings to the quarry. Specially-designed wagons were also built to allow the artworks to be safely transported through the caverns without being damaged. Although the masterpieces were removed when peace returned, the Department of the Environment was unwilling to vacate the site and only left in the 1980s. Speculation mounted over what had been kept there, but when it was reopened all that was found was shelving and old packaging           Clapham South Tube Station was converted into one of eight deep-level shelters built around London to protect the public during Luftwaffe raids. Visitors had to walk down 180 steps to reach the shelter. Other locations included Chancery Lane station on the Central line and Belsize Park, Camden Town, Goodge Street, Stockwell, Clapham North and Clapham Common on the Northern Line. In 1948, the deep shelter at Clapham was used as temporary accommodation for immigrants from the West IndiesMeanwhile Madresfield Court, a country house in Worcestershire, was picked out as a potential safehouse for the Royal Family in the event of a successful German invasion.Should the Germany Army have made it to London, the Royals, including then Princess Elizabeth, would have fled to the mansion, which is secluded among woodland.It was part of a wider plan to move the government to Worcestershire if London became \u0027untenable\u0027 during the war, with more stately homes picked to house Churchill and other government officials. Another  forgotten site is the abandoned Rhydymwyn Valley Works in north Wales where Britain\u0027s World War Two chemical weapons were stored but never used.The site is now a nature reserve but the entrance to the tunnels is still visible with the warning sign \u0027entry to tunnels is dangerous\u0027.Many country houses were requisitioned by the Government to house royalty, politicians and, in some cases, high profile German POWs.            Although it may look like an attractive country manor, Mytchett Place in Surrey, pictured, actually served as a makeshift prison for Hitler\u0027s deputy Rudolf Hess a month after he was captured in Scotland after parachuting into Britain in an attempted peace mission. After initially being detained in the Tower of London, Hess was moved to Mytchett Place in June 1941 and spent 13 months there, even attempting suicide shortly after arriving by throwing himself off a balcony          Hess, pictured centre at the Nuremberg Trials with Hermann Goering, left, and Joachim von Ribbentrop, right, was eventually moved to a hospital in Wales in 1942, where he spent the remainder of the war. After Germany surrendered, Hess, who had been stripped of all titles by Hitler after his unauthorised peace mission, was found guilty of \u0027crimes against peace\u0027 but not war crimes, and was handed a life sentence at Spandau Prison in Berlin          Another quarry to be requisitioned by the British government was Rhydymwyn in Flintshire, Wales, pictured. Neville Chamberlain\u0027s government identified the site as a good location to store chemical weapons should they ever need to be used against Nazi Germany over fears Hitler might attack with mustard gas. Tunnels were then fortified within the quarry in 1939 and by 1943 there were more than 2,000 workers on site          The quarry, pictured from the outside, was later identified as a potential place to store Bank of England gold should Britain be attacked by nuclear weapons. The mustard gas remained stored on site until the late 1950s until it was safely disposed of. The tunnels have been out of use since the early 1990s but were briefly opened to the public for guided tours earlier this yearRudolf Hess, the Deputy Fuhrer of Nazi Germany, was held captive at Mytchett Place, in Mytchett, Surrey, which is now the home of a research company.Hess was transported from the Tower of London to Mytchett Place, known as \u0027Camp Z\u0027, on May 20, 1941.He spent 13 months there and once attempted to commit suicide by throwing himself off a balcony on June 15, 1941.Target maps for the famous Dambusters raid were produced at Hughenden Manor, near High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, and a country house near Lochaber in northern Scotland was taken over for Special Operations Executive training.Quarries in north Wales were used by the National Gallery to hide priceless treasures which were under threat during the Blitz, and tunnels across the country were converted into air raid shelters.In addition, farmers\u0027 fields became dummy and decoy airfields and cities.During the Second World War, thousands of sites across Britain were requisitioned to support the war effort.Command and control centres were generally the best protected and many were indeed bunkers buried beneath ground.          Although its occupants were not as high-profile as some other stately homes, Hughenden Manor in High Wycombe still played a vital role in the war effort. The country house, which once belonged to prime minister Benjamin Disraeli, was used as a intelligence base and codenamed Hillside. RAF and Air Ministry staff produced detailed maps and photos of Germany for raids, including drawing up the plans for the famous Dambusters mission. The house is now owned by the National Trust and is open to the public          Between 1939 and 1946 a secret factory operated at Leeds and Bradford Municipal Aerodrome, pictured, which is now Leeds Bradford Airport. It was the largest single factory in Europe and run by aircraft firm Avro and because of the danger from bombing, it was camouflaged as farmland, with grass covering the roof and fake farm buildings erected around the factory, with even a duck pond built. At the height of its operation, more than 17,500 people worked on site 24-hours a day, and it produced almost 700 Lancaster bombers as well as thousands more of other types of aircraft           Arisaig House in the Scottish Highlands, pictured, became the base for the Special Operations Executive during the war, which was Britain\u0027s secret service during the conflict, running sabotage and spying missions behind enemy lines. Arisaig was used for paramilitary training missions in rough terrain  to prepare agents for similar conditions in mainland Europe. Foreign nationals were also trained at the site, and a memorial was unveiled there to Czech and Slovak soldiers in 2009          Ditchley House, pictured, in Oxfordshire, was picked as the alternative residence for Churchill over concerns his homes at Chartwell and Chequers were \u0027too visible\u0027 to German aircraft. Ditchley was considered ideal because of heavy foliage around the building and an obscured access road. Churchill frequently visited the property and even negotiated deals with the US there.

It is n ow owned by the Ditchley Foundation trust and was used for filming in Downton AbbeyHowever, the country\u0027s industrial powerhouses were simply too numerous and required too much space to be concealed in this way.The authorities did their best to protect these above ground sites as best it could, through a mixture of camouflage, guards and decoy and dummy sites to confuse bombers.The general public did their bit to keep them secret by adhering to the \u0027careless talk costs lives\u0027 campaign.Mr Philpott, 61, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, said: \u0027Britain\u0027s secret wartime locations have themselves enjoyed a variety of fates.\u0027Some of course have been recognised, often only recently, for their historical significance and have been memorialised and made into museums and visitor attractions, like Bletchley and the Churchill War Rooms.\u0027Others have reverted to their pre-war use, including many of the country houses, sports stadia and other locations requisitioned in 1939.\u0027Some gained new uses in the post-war world, often associated with the Cold War, like the shadow factories built for war which were put to peaceful use, making cars or tractors or other products.\u0027Many though have disappeared altogether. The radar stations that dotted the wartime coastline, the decoy and dummy airfields, the hideouts of the British Resistance have to all intents and purposes vanished.\u0027A few have been frozen in aspic, left pretty much as they were in 1945, not memorialised but also not converted for other uses.\u0027It is perhaps these places, like the abandoned chemical factory in north Wales and the alternative war rooms in north London which for me are the most poignant traces of secret wartime Britain.\u0027Secret Wartime Britain, by Colin Philpott, will be published by Pen \u0026amp Sword on November 30 and costs £25. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/11/01/09/51DE621400000578-0-image-a-24_1541064727598.jpg","title":"Irelands crackdown drink driving ruin socialising","story":"    Shane Ross, the minister for transport, tourism and sport, said the measures were a \u0027significant step in clamping down on the scourge of drink driving\u0027 (stock image)University drop-out addicted to drugs and alcohol who stood...Mother who was caught driving SIX TIMES over the legal limit...Share this articleCllr Logan added: \u0027While I do not condone driving with a blood alcohol level above that which is legally permitted, I feel the enforcement of zero-tolerance will instill an unnecessary fear in already marginalised rural dwellers who are dependent on driving for independent living.\u0027 The Garda has had a crackdown on drink-driving offences, with superindendent Kevin English confirming there had been a number of checkpoints over the weekend. Prior to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018 coming into force on October 25, a driver detected with a blood alcohol concentration of between 50 and 80 milligrams was punished with a €200 fine and three penalty points.Leitrim Garda superintendent Kevin English said he welcomed the change, adding that \u0027if the law saves one life it is worth it\u0027.           Prior to the Road Traffic (Amendment) Act 2018 coming into force on October 25, a driver detected with a blood alcohol concentration of between 50 and 80 milligrams was punished with a €200 fine and three penalty points (stock image of Garda in Dublin)Shane Ross, the minister for transport, tourism and sport, said the measures were a \u0027significant step in clamping down on the scourge of drink driving\u0027.He added: \u0027There are few more irresponsible and dangerous things people can do in everyday life than drink and drive.\u0027It was always wrong to give people the mild slap on the wrist of three penalty points for such potentially lethal behaviour, and it is a great satisfaction to know that in future people who behave this way will face a disqualification from driving for three months.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Snake appears Israels Western Wall sparking claims Biblical prophecy coming true","story":"Hebrew bloggers have claimed the appearance of a snake at the Western Wall proves we are in \u0027dangerous times\u0027 predating the coming of the Messiah\u0027The evil inclination, personified by the snake in Eden, will make a resurgence in the days before Messiah,\u0027 the bloggers were quoted as saying by Breaking Israel News.Several references to the Messiah saving an afflicted or endangered people are made in the Old Testament. Hebrew-language site pointed out that in Jewish teachings, Israel is sometimes compared to a pigeon or dove.Police launch investigation into anti-Semitism in the Labour...Battle-scarred bible shows the bullet marks it took when it...Share this articleThe site said: \u0027Just as the pigeon is safe so long as it seeks shelter among the stones of the Temple Mount, the Jews are protected by the Torah commandments. \u0027When the pigeon comes out from the stones or the the Jews move away from the Torah, they are in danger.\u0027We are truly in the dangerous times that directly precede Mashiach (Messiah).\u0027           The snake (centre) was seen scaring away a pigeon perched on the wall, which bloggers said represented the state of Israel being plagued by danger  A worker then climbed a ladder to remove the snake, sparking discussion about what the symbol could mean onlineIt comes after several other incidents at the Temple Mount which have been interpreted as religious signs. Four months ago a large piece of stone fell from the Western Wall, almost crushing a woman who had gone there to pray.One kabbalist - or mystic - interpreted it as a sign that the Third Temple should be built, because the stone fell the morning after Tisha B’Av, which is a fast to commemorate the destruction of the first two temples.The construction of the Third Temple is supposed to predict the Messiah\u0027s coming.Shortly afterward, a large cloud of dust billowed up from inside the Temple Mount Compound, surrounding the Dome of the rock for several minutes.One rabbi suggested the dust revealed a conflict taking place on the spiritual plane. Watch!

Mr Raab (centre) posed with DUP politicians including Mr Dodds (left) and Mrs Foster (second left) following his talks today   Dominic Raab arrived at Stormont today for talks with both the DUP and Sinn FeinAsked twice by the BBC whether it had ruled out any new regulatory checks at the Irish border, he said: \u0027We are engaged in a negotiation process.\u0027We have made it very clear that whether it\u0027s the customs regime for the UK as a whole, or the wider economic integrity of the UK as a whole, we will not allow any proposals to be accepted that would jeopardise that, and that is the crucial thing here.\u0027Of course we want to maintain frictionless trade with our EU partners, but the internal market within the UK is absolutely crucial too.\u0027They are not binary choices, we want to preserve both and also enhance and increase our opportunities for global trade which would be good for the UK and good for Northern Ireland too.\u0027Earlier, following talks with Mr Raab, DUP leader Arlene Foster said she had reiterated to Mr Raab her party\u0027s opposition to any additional checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.Speaking to the media afterwards alongside her deputy Nigel Dodds, Mrs Foster said: \u0027From the constitutional point of view but also from an economic point of view that it is very important that as well as not having any customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers.\u0027    Prime Minister Theresa May (right) and the French president (left) are due to have lunch in the town of Albert before they take part in Armistic commemorations          DUP leader Arlene Foster (pictured with her deputy Nigel Dodds today) said she had reiterated to Mr Raab her party\u0027s opposition to any additional checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UKThe Pound surged yesterday amid claims a deal had been reached safeguarding financial services ties.The blueprint was said to involve the UK and EU having \u0027equivalent\u0027 regulations - with an arbitration system for any disputes and a notice period for erging.Mr Raab also sparked a wave of optimism earlier in the week by saying he \u0027expects\u0027 a orce deal to be settled by November 21.However, officials have been scrambling to play down the chances of a swift resolution, insisting there is still a major sticking point over the Irish border backstop.Downing Street has warned that those speculating about a breakthrough needed to \u0027take a deep breath\u0027.Mr Macron has been one of the most strident critics of Mrs May\u0027s Chequers plan, and has warned he will not agree anything that risks undermining the single market.Meanwhile, France has been working hard to lure business from the City of London.Mrs May and Mr Macron will meet in the town of Albert, close to where British Tommy George Robertson - Mr Macron\u0027s Bristol-born ancestor - was in the trenches.They will also lay flowers at the Thiepval Memorial to thousands lost in the 1916 Battle of the Somme, but current day politics will not be forgotten.\u0027There will be a working lunch during which the topic of Brexit will of course be on the agenda,\u0027 said a French government source.   Cabinet Office minister David Lidington (left) and Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley (right) are in Dublin today for discussions with the deputy PM Simon Coveney          Sinn Fein\u0027s Chris Hazzard accused Mr Raab of dodging real people during his visit to the Irish border today"},{"url":null,"title":"Suzy Lamplugh suspect John Cannan hopes garden search end speculation did it","story":"  John Cannan (left) is the man police believe murdered Suzy Lamplugh but he has denied it from his jail cell today  Police face questions over the garden excavation because they knew suspect had worked on the patio - because he admitted it himself 16 years ago in a letter from prisonSuzy Lamplugh was snatched in broad daylight on a street not...Suzy Lamplugh suspect \u0027told his girlfriend the estate agent...Mother-of-three reveals how she was \u0027targeted by Suzy...Suzy Lamplugh murder suspect is \u0027waiting for his 96-year-old...EXCLUSIVE: ‘I played on the patio they are digging up - now...Suzy Lamplugh police search patio they FAILED to dig up 15...Share this article    Mr Kipper\u0027s efit - which looks like Cannan1. John Cannan, a serial rapist and killer, was given the nickname \u0027Kipper\u0027 by bail hostel friends because he liked eating smelly fish and slept much of the day. Mr Kipper was the name of the man who met Suzy when she vanished.2. He resembled a photofit of a man seen with Suzy when she disappeared 32 years ago.3. Detectives learned that Cannan may have been the the \u0027mystery man\u0027 Suzy had a fling with.4.  Suzy had complained of being pestered by a man from Bristol, Cannan\u0027s home city.5. The former car salesman also had access to a BMW of the type thought to have been driven by \u0027Mr Kipper\u0027 to the estate agent appointment.6. Three days before Suzy vanished Cannan was given day release after serving five years for rape. He also had a false alibi.7. One witness suggested he was a stalker seen staring into Suzy\u0027s Fulham estate agent\u0027s window.8. Another person claims he may have seen the convicted killer take her to a park for Champagne.9. A taxi driver claimed the same day, in that area, a man clutching a Champagne bottle and estate agent papers hailed him.10  Former girlfriend Gilly Paige claims her ex had joked he was \u0027Mr Kipper\u0027.                                                    After his arrest his former international ice skater girlfriend Gilly Paige told police Cannan had told her he knew where Suzy was buried but it was not been followed up.She had been seduced by the \u0027absolutely gorgeous\u0027 killer after meeting him in a Bristol hotel in May 1987 - ten months after Suzy vanished - after she returned from travelling in south-east Asia.Cannan drove her from Bristol to Birmingham where she lived and appeared to give vital evidence about the murder - but she was confused because she had not heard of the case.Ms Paige said: \u0027I\u0027d been out of the country so long, in Thailand, I had not heard or read anything about it.\u0027The reason he didn\u0027t spook me out was because I thought she\u0027d already been found and John was talking about a topic of interest\u0027.  Police are continuing to dig up the patio at Sheila Cannan\u0027s former home in the West Midlands today.But questions remain over its timing because it appears police knew their prime suspect had worked on the patio - because he admitted it himself 16 years ago. The extraordinary confession emerged in letters sent to a penpal from his cell where he is serving 35 years for abducting and beating to death Shirley Banks in 1987.He said: \u0027I haven\u0027t even told you all I should have done. I still have admissions to make but to what end? To speak out would have wholesale repercussions\u0027.His coat was also blood-splattered, but he blamed an abscess in a letter entitled: \u0027The blood on my mac\u0027.He wrote: \u0027There are several truthful reasons how mud and blood came to be on my mac\u0027. The home\u0027s current owner Phillip Carey said police were preparing to dig up the patio 15 years ago but never did after taking samples from the stone slabs.He said: \u0027They had looked at the patio in 2003 and it was discounted at that moment, it\u0027s directly outside the backdoor.\u0027They traced when the patio stones were bought, who they were bought from and this is ten years afterwards.\u0027 Retired Det Supt Jim Dickie, who led the inquiry for six years, said yesterday: \u0027We didn\u0027t dig up the garden because we didn\u0027t have any specific information she may be buried there.\u0027   Police have covered much of the garden in tents and tarpaulin as they dig for Suzy\u0027s remainsJohn Cannan, 64, will not give up his secrets until the death of his mother, a close relative has said.

They were very close, she used to visit him in prison every week.\u0027I don\u0027t think he would want to bring all the attention back on to her while she is alive.

Constantly checking social media, making it impossible to concentrate on a task at hand? Disconnecting and eliminating disruption could be just what you needFrench artist Paul Cézanne once remarked: “It’s so fine and yet so terrible to stand in front of a blank canvas.”Today, the challenge is not so much to begin a task, but to complete it. Digital innovators make a virtue of disruption, but their innovations have also had a more literal impact on our lives. Creative technologies have proliferated – you can make an album in your bedroom, write and publish a novel and create and display your artwork – but so have the number of channels vying for your attention.Any project you begin runs the risk of frequent distraction from multiple sources such as the constant, nagging hum of social media updates, group notifications and message alerts.There is no denying the power mobile phones hold over us. There’s even a phenomenon known as “phantom vibration syndrome”, which is the perception that your phone is buzzing when it’s not.It is a daily challenge to shut off the deluge of stimuli and try to focus, to centre yourself and be imaginative. It was the philosopher Aristotle who first put forward the idea of the tabula rasa: the young mind as a blank slate. In the literal sense, nothing relates to this more than the process of beginning to work on an empty page.Jackie Andrade, professor of psychology at University of Plymouth, wrote a paper in 2009, where she supported the use of doodling as a cognitive process and aid for reducing daydreaming.Pen and paper are the original, and perhaps the ultimate creative platform, providing a physical connection between the mind and a tool for expression. They fuel the imagination and solidify thought.“There was a study (pdf) that compared students writing on paper and those writing notes on a keyboard, and the former came out better in tests. If you’re typing on your computer, whether you get notifications or not, you’re tempted to look in case there’s something there. You’re pulled away in case there’s an email or something might be happening on Facebook. That doesn’t exist if you use a pen and pad. Those notifications are really disruptive, it’s not just reading them, it’s the time it takes to refocus on the task. That’s a powerful reason to write on paper, whether it be real or digital.”What if there was a medium that provided a bridge between physical writing or drawing and the capability of a digital device, but with none of the disruption? Well, there is. reMarkable is a paper tablet that’s so natural and adaptable that it makes notebooks, sketchbooks and printouts redundant. It offers a paper-like reading, writing and drawing experience in a tactile device that filters out the digital noise around you.“There’s a digital epidemic going on right now. Far too many of us are addicted to checking our social media accounts several times per hour, or worse,” says Magnus Wanberg, founder and CEO of reMarkable. “This is forming our habits in a negative way when it comes to our ability to concentrate and focus on the task at hand. We have based our entire product and company on helping people focus. While most tech companies focus on artificial intelligence, at reMarkable we work to enhance human intelligence. This is why we designed the reMarkable tablet with no distractions or notifications.”Find out more at remarkable"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21b7951eebf764e07b0ca69b056432f69be56076/135_1506_2758_1655/master/2758.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=caa034737814e0d2a3e0fb98373b7d0a","title":"book clinic what would you like to ask our experts","story":"In our weekly series you can ask experts in the books industry any questions you want answeredBook Clinic is a weekly series in the pages of the New Review section of the Observer where we will turn to experts in their field to answer any book, reading or publishing questions you may have.

But the search for her replacement begins this Saturday, with the announcement of a panel of experts to guide the selection.The steering group assembles the great and the good of the poetry world, from the director of the Poetry Society to the artistic director of the Ledbury poetry festival, with space alongside for the leading lights of the literary establishment.The Society of Authors’ chief executive Nicola Solomon, who is also serving on the panel, welcomed the opening up of a process that been shrouded in mystery since James I offered Ben Jonson a pension of 100 marks, declaring the society “very pleased to be part of a panel made up of representatives from across the arts sector covering a range of ages, backgrounds and UK regions”.But with the panel set to present a shortlist to the secretary of state at the DCMS and the prime minister due to make a final decision to put forward for the Queen, the poet John Agard doesn’t think much has changed.“I’m certain that the prime minister is very familiar with the iambic pentameter,” Agard said. “But since poets don’t have the final say in politics, logically speaking there’s no reason why politicians should have the final say in poetry.”Agard paid tribute to the way Duffy has transformed the position, supporting the work of other poets and founding the Ted Hughes award.“There’s no question that Carol Ann has done a wonderful job,” he said, “because she made the laureateship connect across the board.”The poet Jackie Kay, currently serving as Scottish makar, agreed, declaring that Duffy’s time as the UK’s foremost advocate for poetry has been “absolutely spectacular”.“She’s been an inspiring and extraordinary laureate,” Kay said, “and she’s changed the role for all time. It’s been a groundbreaking and a ground-shifting laureateship.”Poetry itself has changed since Duffy’s appointment in 2009, Kay added. “It’s more readily available, people feel they have a right to it – both to write it and to consume it in whatever way they choose, whether that be reading a book, watching a video or seeing a poster in the underground.” There has also been a massive explosion in performance poetry, she continued. “The audiences for poetry have got bigger and bigger.”Despite the changes to the position, Kay isn’t throwing her hat into the ring. “I can’t see how I could possibly be the makar and the poet laureate,” she said. “I don’t think the powers that be would want to combine the two.”With Duffy becoming the first female laureate in the institution’s four-century history, black and minority ethnic poets should certainly be considered for the position, Kay continued, citing Lemn Sissay, Benjamin Zephaniah, Patience Agbabi and Imtiaz Dharker as strong candidates. “It would be inspiring and exciting to have a black poet laureate,” she said.For Agard, it’s about time the UK laureate was black. “A black poet should not be seen in that Victorian way as part of a cabinet of curiosities,” he said. “It’s part of the British fabric of being, it’s not an anomaly.” And he’s not ruling anything out. “If I may borrow a cricketing metaphor, who knows which way the pitch will turn.”With poets such as Simon Armitage, Daljit Nagra and Vahni Capildeo also in the frame, it’s impossible to know who will be receiving the laureate’s traditional butt of sack when the decision is announced in May 2019. But Wendy Cope, who has been a prominent candidate since the selection of Andrew Motion in 1999, has ruled herself out of contention this time around.“I was probably a bit over the top when I said the post should be abolished,” she said. “What I hate is the publicity leading up to an appointment, with odds at William Hill and so on. If it’s a competition, it is one that many poets have no interest in winning.”While it isn’t a job she has ever wanted to do, Cope is sanguine about the role of politicians in filling the position. “I doubt if the prime minister has much to do with it,” Cope said. “She’s got much more important things to think about.”Kay is hoping that Theresa May, a prime minister famed for relaxing by watching NCIS, follows the advice of her expert panel. “I wouldn’t have any faith in her making the ultimate decision,” Kay said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b771ff6179648cfb5deecfbb037a01d07457d3ff/0_482_7224_4334/master/7224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=39d382697f0106bd7e5570e5bb4b04c1","title":"ma jian interview exiled chinese writer free speech dissidents novel","story":"The exiled Chinese writer on the murder of dissidents, attacks on free speech and his new novel exposing the brutality of his homelandIn an era of growing political impunity, when dissidents are murdered on foreign soil and even the head of Interpol is not immune from being “disappeared”, Ma Jian seems almost recklessly brave. Could there be a more provocative title than that given by the exiled novelist to his latest satirical onslaught on the country of his birth? For, with China Dream, he co-opts the rhetoric of the Chinese leader Xi Jinping to tell the story of a politician who is driven mad by memories of his own corruption.Xi first used the phrase shortly after becoming general secretary of the Communist party in 2012, and Ma has responded “in a rush of rage” with a short, ferocious novel about the way turbo-capitalism and authoritarianism have combined to inform a Chinese dream that excludes all but a chosen few. “I wanted to give myself the challenge of encapsulating everything in as few words as possible,” he says, wryly adding that it will be interesting to see how the Chinese authorities react to the novel, given that they’ve outlawed so many “key words” online – “even the name Winnie-the-Pooh is banned because people joked that Xi Jinping resembled him”.A momentary silence falls as we consider the surreal possibility of the “paramount leader” being forced to ban his own slogan. But the reality, Ma acknowledges, is that censorship is now so all-encompassing that the novel will very probably not be allowed to exist in Chinese, even in Hong Kong, which has historically provided a toehold for work by dissident authors banned on the mainland.In a tranquil London cafe, close to the home he shares with his translator and partner Flora Drew and their four children, the risks this slight, 65-year-old writer is taking are hard to comprehend. Despite living in the UK for 17 years, he does not speak English. It’s not as if he hasn’t tried, says Drew, who translates our interview, but he has a stubborn devotion to his mother tongue and remains more engaged with goings-on in China than those in his adopted country. “Living in the west allows me to see through the fog of lies that shrouds my homeland,” he writes in the foreword to China Dream. During the interview, he invokes Dante’s Divine Comedy: “It’s only through being expelled that the poet gets to see heaven and hell and purgatory.”It was a perspective forced on him from his earliest days, as one of five children born into a well-to-do family in the provincial city of Qingdao in 1953. A childhood in which he had already shown promise as an artist came to an abrupt end with the start of the Cultural Revolution. He was 13 years old. His art teacher was persecuted as a “rightist” and his grandfather, a landlord and tea connoisseur, was executed. At 15, he joined an arts propaganda troupe, beginning an adult life that would take him through various industrial assignments to a job as a photojournalist. He married a dancer and had the regulation single child. Then a photography prize brought him to the attention of the authorities and he was transferred to work for the foreign propaganda unit of the Federation of Trade Unions in Beijing.There, living in a “one‑bed shack”, he connected with a buzzy young community of writers and artists. Officially, he worked as a journalist. Unofficially, he made and occasionally sold paintings. “Mostly they were stolen, but a man from the US embassy bought one for $40,” he recalls. “My hair was encrusted with oil paint and the walls were papered with my paintings.”In 1983, just as he turned 30, he hit the crisis that would upend his life. Divorced from his wife, who forbade him to make contact with his daughter, he was arrested for “spiritual pollution”. Though Ma was released, his shack was ransacked and his canvases ripped up. “I never painted again,” he says. “I saw what a fragile medium it was, and how vulnerable to abuse and persecution, and I asked myself what was I going to do for the rest of my life?”In his attempt to answer this question he converted to Buddhism and set off on a three-year journey across China on foot. At first, he was afraid even to record what he witnessed in his notebook, in case it fell into the wrong hands, but gradually, he says, “I saw that through literature I could paint my own reality. I could record history.”He arrived in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa to find a people whose traditions had been corrupted by poverty and political oppression even as they celebrated the 20th anniversary of their “liberation” to the status of autonomous region. In 1987, Ma poured his impressions into a collection of short stories, belatedly published in English as Stick Out Your Tongue. It was immediately banned by the Chinese censors, sending him into an exile from which he has never permanently returned, though until six years ago he was allowed to visit China, and continues to keep in close contact with friends and family.He turns up for the interview with a dramatically bandaged thumb, the result of an accident while building a shed in his garden, the explanation of which leads on to one of his latest frustrations. He had written a letter to one of his brothers inviting him to come over to help, he says, “but during this time there was a huge demo of disgruntled veterans demanding higher benefits, so the whole town had been sealed off and surrounded by armed police. No information was able to get in or out, so the letter has probably been handed over to the authorities. What happened there shows how today’s China is more extreme than anything George Orwell could have imagined, because these events don’t even reach public consciousness: it’s as if they never happened.”Erasure of memory is the abiding theme of Ma’s work, whether through the literal motif of an unconscious man in his epic 2008 novel Beijing Coma, set around Tiananmen Square, or through the allegorical pursuit of a recipe for “Old Lady Broth of Amnesia” to which the municipal leader Ma Daode devotes himself in China Dream, tormented by a past in which he drove his own parents to suicide by denouncing them. “The process of dragging back memories that are being constantly erased, especially from my position of exile, makes even more important to me the primacy of memory,” Ma says, “and how it not only involves a nation’s sense of history but a person’s sense of self.”His satire is always firmly located in violations of the human body. Stick Out Your Tongue told stories of ritual rape and multi-generational incest. In his 2013 novel, The Dark Road, aborted late-term foetuses are carried around in plastic bags or boiled in Cantonese restaurants to make potency soups for men. The fourth of China Dream’s seven episodes takes Ma Daode to a strip club, where VIPs have orgies in Mao’s private room with women who are identified only by numbers. The reason for this, he explains, is because “totalitarianism not only seeks to control the thought but also the body in which those thoughts are housed”.“As a writer, when you are trying to describe your characters, there’s a visceral connection to their being. But in my exploration of the body I’m always trying to show that in these systems, when a regime is trying to hurt a person’s physical being, at the heart of it is an attempt to crush their soul. Sometimes, the body can survive but a lot of the time it becomes no more than a carcass.”Red Dust, his semi-fictionalised 2001 account of his life-changing three-year journey, introduced another persistent theme, betrayal. It recounted how he was twice betrayed by an actor girlfriend, whom he, in turn, considered denouncing to the film studio that employed her, out of jealousy over her infidelity. None of his characters is without blame, but neither are they entirely evil. Even Ma Doade in China Dream attempts to warn protesters that they will be killed if they refuse to move out when bulldozers arrive to clear their homes for redevelopment.Ma relates his story quietly and urgently through Drew, keeping his own record of the conversation in spidery Chinese script. The couple met in 1997 when she was working on a TV documentary about the handover of Hong Kong to China and he was one of the few local people who agreed to speak. He invited her to a poetry reading and gave her all his books to read she stayed on to finish them, and by the time she left they were together. He moved briefly to Germany after the handover before joining her in London. She has translated everything he has written since. Does she worry that his repeated attacks on China may put him in danger? “This is the first time I’ve felt concerned, because there’s a brazenness to the behaviour now and they can do it without any backlash at all,” she says.But the couple have kept faith with the best of the country, sending their 15-year-old son to study martial arts at a Shaolin monastery and to spend time with his Chinese family. Ma plans to travel to the Hong Kong literary festival this month, to present his novel in English. “I refuse to be afraid,” he says. “The disregard for truth is infectious. It also explains the rise of Trump. We need to protect concepts of humanity, and freedom can’t be taken for granted. We have to remain constantly vigilant. The more you buckle under these pressures, the huger the monster becomes. One’s responsibility as a writer is to be fearless.”• China Dream is published by Chatto.

As a device for understanding ourselves and the world, nothing else comes close. Poetry is language at its keenest, and the poetry of these islands is our greatest achievement.Accordingly, the laureateship should be the highest office in poetry and the laureate should be  of those ideals. It should be awarded to a poet of true recognition, a poet admired by both their fellow poets and by the public, a poet who is both expert and enthusiast, and a poet who is an accomplished practitioner of the art as well as its champion and ambassador. No one else will do. It should be a poet who listens more than they talk, who reads more than they write, who thinks more of other poets’ work than they do of their own, and who knows and cares deeply about the poets of the past, because there are more of them than us and they are better. If you put the laurel crown on your head and you haven’t read the whole of Beowulf or the Iliad, or don’t know who wrote Lycidas, or can’t recite a poem by Sappho or Emily Dickinson, or can’t name a poem by Derek Walcott, then you are not worthy of the role. Prepare to be embarrassed at your first interview. The great majority of the best poetry ever written is freely available so not to have to read it – even just to disagree with it – is inexcusable. The laureateship requires experience and dignity. We’re not looking to appoint the mayor of Toytown or a mascot for our everyday aspirations. Or someone who has published four books, sits on five committees, has judged six prizes and is a nice person, or someone who is a shop-steward for contemporary values first and a poet second (or third).If you’re still in the running at this stage, you also need to be someone who will get out from behind the keyboard and the dusty tomes, come down from the ivory tower or the sunlit garret or the senior common room, and be prepared to go into the schools, prisons, communities and hospices. In fact you will probably have been doing that for thirty years. And you should happily go to the theatres and festivals and nightclubs to see and hear live poetry being spoken and performed. And you should have a long-term project in mind, like Andrew Motion’s Poetry Archive or Carol Ann Duffy’s award for new work. And you should be thinking about how to encourage and promote the poets of the future, because there will be more of them than us and they will be better."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4a7baaac3b8f02447a367e3698c6696f7bdb1a5/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=92841bd5f07fefdcc859d6ed4b1f2b31","title":"housebuilding slowdown dampens construction industry recovery","story":"Impact of Brexit cited as one of the factors that have led to fewer homes being built A slowdown in housebuilding across the UK has put a drag on the construction industry’s recovery, according to figures that also showed new orders across the sector had slowed.Builders blamed the uncertainty surrounding the government’s Brexit talks for a jittery housing market and their response, which was to complete fewer homes than planned.However, a surge in infrastructure work and civil engineering meant the sector bounced back from a six-month low in September, though not to higher levels of activity seen in July.The IHSMarkit purchasing managers’ index (PMI) for the construction industry improved to 53.2 in October after dipping to 52.1 in September, from 52.9 in August and a 14-month high of 55.8 in July. A level above 50 indicates an an expansion in output.One analyst said the industry was “punch drunk” from buffeting it had received over the past couple of years following severe winters that had brought activity to a standstill only to be followed by surges in confidence about the outlook.Blane Perrotton, the managing director of surveyors Naismiths, said: “After months of see-sawing demand and confidence, the construction industry is getting increasingly punch drunk – with sentiment flat on the canvas.“This latest PMI gives a typically contradictory snapshot of the health of the sector. Output is picking up but new orders are dwindling – which broadly translates as ‘hurry up and wait’.”Howard Archer, the chief economic advisor to the EY Item Club, said October’s reading was below the third-quarter average of 53.6: “While construction activity improved in October, there was a disappointing softening in new orders which grew at the slowest rate since May. This was reportedly influenced by concerns over Brexit and the economy.“Further worrying news saw construction companies’ confidence about output prospects for the next 12 months weaken to the lowest level for nearly six years.”Nevertheless, building companies are still on the lookout for more staff to overcome shortages that have been exacerbated by the Brexit vote and a decline in the number of skilled migrants from eastern Europe looking for work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b8077738ca5d9240f1e78e117061c44f55a3d3a1/0_136_692_415/master/692.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5cab97bfd11b09a130c8681a368e39fc","title":"david cameron legacy shepherds hut","story":"“David Cameron eyes return to frontline politics.” God, why couldn’t that sentence stop after the word frontline? Why does “politics” have to ruin everything? I suppose it’s because Cameron is more of the type who’d have been drinking wine back at the chateau in the first world war. “We’re right behind you!” brays General Melchett at Baldrick on the eve of sending his men over the top. “About 35 miles behind you,” mutters Blackadder.Having said all that, I do hope our former prime minister’s forthcoming memoirs are entitled David Cameron’s War, with a cover picture of him doing a thousand-yard stare in a White Stuff fleece. (Out of shot, the back of it reads: “Val d’Isère 2018 – THE POWDER AND THE GLORY BOYS!!!”)And so to an eye-catching report in the Sun, in which a “friend” of Cameron does a spectacular drive-by on him, unintentionally or otherwise. According to this mate, Cameron is toying with a return to politics, and fancies being foreign secretary. It’s rather difficult to know precisely what to make of a story in which almost every quote sounds like it was said for a dare. “David is dedicated to public service” “David is “bored shitless” David “has often said he wouldn’t rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally”. To which the only possible response is: ahahahahahahahahahahaha. I mean, I wouldn’t rule out opening a $300m action movie, but I guess I’m just a glass-half-full kinda gal. The glass contains liquid LSD.Even Cameron’s more achievable goals appear to be eluding him. He still seems to be in his £25,000 shepherd’s hut, writing this wildly called-for book of his, with the publication date now pushed back again to some unspecified date next year. Perhaps the shepherd’s hut could be towed to some remote snowy location, where a captive Cameron would be forced to write the book readers would like to read as opposed to the one he wants to write. It’s only a vague idea. I think I saw a movie about it once.Either way, Cameron is beginning to feel like the George RR Martin of political memoirists, except without any actual fans. The author on whose novel series Game of Thrones is based has famously delayed and delayed the release of Winds of Winter, the conclusion to his epic, to the point where the TV series has overshot the books and will wrap it all up before the source material gets there itself. Perhaps the same could be done for Cameron. Surely at some point the public can’t wait any longer and a couple of pervy telly producers will have to step in and finish it for Dave, with some post-imperial self-castration and the dehumanising rape of a couple of UK economic regions. Hey – it was consensual by the end.As for layout, it is fashionable for gentlemen scribes to adorn their frontispieces with some quotation from Heraclitus or Bowie or whoever. But it would perhaps be apt if Cameron’s featured only that hilariously clunky and portentous line from Game of Thrones: “When you play the game of thrones, you win or you die. There is no middle ground.” Cue titles, and a little mechanical House of Chipping Norton rising up from a map before getting completely torched by a passing dragon. “When you play the game of thrones, you – oh.”Speaking of bazillion-dollar-an-episode TV dramas, what ghastly news of Dave’s worthy foe, Arron Banks. I am shocked to learn that the motorbike insurer and anti-elitist diamond mine boss who bankrolled the provisional wing of the leave campaign is under criminal investigation. The Electoral Commission this week confirmed it has asked the National Crime Agency to investigate whether one of Banks’ Isle of Man-based companies was the illegal source of £8m in Brexit campaign funding.On the plus side, this feels like a great series two arc for the landmark US TV adaptation of The Bad Boys of Brexit – Arron’s searingly searing account of how some bad boys did a Brexit. It wasn’t so long ago, you may recall, that Arron and the rest of the Nigel Farage entourage – the enFarage, if you will – were claiming to be off to LA to ink a deal with a major studio to adapt this opus for a $10m-an-episode six-part series. This was due to have begun principal photography in early 2018. According to the ’s well-briefed report on the matter: “Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey or Sherlock star Benedict Cumberbatch have been tipped to play Mr Farage.”Another creative project that seems to have had its start date postponed, there. However, I do hope plans are being made to adapt it for the 2019 HMP Frankland panto. Perfectly possible that Spacey could still star. As for the showrunner, perhaps Banks himself might be on hand to take the reins.Or perhaps not. It’s like that old insurance proverb: you come at the GoSkippy king, you best not miss. Naturally, Banks has had something to say on the matter of his elevation to suspect. I usually enjoy Arron’s press statements, which sound like he honked them into a car speakerphone while flooring his Vauxhall Cavalier on the way to a suppliers’ meeting in a BizSpace on the Avon ring road. But this one ends with a poorly punctuated attempt to create a false equivalence with the political donations of … oh dear, “foreign national George Soros”. Well, I wonder what all that can mean.Yet for all of Banks’s artless grotesquery and all Cameron’s artful civility, there is something rather fitting about the pair representing the two sides of the event that sundered the nation – and not simply because either would hate the comparison. They are two chancers, both alike in dignity, with Banks just the Moriarty to Cameron’s Barratt Holmes.Over two years since Cameron ran out on his mess, what strikes you more than anything is his smalltimery. With the obvious exception of the giant, epoch-defining balls-up he made on his own terms, he is almost without other legacy. There is just … nothing much there, with the exception of gay marriage, which you might reasonably have expected an alternative-timeline Labour government to have done anyway. Austerity will always be regarded as a George Osborne-owned project. But listening to the chatter and the chuntering at Tory conference this year, I had to remind myself that Cameron had ever been prime minister. Even in his own party, it is as if the Cameroons never happened.Maybe his book will change all that. Or maybe it will confirm there was even less to him than ultimately met the eye. Maybe he is sitting in his £25,000 wheeled shepherd’s hut right now, wondering about the best “way in” to his own story – still unable to come to terms with the fact that history is only ever going to be able to judge him as another very bad boy of Brexit indeed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/10ad7fe110b72a1daaec49f7a5440cb6dc568bcd/0_33_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1f3839731fcd029167e58591f284c403","title":"david cameron return politics entitlement","story":"The worst prime minister in 200 years has no talent or ability. But he does have a colossal sense of his own entitlementThe British establishment is a gentlemen’s club that offers lifelong membership: once you’re in, you’re in for life, with a vast array of perks thrown in on the house. David Cameron once said he wanted to be prime minister for lofty, high-minded reasons: “Because I think I’d be good at it.” Unfortunately, he ended up the worst prime minister on their own terms since Lord North, who somewhat clumsily lost the American colonies in the 18th century. Having left the country in its greatest turmoil since the war, after two years dossing around upmarket festivals with “his trotters up”, Cameron is now apparently “bored shitless” and fancies being foreign secretary, in much the same way the less entitled might take up learning how to play the guitar to pass the time. If entitlement sprouted legs, arms, and a face prone to turning crimson when provoked, it would be David Cameron.There is one small obstacle in the way of his ambition, the whole throwing Britain off a cliff bit aside, which is that he’s no longer an MP. Like Tony Blair before him, whom Cameron privately described as “the master”, the toppled Tory leader thought he was too big for the House of Commons unless he was top dog. “What? Going off to do tedious trivialities such as helping constituents with their problems and giving them a voice in parliament? Do you know who I am? I’ve played ping-pong with Barack Obama, don’t you know!” It wasn’t always this way: Ted Heath stayed on the backbenches for more than a quarter of a century after he was deposed, even if that was partly just to annoy Margaret Thatcher. Cameron and his sidekick George Osborne pursued an ideologically driven and disastrous austerity project that is the main cause of this nation’s current ills. It choked off the country’s post-crash recovery and caused the biggest squeeze in wages since the Napoleonic wars. The sacred target they set to justify their project – to eliminate the deficit by 2015 – has now been put off until sometime in the 2020s. As my colleague Polly Toynbee gloriously told Osborne to his face on Newsnight this week, their miserable government inflicted misery on benefits claimants while whipping up hatred against them, all while generously slashing taxes for their rich friends, including the bankers who plunged Britain into crisis in the first place.If that wasn’t bad enough, Cameron called the EU referendum as a means to resolve an internal fight within the Tory party. It became a vote, in significant part, on immigration – which is unfortunate given he had himself spent years demonising migrants – as well on the broken status quo that had delivered decline and stagnation for millions of people, in no small part because of Cameron’s own policies.It was always about David Cameron, as he confessed in one revealing Freudian slip during the 2015 election campaign, when he told a rally it was a “career-defining … er, country-defining election”. Men such as him are charlatans whom we would never have even heard of if they hadn’t had all the odds stacked in their favour from conception onwards, and who continue to thrive while millions suffer the consequences of their disastrous political careers. Like Osborne, a man with no journalistic experience casually handed a newspaper to edit, or Nick Clegg, who decided that serving five years as an apologist for a wealthy cabal undermining democracy wasn’t enough, and is resuming that service for Facebook. Or like Tony Blair, who helped set the Middle East alight, and now works as a PR agent for murderous dictators, yet is still feted as a statesman by many in the media. That David Cameron’s entitlement has not been dampened by his calamitous time in office should hardly be a surprise. It is not ability, or talent, or a sense of duty that binds the establishment together: it is entitlement, and little else."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a806d98ddd1250911304fed2b0bc2ae3a75917c0/0_232_5179_3108/master/5179.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=00c8a2c12e50aeea97cc22f6dbc10b07","title":"grimsby unhealthy high street preston","story":"A public health report on Britain’s high streets looks only at the symptoms, when Preston shows how localism goes to the rootDid you ever stare down your high street and think: wow, all these shops.

Hot on its heels in the league table of ill-health is Walsall, then Blackpool. The top 10 also includes Sunderland, Bolton and Bradford. Edinburgh, by contrast, was named the healthiest, followed by Canterbury, with York, Brighton and Cambridge in the top 10.I wonder if you’re also starting to notice a pattern here?

Based on their total scores, the most positive presences on the high street included leisure centres, opticians, libraries and pubs. The most negative ones were payday lenders, betting shops, off-licences and takeaways. The presence of empty shops also led to a deduction of one health point.At a certain level, I suppose there are healthier options than fried chicken, and better ways of investing your money than betting on the horses. But on the other hand: no matter how essential eye tests are, it’s hard to credit the report’s suggestion that opticians are conducive to “mental wellbeing” (opticians are the “endless mattress commercials on podcasts” of the physical world, with their capacity to send you spiralling into a depressive funk).But this isn’t really about shops. The shops are just a symptom. Underlying the report’s findings is a much bigger and more serious public health problem: poverty. “The physical environment surrounds us,” the report proclaims in its opening passages, “and in subtle and not so subtle ways, affects our health.” True enough – but this ambient effect stretches to economic factors as well.If you live a life characterised by constant anxiety about how you’re going to scrape together enough money to pay rent, irregular and inhospitable hours, no time to cook your own food so you have to get something from the takeaway on your way home, no time to socialise so you self-medicate with alcohol from the offy, you will end up – unsurprisingly – living less long, and less well, than an energetic young professional who’s been able to dedicate their life to something they love, or the same person at 50 who’s been able to take early retirement to live off their property portfolio.To give credit where it’s due, the RSPH report does mention the impact of the 2007-08 financial crash on the high street, and recommends things such as the government increasing local authority funding (good luck with that one, lads). But it fails to do anything like enough work to address how economic factors impact on people’s health systematically. And so we end up with the incipient Jamie Oliverism of banning fast-food outlets from opening near schools.It doesn’t have to be this way. Just the other day, a report by PriceWaterhouseCoopers named Preston – once a byword for provincial crappiness – as the UK’s “most-improved” urban area. In recent years Preston’s unemployment rate has halved, while the city has also experienced “improvements above the national average for health, transport, the work-life balance of its residents, and for the skills among both the youth and adult populations”. Its secret? A form of radical localism, which has helped inspire John McDonnell’s “alternative models of ownership” report. Notably, Preston has committed to spending money on goods and services from Preston-based firms, as opposed to relying (as many councils do) on outsourcing firms based in London.And so Preston has tackled problems including public health at their root, by understanding that they are inextricably bound up with the local economy. But of course, implementing these changes also involves vision, will, a certain sort of civic pride. “Investment” doesn’t just mean getting money in, Preston council leader Matthew Brown suggests – it means enabling local people to be actively involved. In this context, one wonders if a report such as the RSPH’s might even have a negative effect.By failing to understand the extent to which public health intersects with economic factors, the RSPH report compounds an existing stereotype that places such as Grimsby and Blackpool are just dead-end dumps, places to struggle to get out of rather than work to invest in. The lesson of Preston is that if we want to make the UK’s provincial towns and cities worth living in, then this – not the prevalence of chip shops – is what needs to change.• Tom Whyman is an academic philosopher and freelance writer"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51ea5eb73ec1ba6a1f6140e3d502c7a50c4379f2/12_0_3475_2086/master/3475.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61d76cb45b55d9d70b3dfd178afdc946","title":"poor swimming pool uk class divide housing rich residents","story":"Housing developments where only rich residents can use certain facilities are emblematic of a much bigger problemDifferent doors. Different schools. Same housing block. London and other big cities struggling to fight gentrification are becoming increasingly segregated at a very micro level. This type of cheek-by-jowl social segregation is giving birth to new and old forms of class antagonism.There have been complaints about so-called “poor doors”. In London, this included protests outside 1 Commercial Street, where luxury apartments went for £3-4m and the rich entered via a concierge at the front while affordable-rent tenants walked down a rubbish-filled dark alley at the back. People – no matter their class status – have feelings, and when you have to enter a building by a route visibly worse than that used by richer residents it can affect your sense of self. When society says you are unworthy, you begin to feel unworthy too.Of course it’s not just private developers – it’s schools too. A report from The Challenge warned that schools are becoming increasingly segregated by class, with one-third of primary and one-quarter of secondary schools segregated along socio-economic lines. Class segregation is being bred in the classroom. We probably shouldn’t be surprised by this institutionalised class stratification. While the Tories like to tell us that income inequality has declined, the UK has a very visible, and growing, gap. Homelessness is now impossible to ignore and while median incomes have fallen in real terms in the past decade, the wealth of the richest 1,000 iniduals has more than doubled. What’s more, the economy is producing more jobs at either extreme, while middle-earning jobs are dwindling. The end result is a growing ide between the haves and have-nots and all the baggage that comes with that.The chancellor Philip Hammond’s use of the word “strivers” during his budget speech is a reminder of how income and wealth differences have been justified in our national psyche in recent years. Those without money are “skivers” – they’ve been lazy. Alternatively, you’re a “striver” – someone working hard to get ahead. Never mind that the biggest determinants of “success” in life remain the wealth of your parents and the place of your birth.Some years ago while interviewing both rich and poor residents of Islington, I was shocked by the levels of distrust and bitterness that went both ways – poorer residents complained about being looked down upon, while richer residents spoke about their fear of walking past housing estates at night. These problems have real consequences. And of course, you cannot think about class and housing without mentioning the horrific fire at Grenfell Tower where many, including surviving residents, believe class prejudice played into officials not listening or acting on concerns about safety.What’s the alternative? Tell developers they don’t have to build any affordable housing? Build separate blocks for those who can’t afford the market price? Most of us would agree that we don’t want to live in a Paris-style “doughnut” where the poor are pushed to the outskirts of the city: that’s why Sadiq Khan and local authorities insist that a certain percentage of flats in new developments be affordable. However, mixed communities don’t sit well in an environment that tells you that people on lower incomes are lazy and stupid.George Orwell once wrote: “Your snobbishness, unless you persistently root it out like the bindweed it is, sticks by you until the grave.” We need to change more than just our house prices we need to change our attitudes.• Faiza Shaheen is the director of the Centre for Labour and Social Studies and Labour PPC for Chingford \u0026amp Woodford Green• This article was amended on 2 November 2018 to remove reference to use of a swimming pool at Royal Wharf in Newham, London, which the developers say is open to all residents"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5308944a43448e6f525b3c4eaf0c111ed691f21/0_20_2480_1487/master/2480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dce64fcf4a377b1a20a5303894fdf5d1","title":"university bankrupt inevitable market forces","story":"Demand is down, supply is up – something had to give and now universities are on the brink. It’s all so avoidableThe decade-long experiment in turning universities into market-driven businesses whose success depends, like a cut-price airline’s, on student bums on lecture seats, looks likely to claim its first casualties.This will come as no surprise to anyone in the sector. It shouldn’t even surprise ministers, but it should be a nasty shock for them. The system of 18+ education that has emerged since 2010 is turning into a national catastrophe.True, it has expanded the number of 18-year-olds going to university. But the number of graduates in non-graduate work has also risen. The half of school leavers who don’t go to university have been left behind like baggage lost in the handling bay. Employers cannot fill jobs that need engineering or technical skills. And a great burden of student debt is growing behind a wall of trickery (a “pyramid of fiscal illusions”, as one report called it), which will land heavily on the shoulders of future generations.No one was persuaded that removing the student cap after 2012 and ramping up tuition fees would be a triumph for market fundamentalism, not least because market theory assumes perfect information of the kind rare among school leavers. There are also factors that no amount of genius can influence, like – to take a random, yet significant input – demography. Fewer babies were born in 2000 than in previous years, and fewer still in 2001 and 2002. So the number of school leavers is down this year, and it will go lower before it starts to pick up from 2021.Some universities – the once-troubled London Met is one example – have responded by recruiting more mature students, but the prospect of accruing thousands of pounds of debt only grows less appealing with age. It’s no surprise that there has been a surge in universities trying to tempt the best students with low grade demands or even unconditional offers of places.At the same time, Theresa May’s hostile environment has, just as it was meant to, made Britain a less appealing place for foreign students. The refusal to grant short-stay work visas for graduating students is another disincentive. Universities UK claims that if the numbers of students from abroad had continued to grow at the same rate as in Australia or Canada, the British economy would be £8bn stronger. Meanwhile, there are more universities than ever. Demand is down, supply is up. Something has to give.Ministers have always acknowledged that any market needs what the former universities minister Jo Johnson once called “scope for market exit”. It sounds so painless. But wherever failure falls, Cumbria or Solent or somewhere in between, it will be a brutal experience. In the knowledge economy, universities bring jobs, investment, energy and purpose into the local economy. Consider Northampton, where the county council is effectively bankrupt and where hopes are pinned on its expanding university. While no one is naming the institutions that are at risk of bankruptcy – rightly, for there are probably a score of candidates, and to name them would be to condemn them – the odds are stacked against the smaller, more local institutions in economically stressed English towns and cities.The old Higher Education Funding Council, Hefce, had powers to strong-arm mergers between vulnerable institutions. The new Office for Students has a student protection package in place, but that will be small comfort for those who’ve just started at a university that might have to shut down before they get to the end of their course, and it will do no good at all to the community that has invested so much in what is, after all, their public institution.In February, Theresa May – urgently seeking an answer to Labour’s astute but flawed offer of abolishing tuition fees – announced a review of all 18-plus education.Here’s what the future should look like: every school leaver should have access to a lifelong education and training bursary which could be used for anything from part-time vocational training to full-time degree-level studies, at institutions validated on the strength of their academic offer, not just on their students’ prejudices. The bursary could be made more progressive by adding means-tested maintenance grants, and students could be given incentives to choose shortage subjects, such as nursing or teaching.Britain’s higher education system is not a research project into the limits of the market. It is a source of world-leading research and also of urgently needed skilled workers and technicians. At every level, from the members of the global elite, the Imperials, Cambridges and Oxfords, to Lincoln’s groundbreaking co-operation with Siemens and Hereford’s embryonic New Model in Technology \u0026amp Engineering, these are places of innovation as well as education, a precious well of community empowerment and opportunity. They have a public value that goes far beyond the number of students they can recruit. And that is what should be at the heart of the government’s review.• Anne Perkins is a former deputy political editor of the "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/51d0bf3bc8841959ddced4e1cd19b30eaadfa1dc/325_426_3081_1849/master/3081.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=587a17fed0a2562b37df07bb0fa25c46","title":"meet the ebay doers 15 budding businesses ready to go big","story":"Chosen from hundreds of inventive, intelligent entries, these 15 emerging startups are on their way to bigger and better things – eBay and the  Labs have teamed up to help take them thereWe had a theory: that everyone’s got a brilliant business idea in them. We tested it out, asking you to tell us yours. And we were right a barrage of budding or would-be businesses came in. Inventions inspired and outlandish. Things of beauty and utility. Problems solved, gaps filled, and a whole host of things we didn’t know we wanted, but do now.Hundreds of ingenious ideas from imaginative, interested people. And a few that may not make it out of the pub – but not many.We whittled those down, putting the favourites in front of our judging panel – Dragons’ Den entrepreneur Touker Suleyman, eBay’s Kirsty Keoghan, and the ’s Hamish Nicklin – who together chose 15 people, or pairs, with the strongest ideas, plus the passion and commitment to take them forwards. These 15 became the eBay Doers – joining our 10-week incubator aimed at helping people grow those bright ideas into burgeoning businesses with workshops, funding and expert mentorship from entrepreneurs. Say hello to …Johanne-Marie Bonsu – Eden \u0026amp Jo (plant-based face masks)Bonsu’s beauty range has been three years in the making. “I’d been beauty blogging for a while and readers would always ask me if I sold products,” she says. “I took a while creating different blends – all plant-based and handmade,” she says. After launching this summer, Bonsu wants to use eBay’s help on her marketing strategy. “I’d love to get to the stage where Eden \u0026amp Jo is a really trusted brand.”Mentor Ade HassanHellen Stirling-Baker – Small Stuff UK (ethical wooden toys)Stirling-Baker has big plans for Small Stuff. Having started out selling handmade clothes, she now plans to launch wooden toys with a meaningful legacy. “The wood is from a sustainable forest in Scotland. Each toy comes with a certificate of origin.” After taking time out due to postnatal depression, she is looking forward to getting her new toys on eBay. “I want to create products that make people say: ‘I love the ethos behind that brand.’ And it’d be great to hear my little boy say: ‘My Mum did that.’”Mentors Adam and Sinead MurphyCatalina Hoyos Loarer and Ildut Loarer – Pap Yay (paper puzzle block toy)A play on “papier”, Pap Yay was born out of a shared love of design and a desire to find an alternative to the plastic tat touted to new parents. “We wanted to create a beautiful product parents didn’t have to hide,” France-born Loarer explains. “That also leaves space for the imagination, challenging children of different ages.” Boosting their savings with a Kickstarter campaign, the couple currently work out of their Hackney flat. They look forward to seeing how the doers scheme will help them manage big orders. “It’s been an amazing experience so far,” says Loarer. Mentors Adam and Sinead Murphy.Catherine Riney – Our World Travel Logs (printed travel logs and notebooks)After 20 years in business management, Riney decided to act on her idea last year. “I’ve lived in three different countries and I do feel like a citizen of the world,” she says. Aimed at helping travellers engage with their journeys and destinations, Riney hopes her sustainable travel logs will help people think about their impact on the world. “I’m starting a campaign #WeHaveNoticed about positive things people have done around sustainability. I believe everyone can make a difference, however small.”Mentor Cathy McCartyColin Sinclair – Snail Offence (snail-repelling copper fences)“We tried everything, from radiator brush bristles to cat fur,” says Sinclair of his quest to stop slugs and snails decimating his plants, without killing them. “They’re like little ninjas.” After trialling several prototypes, including a windmill that lifted the culprits away, Sinclair came up with the copper fence – an attractive, ingenious alternative. He hopes the scheme can help them reach a wider audience. “Now it’s about building the brand.” Mentor Cathy McCartyAmy Paris and Laura Carr – The London Sleep Company (sleep cosmetics and journal)Working in a high-pressured law firm, Paris struggled with her sleep, and would concoct cosmetic blends to help. Testing them out on colleagues, The London Sleep Company was born. Two years of research later, Paris and her fiancee Carr are ready to launch a range. When it comes to a five-year plan, the pair are dreaming big. “We want to be a one-stop sleep shop,” says Paris. “We’d like to add bed linen, and be sold in any sector where sleep is important. To have a mentor’s input to help us will be invaluable.”Mentors Clare Haines and Melissa BurtonMichele Duplessis and Shannon Teague – Pop ’n Sprinkle (sprinkle-on popcorn flavours)The motivation for Duplessis’ and Teague’s business is simple: “We’re obsessed with popcorn.” Moving to London from South Africa, the friends were confused to find just two flavours on offer at the cinema. “In South Africa, you have at least five sprinkle-on flavours,” says Duplessis. Spotting an opportunity, they worked with a manufacturer to develop six flavours, which they’ve been selling online. The next challenge is to build brand awareness and take Pop ’n Sprinkle into the retail market.Mentors Claire Haines and Melissa BurtonEd Spurr – Acorn vases (green gifts)Allowing customers to grow elegant living oak trees from acorns at home, art dealer Spurr’s self-designed glass vases stem from a combined love of beautiful things and nature. First conceived as gifts for his artists, Spurr feels the vases will have wide appeal. “They’ll be interesting to design enthusiasts, tree lovers, botanists, horticulturists and also families with children,” he says. “I think it’s wonderful that from this piece of wood you can grow a tree that’ll become 500 years old.” With the support of eBay he wants to spread his message worldwide. “I’d love people to use social media to share the beautiful trees they’ve grown and start a conversation, one country to another.”Mentor Joanna DaiCatherine White – Sweet Chestnut Designs (Celtic‑inspired head jewellery)After working in the City and a stint as a truck driver, White longed for a more creative job. Studying silversmithing at Glasgow School of Art, she’d already had success selling “sparkly tiaras” but wanted to try something new. She came up with a Celtic bridal circlet, which a friend convinced her to put on eBay. “It sold straightaway,” says White. “That was 2012, and they haven’t stopped selling.” White is now looking for support with packaging and shipping. “I’d like to expand more into America,” she says.Mentor Joanna DaiLindsey Fairbairn – Ledro Design (inidually designed decals)Teaching assistant Fairbairn started her wall sticker business from her home in Chichester. “I was looking for something creative,” she says. “My degree is in design, and I love to craft things, so I came naturally to the idea.” Often personalised, her vinyl illustrations were an instant hit online. She hopes the scheme will help her find the support to scale the business. “I want to employ someone to manage the customer side of it, so I can concentrate on creating more products that’s where my passion lies.”Mentor Gabi CoxLuke Damian-Grint – Bone Shades (Bone-conducting smart sunglasses)Damian-Grint’s innovative glasses use Bluetooth technology to link your phone to a bone-conducting speaker, so users can take calls and use voice-command via vibrations through their skulls to the inner ear. Some similar products are sold in the US, but Bone Shades are unusual in that they run on Google systems, so the tech is always updating. Damian-Grint has started taking pre-orders and, with the scheme’s support, he eventually wants to expand into other products. “I’d like to build it into a technology fashion brand sold in major retailers globally.”Mentor Walter GleesonEmma Orr – Ambassadors of Science (slime kits and science experiments)Looking for a new way to engage her students, Orr decided to shake up her lessons. “I started running science workshops,” she says, “and created a slime kit.” These proved so popular she took the kits online, developing equipment for basic science experiments. Now, Orr has given up her teaching job to pursue her passion full-time. “All my time is spent on this,” she says. Orr hopes the scheme will help her expand as she develops a Halloween box and preps for the Christmas slime rush.Mentor Walter GleesonSimon Basil – Built by Basil (artisan gear knobs from recycled skateboards)Car gear knobs made from old skateboards might not sound like an obvious idea, but it’s certainly a popular one. A fan of Reddit, Basil shared a video of himself making the accessory on the site and, to his shock, it gained more than 400,000 views in a matter of hours. The orders soon started rolling in. “I sell to people who like customising their cars, which is a massive market,” says the former engineer from Lymington, but he’d love some support. “You can’t beat speaking to someone face to face and fleshing out a problem.”Mentors Mo Bro’sDavid Long – Babouche Golf (handmade personalised golf head covers)A trip to Marrakech inspired Long to create his range of golfing accessories. After commissioning a leather maker in the souks to produce a cover for him, he brought it back to his home course. “Everyone loved that it was nothing like the branded covers on the market,” he says. He now stocks 22 styles and sees eBay as the ideal platform for scaling up. “The scheme has given me the impetus to give this everything, because it’s not a side hustle, it’s my future.”Mentors Mo Bro’sEach of our Doers has been paired with an expert entrepreneur to offer advice and guide them through the scheme.Millions of people are using eBay to start a side hustle, make more of a hobby or carve out a career.

Artist and designer Yinka Ilori goes in search of galleries, boutiques and hip hangoutsAmsterdam’s always been one of these places friends keep telling me is amazing, while I’ve just nodded and gone: “Yeah, I’ll go there someday.” So it was about time I did. Getting there by Eurostar, without the faff of going to the airport, taking off your jacket and dealing with security makes all the difference. I constantly get inspired by things when I go away, and I’m always bringing back loads of stuff, from trainers to magazines, food and drink, so I love not being hampered by airlines’ weight restrictions. This time, though, I didn’t actually buy that much – I was too busy checking out some incredible places. Here’s my pick of where to go.Be a culture vultureI love photography, and so, it seems, does Amsterdam there are certainly plenty of places that focus on it. Don’t miss Foam, on Keizersgracht. It’s only a small gallery, but it has an impressive collection of work, built up since its opening in 2002, including images by international photographers such as Noémie Goudal, American artist Daniel Gordon, Dutch photographer Viviane Sassen and – a favourite of mine – Brit Juno Calypso. There’s such a good mix of work: black and white, colour, different themes and formats.You almost don’t need to go inside modern art museum Stedelijk its newest wing, unveiled in 2012, looks like a sculpture in itself (or a bathtub, according to some locals). It’s an impressively big, white structure that contrasts with the original, 19th-century building it’s attached to. Venture inside and you’ll find art, design and photography from a lot of people I admire, including Keith Haring, and Arthur Jafa, who’s worked on videos for Jay-Z and Beyonce.Art in the red light district? It exists W139 is an artist-run space on Warmoesstraat. Back when it launched in 1979, you could find anything from painting to spoken-word performances or punk rock, and it’s still got a fairly anarchic vibe today.Wine and dine, Amsterdam styleAmsterdam’s foodie scene isn’t only about great meals there are some awesome interiors too. I really appreciate good bar and restaurant design – it creates an atmosphere of its own, and none more so than at Café-Restaurant de Plantage, a gorgeous greenhouse-like structure in the middle of the city’s beautiful botanic gardens I could see flamingos strutting around outside from my table. The food’s mainly Mediterranean – think handmade ravioli stuffed with fennel sausage, or Spanish fish soup. It’s rightly jammed, and the service is fab and friendly, without being fawning.For a similar feel, try the jade-green-hued Bar Botanique, in the Eastern Docklands, which is hung with plants and bamboo trees, and serves a mighty fine negroni. The Kanarie Club on Bellamyplein is an old tram depot – you can still see tram tracks on the floor – and its vast, industrial space is softened with ropes of lights, and vibrantly painted steel beams. Upstairs, by the bar, is an empty swimming pool, which is a bit bonkers. But I found the way they’ve used the space inspirational it used to be derelict, and home to squatters – but the way they’ve given it a new lease of life echoes what I do, upcycling furniture. Also, they do the best burger I’ve ever had.I was really taken with the ethos of A Beautiful Mess, located a little outside the centre in a former prison. All the food is made by refugees from places such as Afghanistan, Somalia and Syria, and the experience they gain in the kitchen here paves the way to viable careers in hospitality. You’ll get everything from Lebanese flatbreads to chapatis and curry. Also, the interiors are very colourful – which always earns extra points from me.Round off your night with a visit to Hiding in Plain Sight (if you can find it). It’s undercover, like a speakeasy, with a louche feel. The barmen are great, and it feels like a locals’ place a really secret address.Explore new neighbourhoodsYou could spend a whole morning or afternoon checking out the NDSM district, reached by a ferry from near the train station. Formerly home to Amsterdam’s shipyards, it’s been transformed into a buzzing cultural hotspot with bars, cafes and pop-up shops. The IJ-Kantine bar and restaurant is located in the building that once housed the shipyard offices and workers’ canteen, and PLLEK, another hangout on the waterfront, is made out of shipping containers.There’s even a hotel in a crane the Faralda Crane Hotel has three plush suites inside, and you can bungee jump off it, too (I didn’t). This district is one of those places where you can just wander around for ages soaking up the atmosphere, gazing at the street art, having a beer and people-watching for hours. It’s no surprise that festivals and outdoor performances are regularly held here, and once a month there’s a massive flea market.Back over the water, I loved cycling round the charming neighbourhood of Jordaan, to the north-west of the city centre. It’s got a lot of history, including the Anne Frank Museum, and all the culture, food and shopping you could want. Lose yourself in the Nine Streets, a little network of passageways between the canals, crammed with independent homeware, fashion and interiors boutiques, but don’t leave without making a pilgrimage to Winkel 43. Why? Quite simply, it does the best apple pie you’ll ever eat. I had one slice there, and bought another to take home, it was that good.On my return Eurostar to London, I make the most of the journey. Getting inspiration down on paper while it’s fresh is important for my work, so, wherever I go, I’m always drawing and working. When you travel by plane, the lack of space can make that quite stressful, so being able to plug my phone and laptop in – with enough room to work properly – really was the icing on the cake – or perhaps the sugar on the Oliebollen, if we’re being Dutch about it.Getting thereEurostar has a twice-daily direct service from London St Pancras to Rotterdam and Amsterdam Centraal, with prices starting from £35 one way. On the return journey, passengers will need to take a Thalys train from Rotterdam or Amsterdam to Brussels-Midi for security checks, before boarding the Eurostar to London.

You wore them to parties, for nights when you were not just out but out-out, but they were decidedly NSFW. Now that you can wear jeans to parties and trainers to fancy restaurants, those kind of rules don’t really apply. I’m not suggesting a sequined skirt is a 16-hour desk-to-dinner look, but it could definitely do a Saturday lunch – possibly even brunch, although be prepared to drink mimosas. (That is totally going to happen in this skirt, so you may as well face facts.)This is a shop-your-wardrobe opportunity, because you can wear the same sequins for the daylight hours as you used to wear for after dark – you just wear them in a different way. The skirt I am wearing here is one of mine that used to be a dress, a long time ago. It was a simple, stretchy, short-ish dress with spaghetti straps that I used to wear out-out with ankle-strap sandals and a denim jacket. I stopped wearing it like that a while ago. I’ve little truck with rigid rules about what’s age appropriate, but I don’t think clinging determinedly to a look that represents who you were a decade ago is all that healthy. You and your wardrobe can evolve and mature without going full pelt into elasticated-waistband loungewear.Anyway, I knew I would never wear that dress again, but just as I was warming up the Marie Kondo pep-talk-to-self, I realised this too-short dress was a perfect length for a skirt. So I took it to my lovely dry cleaner and he cut the top few inches off (along with the label, so I have no idea any more where I bought it from) and, voilà, a perfect new cocktail-length skirt that came ready-infused with good vibes and cost a fiver.Are your perfect daytime sequins hiding in the party-clothes bit of your wardrobe? You don’t need to chop down a dress for it to function as a skirt: if the length works, just wear a sweater or a velvet T-shirt over the top. Clothes for going out-out don’t tend to get worn as often as you’d like, what with cocktail funds not earning themselves and having to get up in the morning. So if a sequined skirt can pair up with a chunky knit and ankle boots for a weekend lunch, or a sequined vest can slip under a ribbed cardigan to jazz up the jeans you are wearing to go shopping – that’s a win-win. Look on the bright side of winter: after-dark dressing now starts at teatime. Add a cosy knit and chunky shoes, and let the good times roll, early. Styling: Melanie Wilkinson.

But will it halt harassment on set?Introducing the recent series opener of India’s top-rated talk show, Koffee With Karan, the director-producer-personality Karan Johar championed Bollywood’s new-found “girl power”: 12 months of successes – such as the taut spy thriller Raazi and the raucous bridal comedy Veere di Wedding – that were led and authored by women. His guests, accordingly, were distaff royalty: reigning queen Deepika Padukone, newly radiant after surviving January’s trial-by-fire film Padmaavat, and beaming princess Alia Bhatt, Raazi’s immensely talented young lead. Reclined on Johar’s Nortonesque couch, Bhatt was offered a cuddly Sophie’s choice between her much-Instagrammed cats and beau Ranbir Kapoor Padukone raised a suggestive eyebrow after asked what she first notices in a man.If the show’s peppy tone was enjoyable, it felt strangely removed from the grim claims emerging on social media from women occupying the film industry’s lower ranks. India’s #MeToo movement – initiated in early October and gathering rapid pace online – cast a looming shadow over this week’s Jio MAMI Mumbai film festival, the event’s 20th. As creative director Smriti Kiran told me at the festival’s bustling Juhu hub: “#MeToo started to escalate two weeks before the festival, and we are one of India’s leading festivals, so everybody was looking at us. They wanted us to take responsibility. We wanted to take responsibility.”Sleeves were duly rolled up, red lines established. Two features and three shorts were struck from the programme after allegations were levelled against key creative personnel another feature, the critically admired Balekempa, was withdrawn by producers following an anonymous Facebook post that accused writer-director Ere Gowda of sexual assault. At last Thursday’s opening ceremony, set against the majesty of old Bombay’s towering Gateway to India, festival director Anupama Chopra apologised to “all the people we have disappointed” while hoping “that the decision we took, to stand with the women who have raised their voices, will lead to an environment that is constructive, inclusive and just”.Furthermore, the change in the schedule provided room for a run of female-driven films highlighting the renewed ersity and strength in non-mainstream Indian cinema. Leena Yadav’s Netflix-bound feature Rajma Chawal addressed a recognisable father-son generation gap Priya Ramasubban won hearts with Chuskit, featuring a young paraplegic adapting her wheelchair to her Himalayan home. And emergent Assamese talent Rima Das, whose Village Rockstars is India’s submission for next year’s foreign film Oscar, made two big splashes: first by toppling into a rooftop pool during the opening night party, then with her latest, Bulbul Can Sing, a hard-hitting take on shaming culture.For Kiran, the selection speaks to new ways of thinking: “We used to be a nation that only produced films about big ideas – poverty, dissent – and the focus would seldom be on the inidual, because it was always on the collective. As an Indian, I feel we place so much emphasis on the family unit that the inidual gets shafted, and it’s important to nurture the inidual if you want society to benefit.” Wider exposure to international cinema, rarely screened even in cosmopolitan Mumbai, may have played its part. Roughly 100 festivalgoers queued for five hours to see Palme d’Or-winner Shoplifters the prize for hardiness, though, surely goes to the fellow who queued for 10 hours for the dubious pleasure of experiencing Gaspar Noé’s Climax.Discussion remains to be had about the winds suddenly freshening India’s once-patrician film culture. The campaigning Delhi critic Anna MM Vetticad published a piece for the Quint warning of what might need addressing for greater parity – not least the whispered allegations about predations by several revered luminaries. Even Kiran admits #MeToo snuck up on her predominantly female team: “The movement started in the west way before ours did, and we didn’t think ours would start so soon. We thought it would take 20 more years. So when you think it’s going to take that long, you can imagine how far behind we must be.”The festival closes on 1 November with Steve McQueen’s Widows: more strong women, doing what has traditionally been a man’s job. Beyond that, confesses Kiran, a much-needed holiday beckons. Then, however, the work resumes: “We’re fighting for basic things: respect don’t pounce on me don’t ogle, it’s rude … The narrative around feminism, and wanting things, is to our extreme disadvantage. People turn around and say you hate men. I’m like, ‘No. Why? What is wrong with you?’ So I think, first things first, we need to get the basics right. Forget about big things happening. We’re not starting from ground zero. We’re six feet under. So let’s get to ground zero.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2198d67ca477dd1bbd01c22f9a8f28945f7f5529/0_8_5412_3247/master/5412.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2b627aaabadec6ddf83e3de98e0b1ebb","title":"chelsea matthew harding michael duberry leicester","story":"The helicopter crash in Leicester has sad parallels with the death of Chelsea’s vice-chairman Matthew Harding in 1996From a professional career that ned two decades and hundreds of matches, it is understandable that Michael Duberry can instantly recall only a handful. When the former centre-half is asked to place himself back in the afternoon of 26 October 1996, he can do so immediately. “I was man of the match that day and still have the glass decanter in my house when I see it I know exactly what game that was from,” Duberry says. “I actually watched an old VHS of it not long ago after my mum found it when clearing out a loft. It was a game we just wanted to win that little bit more than usual.”In circumstances not dissimilar to what Leicester City will encounter at Cardiff on Saturday, Duberry and his Chelsea teammates hosted Tottenham Hotspur with tragedy as a backdrop. Four days earlier Matthew Harding, Chelsea’s colourful vice-chairman, was killed in a helicopter crash when returning from a League Cup tie in Bolton. Harding’s man of the people reputation despite huge wealth, which seemed to be enhanced during a high-profile dispute with Ken Bates, meant supporters were heavily affected by his death. Harding was accustomed to joining them, rather than directors, for matches.“It was obviously a massive shock at the time,” Duberry says. “I was just a young lad in the team so I didn’t know Matthew as well as some of the senior players – Dennis Wise, Steve Clarke, these guys would have been in talks with him behind the scenes regularly – but I still knew him to speak to. We all did. He was always around the place, he was so popular. Money was no object yet he was seen as one of the fans probably equivalent to Roman Abramovich sitting in the Shed End nowadays. So Matthew’s death sent a shock and disbelief through the whole club.”Harding’s financial support had been crucial to Chelsea’s revived fortunes. Duberry is unsure whether there was ever a realistic chance of the Spurs fixture being postponed – such discussions were the domain of Wise and company – but is candid about the difficulties of wrestling professional responsibility and heartbreak. Chelsea’s players were perfectly aware that victory over a rival would carry added significance, even if the notion of somehow offsetting Harding’s loss was fanciful.“The buildup to the game was strange, eerie,” Duberry says. “I was a young player so going out and doing my job well was important. I’m a north London boy so playing Spurs was also always important to me. I had to try and stay focused but you couldn’t ignore what was going on. At that time, we would be reading all about it in newspapers lying about the training ground but the Leicester players have to live through what happened with social media, which will be even more difficult. They have more eye witness accounts, videos, audio clips to deal with.“Whereas we knew Matthew from the club, the more you read you realised about the person, about his life away from football. That seemed to make things feel even more sad, the more you read and heard about the man beyond Chelsea.”Ruud Gullit, David Lee and Roberto Di Matteo would score the goals to see off Spurs at Stamford Bridge. Raw emotion, Duberry believes, played a key part in Chelsea’s success. The team would claim the FA Cup at the conclusion of season 1996-97, with a stand at the West London venue now bearing Harding’s name.“The minute’s silence felt like forever,” Duberry says. “You just wanted the game to start by that point I think football was an escape. It was also something to unite so many people. I remember how respectful everyone from Spurs was as well.“I’d had minute’s silences before but when it’s for someone born in 1927 versus someone you know, it’s very different. That was my first time with a black armband for someone I knew, someone I spoke with, and that was a weird feeling.“There was no way Spurs were going to win that game. So many people were willing you to win, you felt that with every run, every tackle. Everyone loved that guy, his death pulled so many people together and brought love out.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d71136a2ba821c99bd0efe22efb83249c2ec2c5c/100_68_2512_1507/master/2512.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=222b04636886516ed4d29a236fb7b841","title":"neil lennon sectarianism racism hibernian scotland","story":"Neil Lennon has said Scotland has a major problem with anti-Irish racism as he rebuffed claims that he incited the latest attack against him. The Hibernian head coach backed his agent, Martin Reilly, who claimed Lennon was routinely targeted for abuse because he was an Irish Catholic who had played for Celtic.Lennon was among several participants assaulted during Wednesday’s Edinburgh derby and was angered by claims – including one from his former teammate Gary Caldwell – that he had partly brought in on himself by signalling to Hearts fans to calm down following a disallowed goal. The former Northern Ireland international has previously been attacked at Tynecastle and suffered a number of other crimes in Scotland, including being knocked unconscious in the street and being the recipient of a parcel bomb. The message “hang Neil Lennon” was daubed on a wall near Tynecastle on Wednesday.“You call it sectarianism here in Scotland, I call it racism,” he said. “If a black man is abused, you are not just abusing the colour of his skin, you are abusing his culture, his heritage, his background. It’s the exact same when I get called a Fenian, a pauper, a beggar, a tarrier. These people with the sense of entitlement or superiority complex. And all I do is stand up for myself.“I’ve been subjected to this for 18 years. I’m 47, I’m fed up of it. I’m the manager of Hibs now and I’m still getting it. Hanging people is something the Ku Klux Klan did in the 60s to black people, so maybe that’s the mentality of the people who write this stuff. There’s a problem. It’s a big problem.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8b665c576cf261ed4c3b34e91440277b52d75cdc/695_0_1314_788/master/1314.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=933347acdf4db02b6573560bf1a6fe31","title":"the fiver arsenal liverpool premier league","story":"Sign up now! Sign up now! Sign up now? Sign up now!Are Arsenal actually any good? It remains one of this Premier League season’s great imponderables, but we may find out when they host Liverpool on Saturday. Unbeaten in 13 games across all competitions, notching up a run of 11 consecutive wins along the way, their fans have every reason to be upbeat. So who better than their former hero-turned-pundit, Paul Merson, to subject their chances to a chilling ice-bucket challenge. “I can’t see anything but a Liverpool win,” he Lawroed. “I think this is the day Arsenal show some big cracks. I just think the defence is terrible, all over the place and no different to what it was before.” Don’t hold back, Merse. Tell us what you really think.While it has long been on the record that Merson is a man whose borderline heroic lack of success in the field of predicting the outcome of various sporting events has cost him several million pounds, it behoves The Fiver to say that using this as a stick with which to thrash his informed opinion is as unreasonable as saying Gary Neville’s punditry is worthless just because his coaching record with Valencia suggests he couldn’t train mice to eat cheese. Despite their excellent recent record, the jury remains very much out on Arsenal, but the consensus seems to be that some sort of definitive verdict will be reached by the final whistle at the Emirates.While the Gooners have often looked delightful going forward, Merson undeniably has a point when he says they’re shakier at the back than an 80s Welsh Elvis tribute act singing about This Old House. They have conceded 13 goals in the league so far this season, just one fewer than the three teams above them combined. Small wonder, then, that so much has been made of the delightful prospect of possible red-cards-in-waiting Granit Xhaka and Stephan Lichtsteiner being contorted into knots by Mo Salah and Sadio Mané. It’s easy to understand why their pessimistic former star can see them conceding several more.For all that, Arsenal boss Unai Emery has the wood over Jürgen Klopp, having masterminded victory over the German’s sides every single time they’ve faced off in opposing technical areas. On one occasion you may remember, Sevilla came from behind to beat Liverpool in no less a contest than the final of Big Vase. “Unai Emery, all people in football know how good he is,” said Klopp of his opposite number. “Not all Arsenal fans were over the moon in the first moment but that’s England a little bit, you want the poster boys.” While it has been quite some time since Arsenal fans have been over the moon, The Fiver suspects they’ll see victory – however unlikely Merson thinks it – not so much as one small step for their team but a giant leap for all of Arsenal-kind.“I saw U2 in Vilar de Mouros in 1982 and I saw The Cure there too. Lloyd Cole and the Commotions also did a very good concert. But there is more. I remember Simple Minds, Echo and the Bunnymen, Nina Hagen, Elvis Costello and Duran Duran.

But we haven’t won now in this season so far, and it’s now the next opportunity, a big opportunity for us, against Fulham - a team which I absolutely respect. I’ve seen them yesterday live, I was at City. For sure we have to be at our best. But I think it makes it even more important that we are focused on us, and we know our strength, we know with the support from the stands we can do this extra yard which is unbelievably important for our game, and this is the moment where we would like to turn it around. And with one win, as we all know, everything can look a little bit different. Another match preview for you. Enjoy!Here’s a story on the latest plot twist in Nicklas Bendtner’s one-man soap opera:“What’s a monthly ethics bonus, why do players get it and what do they get it for?” wonders Andrew Benton, having read (see below) that Marco Verratti is to forfeit some of his.I imagine that players got tired of being fined their actual wages for their occasional misdemeanours, so someone had the cunning idea of giving them extra money for not committing misdemeanours, so when they are fined they are not losing money they have earned, which they dislike, but not getting money they haven’t, which feels a bit better. I could be wrong, mind, and normally am.“Is it me or do Jürgen Klopp’s Steinway keyboard gnashers get pearlier each week?” wonders William Hargreaves. “He’s getting like that Kenny Everett Bee Gees sketch.”Crikey, this sketch hasn’t aged very well. Here it is, though:Here’s Watford’s Javi Gracia on Newcastle and their manager, Rafael Benitez:I know him from a long time ago. He trained my hometown team Osasuna. He is a coach with a lot of recognition in England and Spain. Everybody knows he is a great coach. He always shows it at all the teams he has been.They are a good team, they have a very good coach. Newcastle are looking for their first win, they are working very hard to try to get it and we need to be ready for a difficult game, for a tough game. All the games they are playing, they are playing with the option to get a better result. I am sure in the next game they will try again. This just in from Reuters:The Paris St Germain midfielder Marco Verratti has been fined by his club after being stopped for drink-driving by police in France. PSG said in a statement on Friday that Verratti had been stopped at a roadside check in Paris in the early hours of Wednesday morning and was found to have a blood alcohol level above the legal limit. French newspaper L’Equipe reported that the 25-year-old Italy international was detained by police who placed him in a “sobering cell” before releasing him. The report added that he would be charged at a later date. “Under the rules applicable to the contracts of all our players, Marco Verratti will be deprived of a portion of his monthly ethics bonus,” PSG said. Yes this does indeed appear to work. And it seems the players aren’t similarly bemused, so it’s all good.A lengthy article about the relative merits of north- or south-facing cockerel sculptures can be found on Tottenham’s website here, but I thought the debate was important and interesting enough to quote a little bit here. The headline news, though, is that the club has reviewed its cockerel-positioning policy:Our original designs had the new Cockerel facing North, overlooking the stadium bowl – this resonated given our proud North London heritage and the fact that the Cockerel that sat on top of The Lane’s East Stand also faced in this direction from 1958.Interestingly, when this Cockerel was replaced due to weather damage in the 1980s, it was placed facing the opposite direction, South, with its right flank towards the pitch, resulting in strong feelings from fans being expressed that the Cockerel should be repositioned back to how it was. The Cockerel was subsequently repositioned and remained facing North until the Finale of White Hart Lane.This influenced our initial thinking in terms of which direction the new Cockerel should face, particularly as it will not be sitting on either the East or West Stand. We were also aware though that the Cockerel that sat on top of the Lane’s West Stand, however, faced in the opposite direction - South. In fact, from 1909, when the Golden Cockerel was first seen at the Lane, it resided in this position before it was moved to the East Stand 49 years later. Mauricio Pochettino has sought to calm the nerves of jittery Spurs fans, insisting “I want to feel the glory with Tottenham”.After another tumultuous 10 days for Spurs, rumours began to circulate this week linking Pochettino with a move to managerless Real Madrid. Speaking ahead of his Premier League fixture with Wolves, the manager did not address the rumours directly, but called for renewed patience as the club seek to achieve ‘the last level’.“We are very close to creating, in terms of facilities, one of the best clubs in the world”, Pochettino said. “Of course all have different costs to pay. Sometimes to win titles today is difficult, for many reasons that you and our fans know very well. But sometimes patience is short and frustration is there. I think we are so close to reaching the last level but we need to have that patience that makes us stronger“I think that the period today in the club in Tottenham is so exciting. If you look backwards, it seems like we have been at Spurs for 20, 30 years because it was so tough and the moments that we shared were so intense. But I think we are in the middle of a transition and I don’t believe it’s the end of something.“When I arrived at Tottenham the first video that Daniel showed me had a message, ‘when we are talking about Tottenham Hotspur, we are talking about the glory.’ I want to feel the glory with Tottenham. I think when I watch video from the 1960s, it’s very emotional and I think it would be fantastic to deliver that moment again for our fans. But first of all we need to finish the stadium, move in, make home.”Tottenham announced a further delay to the new White Hart Lane stadium last week, with the ground now not set to be ready until 2019. The bad news punctuated two deflating results, a Champions League draw against PSV Eindhoven being followed by league defeat against Manchester City. But Pochettino’s team bounced back in midweek when they knocked West Ham out of the Carabao Cup, while Dele Alli also signed an extended contract with the club.Asked if the midfielder’s deal sent out a message about the direction Spurs are travelling in, Pochettino said: “In the next few years we will see if it’s a statement. I think it’s important for him to improve his salary, important for the club to reward him. But at the end, extending the contract or not, he was still with a big contract a long contract. I think for Dele it’s a very good thing.” If you’ve had enough of reading what managers have had to say in their weekly press conferences, here’s a great chance to watch what one of them has had to say in his weekly press conference:The latest twist in the madcap world of Nicklas Bendtner:Slavisa Jokanovic has meanwhile insisted that he is the right man to lead Fulham away from the relegation trap door:This kind of situation is part of football. I am not here three days, I am here three years and the board must have some kind of opinion about my work. From my side, I have the confidence, and believe in my job. People around me are professional and we don’t try to make some crazy things.We know it’s not an easy job ahead of us, we must be brave and encourage the team not to stop, never give up. My experience in this club - this is my fourth season here - and always it was complicated and always we reached the target at the end of the season.Rafael Benítez has defended Jamaal Lascelles after the Newcastle defender was criticised for calling the savagely unpopular Mike Ashley “a nice guy”.We met Mike Ashley - and they didn’t know him - for a dinner that was supposed to create a good atmosphere, so his first impression is something that you cannot control. But I think his message - and I was talking to him this morning - is just try to keep everybody together, try to work hard. I think he was trying to be positive, trying to send the right message to everyone. Okay, there are things off the pitch you cannot control when you meet one person at a dinner for a couple of hours. It’s not that you are having an opinion about what has happened in the last 11 years. He’s not trying to do that. It’s just a moment and that’s it. You have to understand that he’s a young player and he had this first impression. And this will tell you what to expect from Everton v Brighton:All your Cardiff v Leicester previewing dreams have come true:Nuno Espirito Santo has been asked for his opinion of his Spurs counterpart Mauricio Pochettino. Shock news: he thinks he’s good.Success cannot be measure with the number of titles. The how is very important. Tottenham are very competitive. What I admire is what I see on the pitch and I see a very good team. I know him and I admire him. The quality of the work they’ve been doing is amazing. The core of the squad, the amount of success they have had.Sky are reporting that Leicester’s entire squad, plus coaches and key members of staff, are planning to fly to Bangkok to attend the funeral of Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha. This just in from Romania, where a third-tier derby in Craiova has turned bonkers:Here’s Unai Emery on Arsenal’s poor record against the top six. I think he thinks it can get better:We want to write a new history. With our players, our quality, and our capacity, I believe in our players and I believe in this project. We are starting this project with very positive things. The captain is Cahill, and if he’s not on the pitch it’s Azpilicueta,. Our captain is Cahill because Cahill was the captain last season and I have spoken with his mates, and everybody told me that he was really a very good captain. For me Cahill is very important on the pitch but also off the pitch. Pep Guardiola has also responded to renewed chatter concerning a potential Manchester City move for Lionel Messi:I have said many times, that when I left Barcelona and went to Bayern Munich and Manchester City, that I never went to the clubs and said I want this player. I know how important he is for Barcelona. This might be interesting:We are sad for him. Nobody likes to be injured. Unfortunately he is injured but fortunately it is not surgery. And with that, Simon Burnton returns from lunch to take you through the rest of the afternoon. Cheers!Still, Poch is taking the slightly odd kick-off time in his stride....Actually, scratch one of those funky options: Vertonghen is out too. Tottenham could be in trouble, midfield-wise, against Wolves on Saturday. Eric Dier tweaked his thigh against Man City on Monday and will be out for a few weeks, while Victor Wanyama did something unfortunate to his left knee in the Carabao Cup two days later (and, incidentally, not enough has been made of the fact they had to play twice in three days this week), so Joao Moutinho and Ruben Neves might be doing their stretches with a little more relish.So does this mean Harry Winks and Mousa Dembele in the middle? Probably: alternatively Poch could get funky and try Kieran Trippier there, or maybe Jan Vertonghen. What do you reckon?OFFICIAL UPDATE from Manchester City on Kevin de Bruyne...Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne suffered knee ligament damage in his left knee during Thursday night’s Carabao Cup fourth-round win over FulhamThe Belgian underwent scans on Friday at the CFA.No surgery is needed but he is expected to be out for between 5-6 weeks.Hi!

David Sharpe, grandson of Dave Whelan and boy chairman of Wigan, will step down from his position when the takeover of the club by the cuddly-sounding International Entertainment Corporation is done and dusted next week.“My grandfather will of course have his own words,” Sharpe said, “but I would just like to state what a privilege it has been to follow in his footsteps. He is Wigan through and through and his passion for Wigan Athletic has never flickered.”IEC will pay £22million for the Latics, and it’s perhaps a sign of what football has become that it’s almost a sum of money where you think “I could’ve had a whipround and got involved in that...”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7873a8304b52f1a5e42241219c8d075e2dcac426/0_8_1695_1017/master/1695.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=725cdc99cf595483a6e5ace45179a2c4","title":"me and sister dont get on what can we do annalisa barbieri","story":"Try to work out what’s at the bottom of it, says Annalisa Barbieri, and start acting like adultsMy sister and I are in our late 20s and have never been close, while me and my mother being close is a source of friction. Recently, our relationship has turned from distant and tense to violent and now nonexistent.As teenagers we went in different directions. I flourished and worked towards my ambitions, got excellent grades, and praise from my parents. My sister seemed remote and uninterested. This seems to have continued.She has had success within her own field and enjoys a much more generous salary than I could ever achieve. I always congratulate her on her successes and ask about her life, yet it feels one-sided. She can frequently be hostile and belittling. I always try to be the bigger person, but am left hurt and angry, so I keep my distance.This came to a head when we both moved back in with our parents temporarily and had an argument that turned physical. Over the next week, she ignored everyone, then left.I felt she owed me and my parents an apology for the way she treated everyone. I couldn’t understand where all this hatred and anger had suddenly appeared from. But now, a few months later, my sister has got in touch with my father. Me and my mother feel betrayed. My father says he just wants everyone to get along, but has not confronted her about what happened.I can’t accept that he is willing to resume contact, and find myself retreating from my relationship with my dad, which I really value. It feels as if he is choosing her over me.Your father isn’t choosing her over you, any more than your mother is choosing you over her. It sounds like your family has never learned to be a group of four – there’s a lot of stratification. I don’t condone your sister’s violence – that was wrong – but you say in your longer letter that you shouted at her that “no one wanted her there”, which was also very wounding. There’s clearly an enormous amount of hurt in your family. You say you don’t know where this hatred and anger has suddenly appeared from, but it will have been festering for a long time.It isn’t obvious who is the eldest and who the youngest. I’m guessing there’s a very small age gap. It’s worth finding out what happened when child number two was born. Did the first born feel pushed out? Did the second born feel they had upset the family dynamic? Those early years can inform current behaviour patterns.Parents of young children can, often unconsciously, make or break sibling relationships. Siblings can, as the family psychotherapist I consulted, Dr Reenee Singh (aft.org.uk), said, “reflect what’s going on in the generation above”. In other words, with your parents, who don’t seem to be handling this in a very confident manner. Were they always like that?But how you and your sister get on now is your responsibility: you are adults, yet you are acting like young children. Your sister not asking anything about you is a classic way of one sibling rejecting the other. What you need to do is step away from the family dynamic and discover who you both are as adults – and see things from each other’s point of view.How do you move forward? You will have different narratives of your childhoods, and you will each need to allow the other to tell their side.“You may want to consider writing your sister a letter, owning your part in the argument and your own feelings,” Singh said. “You can explain how you feel without blaming. ‘I felt upset’ rather than ‘You upset me’. Apologise for your part in it.” Singh suggested it may also be worth looking at your parents’ own sibling relationships and the way they were parented – both can provide useful answers to your dynamic with your sister.“Of course, your parents should be able to have a relationship with both of you. The unit can’t just consist of you alone and your parents.”I got the feeling that’s what you really want, and you will need to dig deep to acknowledge why that might be.• Send your problem to annalisa.barbieri@mac.

The teenager formerly known as Coco is not a faded memory whom I can objectively observe. She is an annoyingly near version of myself, whom I am driven to improve upon. I’m still paying for her mistakes (three words: Topshop store card) I am probably still in a bit of competition with her. If my former self were in a queue, I would definitely pretend I knew a random stranger near the front, just so I could be ahead of her.Yet there are many attributes of Myself the Younger that I actively resist growing out of. It’s probably why, last week, for the first time in years, I found myself at a rave. An actual rave! You know the sort, with the flashing lights, heavy bass and sense of foreboding throughout?Maybe that last one is just me. But still, it would suggest some inevitable change is occurring. I’m fairly certain my 18-year-old self didn’t sit in silence hours before any big night out wrought with anxiety about queues, lack of loo roll and the price of water (£7!).If the question was inverted, and my teen self could send present-day me, sitting in the corner of the rave, a message, I guess she would say: “See you later, loser!”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3b5b13bf236416aa51c2577bd3b272bbf7254dd8/96_15_4761_2856/master/4761.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=04d3d24c0141da0f3488dc0996a841c5","title":"lets move to wimborne minster dorset","story":"What’s going for it?

Tickets cost £55 and upwards per day, while online pay per view is $20 for the match. Other popular chess websites will provide free viewing, possibly with a delay in move transmission.A close contest, for sure, and also a clash of different technical approaches. Carlsen said about his opponent in a recent interview: “ His playing style is very concrete. He calculates very, very well and deep. He is well prepared. And he loves the centre. Caruana often sacrifices pawns, gives his opponents passed pawns, accepts attacks towards his king in order to achieve control of the centre. So in terms of chess understanding, this is what I would assess that we are the most different on, he values the centre a lot.”The Norwegian, 27 is confident because of his results against the American despite Caruana’s recent successes. He gave a clue to his match strategy: “I have won several games against him earlier with active defence where he put pressure on me and I managed to get counterplay and win. So you can’t rule out that I will try that quite a bit.”If there is a decision on or before game 12, Caruana is probably the favourite, but if the classical games end 6-6, Carlsen should win the speed tie-breaks.Husbands and wives often play in the same tournament, but none have done so with the spectacular success that Rodoslaw Wojtaszek and Alina Kashlinskaya achieved in the Chess Isle of Man International at Douglas last week.Husband Wojtaszek, seeded 10th behind two former world champions and others from the global top, scored an unbeaten 79 in the main event then won a speed play-off for the trophy, while wife Kashlinskaya, seeded sixth among women in the mixed field, played the tournament of her life. She drew her first two rounds against the world No 5, Anish Giri, and ex-world champion Vlad Kramnik, lost only once, and ended with a crushing victory over one of America’s top juniors.The result also brought justice to Poland after last month’s Olympiad when its team were close to gold but ended up an unlucky fourth. For their final round match in Batumi against India. Wojtaszek had considered a mazy pawn sacrifice in the Catalan (1 d4 Nf6 2 c4 e6 3 g3) then decided on a more solid line which led to a draw.But in the critical penultimate round at Douglas, Wojtaszek sprung his pawn sac against an unsuspecting Michael Adams, and the England No 1 immediately blundered. If that scenario had occurred at the Olympiad, Poland would have won gold.The final round was Kashlinskaya’s 25th birthday. Besides the women’s trophy and first prize, her success earned a GM norm with a 2705 tournament performance compared with her start rating of 2447. Very few players have ever made such a high level quantum jump in their mid-20s. With some understatement, she described the event as “definitely” their best performance as a couple.It may well rank as the best husband-wife performance in chess history, rivalled only by Bu Xiangzhi and Huang Qiang, who both won team gold and inidual silver medals for China in Batumi. The Olympiad is the superior event, but China’s double was less of an upset.Arkadij Naiditsch tied first with Wojtaszek before losing the speed play-off 2-1. It was a career best for the 33-year-old who was born a Latvian, moved to Germany, then switched federations to Azerbaijan.Adams joined the leaders two rounds from the finish but lost them both, and it was Gawain Jones who achieved an English triumph. The Yorkshireman, 30, defeated top seeded Levon Aronian, shared third prize on 6.5-2.5 in world class company, and described his feelings as “Relief. I’ve had so many long games, and I’ve been suffering in nearly all of them as well,so it’s nice to have a good position for a change!”Kashlinskaya’s final round win began with the rare 6…Nh6!? dug up from the 1960s and was virtually settled between moves 16 and 19. Her sharp 16 Nd5!? sacrificed a piece for a central pawn phalanx, which became crushing after 18…Be4? (Bc8!) White soon regained the piece, and Sevian was overrun by two passed pawns on the seventh.Timur Gareyev may not be the strongest grandmaster on the planet, but he is surely the most adventurous. The Uzbekistan-born 30-year-old who now lives in Kansas and represents the US, set a global record in 2016 when he played 48 games simultaneously while blindfolded, breaking a landmark achievement formerly held by the likes of Richard Reti, Alexander Alekhine, and Miguel Najdorf.

The alleged victim, who did not come forward with the complaint until 2015, accused Rose, Randall Hampton and Ryan Allen of breaking into her Los Angeles apartment and raping her while she was incapacitated from an evening of drinking. She also claimed to being drugged by the men.Like many sexual assault cases, it turned into a “he said, she said” affair, with the focus weighing heavily on the woman to prove her case against a superstar athlete and idol of millions (including, it would seem, the jury members who posed for photos with Rose in the aftermath).Despite Rose admitting to not knowing what consent meant, and admitting that, yes, he and his friends did have sex with the woman while she was intoxicated, he was not held accountable in any way for his actions.Perhaps the most shocking part of the trial was the admission Rose gave in response to what he and his friends were planning on doing once they arrived at the apartment:Q: So they just said, ‘Hey, it’s the middle of the night. Let’s go over to plaintiff’s house’ and they never gave you a reason why they wanted to go over there?’Rose: No, but we men. You can assume.Q: I’m sorry?Rose: I said we men. You can assume. Like we leaving to go over to someone’s house at 1 a.m., there’s nothing to talk about.Q: All right. Is there — within what you just reviewed in those text messages — is there anything within them that would lead you to believe that plaintiff wanted to have sex with you and the other two defendants on August 26, 2013?Rose: No.Not only did Rose basically state that “boys will be boys”, he also confessed that there was no indication that the plaintiff wanted to have sex him or his friends.This was all admitted openly in court, on the record, in front of a jury. Still, Rose walked and went on to continue playing basketball, although he will likely find himself back in the Los Angeles courthouse as the case is under an appeal scheduled to be heard on 16 November.When Petersen decided to include the accusations against Rose in the same breath as the injuries that derailed his career, he did a disservice to the conversation around sexual assault. It’s clear that Petersen isn’t equipped to lead a discussion around this, because you can’t try to talk about Rose’s rape allegations in 15 seconds. You also cannot simply put being found not liable of sexual assault in the same box of overcoming injuries.Talking about sexual assault is never easy, even for me, as a survivor of multiple assaults who has written about the experiences on several occasions. We cannot approach the topic of sexual assault in a myopic manner. We have to be thoughtful, educated on cases we are speaking on, and willing to sit back and truly evaluate what value we add to the conversation.In the case of Petersen, he did not take into account what he actually knew about the proceedings, except that he knew Rose hadn’t been found guilty of anything. There is a time to talk about sexual assault allegations against an athlete. However, it should never be framed in the same narrative thread of a comeback from injuries.In the case of an injury, only one person is directly impacted: the athlete. In the case of sexual assault, there is another person to keep in mind, someone who may not have found redemption: the survivor.And if we collectively look at the survivors of sexual assault who do come forward, even if they find legal justice, there is often very little redemption for them. No one writes or talks about their lives and focuses on all the obstacles they had to overcome in regards to their assault. We don’t get to know their pain or see how PTSD can impact their lives on a daily basis. We don’t see the internal struggle many survivors endure, the struggle to love and to not blame themselves for the assault. Their redemption stories don’t make the cover of magazines – and since every 98 seconds a person in the United States is sexually assaulted, there simply isn’t enough time to cover every single one of these comebacks.Those are the redemption arcs I want to hear and that the world needs to hear, too."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c14a0e4f12708302d82b9e7c1810b00e17904929/360_848_6054_3632/master/6054.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=56a278279f56cda15f3ef555c40b03a7","title":"mark gatiss the league of gentlemen was a premonition of brexit","story":"After a turn on stage as George III, the co-founder of the League is returning to horror to recreate Dracula for TV. What he finds ‘frightening and debilitating’ now, though, is leaving the EUMark Gatiss is recalling an early memory, rocking back and forth on the sofa as he talks. It is an “extraordinarily vivid” moment from when he lived opposite a psychiatric hospital in County Durham. The institution was central to his childhood, a “colony” in which his mother and father worked, where he went to swim, to trampoline, to see films. Except, on this occasion, he was left on one of the wards with his brother to wait for his parents. “I must have been around five. There was a boy rocking on a bed. As I remember it, he had an empty eye socket. He had his thumb in it and he was just rocking – like this.”Gatiss takes his thumb to his eye and rocks some more. It is a baroque vision, creepy enough to make you squeal, and befitting for one of the creators of the stage show and TV series The League of Gentlemen. As Gatiss says: “You can’t get more northern gothic, can you?”It is clear he enjoys playing up the northern gothic. His Twitter tagline reads: “Actor. Writer. Strangler.” In person, there is no hint of gloom. He is sweet and sunny, an optimist by his own admission. Still, an unprosperous northern childhood and those years of observing mental illness – and the world’s responses to it – continue to serve him at the age of 52. He is currently in Nottingham, in rehearsals to play the titular lead in Alan Bennett’s 1991 play, The Madness of George III, at the Nottingham Playhouse. The play – which was adapted for a 1994 film, The Madness of King George, starring Helen Mirren and Nigel Hawthorne – dramatises the monarch’s mental illness.Since the TV version of the League – which followed the tormented outcasts and oddballs of the fictional town of Royston Vasey – landed in 1999 and earned Gatiss and his co-stars a legion of fans, he has helped to create some of the most popular shows on TV. These include the revived Doctor Who (as a writer and an actor) and Sherlock, a reimagining of Sherlock Holmes as a 21st-century detective, which he co-created with Steven Moffat and in which he stars as Holmes’s brother, Mycroft. In between, he has worked on films and written books and plays. His stint in Nottingham follows a nationwide tour of the League, an Oscar-tipped film (The Favourite) and The Dead Room, a yet-to-be-aired Christmas ghost story starring Simon Callow, which he wrote and directed. After The Madness of George III, he will team up with Moffat again for a BBCNetflix adaptation of the vampire classic Dracula. “I do work hard and I think that’s a good thing,” he says. “Work hard, be kind, that’s my motto.” Filming for Dracula will start next year, but Gatiss does not plan to act in it. He will not be drawn on who will be cast as the vampire, but says he and Moffat thought carefully before deciding to set the series in its original period, the 19th century: “We said when we started Sherlock that we briefly got custodianship of the keys to Baker Street and we felt: ‘It’s our go.’ So, we wanted to have ‘our go’ at Dracula and with that we wanted to do all the treats – a big, spooky castle and the rest of it.”Sherlock was set in the modern day for the opposite reason: “We felt it had become so swamped with Victoriana that people had lost sight of what it was – which is essentially a flat-share story of two unlikely friends, one of whom solves crimes. That was the really exciting thing, to just go back to basics.” While the series has been a runaway success, there have been criticisms: one  article lamented that his Sherlock was morphing into James Bond it vexed Gatiss so much that he sent the  a rejoinder in rhyme, outlining the differences between his hero and Ian Fleming’s.There have been other charges of “unfaithfulness” in Gatiss’s adaptations, but he is adamant about his right to play with an original story. “I feel very strongly about not just drearily reproducing the book. You are duty-bound to think: ‘Here’s an idea, why don’t we flip this round,’ especially if people know it well. It doesn’t spoil the original. No one burns the manuscript … the Tardis would never have left the junkyard in the 1960s if it wasn’t about change.”And what greater change than a female doctor? The new series is the first with which Gatiss has not been involved since Doctor Who relaunched in 2005. How does he feel about Jodie Whittaker’s Doctor? “First, it’s lovely that I’m enjoying watching it on a Sunday night and not knowing anything about it. I have even tried to avoid the trailer for the next time. And I have said for a very long time that there should be female Doctors. As soon as you watch it, you say: ‘Of course, why not?’ All you need, ever, is for the right person to be playing the part. Jodie is instantly likable, funny, delightfully odd.”If that is the case, can we – should we – stop at Doctor Who or extend a gender-blind, colour-blind policy to all period dramas? It depends how literal we want to be, Gatiss says, but he balks at the prospect of a female Bond. “Doctor Who is an alien with two hearts who lives in a dimensionally transcendental phone box and can periodically change his or her appearance. James Bond is a man. There’s no way out of that. It becomes a very reductive argument. If you want to create a really kickass new heroine or hero, then do something else.”If you were to create a female Bond, he adds, would you then follow Fleming’s blueprint of making her a sexist lothario? “What is it about James Bond you want to change? Is it just the sex or is it everything else? In which case, you’ve got a different character anyway.”Gatiss was not long out of studying theatre arts at Bretton Hall College in West Yorkshire when he co-wrote the League with Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, whom he met there. It has been a long, loyal partnership, even though they went their separate ways – and thrived – before returning after 13 years to take the show back on the road. “We never fell out, we just stopped doing it,” Gatiss says. “We had been doing it virtually day in, day out for 11 years. So, we decided to do other stuff. The extraordinary thing about the tour was that it felt like no time had passed, which is what great friendships are about.”The League began as a stage sketch show in 1994, when standup was more dominant in comedy. Gatiss and the others were enlisted to fill a slot at a fringe festival. “We did it for five nights and it went down really well. I remember a friend of mine saying: ‘You should do something with this.’” They did – and won the Perrier award at the Edinburgh fringe in 1997. “We did what made us laugh. All the things we loved ranged from proper horror to the horror of embarrassment Alan Bennett, Victoria Wood, Mike Leigh. It was very much about our northern upbringings, too – we were identifying our own experiences of the world of the north. It was real anger and despair and oddness.”It is not just the rising intolerance of the “immigrant” outsider that he fears, but also the erosion of other liberal, humanist values. As a gay man – he is married to the actor Ian Hallard – he has never felt personally threatened in London, where he lives, “but you go out of London and it’s very different. You go to certain parts of the country and you think: ‘I would modify my behaviour here.’”The regions around his birthplace were the heartland for leave voters, but Gatiss is proud to have grown up in the north and in a working-class household: his father was the chief engineer at the psychiatric hospital and his mother was a carer and secretary. “I think my background did me an awful lot of good. There’s a very good line from Doctor Who: ‘Never lose sight of your horizons.’ There’s nothing wrong with coming from one place and moving to another place, but it’s good to know that and honour it. And also to acknowledge its flaws – it doesn’t have to be perfect.”Brexit upsets him immensely. He speaks of it in irate exclamations and bloody analogies: “Brexit, to me, is like slitting your own throat and going to bed saying: ‘I’ll see how I am in the morning.’ I’m a sickeningly optimistic person and that’s what worries me about how depressed I am about it all. The temptation is to totally disengage because it’s so frightening and debilitating, but if you do that they’ve won.”The Madness of George III is at Nottingham Playhouse until 24 November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b4c3ebb58abd2788408c16d38439d1bb080e9c62/390_0_1610_966/master/1610.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aee5ad4ea0e8de1d6b91edff41dfa3f5","title":"darcey bussell strictly steps back in time in pictures","story":"In her new book, Evolved, the Strictly judge and former Royal Ballet star gives an intimate account of her career, alongside photographs of her rehearsals, performances and fashion shoots"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3fcc93b69f02e07c620bd8d2ec0c79aa0630e2be/0_129_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=37b40f7acde6a096bb7bf063307d9ac0","title":"today in focus takes you behind the guardians headlines podcasts of the week","story":"’s new daily show aims to tell the paper’s stories in a fresh and engaging way.

Church bells were rung in towns and villages across the UK, for the first time since the war began, both as a symbolic gesture and to let people know the war was over.Though this was a joyous moment for the allies at least, the devastating loss of life affected many families and communities in Britain and across the world. Thirty nations had declared war between 1914 and 1918. Many countries along with Great Britain sided with the allies, including France, Italy, Russia, and the United States.

Those arriving at the border will be required to have uploaded pictures of their passport, visa and proof of funds.According to an article published by the European commission, the “unique approach to ‘deception detection’ analyses the micro-expressions of travellers to figure out if the interviewee is lying”.The project’s coordinator, George Boultadakis, who works for the technology supplier, European Dynamics, in Luxembourg, said: “We’re employing existing and proven technologies – as well as novel ones – to empower border agents to increase the accuracy and efficiency of border checks. The system will collect data that will move beyond biometrics and on to biomarkers of deceit.”Travellers who have been flagged as low risk by the avatar, and its lie detector, will go through a short re-evaluation of their information for entry. Those judged to be of higher risk will undergo a more detailed check.Border officials will use a handheld device to automatically crosscheck information, comparing the facial images captured during the pre-screening stage to passports and photos taken on previous border crossings.When documents have been reassessed, and fingerprinting, palm-vein scanning and face matching have been carried out, the potential risk will be recalculated. A border guard will then take over from the automated system.The project, which has received €4.5m (£3.95m) in EU funding, has been heavily criticised by experts.Bruno Verschuere, a senior lecturer in forensic psychology at the University of Amsterdam, told the Dutch newspaper De Volskrant he believed the system would deliver unfair outcomes.“Non-verbal signals, such as micro-expressions, really do not say anything about whether someone is lying or not,” he said. “This is the embodiment of everything that can go wrong with lie detection. There is no scientific foundation for the methods that are going to be used now.“Once these systems are put into use, they will not go away. The public will only hear the success stories and not the stories about those who have been wrongly stopped.”Verschuere said there was no evidence for the assumption that liars were stressed and that this translated to into fidgeting or subtle facial movements.Bennett Kleinberg, an assistant professor in data science at University College London, said: “This can lead to the implementation of a pseudoscientific border control.”A spokesman for the project said: “The border crossing decision is not based on the single tool (ie lie detection) but on the aggregated risk estimations based on a risk-based approach and technology that has been used widely in custom procedures.“Therefore, the overall procedure is safe because it is not relying in the risk on one analysis (ie the lie detector) but on the correlated risks from various analysis.”The technology has been designed by a consortium of the Hungarian national police, Latvian customs, and Manchester politan and Leibnitz universities. Similar technology is being developed in the US, where lie detection is widely used in law enforcement, despite scepticism over its scientific utility in much of the rest of the world.Last month, engineers at the University of Arizona said they had developed a system that they hoped to install on the US-Mexico border known as the Automated Virtual Agent for Truth Assessments in Real-Time, or Avatar."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2c817dfbd7b0240fef9af2f85aef9a067021fcf6/0_111_4663_2798/master/4663.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=46a7fefa8f955c6e948f6e9a71076074","title":"model bar refaeli criticised over islamophobic advert","story":"Video shows model Bar Refaeli removing niqab as ‘freedom is basic’ slogan appears on screenOne of Israel’s most prominent models has been criticised for appearing in an advert in which she rips off a face veil to the slogan “freedom is basic”.The Israeli clothing brand Hoodies posted a video online this week that opens with a Hebrew caption reading “is Iran here?” while zoomed in on Bar Refaeli’s face, which is covered in a black niqab.Refaeli, 33 – a former girlfriend of the actor Leonardo DiCaprio – is one of the world’s best-known models. She married the Israeli billionaire Adi Ezra in 2015.On Facebook, Hoodies accompanied the advert with text asking if people felt their freedom was under threat.Refaeli’s performance was criticised online as Islamophobic and anti-Iran, where that type of headscarf is rarely seen. Under Iranian law, women are required to cover their head, but millions ignore this by wearing loose veils.The clothing company ran the advert on Monday and it was viewed 160,000 times on YouTube. Following the outrage, Hoodies posted another version in which the Iran reference was removed and other women, including the transgender actor Stav Strashko and an Ethiopian-Israeli model, also removed niqabs.Another woman wearing a hijab and Hoodies sportswear was also added, although she did not remove her headscarf. Both videos received more dislikes than likes.Nuseir Yassin, an Arab-Israeli video blogger who runs the Nas Daily online video show, described the advert as the “worst commercial ever”.“It is not OK to disrespect an entire country, an entire gender, or an entire religion just to sell a T-shirt,” he said.In a separate incident, local Israeli election campaign posters displayed by a Jewish nationalist party that showed a woman wearing a hijab were removed after causing an outcry.

But following days of talks in Hobart in Tasmania, the CCAMLR rejected the plan, which needed unanimous agreement to pass.Environmental groups, who had mobilised 2 million people in support of the plan, reacted with dismay.“This was an historic opportunity to create the largest protected area on earth in the Antarctic: safeguarding wildlife, tackling climate change and improving the health of our global oceans,” said Frida Bengtsson of Greenpeace’s Protect the Antarctic campaign.“Twenty-two delegations came here to negotiate in good faith but, instead, serious scientific proposals for urgent marine protection were derailed by interventions which barely engaged with the science.”She said that rather than put forward “reasoned opposition on scientific grounds, some delegations, like China and Russia, instead deployed delaying tactics such as wrecking amendments and filibustering, which meant there was barely any time left for real discussion about protecting Antarctic waters”.The UK government backed the plan, with an Foreign Office delegation present for the talks in Hobart, Tasmania. Minister Alan Duncan said: “It is not in our gift to do this unilaterally. It is subject to an international treaty which requires wider agreement with other countries. At CCAMLR, these proposals were rejected due to objections from others.”He said the British government would continue to press for the creation of ocean sanctuaries in the Antarctic in the years ahead.Last month, the UN warned there were only 12 years left to prevent climate catastrophe.The environment secretary, Michael Gove, had told the  he was “fully behind” the creation of the Antarctic sanctuary, which he said would be a key moment in the effort to protecting the world’s oceans.She said that although the scientific evidence was clear, “diplomatic efforts seem to be more concerned with expanding fisheries than with conservation”.She said that meant it was more urgent than ever for the public to join the fight and put pressure on politicians to safe the oceans before it was too late, adding: “If bodies like the Antarctic Ocean Commission continue to fail in their mandate to conserve the ocean, they’re clearly unfit for purpose and aren’t part of the solution. Instead we must look to the historic negotiations taking place at the UN towards a Global Ocean Treaty.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3684404.1541177938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"may urged to clarify whether she blocked arron banks investigation","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBrexit campaign donor and businessman Arron Banks. Photograph: Daniel Leal-OlovasAFPGetty ImagesA British Labour MP has asked Theresa May whether she or any other minister had ever declined a request from the security services to conduct an investigation into the controversial Leave.EU campaign donor Arron Banks. Ben Bradshaw wrote to the prime minister a day after it was announced that a criminal investigation into Mr Banks had begun, amid repeated allegations that Mrs May had blocked an investigation in 2016, when she was home secretary.Mr Bradshaw said the allegation was extremely serious. “I have today written to the prime minister to ask if she or any other minister or senior official has at any stage declined a request from any of our security, intelligence or law enforcement agencies to investigate Banks,” he said.On Thursday, Britain’s Electoral Commission concluded that there were reasonable grounds to suspect Banks was “not the true source” of donations totalling £8 million (about €9 million) to the Leave.EU campaign.The elections watchdog also referred Mr Banks and Leave.EU to the National Crime Agency, which said it would begin an investigation on the grounds that “a number of criminal offences may have been committed”.Mr Banks denies any wrongdoing. “I am a UK taxpayer and I have never received any foreign donations”, he said on Thursday.Liz Bilney, a Banks associate who is also under investigation, added: “I run the group of companies where the money was from and we don’t have any transactions that are from Russia. ”Downing Street would not comment on Mr Bradshaw’s suggestion that an investigation was blocked, although it is understood the claim is denied. A No 10 spokesman said: “We would never confirm or deny the detail of any conversation with security services on any topic.”The Daily Mail reported on Thursday that Mrs May declined a request by one of the security services to investigate Mr Banks in 2016, repeating a claim made by Tom Watson, Labour’s deputy leader, at his party conference in September.The Electoral Commission concluded that Mr Banks was not the true source of the £8 million in loans provided to the Leave.EU referendum campaigns that the lending involved a non-qualifying or impermissible company – Rock Holdings Ltd – based in the Isle of Man and that Mr Banks, Ms Bilney and others concealed the true details of the financial transactions.Mr Banks has been invited to appear on the BBC’s Andrew Marr show this weekend, where he is expected to respond again to the allegations. He told the London Times he had obtained a legal opinion to show that lending money via Rock Holdings was legitimate, and that he would refer to that opinion on air. – "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3683111.1541154080!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"we came from the jungle a clandestine life here it s another world","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFarc  guerrillas wash clothes at their camp in the Transitional Standardisation Zone in Pondores,  Colombia, in April  2017. Photograph: Joaquin Sarmiento AFPFor years he was one of the top tailors in the left-wing Farc guerrilla group: carrying his sewing machine through Colombia’s jungles on the back of a donkey, he was the man who kept the Caribbean fronts dressed and battle-ready. “They would say, we need 600 uniforms. Or a thousand tents,” says Diosenel Criado, who during his time with the rebels went by the alias Omar. “Camouflage was hard to get, but someone would smuggle it through. I would sew with my gun hanging right beside me.”  – logistics were everything. Always on the run, outnumbered and outgunned, the rebels needed to be sure their food, clothing and camps were good. Criado spent more than a decade with the rebels, whose acronym once stood for the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, sewing their rucksacks, army fatigues, tents. But a peace deal signed with the government at the end of 2016 saw 7,000 armed rebel soldiers give up their guns and move into reintegration camps. Criado was among them. He brought that sewing machine – which he had kept for all those years – and is now setting up a peacetime sewing venture in a remote part of northern Colombia. Although camps like this one in Pondores, La Guajira, were meant to be temporary, many of the rank-and-file soldiers who came here to hand over their weapons have decided to stay on. Today, it’s home to some 200 former combatants trying to figure out what a life in peacetime might look like for them. In the middle of the day, the heat is unbearable, the atmosphere lethargic. A series of prefabricated houses lines a dusty footpath. There are shared bathrooms and tiny stoves in each house. One woman who spent 40 years in the guerrilla movement tells us they suffocate sleeping inside at night and that they are all putting on weight from the transition from mountain warfare to civilian life. Since the fighting stopped, many ex-combatants have been studying, choosing to finish their high school programmes or take professional training courses. They receive a basic budget from the government to cover their needs. But the biggest question for most is how long they will be able to stay here and what they are going to do next . Some want to work in tourism, others hope to farm. But such projects face roadblocks, with either uncertain tenancy on the land or questions over how they will be supported in endeavours entirely new to them. Walk into Criado’s workshop and everything seems cool, calm and orderly. It’s the only place in the camp with air conditioning. UN-donated sewing machines line the desks, thread and fabric are spread neatly over the tables. He cuts the cloth using the cardboard models he was given by a government training agency his female guerrilla recruits chat quietly as they sew nearby. “I wanted to start this project from the moment we came here,” says Criado (49), who found out he had become a grandfather after the war. “This food, this money the government gives us, it is not going to last forever. And when this ends? We need a way to live.” The team works hard on its new projects. The clothes are smart and precisely made: sweatsuits, dress shirts and domestic worker uniforms. The problem is that Criado does not have any sizable orders. The biggest one he has had to date was to dress a team of ex-combatants at a nearby farm. He travels the region trying to make contacts, chasing up promises of further orders, but business is slow. “People have said ‘we will bear you in mind’,” says Criado.The success of Colombia’s peace deal – which ended the longest-running war in the hemisphere – will live or die on whether ex-Farc rebels can find a way to make a living away from the violence. But experts say this less glamorous part of the demobilisation and reintegration process has not received the attention it needs.The government in Bogota remains at war with another left-wing group, the ELN, and is battling drug-trafficking mafia groups that could easily soak up those with a background in insurgency and a sense of disenfranchisement with the peace deal. “Colombia has a lot of organised-crime groups and guerrilla dissident groups, and they’re hiring,” says Adam Isacson, a Colombia expert at the Washington Office on Latin America, adding that finding work in the normal jobs market may be tricky for ex-combatants from a group many Colombians considered a mere terrorist group. “Business owners worry that iniduals who spent years on the other side of the law will not be ethical employees,” he says. The United Nations has expressed concern over “shortcomings” in the reintegration measures currently in place, with a recent memo from the in-country verification mission warning that “today, more than ever, renewed government support for productive reintegration is essential”. Colombia’s newly elected president Ivan Duque has promised to do more, but as he was a sceptic of the peace deal while on the campaign trail there have been questions over how far his commitment to some parts of the deal will go. Back in Pondores, that leaves this group of ex-combatants wondering what their future holds. Many say that those who have lived through war do not want to go back. But they also say that they need more help. “We want to go forward with the peace process. The world needs to know that we are committed. But for reintegration we need to have a project,” says Franklin Ruiz, an ex-combatant who wears civilian clothes and a Farc baseball cap. “We came from the jungle, a clandestine life, we come here and it’s another world,” he says. “I was in the guerrillas for 40 years. It’s not easy for us to change.” *This article was supported by a grant from the Pulitzer Centre on Crisis Reporting "},{"url":null,"title":"halloween celebrations costumes around world pictures","story":"Around 2000 people gathered on the streets of Kawasaki, Japan, to watch the country\u0027s largest Halloween parade on Saturday 28th October.

It came as Topshop was forced to cancel a launch party for its latest collection after designer Michael Halpern pulled out.Ms Miller declined to comment on Mr Bercow\u0027s refusal but, writing for The Daily , highlighted the Commons\u0027 own use of NDAs, on which it spent £2.4million between 2013 and 2017. Perhaps Parliament would be better placed to challenge this abuse of the law if it weren\u0027t also caught up in the use of NDAs, she argued.There have been more than 50 severance agreements, most including confidentially clauses, relating to House of Commons staff alone over the past five years. Last week, Ms Miller called on Mr Bercow to resign over a report into bullying in the Commons, something he himself has been accused of. Andrew Bridgen, one of Mr Bercow\u0027s most vocal critics, said: He should recuse himself from any further participation in the House\u0027s response to the culture change required. In fact, the best thing he can do is stand down as Speaker.A spokesman for Mr Bercow, who has denied bullying or any knowledge of pay-offs to alleged victims, said it might be thought premature to grant an urgent question on NDAs given the Government\u0027s response to Ms Miller\u0027s committee\u0027s report on misconduct in the workplace was expected shortly.Ms Jones said her committee would love an NDAs debate but could not sanction it unless a petition was lodged on Parliament\u0027s website. The impact of the scandal on Sir Philip\u0027s retail empire began to emerge last night after Mr Halpern withdrew from a launch party for his line. He is understood to have felt unable to attend after Sir Philip was named as the businessman behind an injunction preventing The  publishing allegations against him of sexual harassment and racial discrimination. A fashion insider said: His brand is about female empowerment. That\u0027s his ethos. He couldn\u0027t go ahead with this, it wouldn\u0027t be a good look. It would be awkward. I can\u0027t imagine celebrities would want to be associated with Philip Green. He\u0027s in a tricky situation.

A school pupil posted a picture on Snapchat of his new GCSE classmate asking: “How’s there a 30-year-old man in our maths class?”After parents expressed concern that an adult could be mixing with the academy’s 680-pupils the school contacted the Home Office, which launched an investigation. The pupil has been asked to not attend school until the investigation is completed.One mother, whose son is in the same year as the migrant student, said: “Parents have been pulling their children out of school left, right and centre.“Looking at photos of this man, he is clearly older than 30. How can someone like this be eating with children, changing with children and learning with our children while pretending to be a teenager?“He could be harmless but he could also be a dangerous man. I am terrified to think what would happen if he started a relationship with a young girl who thought he was her age.”She said her son believes the pupil speaks little English and struggles to make himself understood with his teachers.“He sits in the class but cannot speak or learn,” she continued. “What makes it worse is that the school has made no contact with any of the parents or called us in for a meeting, yet we are all up in arms and worried.“Something needs to be done and soon because this is likely to be happening all over the country and the Home Office is doing very little to help. I won\u0027t have my son studying with a 30-year-old man.”Other parents speculated that he may have qualifications from his home country which are not recognised in the UK, so he is trying to obtain GCSEs.Another mother wrote on Facebook that if the pupil was an adult in class it represented a serious “security breach.”Lee Northcott added: “I am shocked and outraged that this has happened when my son and nephew attends this school.“They need to get to the bottom of this and get it resolved as soon as possible.”A school spokesman said: “This is a matter for the Home Office and we have referred it to them. The student is not attending the school at this time.“We can not comment further on an inidual case, but we have followed Government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any admissions matter.”Any asylum seeker arriving in the UK is asked to provide proof of age. However, many have no official documentation so immigration authorities often ask social services to carry out an “age assessment” to try to spot those posing as a child in the hope of being allowed to stay in Britain.It is understood the Ipswich pupil arrived without a passport, or any other proof of age, so would have been assessed by immigration officials or social workers.Asylum applications were over a million for the second year runningA Home Office spokesperson said the department does not “routinely comment on inidual cases,” adding that if immigration officials had doubts about a migrant’s age social services would conduct an age assessment.In 2016, David Davies, the Conservative MP for Monmouthshire, called for dental tests to be carried out on asylum seekers arriving in Britain from Calais after photographs appeared to show adults arriving.The Home Office had allowed around 100 immigrants from the so-called Calais Jungle to move to the UK if they were aged between 14 and 17.At the time, Mr Davies said he feared “British hospitality” was being abused by those pretending to be younger than they were.The Home Office said it used a “number of determining factors” to establish a asylum seeker’s real age, including their “physical appearance or demeanour.”Brexit latest: DUP warn Dominic Raab against allowing regulatory checks down the Irish SeaComment: If we want

near-Earth asteroids.ConsenSys\u0026nbspannounced its acquisition of Planetary Resources on Wednesday, 31 October, together with its intention of democratising and decentralising space endeavours.The space mining startup has had some high-profile backing since forming in 2009, including Google co-founder\u0026nbspLarry Page, who was involved in a $21.1 million funding round in 2016.Over the course of nearly a decade, Planetary\u0026nbspResources has simultaneously pioneered technology, business, law and policy, and brought the promise of space resources irreversibly closer to humankind\u0027s

provide a near-infinite supply of resources for humanity.Commercially viable asteroids include those containing minerals like gold, silver and platinum, which could be mined and transported back to Earth.\u0026nbspIn 2015, the US government recognised this potential by legalising asteroid mining and moving\u0026nbspaway from the 1967 Outer Space Treaty that banned it.The acquisition of Planetary Resources by\u0026nbspa blockchain startup involved with ethereum\u0026nbspdoes not come as a surprise given the nature of space mining, according to Brian Israel, who has previously worked with the US government on the international legal dimensions of outer space.Ethereum smart contract functionality is a natural solution for private-ordering and commerce in space – the only domain of human activity not ordered around territorial sovereignty – in which a erse range of actors from a growing number of countries must coordinate and transact, said Israel, who now serves as Planetary Resources general counsel.\u0026nbspConsenSys\u0026nbspfounder Joe Lubin\u0026nbspechoed this sentiment, saying the space firm was in line with his company\u0027s belief in the potential for ethereum\u0026nbspto help humanity craft new societal rule systems through automated trust and guaranteed execution.He added: It reflects our belief in democratizing and decentralizing space endeavours to unite our species and unlock untapped human potential. We look forward to sharing our plans and how to join us on this journey in the months ahead.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A shortage of new infrastructure projects to bid for has also been a concern for the civil engineering sector.”Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of UK GDP.The latest official data suggests that the sector grew by 1.6 per cent in the three months to August, but this came after a severe contraction earlier in the year during the Beast from the East\u0026nbspsnow storms.The PMI survey for manufacturing showed that activity in the sector hit a two-year low\u0026nbspin October, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in global trade.The next\u0026nbspsurvey for services, which account for 80 per cent of the UK economy, will be released on Monday.According to the ONS quarterly GDP growth was 0.7 per cent in the three months to August, up from 0.4 per cent in the second quarter.The Bank of England, in its latest forecasts on Thursday, said it expects\u0026nbspGDP growth to come in at 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, before dropping sharply to 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A shortage of new infrastructure projects to bid for has also been a concern for the civil engineering sector.”Construction accounts for around 6 per cent of UK GDP.The latest official data suggests that the sector grew by 1.6 per cent in the three months to August, but this came after a severe contraction earlier in the year during the Beast from the East\u0026nbspsnow storms.The PMI survey for manufacturing showed that activity in the sector hit a two-year low\u0026nbspin October, reflecting the impact of a slowdown in global trade.The next\u0026nbspsurvey for services, which account for 80 per cent of the UK economy, will be released on Monday.According to the ONS quarterly GDP growth was 0.7 per cent in the three months to August, up from 0.4 per cent in the second quarter.The Bank of England, in its latest forecasts on Thursday, said it expects\u0026nbspGDP growth to come in at 0.6 per cent in the third quarter, before dropping sharply to 0.3 per cent in the final three months of 2018.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But if even Star Wars can flop,\u0026nbspMarvel could certainly begin to lose steam. Here\u0027s a few cards it can play to stop that happeningClick to followThe Independent‘s Of The Galaxy’ was a huge commercial hit – but can it last?Bad luck superhero haters: there’s another of Marvel’s\u0026nbspcostumed crusaders at\u0026nbspyour\u0026nbsplocal multiplex\u0026nbspin the form of Venom.\u0026nbspThe hype machine is also moving into high gear for Captain Marvel, even though that’s not\u0026nbspscheduled to drop until March. There have been contradictory reports about whether Venom, starring Tom Hardy, is going to be part of the official Marvel Cinematic Universe (MFCU) or not.\u0026nbspSony holds the rights to Spider-Man and several linked characters, but struck a complicated deal with Marvel Studios, and ultimate owner Disney, to bring the web slinger into the MCU, which resulted in the wildly successful Spider-Man: Homecoming\u0026nbspat $880m\u0026nbsp(£685m) global gross. A sequel is due next year.\u0026nbspBut, depending on the box office, Venom could become part of a separate Sony Marvel universe. It would likely major on anti-heroes, which might be a lot of fun. Much depends on the film’s gross.Jake Gyllenhaal to play the villain in Spider-Man sequelBefore we look at the future, it’s worth reflecting on just what a remarkable creation MCU is from both a financial, but also a critical, perspective. Marvel Studios has put out 20 interlinked films so far, featuring seven inidual characters and one team (s of the Galaxy), which it has then brought together in three Avengers movies (four if you count Captain America: Civil War) with the fourth (and final?) outing due next year. What’s more, it has done it with mostly “B”\u0026nbspcharacters.\u0026nbspThe comic book publisher’s prior practice had been to licence its top properties to others. This is how Sony got Spider-Man, and Venom, and 21st Century Fox got the X-Men suite of characters, and the Fantastic Four.\u0026nbspDespite this, not since Captain America, back in 2011, has an MCU film failed to gross more than $500m globally. Six have broken the $1bn barrier and Avengers: Infinity War raked in twice that.\u0026nbspCritics sometimes grouse about the popularity of superhero movies, and the stranglehold they hold over multiplex screen space and the global box office, but they’ve been remarkably kind to the MCU’s output when it comes to their reviews.\u0026nbspAll its movies have been certified fresh by review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, with scores ranging from 66 per cent (Thor: The Dark World) to 97 per cent (Black Panther), an achievement unmatched by any other major franchise.\u0026nbspIf you find Tomatoes’ binary “freshrotten” system too simplistic, how about Metacritic? It puts together a weighted average of critics’ reviews to create a “Metascore”, and also separates films into five bands (two red, one amber, two green).\u0026nbspAll but three of Marvel’s films boast a green, “generally favourable”\u0026nbspor better rating, with Black Panther’s 88 again at the top (indicating “universal acclaim”).\u0026nbspIt just wouldn’t do to have the Best Film Oscar going to a superhero flick, so the Academy has created a gong for “Outstanding Achievement in Popular Film”. It’s already been dubbed the Black Panther award.\u0026nbspThe Dark World again brings up the rear, its score of 54 rating puts its reviews into the “mixed or average”\u0026nbspband.\u0026nbspBut compare that with rival franchises. That 54 low point is still better than any of the three Fox Fantastic Four filmsWarner Bros has produced five movies in the much younger DC extended universe, just one of which (Wonder Woman) has garnered “universal acclaim”\u0026nbspwhile being “certified fresh”. They’ve all grossed more than $500m (I’m charitably excluding the disastrous Green Lantern here, which everyone tries to forget about) but not one has breached the $1bn barrier. “Troubled”\u0026nbspis a word that is frequently applied to the project.\u0026nbspDeadpool’ has been\u0026nbspFox’s best grossing superhero flick so farAlthough Fox’s 11-strong X-Men slate has produced several critical hits, it has still turned in three “certified rotten”\u0026nbspduds alongside them.\u0026nbspIts best gross of $783m, meanwhile, came courtesy of the R-\u0026nbspor 15-rated Deadpool, something no one really expected upon the delightfully anarchic movie’s release.\u0026nbspIt should be noted that I’m not allowing for inflation here, and the first X-Men film was released back in 2000, but even had I done so, the X-movies would struggle to hold a candle to the MCU. \u0026nbspThe critics who have speculated (plaintively sometimes) about superhero fatigue setting in got some ammunition courtesy of the (relatively) disappointing opening for Antman \u0026amp The Wasp.\u0026nbspBut that film has now grossed in excess of $100m more than the franchise’s first outing at $620m and counting, which isn’t too shabby for a second tier franchise with a light (for a superhero flick) production and marketing budget.\u0026nbsp“Never bet against Marvel,” said Forbes, reporting on the numbers. And given all that, why would you?In a word, gravity. It has even started to weigh on even a Star Wars franchise that managed to sell three bad movies to an adoring public and looked all but bomb proof until audiences shrugged their shoulders at Solo: A Star Wars Story, which now, shockingly, looks set for a loss despite enjoying mostly positive reviews.\u0026nbspSo Marvel’s job isn’t going to get an easier.\u0026nbspBut it still has cards it can play...This one is blindingly, glaringly obvious. Launching the MCU with mostly middling characters, in terms of public perception, was a big risk. Marvel then doubled down by producing some highly successful films starring heroes that were largely unknown outside of the comic buying public such as Antman, the s, even Dr Strange.Yet in spite, or perhaps because of, a willingness to roll the dice, even on a superhero who’s main power is shrinking in a movie featuring a fight on a Thomas the Tank Engine toy railway that results in Thomas suddenly growing to giant size and exploding out of a house, Marvel has proved remarkably conservative with respect to its leads.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.33 Superhero films set for release between 2016 and 2020 Show all 34Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Release date: 6 May 2016. Iron Man and Captain America are set to face off in this superhero blockbuster that will feature nearly all the Avengers but won’t be an Avengers film. It will also mark the first time Spider-Man will feature in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Sony having made a deal with Marvel Studios. Release date: 27 May 2016. Following the success of Days of Future Past, Apocalypse will follow the young X-Men team as the battle against Oscar Isaac’s titular villain as he gathers his four horsemen Magneto (Fassbender), Angel (Hardy), Storm (Shipp), and Psylocke (Munn). Expect carnage and no Wolverine. Release date: 5 August 2016. The first ‘supervillain’ film, Suicide Squad is also based in the DCEU (DC Extended Universe, where Batman and Superman live) and will introduce the world to Margot Robbie’s Harley Quinn and Jared Leto’s Joker. One of the more exciting upcoming DC films that’s for sure.Release date: 4 November 2016. Benedict Cumberbatch will debut in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe, where Captain America and Iron Man live) as the Sorcerer Supreme. The film already has an incredible cast, including Chiwetel Ejiofor, Rachael McAdams and Tilda Swinton. Release date: 20 February 2017. Kicking off 2017 is the Lego version of Batman, who will lead his own spin-off, having already featured in the amazing Lego Movie. Will Arnett voices the titular character, while Zach Garfianakis - from the Hangover - will voice The Joker. But will he better than Leto?Release date: 3 March 2017. Having not starred in X-Men: Apocalypse, Wolverine will return to the big screen in a solo film which was recently made R-Rated following the success of Deadpool. It is expected to be Hugh Jackman’s last outing as the titular character.734 7. s of the Galaxy Vol. 2Release date: 5 May 2017. Chris Pratt and the crew are returning to space in the sequel to the surprisingly successful s of the Galaxy. According to director James Gunn, the film will not feature Thanos, even though he will to play a major role in phase MCU Phase 3. Cast includes newcomers Kurt Russell and Pom Klementieff, as well as, rumour has it, Sylvester Stallone.Release date: 23 June 2017. Gal Gadot is returning to the DCEU in her very own film, marking the first female-led superhero film on this list. Chris Pine is on board to play Wonder Woman’s love interest.Release date: 7 July 2017. Yes, it is another Spider-Man reboot, having previously been redone with Andrew Garfield as the lead. However, this time it is part of the MCU, with Tom Holland as the titular character, and a heavily rumoured cameo by Iron Man could be in the pipeline. We can dream.Release date: 6 October 2017. In a strange announcement, Fox decided to withhold the release of Gambit until a future, as-yet unannounced date, which could be here, or this could be a completely separate project. Many suspect Deadpool 2 could nicely fit here, Fox capitalising on the success of the first film.Release date: 3 November 2017. Chris Hemsworth will be returning as the Norse God in his third solo MCU film. Flight of the Conchords’ Taika Waititi is on board to direct, and promises a fun adventure that will likely lead into Marvel’s next project, Infinity War.Release date: 17 November 2017. Hot on the heals of Thor comes Justice League Part One, the first DCEU team-up flick which will see Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg work together to fight bad guys.Release date: 12 January 2018. Kicking off 2018 will likely be the second Deadpool film, but then again, this could very well be another X-Men team-up. There’s also talk of an X-Force film, with Deadpool and other mutants teaming up to fight evil.Release date: 16 February 2018. The first non-white male-led superhero film in the MCU comes in the form of Black Panther, with Chadwick Boseman reprising the titular role, having also starred as the Panther in Civil War. Creed’s Ryan Coogler is on to direct what could be a very exciting film.Release date: 16 March 2018. The Flash will be the first DCEU film since Justice League, and sees Ezra Miller take the lead. Phil Lord and Chris Miller were supposed to pen the film before Disney snapped them up for the Han Solo-film, leaving Seth Grahame-Smith to take charge.Release date: 4 May 2018. And so, we finally get to the point of all these Infinity Stones! Thanos will be the big bad, with the Avengers needing to team up to defeat their biggest foe yet. It has previously been described as “the end of the Avengers as we know it”.1734 17. Ant-Man and The WaspRelease date: 6 July 2018. Peyton Reed will be back to direct this surprise sequel to one of the better received MCU films. While the name is ridiculous, at least Marvel are finally having a leading female superhero. Release date: 13 July 2018. Again, not much word on this one except it is thought to be X-Men spin-off New Mutants, something Josh Boone has been hit up to write.Release date: 20 July 2018. Avi Arad, Matt Tolmach, and Amy Pascal - the team behind the live-action Spider-Man films - are producing this ‘unrelated’ animated adaptation of the hero. Because you can never have too much Spider-Man, right?Release date: 27 July 2018. Another Justice League spin-off, Jason Momoa plays the leading man. Furious 7’s James Wan is on to direct, but little else is known about the film.Release date: 8 March 2019. We’ve hit 2019, and the first confirmed superhero film will be the first proper female-led MCU film. No-one is confirmed to be in the titular role of Carol Danvers just yet.Release date: 5 April 2019. Dwayne Johnson stars as the villain in this DCEU film which will be somewhat separate to the other DC films.Release date: 3 May 2019. The conclusion to the long drawn MCU saga. Expect a big finish with at least a few planets being destroyed.Release date: 14 June 2019. Soon after the Infinity War story reaches its conclusion, so will the Justice League’s. Not much is known, except Darkseid will likely be the villain for at least one of the parts.Release date: 12 July 2019. The concept of Inhumans (or Marvel’s mutants) has already been introduced in TV, through Marvel’s Agents of Shield, yet the film is expected to introduce the Royal Family who have yet to be seen in the show.Release date: 3 April 2020. Having debuted in Justice League Part One three years previously, Cyborg will finally be making his own outing, with Ray Fisher as the titular character.Release date: 1 May 2020. The first of three untitled Marvel films. There are a couple of contenders, the first is a likely sequel to Spider-Man with Sony, or a third s of the Galaxy film, thus finishing the trilogy.Release date: 19 June 2020. Before you start to worry, this has nothing to do with the Ryan Reynolds-starring flick that hit cinemas a little while ago. Instead, this will be another DCEU film that will likely spin-off from Justice League after the Green Lantern Corps cameo in one of the parts.Release date: 10 July 2020. As well as Spider-Man or s of the Galaxy sequels, a Doctor Strange or Black Panther one could fit in nicely here. Or perhaps Black Widow may finally get the solo-film she deserves.Release date: 6 November 2020. Some speculators also think a Blade film could fit in here, marking over 20 years since the first Blade. But many believe the character may be better suited to a Netflix series, as with Daredevil and Jessica Jones. There’s also talk of a Runaways film reaching cinemas at some stage.Release date: TBA. Now we’re onto the TBA release dates, the first of which is a Batman solo film, written and directed by Ben Affleck. When this is due, no one is quite sure but expect it sooner rather than later if Batman v Superman is a success. Release date: TBA (rumoured 2017). A sequel to Suicide Squad is expected to come in 2017 according to recent reports, but nothing has been confirmed. If the first is successful, it should come as no surprise for Warner Bros to rearrange their schedule to fit in this surefire hit.Release date: TBA. This is an odd one, as it has been confirmed Sony are wanting to release a Venom film completely unrelated to the upcoming Spider-Man reboot. Venom, as you may know, is a Spider-Man villain, intrinsically linked to Spider-Man, so it seems odd they would release a film unrelated to the rebooted project and not linked to the MCU.Well, now you mention it, there’s also that sequel to Fantastic Four that has seemingly been dropped by Fox. Plus, there’s the Gambit film which has been put on hold (but will likely fill an untitled Fox slot so we haven’t added it extra).

It would have been in the top 10 were it a Marvel outing.\u0026nbspLupita Nyong’o as Nakia\u0026nbspand Letitia Wright as Shuri\u0026nbspin ‘Black Panther’ (Marvel StudiosDisney)There are welcome signs that this is changing. Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is slated to play a big role in the MCU’s future. Scarlett Johansson’s Black Widow also looks like she’s finally going to get a solo outing, although her fans might have to wait a while. The next s outing is rumoured to focus not on\u0026nbspChris Pratt’s Peter Quill, but\u0026nbspmore on the character of Gamora, played by Zoe Saldana, who is of Domican and Puerto Rican descent but is bright green in the films.\u0026nbspApart from the fact that this is the right thing to do, a more erse roster ought to be good for the finances.\u0026nbspLet’s face it, if you’re going to shell out more than $200m in production costs, plus the same again (at least) for the marketing, you need a global audience. The domestic gross just won’t cut it.\u0026nbspTories, Ukipers and Trumpkins can cry about all they want, but the world is a pretty erse place. DC’s Suicide Squad provides another example of how lucrative ersity can be. It had Will Smith at the head of multi-racial cast, with Viola Davis as one of the main antagonists.\u0026nbspDespite the disdain of the critics, the film pulled in a more than healthy $750m, and might have done better had it secured a release in China and not been hampered by a 15 rating in countries like Britain and Australia. Deadline Hollywood nonetheless ranked it as the tenth most profitable movie of 2016. ‘Nuff said.\u0026nbspIt’s not that they’ve been, well, bad. But the MCU’s villains mostly haven’t been particularly memorable, at least not until recently.\u0026nbspIt might be asking a lot to find something that rivals the late Heath Ledger’s Oscar-winning turn as The Joker in Batman: The Dark Knight. That sets a very high bar.\u0026nbspBut there’s room for improvement. Beyond Tom Hiddleston’s multiple outings as Loki, I struggle to recall all that much about the others, having seen every MCU film on multiple occasions. They do rather merge into one another.\u0026nbspBut there are signs that that too is changing for the better.\u0026nbspJosh Brolin’s Thanos provides a black hole for the dizzying array of characters featured in Avengers: Infinity War to orbit, and helps bring together what might otherwise have served as a rather aimless series of spectacles.\u0026nbspA study in understated menace, what makes him stand out is his utter conviction that his genocidal vision is right and moral, by contrast to the nihilist portrayed in the comics.Tennant gets his evil on as Kilgrave in ’Jessica Jones’ (Netflix)Then there is the charismatic revolutionary Killmonger (Michael B Jordan). There are many, myself included, who found themselves rooting for him as much as for the Black Panther he faced off against.\u0026nbspOnly his methods, and carelessness towards the civilians getting in his way, make him a villain.This is a good sign, but Marvel’s going to need more multi-faceted and layered baddies if it’s going to counter the feeling of, oh, I see, another superhero flick. I dunno, fancy a game of Fortnite?\u0026nbspPS: If Marvel has any sense it will find a way to resurrect David Tennant’s Kilgrave, who made the first season of Netflix’s Jessica Jones so compelling. His cameos also livened up the disappointing second outing. Now there’s a truly memorable villain. Which brings us neatly to...I’m probably on a hiding to nothing with this one – Marvel Studio’s president Kevin Feige, who deserves much of the credit for the monster that’s been created, has been notably lukewarm about the prospect of bringing it\u0026nbspto the silver screen. Marvel has multiple properties, hosted by multiple broadcasters.\u0026nbspABC’s Agents of Shield started out shadowing the films. The show’s lead character Phil Coulson (Clark Gregg) appeared in the first Avengers movie, Thor and two of Iron Man’s three outings. He will show up in the 1990s set Captain Marvel too. Samuel L Jackson, who plays Nick Fury in the movies, also turned up in the show a couple of times.\u0026nbspBut it went on to erge and one of its stars, Chloe Bennet, notably expressed her frustration at the films’ failure to acknowledge the show.\u0026nbspYou could be forgiven for thinking that the mostly successful Netflix series featuring “street”\u0026nbspheroes trying to save their neighbourhoods rather than the galaxy, are set in an entirely different universe.\u0026nbspThey’re grimy, 15 rated, and violent. That violence feels much more real than what is depicted in the films. When people get hit they get hurt. They end up in hospitals. Rosario Dawson’s Night Nurse sometimes has to patch them up.\u0026nbspDeadpool showed how successful taking a 180 degree turn can be. It was produced for just $58m, about a quarter of what it costs to get a top line superhero flick done, and there were no 3D\u0026nbspcameras around on set either.\u0026nbspThe global\u0026nbspgross of the wildly successful ‘Spider-Man: Homecoming’The Defenders, in which four of the Netflix stars teamed up for a mini series that, sadly, added up to less than the sum of its parts, occasionally gets mentioned as a possibility for a film, albeit a distant one.\u0026nbspPerhaps that will change if superhero fatigue starts to set in and the studio has to think about something genuinely different to tickle audiences’ palates. Disney’s own streaming ambitions add a further ingredient to the TVfilm crossover stew. \u0026nbspThis is a card the studio really shouldn’t play. When story takes a back seat to spectacle, the film suffers. Warner’s first DC Universe outing, Man of Steel, was ruined by director Zack Snyder indulging in a spectacle laden battle between Superman and General Zod, which smashed up the city of polis. It was jarring –\u0026nbspthe comic book character would have done his damnedest to protect the city –\u0026nbspbut worse still, it was kind of boring.\u0026nbspThe first trailer for Brie Larson’s Captain Marvel is hereRuby Rose to star as lesbian superhero Batwoman in new seriesSupergirl to get television’s first ever transgender superheroThe same is true of X-Men: Age of Apocalypse. The hotly anticipated return of Brian Singer, who got the franchise rolling with the critically acclaimed first outing, also majored on spectacle, and the resultant film ending up a disappointing mess after an encouraging start. Story rules. Write that out 10,000 times. Then write it out again. \u0026nbspIf superhero fatigue really does start to set in, there’s always the X-Men – which will be under Disney’s control if and when the entertainment behemoth’s deal to buy a big chunk of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire makes it past America’s anti-trust watchdogs.\u0026nbspIf you bring the mutants into the MCU, and then have them fight a new team of Avengers, like they did in the widely successful Avengers v\u0026nbspX-Men comic book event, you’ll likely have another $2bn beast on your hands, or even multiple such creatures.\u0026nbspGeekdom is positively drooling at the mere thought of such an event. Those of us with a few miles on the clock might keel over if it ultimately gets announced.\u0026nbspHopefully there’ll be a hero or two around to save us.\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

According to the central bank, that person could have worked in any field of science including astronomy, biology, bio-technology, chemistry, engineering, mathematics, medical research, physics, technology or zoology.Some of the names suggested so far include Professor Stephen Hawking, who died earlier this year, and Ada Lovelace, the first computer programmer.Bank of England governor Mark Carney said: “I am delighted that the new £50 will celebrate the UK’s contribution to science. There is a wealth of iniduals whose work has shaped how we think about the world and who continue to inspire people today. “Our banknotes are an opportunity to celebrate the ersity of UK society and highlight the contributions of its greatest citizens. My colleagues and I look forward to hearing from the public as they think science and put forward their nominations.”Sarah John, chief cashier and director of notes, said: “Developing a new £50 note is an important step to ensure we can continue to provide secure banknotes that can be used with confidence. “For this note, we want people to nominate a variety of characters to reflect the brilliance and breadth of the UK’s contributions to the field of science.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

But its high street outlets in the UK suffered a 1 per cent decline and fell by 6 per cent in Ireland.Paddy Power Betfair chief executive Peter Jackson said: Quarter three was a good quarter for the group. In Europe, the encouraging momentum that we saw in quarter two accelerated further, with online revenue up 15 per cent.This momentum, which was evident in both Paddy Power and Betfair, is driven by enhancements in product and good execution in promotions and marketing.In the US, the exciting potential of the sports betting opportunity and the strength of our strategic positioning has been evidenced by our experience to date in New Jersey.In the UK, bookies have also been warning about the impact of a recent Government move to slash stakes on fixed-odds betting terminals.Paddy Power said the new £2 stake limit would result in a 33 per cent to 43 per cent decrease in machine gaming revenue, or £36m to £46m revenue impact.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

When I went in for my last day of recording, I wanted to have my back to them, because usually, you’re facing him so he can look right up and you can talk about it. But I didn’t want to see them and pretend they couldn’t see me.“When I realised what they were going for, I realised, ‘Oh, this is a moment in history’.”Buzz Lightyear actor Allen previously revealed the final scene is so emotional he could barely get through it. He described the way the film’s writers, Will McCormack and Stephany Folsom, decided to end the sequel as “so big” it startled him.Created with Sketch.

We know the UK government has started making such plans as a result of the growing demand for such a vote, demonstrated by last weekend’s march.“The EU should do the same, because MPs who back the People’s Vote are fast forming the biggest and most cohesive bloc in Westminster.”UK-EU transport links after Brexit ‘increasingly a cause for concern’MPs ‘far more likely to reject Brexit deal’ if unable to amend itPound sterling falls to six-week low as Theresa May faces Brexit backlPlaid Cymru Westminster group leader Liz Saville Roberts, who also met with Mr Barnier, said she had used the meeting to push for an extension to the negotiation period to accommodate a referendum.“I pressed Michel Barnier on protecting Wales’s interest through the extension of Article 50 and a People’s Vote,” she said.“In Westminster, with the prime minister’s proposals amounting to nothing more than a mix of fudge and fantasy, a People’s Vote is more likely than ever.”The EU has previously reacted cooly to suggestions that the period could be extended, but has not ruled it out. An extension would require the unanimous approval of all 28 EU leaders on the European Council.\u0026nbspSadiq Khan visited Brussels on Friday\u0026nbsp(Getty)Brussels is particularly wary about extending the transition into May, when Britain would have to take part in the next European Parliament elections if it was still in the EU.Mr Khan, speaking after a separate meeting on Friday, said: “The point I made to Michel Barnier, really quite forcefully, is that there is a possibility of the British parliament rejecting the deal that Mrs May secures from the EU.Created with Sketch.Brexit march for a final say – in pictures Show all 65Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Final Say campaigners take part in the peoples vote march for the future in London 20102018Red smoke from a canister hangs in the air as around 100,000 demonstrators march through London during a People\u0027s Vote anti-brexit demonstration savings banners and placardsMayor of London Sadiq Khan takes part in the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.MP Chuka Umunna (left) and MP Vince Cable (right) as MP Anna Soubry (centre) addresses Anti-Brexit campaigners at a rally after the People\u0027s Vote March for the Future in London, a march and rally in support of a second EU referendum.

In those circumstances, I suggested the EU should begin preparatory work on the extension of Article 50.“Because what would not be a good thing in my view is if we managed to get a referendum but it was too late because we had left the EU or the EU had not made preparations for an Article 50 extension.”Mr Khan added: “Whatever Theresa May brings back will probably be rejected by cabinet, almost certainly rejected by the party, and if not will definitely be rejected by parliament.“That’s why I said to Michel Barnier: listen, you need to start preparing for the possibility of extending Article 50 because if that is the case we will need time to have a referendum.”The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Delighted that he has come over to Northern Ireland and made a visit to the various ports, we look forward to continuing our engagement with him,” she told reporters.Government urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitWho are the key EU politicians involved Brexit negotiations?No 10 yet to decide on EU free movement after no-deal BrexitShe said her party has made it clear to the UK cabinet minister that “from the constitutional point of view but also from an economic point of view that it is very important that as well as not having any customs barriers, we cannot have any regulatory barriers”.Though the party leader struck an optimistic tone, her account of the meeting would suggest she doubled down on her red lines on checks on the Irish sea.The British government says it agrees with the DUP\u0026nbspand will not accept a customs border on the Irish sea, viewing it as a breach of sovereignty. But senior UK government officials have indicated that they would be willing to accept a regulatory barrier – a concession that would make finding common ground with the EU a lot easier.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator has said that there would have to be regulatory checks, however, and that they might increase ten-fold. There has been no outward sign that the EU is shifting its position in that regard.Ms Foster welcomed Mr Raab’s Friday visit to Northern Ireland, adding: “I am glad that he took the chance to visit the ports today because he would have been able to see what happens at the ports.“We are engaged in an ongoing process, we want to be as helpful as we can in these negotiations, we want to get a deal on exiting the European Union that is good for Northern Ireland and it can only be good for Northern Ireland if we remain a full part of the United Kingdom.”The dispute around the Northern Ireland border stems from a commitment by both the UK and EU to avoid a hard border between the Republic and the North, but disagreement on how this should be achieved once the UK leaves the EU and trade barriers are re-erected.Theresa May\u0027s decision to leave the single market and customs union means that there would ordinarily have to be checks on goods between the UK and EU, but both sides want to mitigate this for the special circumstances on the island of Ireland. The Good Friday Agreement stipulates that there can be no hard border.Created with Sketch.Brexit threatens life on the Irish border: in pictures Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.John Murphy flies the European flag outside his home near the border village of Forkhill, Co ArmaghAn abandoned shop is seen in Mullan, Co Monaghan.

There may yet be a Brexit agreement on the Irish border. The latest whispers out of meetings in Brussels are that the EU is preparing to offer a compromise solution on the so-called “backstop”. Whether it will be enough for the UK remains to be seen.But let’s suppose it is, and a withdrawal agreement is signed. Does that prevent a no deal? Not exactly.There are two things that could still cause a no-deal Brexit. Both bring a huge degree of uncertainty.EU plans compromise on customs union to solve Irish borderThe first is the parliamentary vote. Theresa May, you may remember, has no majority in the House of Commons and needs help. How the DUP, Labour, and Conservative Eurosceptics\u0026nbspvote will determine whether a deal passes parliament, even if it has been agreed between\u0026nbspnegotiators.The second uncertainty is over the future trading relationship. An outline of this was supposed to have been agreed by now, but the timetable has slipped because of a lack of progress on Northern Ireland, which the EU insists must be dealt with first.\u0026nbspIt is not widely understood that UK law states that this outline of the future relationship has to be presented to MPs before any vote on the withdrawal deal. But it is simply not clear how this will be possible.\u0026nbspTheresa May’s Chequers plan has been dismissed, and she has rejected the EU’s options of a loose free trade agreement or Norway-style single market participation. Negotiations are practically at square one for this, with practically no time left.It is widely claimed that any document will have to be a fudge. But the EU said at the Salzburg summit that any outline must be specific – not just a list of vague aspirations.Brexit talks ‘close to a deal’ says DUP leader Arlene FosterGovernment urged to revive fishing for endangered tuna after BrexitArron Banks is hoping to become some kind of Brexit martyrUK construction dogged by Brexit uncertainty in OctoberHow agreement could be reached on anything substantial is unclear, and neither side looks able to back the other’s proposals. It’s possible the issue of the trading relationship could make a comeback and sink the whole thing.And yet, if we cannot sign a deal, Britain may still avoid heading over the cliff edge.\u0026nbspThe government says emphatically it is prepared to go ahead with a no-deal Brexit, but the truth is the country is simply not prepared. The physical infrastructure needed is not in place and will take years to build, at ports, airports, and elsewhere.\u0026nbspThere is certainly not a majority in the House of Commons for a no-deal, and the political damage to the government of going ahead with one far outweighs any benefit.However, there remains the option to revoke Article 50 – even temporarily – before March 29.\u0026nbspEmpty supermarket shelves, grounded flights, and queues at ports are a prime minister’s worst nightmare. Desperation to avoid this at all costs means that a\u0026nbsplast-minute government U-turn is more than just a possibility\u0026nbsp– it’s likely.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

An acrobat fell from the top and died in 1863. It remains a mystery, a travesty for some, that Britannia - the monument’s embodiment of the nation - has her back to the sea. These days she turns her back on a single one-man tent too, a home, a shelter erected on the shore.This was the last scene I saw in the town. I was leaving. I thought of how child’s play, in its innocence and vitality, continues amidst our hunched, phone-tapping adolescence and adulthood.Some delegates said gathering the documents would prove difficult for many travellers who may have lived in the UK for their entire lives but might never have registered with a doctor or attended school.Sarah Zawacki, a representative of the Roma Support Group which works with primarily Polish, Romanian and Slovakian Roma gypsies, said language barriers and distrust of government was also preventing the community applying for settled status.She told the meeting the £65 cost per application - which is an online process - was also a problem.Our work with (Roma communities) found that there was also a very low awareness of the need to apply to secure their position in the UK.Now they know there is this application, but it\u0027s £65 - many are on very low incomes and have very large families and it\u0027s just unfeasible.Then there is the language barrier - many speak some English but it\u0027s not the level needed to access this application.There are an estimated 300,000 Roma living in the UK.Ms Zawacki said women in Roma communities are particularly vulnerable as they may never have worked or been registered with an official organisation even if they have lived in the UK for decades as they would traditionally be looking after children.She said the same concerns applied to the elderly who may have been brought to the UK to be looked after or to look after children.Trust is also such a problem that those who came to the organisation for help are unwilling to answer an anonymous survey asking only Do you have a chip passport and Do you have £65 because of the questions\u0027 connection with immigration authorities.Asked if it was possible the UK could carry out mass deportations of Roma gypsies she said: The Home Office has given no clarity on what will happen to people who have their application refused apart from that they can apply again - even then they would have to pay another £65.The conference comes a week after the Government announced a £9m\u0026nbspfund to help vulnerable people - such as people with learning or physical disabilities, mental health problems or low literacy - gain settled status.The government uses a digital system to track settled status, but among attendees at the Traveller Movement conference there were calls for a physical certificate to be provided that can be passed on to children and grandchildren if their immigration status is called into question.A representative of the Traveller Movement said one of the goals was to ensure that part of the £9m\u0026nbspfund was awarded to organisations working with travellers and Roma communities.The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

It will serve as an opportunity for businesses to reach people, he said.WhatsApp update finally brings stickers to messaging appThe status feature is something like the stories tool that appears in Instagram and Facebook, as well as WhatsApp. It allows people to post updates that will appear to all of their friends, letting them share photos or text and then letting it disappear afterwards.WhatsApp has struggled to come up with ways to show its users ads: without a feed, like Instagram or Facebook, there are few places for them to be injected.When it dropped its subscription fee in 2016, the company posted a blog post making clear that ads would never interrupt your communication, further adding to the issues about how advertising could be shown within the app.But the status feature appears to have solved that problem, allowing WhatsApp to slide marketing posts in between updates from friends, like it does with Instagram stories.As well as serving as something like a feed, WhatsApp\u0027s status feature has quickly become a huge part of the app. It now has a huge number of users, and is more popular than many major apps like Snapchat.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our Community Guidelines.You may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or inciteful language is not acceptableDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Follow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Minds comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

A seven-hour slog live from Westminster City Hall, presented by Adam Hills, Maya Jama and the network’s spare part Alan Carr, who set the tone for most of what followed interviewing Foxy from SAS: Who Dares Wins.“It’s been announced you’ve got a new Stand Up To Cancer series starting next year. Tell us about it.”“I can’t.”“Give us some names.”“I can’t.”No sooner had we written that one off than it become apparent there was no Bake Off special either — just a promo for a show that will be screened months from now. No matter, though. With its lofty public-serving hat on, Adam Hills faithfully promised Channel  would “educate, entertain and inspire” us for the remainder of the evening, which must have looked quite good written down.In practice The first thing to say about Stand Up To Cancer is that it featured some of the most beautul and affecting films you’ll see on a telethon.They needed to be, as well, ’cos you don’t have to have watched the event to know it contained a lot of feeble stunts and sketches.I also could have lived without Adam Hills carrying out a threat to have his pubic hair waxed, live, once the total reached £million, and the educational segment, with Katherine Ryan and Chris O’Dowd, which was sunk the moment he announced: “We’re goingto put the humour in tumour.”Tellingly, there was also a fair bit of non-network talent involved, including James Corden.I’ll not dwell, though, on what Channel ’s Twitter feed did to the Carpool Karaoke segment, where Michael Buble talked about his son’s illness, except to say it was one of those productions where the left hand wasn’t talking to the right.So when Chris O’Dowd was moved to tears talking about the cancer films, the studio audience was guffawing loudly at Alan Carr manoeuvring himself into background position in a Prue Leith wig.By a process of elimination and production gaffs, though, it became apparent the centre of Channel ’s entire universe now is Gogglebox, which had created an all-star version with Louis Tomlinson, Danny Dyer and daughter Dani for the occasion.They missed a trick, frankly, by not capturing Louis falling asleep to The X Factor. But it was still riotously funny watching the regulars pick apart Naked Attraction, with the choicest comment being: “That one looks like Homer Simpson’s mouth.”This was not the sound of people laughing with the channel, though. They were laughing at it.A network that was once known for being brave and innovative is now far more readily associated with a genital parade, third-rate reality shows and cakes than anything in the way of ground-breaking drama or comedy.In fact, the only two genuinely funny people on its payroll are probably Jimmy Carr and Sean Lock, who had to make way, at Stand Up To Cancer, for box-ticking randoms like Mo Gilligan, who was served this testicular curve-ball by Maya Jama.“Do you have a special name for your balls, by any chance ”He does.The Big Narstie Show.So there I was, gently drting off as Darcey Bussell went through the technical motions on Strictly. “The control in the rise and fall. Strong in the two-three.”When, unless I’m imagining it, she told Sean Walsh: “You have to smooth it out and iron it out, so it isn’t jerking off or skippy.”Suddenly I was all ears for the show’s Halloween special – an event which, for three good reasons, is usually my least favourite of the run.Firstly, Tess always expects a laugh for referring to it as a “spook-tacular”.

There were announcements on schools funding, defence, moving “from disposable to reusable cups across all beverage types” — even a tax break for public loos. More money for social care and Universal Credit.Shopkeepers will breathe a sigh of relief at a hefty cut to business rates.There were hints of more money for the police. Sun readers will also welcome the tax freezes on beer, spirits, cider and short-haul flights.But the big bucks — some £.billion of the £.billion extra the Government expects to spend come - — went to the NHS, fulfilling the Prime Minister’s summer promise to increase spending as a th birthday present to a health service creaking under the strain of an ageing population.The question, of course, was how the Chancellor was going to pay for it.Before the Budget, all sorts of grim possibilities had been floated.Extra taxes on white-van men, lower- ing the VAT threshold and tightening the rules about National Insurance contributions. Taxes on plastic cups . Taxes on pretty much anything, really.Perhaps the best thing the Chancellor did in his Budget, then, was say “No”.To almost all of it. For an hour or more, I waited for the sting in the tail — the bit where Fiscal Phil turned Hatchet Hammond.But it never came. In paying for his promises — and above all, the NHS — the Chancellor was helped by better-than-expected borrowing forecasts, which showed our economy’s remarkable record of creating jobs is still going strong.But he has also made a calculation that it is better to live with a small and manageable deficit than try to drag the finances back into surplus at the cost of higher taxes. And that voters will see through Labour’s promises to hike borrowing back to stratospheric levels in the name of a socialist transformation of the economy.He decided, in other words, people pay enough tax already.And he’s right. All too often in recent years, it has felt like the answer to every problem — at least from Whitehall’s point of view — is higher taxes and more interference.Hammond was never going to copy his tax-slashing Tory predecessor Nigel Lawson, who made it a point of principle to abolish a dferent tax with every Budget.But at least he drew a line in the sand, deciding it is better when hardworking people get to keep more of their own money.That ending austerity should not, and must not, mean higher tax bills. That hard work should mean hard cash in your pocket.Yes, Hammond — like every Chancellor since Gordon Brown — made too many fiddly little announcements.But he avoided the kind of whacking- great raid on taxpayers’ pockets so many were urging him towards.This doesn’t mean we are out of the woods. Britain’s growth prospects over the next half-decade are still extraordinarily sluggish.The outcome of the Brexit deal will drastically change the fiscal picture.In many ways, Hammond’s speech yesterday was a holding action ahead of the much bigger decisions to come.We still need much more radical action to kickstart growth and productivity. Despite the scale of the housing crisis, for example, there was only tinkering around the edges.But a large part of delivering that growth must involve making the economy more dynamic, more competitive and letting people keep more of their own money as a reward for their efforts — moving the country in the direction outlined by Philip Hammond, rather than the one sketched out by Jeremy Corbyn .The overall verdict on the Budget  The jokes were worse than expected but the numbers were better.More spending on the NHS, tax cuts for millions of voters and the worst ideas kept out of it.Yes, borrowing will be higher — but low enough to keep us out of the danger zone and far, far lower than under a Corbyn government.That is a menu Philip Hammond will be pretty happy with.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Another £.billion to iron out Universal Credit problems. A near five per cent hike in the minimum wage. A big, welcome cut in business rates for struggling firms.New ideas flowed: a levy on web giants’ UK revenues, potentially raising £million, is long overdue — though Philip Hammond must ensure the ­burden does not fall on online shoppers.There was major funding to help councils transform our hollowed-out High Streets, including turning vacant shops into homes. A huge increase in firms’ annual investment allowance will let them deduct from taxable profits up to £million spent on tools and machinery.Heathrow’s e-gates will now speed up entry for visitors from the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as well as Europe — a symbol of a global Britain open for business.Some bad ideas The Sun has criticised, including the proposed “latte levy” on plastic cups, were binned. Duty was frozen again on fuel, as well as beer.Even the OBR’s normally pessimistic forecasts were on Mr Hammond’s side. Growth is predicted to rise steadily, albeit too slowly. Unemployment is set to fall to its lowest in  years.We wish the Chancellor had outlined more radical, visionary low-tax measures. He will need them should Brussels shove us into a no-deal Brexit. But that gripe aside, what was not to like The Tories must not try to ape Corbyn’s £trillion spending fantasy. But it is not “Corbyn-lite” to spend billions fixing Britain’s most pressing problems, evenwe are still running a deficit.As for Corbyn himself, it was obvious he took in barely a word of the Budget.In his “response” he merely recited his normal scripted complaints, flubbing his words and shouting randomly, as is now traditional. He somehow contrives to make even this chaotic Government look like a model of competence.Budgets often unravel when acres of small print are finally scrutinised.But for now... nice one, Chancellor.ANGELA Merkel is a once-brilliant politician scuppered by an arrogant disregard for voters.For years she was admired worldwide. Then she flooded Germany with a million migrants, enraging the public, fuelling extremism and sealing her own downfall.Don’t expect Brussels to learn from it.Their contempt for citizens is even worse.

burglars","story":"Sophie Hannah wrote A Dark Time to pass on security hints and tips to homeowners who find themselves at increased risk of burglary during the winter months.Seven homes in the UK are burgled every minute across a calendar year.A study of , homeowners carried out by a home security firm to coincide with the launch of the book found  per cent of Brits have no security measures in place whatsoever.A Dark Time is the latest entry in Hannah’s Waterhouse and Zailer series, which started in  with the release of Little Face, which sold over , copies in the UK.Sophie Hannah said: “I’ve really loved writing A Dark Time.I had an idea that Id really wanted to try out for ages – and raising awareness around the increased risks to home security now that the nights are getting darker was the perfect fit for executing it.My story idea needed exactly that setting, a dark night, and involved a burglary of a very peculiar kind – a puzzle that I knew my detectives Simon Waterhouse and Charlie Zailer would enjoy solving.UK homes are at an elevated risk of burglary thanks to the clocks going back, according to research.December was revealed as the peak time for break-ins across the UK, with  per cent of Brits experiencing a burglary in the last year alone.And six in  Brits feel more vulnerable to a break-in when the nights grow longer.However, keeping our homes warm and making sure energy bills are paid are the nation’s top concerns after the clocks go back – ahead of securing our castles.Nearly a quarter of Brits have fitted a security alarm to warn off potential intruders, and  per cent keep their house lights on to make it look like someone is home.A further  per cent close their blinds or curtains while they’re out, and just under a tenth have bought a dog to deter burglars from targeting their property.Lee Jasper, security expert at ADT said: “Year on year, we have seen a  per cent increase in burglaries during the darker months.So it’s vital that people put the right security measures in place to help protect their homes to avoid falling victim.“The research shows we’re feeling more vulnerable as a nation when the clocks go back, however there is a clear lack of awareness when it comes down to preventing burglaries.“We’re hoping that the launch of A Dark Time can help the nation safeguard their homes, in an entertaining and engaging way.”A Dark Time is available as a free download from the ADT website from Monday nd October on: https:www.adt

dficult to identy his age.Students and parents claim he lied to British authorities about his age to get an education, as his previous qualications were not recognised in the UK.The Home Office has taken on the investigation into the age of the pupil and how he became enrolled at the school.When asked for a comment a spokesman for the Home Office said: “We do not routinely comment on inidual cases.”Sources at the Home Office confirmed that the investigation was being treated “seriously” and appealed for the pupil to be given privacy.In a statement, Stoke High School said: “This is a matter for the Home Office and we have referred it to them.School bosses dropped a suggestion from a previous statement which suggested that the pupil was an asylum seeker.It continued: The student is not attending the school at this time.“We can not comment further on an inidual case, but we have followed Government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any admissions matter. ”Parents have blasted the school over the investigation, accusing school bosses of trying to sweep it under the carpet.One mum fumed in a Facebook post: So My son’s school now let’s in ‘ year old men’ claiming to be a  year old.He’s been there since the start of last term, that’s some huge security breach.Not funny at all but ffs look at his picture of him in class c’mon now I’m  he looks older

who did not want to be named, told the East Anglican Daily Times: “This is extremely concerning.He has told students he has had to lie to get into high school to complete his GCSEs.”A pupil took an image of the inidual dressed in unorm during a year  maths class.The text across the image reads: How is there a  year old man in our maths class.Another parent raged: “My son goes to the school and it is not a nice thought that this man is around children and sitting with them at lunch.”If there is a doubt about someones age as part of an immigration case, the Home Office can arrange for social workers to undertake an assessment.Because there are dferent rules for the treatment of adult and child asylum seekers, the authority has to establish at the outset the age category an inidual is in.Age indicators can include assessments of physical appearance such as height, build, facial hair and voice pitch.The Sun Online has approached the Home Office and Stoke High School for further

Ghostbusters . Indiana Jones And The Annoying Son. The horrors that unfolded after Superman IV.Buttheres one movie that would benefit us all to see play out in Westminster, its True Lies : Mr Cameron Comes To Town. Otherwise known as the latest instalment in the Entitlement Chronicles.Theres nothing quite like over-weening self-belief for encouraging people to make arses of themselves, so we must thank Eton, Oxford and the Bullingdon Club for instilling so much of it in David William Donald Cameron, scion of William IV and une grande dame of believing he was born for the role.Today hes announced - well, lets be fair, he confided in a friend who put it on the front page of The Sun - he is bored s***less and would quite like to be made first a peer, and then Foreign Secretary. We have not been informed whether his preferred post is linked in any way to the skirt-lting, achievement-free high-jinks of his old mucker Boris Johnson in that position, because a spokesman refused to comment on the article. Perhaps that was because his boss, who was once such a bad PR man for Carlton TV he would answer the press office phone pretending to be the cleaner in order to evade questions, considered the press release to be all the info anyone needed.  David is dedicated to public service and has often said he wouldnt rule out a public role one day, domestically or internationally, said the friend, in an instruction to the nations current rulers to get him a cushy job in either the UN, NATO, or the international male modelling sector. After all, David Gandys going on paternity leave and those swimming trunks wont sell themselves.  He is only  and still a young man, added the friend, although it is unclear whether he was talking about the portly former PMs age, or his softening waist measurement. For since ordering a referendum that had the same effect on the nation as a dodgy takeaway, and leaving the resulting sloppy mess on the mat, Dishface has slunk off to enjoy the fruits of  fairly disastrous years in office. Those benefits have so far included a third home, not one but two pound, faux-shepherd huts, and a reported pound, advance for the memoirs he has conspicuously failed to write in the posh boy sheds, which some fool had installed a bed in.  He has been spotted lunching with Nick Clegg, dipping into the private gentlemens club Whites which he had abandoned when running for office, shooting game in Oxfordshire and making big money speeches. But his mates cant play tennis at lunchtime, Jeremy Clarkson is barely speaking to him and his former Number  is scooping up all the post-Parliamentary jobs and cash. So a permanent state of well-remunerated chillaxing is not making Cameron happy. Aww. Sadly a nice quiet job in Brussels is now off the cards after some bright spark called a vote to seepeople agreed with a multi-homed millionaire with a mouth like a cats bum. But there are a few jobs in public le that would suit all of us right down to the ground, and involve him fixing some of the problems he created. For example: . Libya  Making the man a peace envoy to the failed state riven by factional jihadis may be the only thing that will redeem Cameron to international historians. The man who once walked the streets of Tripoli accepting the jubilation of crowds freed from the oppression of Colonel Gaddafi would surely find it an easy task to persuade them to stop beheading, trafficking, murdering, raping and throwing desperate migrants into the Mediterranean in things that are called boats only by the criminally insane. If he found that too tricky, perhaps he could concentrate on collecting all the guns he released to the fundamentalist militia when he ordered RAF bombing raids on Gaddafis armouries, on the basis that Brits arming the rebels was not allowed, but Brits bombing a path to the weapons was a great wheeze. No  Well then perhaps he could try: . Food banks  At the start of Camerons reign in  , the Trussell Trust - largest food bank provider in the UK - handed out , food packs to people who relied on charity to eat. By the time he abdicated responsibility in   it was .million. And the Trussell Trust runs only about half of all food banks, so the real figure may be twice that. Even a cursory glance will inform you that David Cameron is not a man who has ever gone without pudding, so who better to be put in charge of ensuring pensioners, children, and hard-working but poorly-paid adults get fed  All right, they might find Weetabix, teabags and tins of beans are replaced with pheasant, dessert wine and foie gras, but whats a little gout matter when you can wobble your chins with joy.  . Hideous Gideon If that doesnt float your vengeance boat perhaps youd like to task him with releasing the nation from the cold, dead hands of George Osborne, the man who changed his name to sound more Prime Ministerial but thought being a lizard wouldnt matter. Im sure Gideons paying tax on all that lovely wonga hes making while planning how to chop up Theresa May and put her in his freezer, but perhaps David could confirm for us that none of it has found its way to Panama. . BORIS. F***ING BORIS Of the three Tory leaders who were stupid enough to give Boris Johnson a job, only Cameron failed to make him resign. The blond buffoon has trailed in his wake since school, knocking over ornaments, goosing the girls and generally annoying everyone. Its time Cameron took responsibility for the objectionable hound and had him neutered and enrolled in puppy school. . Oh yes, almost forgot. Total chaos  With the  Health and Social Care Act, Cameron cut a poundbillion-a-year management tier out of the NHS and then wondered why no-one was managing the NHS very well. And instead of properly funding social care, he took more money from the NHS to pay for it, while removing money from local authorities so they couldnt pay for it, with the net result that neither the NHS or social care had enough money. Then he cut every single part of the state. He removed investment from the economy. He sold the Post Office, Eurostar and Northern Rock for less than you could get at a boot sale and had the brass neck to say that the resulting economic despair was Labours fault. To top it all, he put the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in a blender just to get rid of Nigel Farage, when all he actually needed to do was throw a few French waitresses at him. Were left with constitutional crisis, talk of barbed wire in Ballyconnell and Nigel has persisted like gristle stuck in a back molar. If Cameron really wants to make himself useful and perform a public service he could become chairman of the board at LBC, and fire the snivelling little toad.The list of Camerons cock-ups is long and glorious enough for anyone to spot that politics, and possibly cutlery, is beyond him. Theresa May has a drastic lack of achievement, but unlike her predecessor shes not got a failed state, starvation or laziness on her CV. There could be nothing more just, more popcorn-tastic, than rubbing Camerons nose in the crap he left us to deal with. If theres anyone who needs to learn about shit, its him.

The Sun reports today the former Prime Minister is bored of living in his luxury shed and is mulling ato politics. He’s apparently decided that being Foreign Secretary would be an appropriate sort of job for a man of his experience and stature. There are precedents for former Prime Ministers going on to serve in other Cabinet roles, most notably Alec Douglas-Home who was Foreign Secretary under Edward Heath following his brief spell in No . But Mr Cameron’sto the frontline is unlikely to be viewed as a noble act of public service. Having been handed the keys to office he then trashed the property, insulted the neighbours, impoverished the staff and then recklessly torched the building. He now reportedly wants to swagger back into Toad Hall after others have attempted to clean up the mess. Good luck with that. It is an indication how much our politics has changed that the Prime Minister can weather so many ministerial resignations without it apparently affecting her standing.The departure of Tracey Crouch , one of the more likeable Tories, follows that of David Davis, Boris Johnson, Amber Rudd, Michael Fallon, Damian Green, Steve Baker, Justine Greening, Greg Hands and Philip Lee. When the bar is so low you wonder how Chris Grayling is still in a job. The Prime Minister should be alarmed that many of those siding with Ms Crouch are from the Brexiteer camp. In some cases their opposition to FOBTs is based on genuine concern but you suspect that others have seized on the issue as yet another way of undermining the Conservative leadership. The sharks are clearly swimming as a pack. Expect them to circle again today when the report into Amber Rudd’s resignation as Home Secretary is released. The Times reveals the inquiry will pin the blame on blunders by Home Office officials."},{"url":null,"title":"mps not impressed david cameron","story":"NewsMPs are not impressed David Cameron mightto frontline politics because hes bored s***lessTom Watson said it would be \"outrageous\" for the former PM to make a come backShareByNicola BartlettPolitical Correspondent:,  NOV NewsMr Camerons news was not welcomed by MPs \"Get politics updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMPs are not impressed with the news that David Cameron is mulling ato politics after his resignation following the Brexit referendum. The former Prime Minister has reportedly said he is bored s***less - and wants to be Foreign Secretary. Deputy Labour Leader Tom Watson said it was outrageous. He told GMB: I think that guy ran away from a Referendum result that he imposed on the country and he had a responsibility to take us through Brexit and the negotiations. To just sort of consider coming back asit’s an entitlement was actually part of the problem we had with David Cameron in the first place.” The Shadow Culture Secretary was among a series of Labour MPs who reacted to the reports. The Sun reported the -year-old as telling friends he wanted toto the front benches two years after leaving  Downing Street in the wake of the Brexit vote. Camerons resignation came just a year after he clinched a surprise majority in an election against Labours Ed Miliband. But his premiership ended in disaster when a majority of the country voted to leave the EU. Giving his resignation speech outside the door of  Downing Street, Cameron said: “I was absolutely clear about my belief that Britain is stronger, safer and better off inside the EU. I made clear the referendum was about this, and this alone, not the future of any single politician, including myself.  Shadow education minister Angela Rayner labelled his rumouredas bizarre. Ms Rayner, MP for Ashton-under-Lyne, tweeted: Just when you thought politics couldnt get anymore bizarre. No David please stay in retirement you caused enough damage last time. The paper said Mr Cameron would not be against the idea of cabinet recall in the ministry of whoever succeeds Theresa May as Prime Minister. Shadow communities and local government secretary Andrew Gwynne wrote: God. No. Didnt he do enough damage first time round   Please spare us all. Redcar MP Anna Turley said: The sense of entitlement is unreal. Please go away and think about what youve done, while Emily Thornberry posted a facepalm emoji - a picture used to display frustration or embarrassment at a certain situation. Yvette Cooper tweeted: What, because it worked out so well last time  Man, you ripped up our closest international partnership. By accident. That makes you even worse than Boris Johnson. But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith had a more measured reaction to the news. He told GMB his successor should have stayed in the post after the Brexit vote saying: “I actually thought that he should have taken the responsibility having called the Referendum to have seen this through and not resigned. I was pretty unhappy with him for doing that. That was his responsibility. I don’t know whether it’s true or not, I haven’t spoken to him. Of course, it’s always open to him to do that, whether he comes back into parliament or goes into the Lords. I would find it rather peculiarhe wanted to do that.” "},{"url":null,"title":"brand new home wonky brickwork","story":"NewsBrand new home with wonky brickwork becomes laughing stock of neighbourhoodDarren Harris sayshis marriage wasnt so strong the state of the house in Pembrokeshire, Wales, could have finished itShareCommentsByLaura Clements:,  NOV Newsthis.style.displaynone\" Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror incoming video brand-new-house-bad-neighbours-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:,video.header.bidding.enabled:,bundledCss:,recommendations:https:mab.data.tm-awx rhs,modularCss:true,newslettersURL:https:communicatoremail F QVgiPbuQPTrjCOF~PhHv_ ,nativeAppBanner:true\"\"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA brand new home with wonky brickwork and a sinking garden has become the laughing stock of its neighbourhood. Darren Harris forked out pound, for his four-bedroom home in Pembrokeshire, Wales, before it was built. But he says the condition of it has reduced his family to tears - and left his neighbours in stitches, Wales Online reports. Darren claims the property has a garden that is not level, a badly-fitted door and paving stones laid into the ground without cement.Astonishingly, he even says thathis marriage wasnt so strong, the state of the house could have finished it.  Darren says he has dealt with more than  defects since he got the keys for his new-build. Even his neighbours have been laughing at his expense, he says, pointing out the wonky brickwork at the side of the house. Persimmon, who built the house, say they are aware of the concerns and are working to reach a satisfactory conclusion. Mr Harris claims the problems started on day one. In June, I got the keys to my house and we drove down to the property, he said. The neighbours came over and asked meI had seen the brickwork on the back of the house.  They said to me We have been having a bit of a laugh and a giggle. When Mr Harris took a look, he claims he was confronted with wavy brickwork that wasnt straight and looked unsightly. The -year-old civil engineer was shocked. I know all about brickwork. Im a builder myself, and have run my own company for  years, he said. But the walls were just the start of his problems. As he entered his finished house for the first time, he tried to put the key in the door. But the door wouldnt budge. We couldnt get in, he said. I thought there must be a problem and went back to the site office. A Persimmon agent came back with me and in the end, he had to shoulder-barge the door to get it open.  It turned out the door frame had been fitted badly, he claimed.But the problems carried on. Mr Harris said: The problems are unbelieveable. He had bought the house at Martello Park, Pembroke before it was built. Together with his we, who is an area manager for Greggs, he has a number of buy-to-let properties in Pembrokeshire. He had planned to rent out the house once it had been completed. When we went to see the development initially, we looked round the show home, Mr Harris said. It looked like a nice spot, with views onto Pembroke Castle, so we put a deposit down in February . But ever since he got the keys, he claims the reality has been far from perfect. As well as the poor brickwork, we have found paving slabs have been laid straight onto rubble and earth, without any cement, he alleged.  The ground isnt level in the garden, the drain covers are sticking out of the ground, and the drains are positioned in the wrong place so the water runs straight past them. While I was there, I saw a worker laying some slabs and I could see he was doing it all wrong. Im a bricklayer by trade, so it was clear to me there were no footings under the paving. Even the guttering is all wrong, and not just on my property. None of the guttering reaches the end of the houses and water cascades down the sides when it rains. While I was mowing the lawn, I kicked my foot on the raised drain cover and actually broke my foot, causing me to take three weeks off work. Its caused my we and I no end of worry and stress. She has been in tears. If my marriage wasnt so strong this could have finished us.  Mr Harris, who lives in Sutton Coldfield in the Midlands, posted pictures of his house on Facebook. He says he is not usually the type of person to take to social media, but he was directed to a Facebook page for Persimmon home owners. He said: After I posted my story, I was contacted by Persimmon who said they would like to address my complaints. They sent a young guy round – he could only have been  years old. He spent half a day taking doors on and off, and making it worse. While Persimmon agreed to recty some of the issues, the problems persisted and Mr Harris took to fixing the problems himself. He drove the -mile round trip between the Midlands and Pembrokeshire throughout the summer, staying on a mattress in the back room of the Martello Park property.  Now, after spending thousands of his own money to fix the problems, Mr Harris has decided to take the national house builder to court. I have been on to head office. I have been brave enough to take them on and take them to the small claims court, he said. The rectication work they attempted was not acceptable. I have given them the opportunity to put it right. I have had to put off getting my tenants in, which has resulted in losses of pound,. We have been forced to get on with the retrospective work ourselves and it has cost us thousands. Thats the only way I could get the house finished and ready for our tenants. A spokesman for Persimmon Homes West Wales said: We are aware of Mr Harris’ concerns and we are working to reach a satisfactory conclusion. We have many happy customers across South Wales and we take customer service seriously.

Great Yarmouth Charter Academy - which last month called in ‘unorm police’ to measure girls’ skirt hems - told -year-old Courtney Dougal to take off the knitted tribute. School bosses said the symbol was “too large” - despite being just cm bigger than the traditional paper poppy. Courtney, in Year  at the Norfolk high school, had worn the poppy with pride on Tuesday only to be told by principal Barry Smith to remove it. Her dad Raymond Dougal, , said he was “absolutely disgusted” by the school’s tough stance.  He said: “I am absolutely disgusted that they have made her take the poppy off. It is a little bit on the larger side but that is what makes it. “If it was huge and looked ridiculous I would not have sent her in it. “As it is it looks lovely. She is only little so that probably makes it look bigger than it is.” He added: “I said to Courtney to just go in and wear it but she didn’t dare.” Mr Dougal bought the poppy in his local pub The Sportsmans Arms in Great Yarmouth, with contributions going to the Royal British Legion. Landlord John Vale said the school “overstepped the mark” this time, branding the ban “disrespectful”. Charter Academy defended the move. A statement said: “Poppies are available in school and we encourage pupils and staff to wear them unfortunately in this case we felt that the large knitted poppy was not appropriate to wear in school.  “We are keen that pupils recognise and respect the sacrices made in war, and pupils are being encouraged to learn the poem In Flanders Field. “Many will be taking part in the town’s Remembrance Day service on November . “We are also refurbishing and relocating plaques commemorating former pupils of the Great Yarmouth Grammar School that served in battle, as a permanent reminder of that important heritage.” Last month, furious parents hit out after the school called in unorm police to measure theof girls’ skirts. Experts from a nearby unorm shop were consulted after pupils started turning up in short skirts. he academy has previously been criticised for its strict new rules on unorm and haircuts - banning one style called Meet Me at McDonald’s. The curly-on-top, short-at-the-sides look has been compared to the eighties New Romantic movement. It features shaved sides and a long tousled top with a floppy fringe.

Dashcam footage of the incident near Waltham Cross in Hertfordshire appears to show the BMW driver slam on the brakes before he is hit. But some online viewers have speculated that the smash, which happened on the A, may have been deliberate and a cash for crash scam. Footage shows the silver BMW approaching the roundabout at normal speed before apparently slamming on the brakes.  The car with the dashcam rear-ends the vehicle and they both come to a stop. A man and woman then immediately clamber out of the BMWs passenger seats to confront the other driver. The pair begin gesticulating angrily and the man begins rubbing his head as though he is hurt. Both drivers pull over to the side of the road and an argument appears to break out over the cause of the collision.  Writing on YouTube, the man with the dashcam footage claimed: The driver for some unknown reason brakes to a complete stop. The driver in the frame wears a baseball cap and glasses. A person blocking my route to a safe place to stop the car allows me to safely stop my car when the driver and passenger have switched seats. The driver walks out of the front passenger door and puts on a baseball cap and glasses. The passenger then sends me his data and discusses why the accident occurred.  But viewers are split on exactly who is at fault for the crash. One YouTube commenter wrote: How slow is this guys reflexes  Leave proper braking distance or learn how to drive﻿. But another person slammed the BMW driver, claiming: This is a scam, do not fall for this, call the police to explain.

The mum-to-be impressed fashion-lovers with her incredible looks - covering everything from comfy casual to red carpet glam from high street names, as well as designer brands. And communication coach Robin Kermode believes the pregnant duchess, , used her strategically picked attire to signal her strongly held beliefs. In total, it is estimated Meghans Down Under tour wardrobe cost pound,. The items of clothing with signicant meanings behind them include her pumps created out of recycled plastic water bottles, and jeans made by female victims of human trafficking and sexual exploitation. With the world of the eyes upon her, some of Meghans outfits have unsurprisingly sold out as fans rush to snap them up. The jeans made by female victims of sexual exploitation  On several occasions during the overseas tour, Meghan opted to wear jeans from Outland - including the Harriet pair, pictured above. The Australian brand was founded by James Bartle after he saw first-hand how human traffickers prey on vulnerable young girls in order to service the sex industry. Determined to making a change, James learnt that once a girl has been rescued and supported through her recovery, a sustainable career path is vital for securing her future. He created the Denim Project, to enable those girls who demonstrated an interest in sewing to put their new skills to use. Outlands team of seamstresses offer positions to those at risk of falling into poverty, and has broadened its mission to set a standard for the treatment and remuneration of young female workers in the garment manufacturing industry. It also sources ethically and environmentally sound raw materials, from organic cotton pocket linings to recycled packaging. After the Duke and Duchess of Sussex announced their engagement, they asked people who wanted to mark the occasion to donate to charities they had picked instead of giving them wedding gts. One of these charities included the Myna Mahila Foundation, which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as iniduals and businesswomen. Thus Meghans Outland jeans reflect her desire to help vulnerable women which she has spoken so openly about. The vegan leather trainers  Meghan went comfy and casual as she donned white Veja V trainers while on a boat trip in Sydney during the Invictus Games. The trainers got everyone talking as they are environmentally friendly, and made from raw materials sourced from organic farming and ecological agriculture. Some of the shoes also use recycled plastic bottles and many have soles made from wild Amazonian rubber. The French fashion brands founders, Seacutebastien Kopp and Franccedilois-Ghislain Morillion visited clothing and food factories in South America, Asia and Australia while running a nonprofit group — and were appalled by what they saw. So in , they founded Veja in France with the vision of making trainers using the most ecological materials and ethical suppliers they could find. Fashion fans were delighted when they saw Meghan wearing a pair and the duchess is keen on environmental and conservation causes. The recycled plastic bottle pumps  Meghan wore Rothys flats twice on tour, including during a beach clean-up in Melbourne. The pumps are made from recycled plastic water bottles that would otherwise have been destined for landfill - and have been dubbed the most politically correct shoes on the planet by Vogue. The insoles on all of Rothy’s shoes contain recycled foam the rubber soles are made without environmentally stressful black carbon. The yarn comes from plastic and even the packaging’s made from post-consumer recycled materials. Meghan supports charity Surfers Against Sewage, which is a national marine conservation and campaigning charity. It inspires, unites and empowers communities to take action to protect oceans, beaches, waves and wildle. Hugo Tagholm, chief executive of the charity said: Our work as a national marine conservation charity empowers tens of thousands of volunteers annually to protect beaches for everyone. We are currently focused on tackling plastic pollution and this support will help us move towards our vision of Plastic Free Coastlines.” So it is very fitting Meghan wore the pumps during the beach visit - signalling her passion to protecting the sea from plastic. The sustainable brand  The Duchess of Sussex wore a stunning custom-made silk wool cocktail dress in dark navy by Gabriela Hearst at Government House in Wellington. The sustainable luxury brand is based on a less is more approach. Gabriela is a notable feminist designer and political activist. She wanted to create a brand that reflects a slower pace and process: where things are made with care and detail, where tradition is more important than trend, where there is a purpose to every piece, according to her website. She takes into consideration where materials come from and who is making them. Meghan wore the dress to deliver a speech to honor the th anniversary of female suffrage. The empowering dress  Meghan looked sensational when she wore a beautul white Theia dress for dinner with the King and Queen of Tonga. The label is inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, who had an incredible power to turn everything that she gazed on to light. The Theia dresses are designed to make women feel confident – similar to Meghan’s beliefs. The website explains about their collection: Inspired by the Greek Goddess Theia, this evening wear, bridal and day dress collection was created to bring out every womans inner goddess. One of the original Titans, Theia, who ruled during the Greek Golden Age, possessed the incredible power of light which radiated from her sparkling eyes. All that she gazed upon glittered, becoming luminous and radiant. She imbued gold and silver with their shine. She gave diamonds their fire and rubies and emeralds their sparkle. Her three children Helios the sun, Celene the moon, and Eos the dawn, all continue to bring light in to the world everyday. The woman who wears Theia will be filled with confidence knowing her dress fits wonderfully and looks beautul on her, thus naturally allowing her inner goddess to shine.

Poppy, a Shih Tzu was found by inspectors living in a Liverpool home where the floors were smeared with faeces and urine. The elderly animal had been so badly treated her fur was matted together and crawling with maggots, the Liverpool Echo reported. Poppy was also blind and suffered from a condition called dry eye, which attacks an animals tear glands. She had sore, infected skin and had grown obese from a lack of walking.  RSPCA Inspector Fischer found Poppy hiding under a bed when she inspected a property in Fairfield on July . Today, owners Maureen Payne, , and her son Robert Payne, , were indefinitely banned from keeping any animal in a hearing at Liverpool Magistrates Court. The pair, both of Birchfield Close, neglected the animal so badly that vets at Greater Manchester Animal Hospital took the decision to put her down in July. One photo taken inside the property shows a floor coated in animal faeces, with paw prints where the dog had walked its waste through the house. Peter Mitchell, prosecuting, said: Inspector Fischer found extremely dirty conditions in the house. Dog faeces was smeared across the floor in several rooms.  The dog bed was full of faeces and the dog had urinated around the place. Mr Mitchell said the RSPCA inspector was greeted by a strong smell of urine and faeces upon entering the house and that Ms Payne claimed to have a vet appointment booked for July . It was later established that this appointment never existed. Mr Mitchell described the house as cluttered and dirty and said Inspector Fischer eventually found Poppy hiding under an upstairs bed where the dog was snappy and reluctant to come out.  Upsetting photos taken after Poppy was signed over to the RSPCA by her owners show vets had to shave off her badly matted fur to try and treat the catalogue of problems they found. Vets that treated Poppy at the Greater Manchester Animal Hospital deemed the dog to have suffered skin sores, matting and dry eye, and the animal would have suffered pain and distress. Poppy weighed .kg when she was taken in by the RSPCA - a weight that was classied as severely obese for her breed. Paul Potter, defending Mr and Ms Payne, said Ms Payne is bad on her feet and has limited mobility, which meant she could not walk Poppy.  The dog was inherited from Ms Paynes mother, who died in . Mr Potter said Ms Payne had successfully kept pets in the past but found this breed demanding. Mr and Ms Payne were disqualied from keeping any animal for an indefinite period, with a minimum term of five years before they could appeal this order. The mother and son were also handed a four week curfew, reduced from six weeks on account of the pair entering guilty pleas at the first available opportunity. They were also ordered to jointly pay costs of pound.

Rachel Allison always knew she wanted to be a young parent and when she turned  made the le-changing decision. The now -year-old spent almost pound, in total on IVF and sperm from a donor living in Sweden. And in March her baby daughter Evelyn was born. “I always wanted to be a young parent like my mum. I didnt want to wait for someone to come along, the insurance advisor told Derbyshire Live. Have you got an IVF story you want to share  Email webnews@mirror  In total, it cost pound,. I had money saved from work and I borrowed some from the bank, but you pay for it in stages.

She added: IVF costs a lot of money but there is more of a chance with it than insemination. The sperm was pound, and I bought two lots of it just in case.  Rachel said choosing a sperm donor was like a dating site, minus the pictures and cheesy chat-up lines. It shows their hair colour, eye colour, education and family history. It didnt take too long to choose, I was just drawn to one of them, she said. Rachels donor was from Sweden, and she is happy to let Evelyn get in touch with her biological father when she is . She said she wanted the donor to have the same colour of skin, hair and eyes as her. And Rachel insisted that comments such as its not fair bringing up a baby without a dad didnt put her off.  She said: A lot of people want to do it but worry about what people would say, but there isnt a normal family set up nowadays. Around the same time that Rachel had Evelyn, she also decided to donate her own eggs - and is now planning on doing it again. She said she wanted to give back to families who may be desperate for a baby. Rachel said that she would do it all again with IVF - but wants nothing more than to meet somebody. She said: I get a lot of people messaging me about what Ive done. People donate blood and organs so why not donate eggs or sperm  I want to raise awareness about things which arent spoken about.  Rachel, who said she hadnt really had a maternity leave, credits her mum Tracey for her help with support and childcare. Tracey Joines, , said: When Rachel told me that she was going to try for a baby I had no hesitation in supporting her all the way, I knew she would make a fantastic mum. We are a very close family and Evelyn has been a blessing to all of us. I know some people frown upon her decision to be a single mum but at least Rachel did it because she wanted a baby - there are sadly a lot of people that end up as a single parent through no fault of their own.

Edmund Zagorski died at approximately .pm local time just  minutes after a last minute of stay of exection was denied by the Supreme Court. He is the second man to die by electric chair in Tennessee since . According to witnesses, -year-old Zagorski was askedhe had any last words and he replied “let’s rock” shortly before the execution was carried out. According to local media Zagorski , who shot and slit the throats of two men in  during a drug deal, also “smiled and grimaced” as he was being prepared to die.  His lawyer Kelley Helen said she smiled at him and tapped her heart and later told the Tennessean: “I told him, when I put my hand over my heart, that was me holding him in my heart.” Reporters who witnessed the scene said that the Extraction Team - the team that extract a prisoner from the holding cell to the chair - then put a sponge with saline solution on Zagorski’s head and secured it with two straps. A hooded shroud followed. Ms Henry said he appeared to wave then clenched his fists as the first , jolts of electricity flowed into his body for  seconds and that his little fingers appeared to “dislocated or broken” due to the force of straining against the straps. She also said there were signs he was still breathing before the second bolt was administered for  seconds. A doctor then appeared and confirmed that Zagorski was dead.  According to his lawyer, he made the following statement before he was taken to the execution chamber: First of all I want to make it very clear I have no hard feelings. I don’t want any of you to have this on your conscience, you are all doing your job, and I’m good. It was very important to him that this not be a day of sadness for us, she added. He very much wanted a light mood, and he was in a light mood every time I saw him.  Zagorski chose the chair because he believed it wouldnt be as agonising as being killed by lethal injection. However, the man who built the chair, Fred Leuchter, had earlier revealed he feared it wouldnt work properly for Zagorskis execution and would be just as inhumane as the injection. The execution was initially set for October , but it was delayed because the state was not ready for an electrocution. For his last meal, Zagorski chose to dine on pickled pig knuckles and pigtails.  When he was previously on death watch, Zagorski chose not to order a last meal, but fellow death row inmates pooled their resources to give him a pizza dinner, the Tennessean also reported. Death row inmates are usually given to spend on a special meal before they are put to death. Zagorski was convicted of first-degree murder in the deaths of two men - John Dotson, , and Jimmy Porter,  - in . Then , he had convinced the pair he could supply them with lbs of cannabis and lured them into a wooded area in Tennessees Robertson County, where he shot them and slit their throats.

Photos posted to Twitter show shattered glass and trays strewn over the ship. One passenger, David Crews, told News  that at first he wasnt worried, but began to worry when the ship didnt right itself. He said: “I didn’t think anything of it, since it’s not uncommon for ships to rock back and forth. But it didn’t rock back. It kept leaning. “Plates and silverware started sliding off the tables. Then the tables themselves started to slide. Glasses and plates started to fall and shatter. At this point, it was pure chaos. Screams. Cries.

More than two and a half thousand passengers were on the ship at the time, and some were so traumatised by the event that they reportedly flew home from the Dominican Republic instead of staying on the ship.

One which ended in an easy victory for the Jambos.Tonight they welcome champions Celtic fresh off a - win of their own over that same Hearts team in the Betfred Cup semi-final on Sunday.It’s fair to say the odds are not in Dundee’s favour but that won’t stop the Dens gaffer giving his team the belief they can cause an upset.To get anything, though, he knows they can’t afford another sloppy start to the game.He said: “It’s so important to give ourselves a chance at the start.“Until Hearts scored their second goal, we did a lot of things good in the game though nobody seems to be interested in that.“We got into some good positions but didn’t punish them and lost another silly goal.“You think you have all the men in place to deal with it but you don’t.“It is very important we start the game well and grow into the game, that’s always the case whenever you play the Old Firm.“That is the aim, to get off to a good start.“I was at Murrayfield on Sunday and I thought Hearts were excellent for  minutes until the penalty but that’s what Celtic do – they constantly pose you questions.“Your concentration levels have to be tip-top and I felt after they got their goal that fluency they have came back.“Celtic are starting to hit their top level and you could see that with the quality of the goals.“To be able to keep that concentration level for -plus minutes is very, very dficult.“To beat them you have to have your organisation levels spot on, you’ve got to have one to  playing out of their skin and you hope a few of them aren’t quite at their peak.“It’s like anything, the favourites don’t always win and that’s the belief you have to go into the game with.“I’ve been at other clubs where we’ve gone and got a result against them and that’s the belief you’ve got to carry against them.“Equally, having said that, you know you are going to have to do everything really well and hope a few of their players are off it.”By the time January comes around, expectations are there will be a raft of changes in the Dens squad.However, Jim insists every player at his disposal right now will get the chance to show he’s good enough to help the side get out of relegation trouble.For the new gaffer, though, it’s not just about showing you’ve the ability to play at this level, it’s about proving you have the character to do so, too.He added: “I think this squad, with no disrespect to the Ross County squad that I inherited, definitely has more ability within it overall.“Ability alone isn’t enough – you’ve got to be able to do the hard yards and carry your job out. That is so important and good teams will punish youyou don’t.“It’s so important to have a good shape about you and do your jobs well at this level.“We have seen what happens when you drop runners at set-plays and give away silly free-kicks.“I think there is plenty of character in this dressing-room but it’s about knowing what’s required of you and standing up to do it.”"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bdb0240656a8.jpg ","title":"dundee woman in bid to save life of abandoned street dog candy","story":"A Broughty Ferry woman is pulling out all the stops to fund a le-saving operation for an abandoned street dog from Romania.Mongrel Candy was dumped on the streets of the city of Constanta along with her sister Cherry not long after she was born in March last year.The pair were lucky to be taken in by UK charity Barking Mad Dog Rescue.Candy was brought all the way from Romania to Tayside to be fostered by former midwe Lillian Stewart, , who is a volunteer with the charity.A family were found to adopt Candy – but shortly afterwards they discovered she had a le-threatening illness that would either require expensive surgery or would result in her having to be given expensive medication and a special diet for the rest of her le.Lillian said: “The family felt they were not in a position to provide that, so Candy came back to me and now I and the charity are trying to raise money for her surgery.”Candy has a liver shunt, which means a vein that should be taking blood through her liver to pury it is bypassing the organ instead.She said: “There is corrective surgery available but it costs somewhere in the region of £, to £,.“The charity has already spent £, to discover what was wrong with Candy.“She is due to go to Glasgow on November  for the surgery at the small animal hospital.”Candy’s surgeon said her shunt is very unusual, one he has never seen before.Lillian added: “Candy is the sweetest little dog and she has been through so much.“We feel she deserves the best care we can give her and are desperately hoping we can raise the money for her operation.

Other outfits in the Championship quickly worked out while getting the ball quickly was an option,that wasn’t on they’d have time to get the ball under control and pass their way up the pitch.As Partick Thistle, Inverness Caley Thistle and now Dunfermline have discovered, it’s been all change under the new manager.When his team lose the ball they will work hard, fast and high up the pitch to get it back as quickly as possible.That brought them their goals in Robbie’s opening game at Firhill, when for both strikes home players actually had good possession in their own half but were caught out by the speed with which they were closed down.And in the draw against ICT and in Saturday’s win over the Pars, a feature of United’s play was the number of times they won the ball back in, or near, the opponent’s defensive third.Watching from the stands, what is striking about the new policy is the amount of ground it involves the attacking players covering. At the sharp end has been Pavol Safranko. Fortunately for United, as well as being a talented goalscorer, the Slovakian prides himself on his work-rate.At the weekend he almost literally ran himself into the ground – going down with cramp in injury time and being forced off.Not far behind have been the attacking midfield trio of Paul McMullan, Fraser Aird and Billy King. As well as being expected to get forward and get on the ball, there is little respite for them when the other team’s defenders have it.Delighted as he’s been with that quartet’s attitude to a side of the game creative players do not always relish, Robbie stressed the system only works and will continue to,every outfield player buys into it.One chink in the armour though and he knows it will fall apart, allowing the other team to find men with space and time to hurt United.“Pavol’s been great. I know that he’s a very good player and, as I’ve said, I knew about him before I came here because I’d seen him play at Aalborg ,” said the gaffer.“But we also have McMullan, King, Aird, the boys behind, doing a lot of running as well.“And I’m a big believer that when we go and press, even when we’re attacking, the defence have got a big role to play in it as well.“If we’re asking forward players to go and run , ,  yards to go and press people, then the midfielders and defenders have to do it as well.“There is a responsibility on them to go and do it as well. As a team we are getting better at it, but it’s early days, we’re only three games in.”That note of caution possibly stems from the fact, although he’s been pleased with the way the players have taken to the tactic, the next couple of weeks could provide sterner tests of it.Partick and the Pars have been struggling for form and while Inverness remain the only unbeaten second tier team, as five of them in a row indicates, they have become the draw specialists of the ision.Up next are Queen of the South and leaders Ross County, two sides who might just be better equipped to cope with the high press."},{"url":null,"title":"tom duthie neil mccann tried to change too much too soon at dundee","story":"When Neil McCann looks back on his time as Dundee boss he will surely learn several lessons, ones that can stand him in good steadhe s to management.Perhaps the most obvious will be that, whatever your football philosophy, it has to be tapered to suit the resources you have available when it comes to players.McCann’s mantra at Dens was to play passing football at all times and, ultimately, at all costs. That led to too many goals being lost by errors as, at high risk, the ball was played out from the back.It became increasingly clear some of his defenders in particular were not comfortable with this policy but the manager was not for budging and persevered with the style of play he was convinced would, ultimately, bring success.The number of goals it cost made it inevitable what many saw as stubbornness was what cost McCann his job.That is, perhaps, an over-simplication and, now the dust has settled on the former Scotland international’s departure, a more in-depth look throws up other factors.A look at the players he used in his eight Premiership games in charge this term highlights another couple of causes for his downfall.First off, the list of those involved looks too long. In just two-and-a-half months of league football, Dundee fielded  dferent players.Of course, injury and suspension means some of the constant stream of changes were enforced, but others suggest he was never totally sure of what his best line-up was. Given the style of play he wanted, this lack of consistency in selection had to be an issue.Arguably, an even bigger one was that he fell into the rookie manager’s trap of trying to make too many changes too quickly.The Premiership may not be one of the top leagues in Europe but it does have its own unique qualities. One of them, as most new arrivals testy, is the tempo of the play here is more frantic than in many other countries.Even players coming up from England, where the pace is higher than on the continent, usually comment on that.What that means is players from where have to be given time to adjust and, as they do, it’s important they have men around them who are already experienced campaigners in our top ision.A glance down the list of the men used this season suggests there were not enough performers who fitted into that category.Of the  he used, nine were completely new to the league, while eight others had no more than a season’s experience of it.Ironically, the most used who fell into those categories was when  started the solitary win at Hamilton last month but, in the other outings, seven or eight such players were used.That’s not saying these players are not good enough for this level but, as most experienced managers in any league will say, whatever the level of talent, having so many who are not familiar with their surroundings is a risk they wouldn’t be prepared to take.While McCann did bring in vastly-experienced Premiership performer Kenny Miller at the end of the summer transfer window, the loss through injury of Paul McGowan had to be a major blow.And it should not be seen as insignicant that, as he’s scoured the free-agent market since his arrival as manager, new boss Jim McIntyre has paid particular attention to men who know the top flight well.Martin Woods is expected to sign up once he’s proved his fitness, though Celtic on Wednesday may be too early for that. Woods’ old Ross County team-mate from when McIntyre was in charge, Paul Quinn, has also been linked."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/11/5bdad577ee4ff.jpg ","title":"workers fume as dundee council introduces heavy handed ban on smoking and vaping on shift","story":"Dundee City Council workers face disciplinary actionthey smoke on sht under a new policy which has been branded “heavy-handed”.The policy, seen by the Tele ahead of it coming into force on Thursday, explicitly bans staff from smoking on company time.This applies when they are outside, travelling between offices and on tea breaks, meaning workers can only smoke on unpaid lunch breaks. vw, px\"  The ban applies evensmokers aren’t identiable as council workers and does not distinguish between cigarettes and vaping.Those who flout the policy face “disciplinary action”.George Barr, local Unite convener, slammed the plan as “heavy-handed” and said some workers feared losing their jobs.Mr Barr said: “We have been asking what help the council will give and it doesn’t look like it will be anything substantial.“The council should be helping people to give upit wants to enforce this policy, especiallypeople could potentially be sacked for smoking. This is an attack on people who smoke. It’s not an easy thing to give up – and not everyone wants to either.”Council workers who spoke to the Tele on condition of anonymity don’t believe the policy will be enforceable.One said: “I think this is going to affect a lot of people. I can see why the council is doing it but I don’t think they’re doing it in the right way. I smoke about  a day. When I first heard about the policy I thought about buying a vape but they’re banning those too.“A lot of the older people are worried they’ll lose their jobsthey get caught, and they’ll lose their pensions – pensions that are in tobacco. It’s ludicrous.”Dundee, together with Angus and Perth and Kinross Councils, invests £. million of pension money in tobacco firms through the Tayside Pension Fund. Another worker said enforcing the ban could create rts between employees and their managers.“I don’t think it’s enforceable,” the worker said. “Managers are going to have to go round telling people to put it out and that’s going to be more hassle for them.“The council is going about this completely the wrong way.“Look at the NHS’s no-smoking policy – you still have to walk through a cloud of smoke to get in the front door at Ninewells.” The council says the move is a response to a Scottish Government report which called on authorities to adopt “fully smoke-free policies”.A government spokeswoman said it encouraged councils to “make their grounds smoke-free”, adding: “Cosla has published guidance for local authorities on how to implement this.”Cosla, which represents most Scottish councils, said authorities were ultimately free to choose how to impose a smoking policy.A spokesman added: “Councils play a vital role in improving public health outcomes for our communities and this often begins with our own staff policies and our own premises.”Council bosses claim the policy will protect adults, and reduce the number of adult “role models” seen smoking in public by children.A spokesman for the local authority said: #The council has revised its smoking policy as we are working to protect the health of employees and also promote positive health messages across the wider community, in line with the agreed #Our People Strategy# and health and wellbeing framework.#The council is committed to helping achieve the national targets on reducing smoking in the Scottish Government’s #Creating a Tobacco-Free Generation# strategy.#A key part of that approach involves discouraging children and young people from taking up smoking.#One way to assist that is to reduce the number of adult ‘role models’ who can be seen smoking in public.#Across Dundee, there has been the introduction of voluntary no-smoking areas at children#s playparks and we will be looking to extend this to  more open spaces in the future.#The new policy mirrors recent changes brought into effect by NHS Tayside and by other councils across Scotland. The council will assist any employees who want to try to give up smoking.#There was detailed discussion with trade unions during the formation of the new policy and employees will be able to ask their line managers about the implications for them at the start of this early implementation stage.#"},{"url":null,"title":"wetherspoons-bans-dogs-from-all-pubs","story":"POPULAR pub chain Wetherspoons has banned dogs from all of its branches."},{"url":null,"title":"mobile-providers-charging-customers-for-phones-already-paid-off","story":"AN estimated four million UK mobile phone users have been charged pound million for handsets they already own, a charity has warned."},{"url":null,"title":"hydro-turns-five-meet-the-head-of-entertainment-who-spoke-on-anniversary","story":"OVER five million concert-goers in five years have visited the SSE Hydro...a figure which has exceeded the expectations of the woman responsible for bringing some of the worlds biggest acts to Glasgow."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-takeaway-launches-deep-fried-mars-bar-calzone","story":"A GLASGOW takeaway has launched one of the worlds unhealthiest pizzas - a deep fried MARS BAR calzone containing around , calories."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-and-meghan-expecting-first-baby","story":"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are expecting a baby in spring , Kensington Palace has announced."},{"url":null,"title":"teen-bakes-grandads-ashes-into-biscuits-and-shares-with-classmates","story":"A high school student mixed her cremated grandfatherrsquos ashes into homemade sugar biscuits and shared them with several classmates, police in Calornia said on Wednesday."},{"url":null,"title":"dalmarnock-orange-and-purple-district-band-ordered-to-re-route-glasgow-remembrance-day-parade","story":"ORANGE marchers have been told to re-route their Remembrance Day parade away from St Maryrsquos Church in Calton amid fears of violent clashes."},{"url":null,"title":"dundee-0-celtic-5-the-champions-hand-out-a-dens-park-drubbing-with-five-different-players-on-the-scoresheet","story":"EVENCeltic had not got their act together over recent weeks this would be have the simplest of nights for them at Dens Park against a Dundee team in big trouble."},{"url":null,"title":"long-road-ahead-for-sauchiehall-street-recovery","story":"THE challenge to revive Sauchiehall Street will exist long after the street is finally re-opened, businesses have said."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-binmen-who-walked-out-beside-equal-pay-women-demand-wages","story":"A GROUP of refuse workers who walked out in solidarity with equal pay strikers have warned of further industrial actionthey are not paid."},{"url":null,"title":"ryanair-changes-luggage-rules-for-second-time-in-a-year","story":"Ryanair has changed its hand luggage rules for the second time this year."},{"url":null,"title":"beverley-lyons-movie-star-idris-loves-being-part-of-the-glasgow-club-once-again","story":"IT was great to see Idris Elba filming in Glasgow for the second time in his movie career."},{"url":null,"title":"revamp-plans-for-glasgows-historic-high-street-and-saltmarket-get-go-ahead","story":"The long-overdue regeneration of Glasgows historic heart has been brought one step closer after the approval of plans to breathe new le into the area."},{"url":null,"title":"neil-lennon-you-call-it-sectarianism-here-in-scotland-i-call-it-racism","story":"Neil Lennon has fully backed his agents claim that he is routinely targeted for abuse in Scotland because he is an Irish Catholic who played for Celtic."},{"url":null,"title":"find-out-why-hundreds-of-delegates-are-heading-to-the-sec-this-weekend","story":"MORE than , delegates will be taking part in a conference which aims to showcase the latest advances in cancer research."},{"url":null,"title":"glasgow-light-opera-to-perform-oklahoma-at-the-kings-theatre","story":"The Glasgow Light Opera Club will perform Oklahoma at the Kingrsquos Theatre this month."},{"url":null,"title":"couple-raffling-off-3m-mansion-for-just-25-a-ticket","story":"AN English couple have decided to raffle off their pound million house via an online contest."},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118270.jpg","title":"Budget brings new rules of engagement","story":" Highland Council is asking for the public, staff, trade unions and members to help make \"very hard decisions\" as it looks to cut close to pound million from its budget through a month of consultations with communities.The local authority is planning for a potential budget gap of pound. million over the next three years despite over pound million in cuts starting in  and projected into next year.The councilrsquos budget team launched Novemberrsquos public engagement on Wednesday and is calling for everyone to get involved to make their views known.On Monday, Chancellor Philip Hammond announced pound million more to the Scottish block grant and it is hoped that some of it will reach the council.

aberdeen bypass delay","story":"Contractors behind the AWPR project have not been “entirely straight” with the Scottish Government, the Transport Secretary Michael Matheson today claimed.In an interview with the Evening Express, he heaped pressure on the building firms behind thebypass to open the already completed .km section from Craibstone to Stonehaven and Charleston as soon as possible.It comes after Mr Matheson revealed to Holyrood yesterday that the £ million project has been delayed yet again and is now targeting an opening date in December after defects were found at the new bridge over the River Don.Mr Matheson laid the blame squarely with the contractors for the project – a joint venture between Balfour Beatty and Gallord Try known as Aberdeen Roads Limited – for holding this up after failing to grant a iation to the original contract.Speaking to the Evening Express, the transport secretary said that section of road “could be opened up” but said there is “no provision” in the contract to allow that to happen.Earlier this week, Mr Matheson said he spoke to Peter Truscott, chief executive of Gallord Try, to receive an update on the progress they were making discussing the issue with lenders.He claims Mr Truscott confirmed to him that Aberdeen Roads Limitedwas making the “necessary changes” to the contract to open the section but received a letter yesterday morning which suggested ARL had yet to agree to open this section of the road and to inform its lenders. Mr Matheson, who has called for an urgent meeting with the contractors, said: “This suggests to me that the contractors have not been entirely straight on the matter and I have made it clear in my response to the contractor that I find that completely unacceptable.“I’m not prepared to have a contractor say one thing on Monday and then on the Thursday to change their position.“The issue is not our lack of desire to have that iation, it’s the lack of response from the contractor to make that happen.“It’s up to the contractor to agree to that opening. There is no provision for it to be simply opened. There’s a clear way we can resolve this matter through a iation and we’ve been pursuing that for a considerable period of time now.”When asked why the contractor was reluctant to make the changes to the contract, Mr Matheson said: “That’s a question which you will need to put to them.”Throughout the duration of the project, contractors have refused to comment directly to the press due to the “partnering nature” of the project, with all requests instead being put to the government agency Transport Scotland.When pressed on a definitive opening date, Mr Matheson said they couldn’t be “firm” about the time frame but said contractors believe the whole route could be open by December, adding that would “hopefully” be the case. He said: “At this stage it is dependent on a number of factors.

What’s more, eventhey don’t mutate as occurred in the case outlined here,released into the wild either by design or mistake these foreigners can cause havoc to local ecosystems.In a letter to the scientic journal Nature in , a group of German scientists began ‘it has been rumoured that an unidentied crayfish…of marbled appearance and uncertain geographical origin that was introduced into the German aquarium trade in the mid s, is capable of unisexual reproduction ’.The authors ended by warning that: ‘This crayfish…could become a menace to European freshwater systems, as the release of even one specimen into the wild would be enough to found a population that might out-compete native crayfish’.Now,  years later, this all-female crayfish has escaped into the wild.  Identied as a descendent of the fresh water slough crayfish from Florida, it is now called the marbled crayfish or Marmokrebs. So far it has invaded the waterways of at least nine European countries as well as Japan and Madagascar. Unravelling its origin reveals that a unique macro-mutation must have occurred in a single slough crayfish egg probably caused by heat or cold shock whilst in transit from Florida to Germany for the pet market.The resulting female hatchling possessed three sets of chromosomes per celland the ability to produce clones of itself without a mate and at very high frequency.Because of its warm climate and abundant freshwater habitats, Madagascar has seen the most rapid colonisation with Marmokrebs. Millions of the animals have invaded the countries lakes, rice paddies and swamps and are threatening its seven endemic crayfish species.It is only a matter of time before this scenario is repeated in other locations, destroying valuable ecosystems and eliminating indigenous species."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 37","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Sir,It is always a delight when a letter awakens a landowner.James F Lithgow#s insult about ‘blow-ins’ is a typical trait. I worked extremely hard to buy my farm, not being able to piggyback on my forebears’ efforts, and I didn’t ‘blow-in’, it took two forty-foot pantechnicons four days.It is clear he has an interest in wind turbines, and no doubt with a pair of wellies, a fish farm or two. His blinkered refusal to accept the huge body of evidence regarding fish farm contamination suggests he has an investment and it needs protecting. But only, of course,you don’t have a commercial interest.There is a huge amount of evidence that mechanical kelp harvesting does irreparable damage to the sea bed. Could I draw your readers# attention to the Facebook page #Stop Mechanical Kelp Dredging# The sea bed can’t be seen, but a bank statement can. No prizes for who is the loser. The  jobs in aquaculture will not last longmass kelp harvesting is allowed to decimate sub-sea environments and the only jobs on fish farms will be pushing barrows of diseased and dead fish.I’ve no doubt he knows that wind turbines have a -year le span and then the hugely disruptive process will start againan alternative has not been discovered. It has been calculated that the energy costs of a wind turbine will never be recovered during its lespan, but those receiving grants really don’t care.Why, given the amount of rainfall in Argyll, are hydro schemes not pursued  It used to be a mystery, until one looks at the vast sums of subsidy given by a gullible government to so called ‘alternative energy sources’, which actually means ‘alternative revenue sources’.There are any number of pretty glens that could be dammed, providing an extra environmentally-friendly leisure resource, create an opportunity for aquaculture and would not require a replacement somewhere down the line.Alexander Hamilton, Tayvallich.Sir,With reference to James Lithgow’s letter of September , it is important to make a couple of points.Mr Lithgow is right to say kelp has been sustainably harvested in Argyll for generations. There can be no comparison, however, with the current proposal to mechanically dredge up entire stands from the seabed together with all the fragile le that depends on them. This is not sustainable as evidenced in the few countries which have allowed this practice to take place.  Seaweed cultivation, on the other hand, is sustainable and more can be found on this through the Scottish Association for Marine Science.The  parliamentary inquiry into the environmental impact of salmon farming warned current methods could cause #irrecoverable damage#.  This is deeply concerning to those of us who live here, raise families and rely on the sea for our creel fishing, shellfish and tourism businesses. We also all have an inherent responsibility to care for our environment and there is increasing urgency to do this.Enterprises do need to be encouraged to grow and to provide opportunities and employment. This, however, must be done responsibly and with thought for the long-term viability of our communities.The profits of the predominantly multi-national salmon farming companies, who benefit from current loopholes in our environmental regulations, are well able to fund a responsible and researched approach for sustainability and erse employment opportunities. Norway, for example, is encouraging its salmon farmers to adopt closed containment and these methods are working well in a number of other countries, including the USA.The council has a legal responsibility for the environment and needs to take precautions for the future of Argyll, not just for job numbers today.If short-term interests are prioritised, all of our futures will be much the poorer.Will Self, on behalf of Friends of the Sound of JuraSir,Most schools in Scotland have pipers and drummers within their pupil population.Schools in Argyll are probably no exception.

Fish generate their own electricity by biological means, you see, and so have no need for charging points.Perhaps I shouldn#t even try to explain the joke to Mr Lithgow.I had hoped for a more cogent critique of the points I made, rather than the amateurish attempt to cover his lack of reasoning by smearing my origins and character, or what he erroneously imagines them to be, and by repeating the endless waffle of the wind industry#s PR department.One example: whenever a new wind farm is proposed there is a claim that it will provide electricity for a certain number of homes, say ,. What is not mentioned, however, except in very fine print at the bottom of the page, is that these figures are only achievable under perfect wind conditions, which rarely occur, and that the real output of usable electricity is a small fraction of the headline figure.What is also not mentioned is who is going to pay for the decommissioning costs when the wind farms inevitably turn into junk. Somehow, I don#t think it will be those who benefited financially. More likely, it will be us, the public, already being fleeced by inflated electricity bills, who will have to pay to haul thousands of tons of unrecyclable trash from our mountains or live forever with enormous eyesores.Let me restate the case for tidal power. The tides are generated by the moon as it orbits the Earth which creates gravitational pull on the oceans. These tides are predictable, both in power and timing, for centuries in advance, and will carry on being so until the moon eventually flies off into space some billions of years hence. There are two incoming tides and two outgoing every day, a total of four, each one involving an enormous quantity of moving water and thereby presenting the opportunity to generate electricity, totally free of carbon dioxide emissions.The UK, and especially Scotland, has an enormousof coastline. Scotland#s coast is about , kilometres, and Argyll accounts for a very high proportion of this because of the legacy of the last ice age which left us with such a convoluted coastline. So we have plenty of scope to exploit this resource.And we are doubly blessed because the complexity of our coastline results in the tides reaching dferent points at dferent times of the day. Therefore, by using several dferent sites, we could have an even amount of electricity always on tap.Wind and solar power cannot match this, either in quantity of power or dependability. They require a duplicate system of nuclear, coal, gas, and oil-fired generators always fired up and ready to kick in when the wind and sun refuse to co-operate # an enormously expensive system both in money and CO emissions.There is a case for subsidies during the infancy of any industry to get it started off.But the wind farm industry is not an infant # it is now a fully grown cuckoo. It has never has earned its keep and never will so it is time to chuck it out of the nest.Stuart White, Minard.Friday September  is World Alzheimer’s Day.There are , people with dementia in Scotland and , people with dementia across Argyll and Bute.

As he says, it is far too dependent on the vagaries of the weather.Tidal power can never fail and here in Mid Argyll we have potentially the most efficient and cost-effective tidal system under our noses. This, in turn, would open up additional tourist and recreational facilities at virtually no extra cost. This would be a win-win situation, but without, I suspect, sufficient profit to satisfy the usual parasitic financial interests.What is this simple and relatively inexpensive answer Simply build a sea wall or dam, call it what you will, across the relatively narrow entrance of Loch Gilp from the Lingerton promontary towards Ardrishaig via the rocky skerries, which would reduce the cost, and finish short of the Ardrishaig lighthouse harbour wall, thus funneling all the tides through a very narrow area.Then simply incorporate as many sea locks and gates as needed to allow passage of boats in and out of the harbour and the Crinan Canal.The additional locks would be used for either lower-able turbines or permanently submerged tidal units such as in the Pentland Firth. This would be simple and cost-effective, as the generating turbines catch the tides both in and out. After all, the Romans were using tide mills , years ago, so the idea is nothing new.In addition to this, Ardrishaig would finish up with an enhanced harbour  and marina and, with a few rocks removed from the beach, the wide open area at low tide back to Lochgilphead # now wasted # would make a splendid international course for activities such as land yacht racing.The other deceitful cuckoo that we should consider debunking is the very misleading fallacy that electric cars are helping to save the planet. Yes, it is ideal and justied for town or city use to keep the fume level down in densely built up areas where fresh air is in short supply among high buildings. But generally their use is unjustiable because pollution would actually increase considerably overall because to generate every single power unit of electricity it takes roughly two polluting units of other fuels such as coal, oil or even gas to produce that single electrical unit.So, unless the electricity is always generated from renewable systems such as hydro, tidal, solar or wind, then total pollution would go up, not down.One more cuckoo destined to be the sham of another expensive white elephant.Bob Henderson, LochgilpheadSir,We would like to say a huge thanks to all the bands who played on the Sunday of this year#s Tarbert Music Festival for making it a successful afternoon after the event had to be moved from the quay to the village hall # this has to be our most stressful decision.Thanks to all the hotels and pubs for organising the great music for the weekend.We raised just over £ at the coffee morning, so thanks to everyone who baked or donated and also to all the helpers # Anne, Gail,Jane, Allie, Nina and Zena.Many thanks also to the award-winning Mid Argyll Pipe Band, who entertained a huge crowd in the pouring rain and also the Loch Fyne Pipe Band who played to the Sunday survivors.To Mrs Brown, our very own collector extrondanaire, her wee buckets totalled £.Finally, and most importantly, thanks to visitors and locals for turning out to support our music festival.Thank you all.Margaret, Duncan, Barbara and Kirsten of Tarbert Music FestivalSir,The National Autistic Society is looking for people and organisations who have done something amazing for autistic children, adults, or their families.Perhaps it’s a teacher who has helped a child achieve something great, an autistic adult who has been campaigning tirelessly or a business that has put a lot of effort into making their workplace accessible.If any of your readers know of a person or organisation like this, please nominate them for our seventh annual Autism Professionals Awards.

The pair have performed all over Scotland as well as being broadcast on BBC Radio Scotland’s Classics Unwrapped multiple times.The afternoon started with the couple’s typical Spanish repertoire, a warm ‘Les Filles de Cadix’ that brought Bizet’s ‘Carmen’ to mind. Following Seiber’s ‘Four French Folksongs’ the audience was treated to the accomplished Savolini playing two solo pieces – originally Schubert lieder # now arranged for guitar. Although he only had six strings on his guitar, Savolini was still able to capture the rippling of water under the melody. The first act was finished with a light contrast of Scots songs including ‘Dream Angus’ and was met with murmurs of agreement in the audience.The second act began with a piece by Marco Ramelli by the name of ‘Moon’. The text was taken from a th century poet yet the music was modern and fresh. After three Spanish songs by Joaquin Rodrigo during which the audience was told stories of a youthful girl’s wish to be picked as a companion for the king and a miller#s we staying true to her husband although her offer may be tempting, the two performed three of Granados  Tondillas. This was followed by a sentimental and personal depiction of Spain in Granados ‘Dance Española’s No.’ played by Sasha Savolini.McNeill and her partner finished with two Spanish songs by Turina, the first being an earthy and dramatic prayer to the virgin of hope and the second a feisty scorned woman with underlaying tones of sadness. Yet the audience was surprised to an encore of a beautully soft rendition ‘St Columba’s Prayer’.This was an entertaining afternoon enjoyed by everyone in Ardrishaig Public Hall."},{"url":null,"title":"etive tests loch fyne anglers","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated -days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as  pence per week.Subscribe NowLoch Fyne Sea Angling Club held its annual #blind pairs# competition out of Airds Bay on Loch Etive recently in testing conditions.The strong wind and heavy rain made it a dficult day for the anglers, but they made the best of it fishing from the small self drive boats.Loch Etive produced the usual species of spurs, whiting and dogfish with a total of  fish caught and ed.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a pound, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article13513457.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_Silverburn.jpg","title":"big changes set stagecoach bus","story":"NewsBig changes set for Stagecoach bus timetables in Ayrshire as operator ditches Silverburn serviceOperator Stagecoach said new timetables would \"better reflect our customers travel habits\".ShareByStephen Houston:,  OCT NewsStagecoachs Ayr base \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSweeping changes are planned for the Stagecoach bus network - and the direct shoppers express to the Silverburn mall is to be put off the road due to lack of trade. Stagecoach insist they have to keep developing the Ayrshire network and fish where the passengers are. And they say: “These changes better reflect our customers travel habits. “A number of these changes will deliver improvements in reliability and frequency, while others will offer a service proportionate to demand.” The switches in service are planned to begin operating in January. The changes were discussed by the Ayrshire Bus Users Group in Troon on Saturday. Watchers are particularly interested in the failed route which served the Silverburn mall in Pollok at weekends. It was launched exactly two years ago with the now departed managing director Tom Bridge crowing: “Shopping habits are changing from traditional high streets.” Ayrshire traders, however, deemed it a slap in the face. But of the X from Ayr, Prestwick and Kilmarnock to Silverburn, they now admit: “Our plan is to remove this service due to very low passenger numbers.”  Stagecoach’s Ayr HQ is wanting passenger feedback on the plans and staged an information day at Ayr Town Hall on Monday. Travellers are now likely to get back their direct Ayr to Irvine number  route via Troon. The last change the company made was to introduce a A which will be scrapped. But this will only be every  minutes. The new  route will take in Barassie, Monkton and Loans. That means Loans will no longer get the  coaster which had erted through the Main Street off the A. Belmont would no longer get the number six which was every  minutes. Instead it will get the number seven every  minutes - andpassenger numbers dont improve it may also be culled. The number two will pull out of Dalmilling and Hayhill, with the areas served by the number one and three. Stagecoach want to sht the X to Hamilton from Ayr away from Prestwick and take it up Whitletts Road. The number  from Ayr to Muirkirk will lose some early and late night services due to some routes shting via the Cumnock depot. The busy X from Ayr to Glasgow is to get extra capacity. The company want new departures from Ayr at .am, .pm, .pm, .pm, .pm.

The former Aberdeen man has formed an impressive defensive partnership with Jamie Adams - and once again the pair were fantastic at Firhill. But Rose proved his threat in the opposition box when rising to bullet home Declan McDaids corner, coming as it did at the end of concerted Ayr pressure. Rose looks to have a bright future in the game and he deservedly gains the headlines today.  Whistler Bobby sends Ayr raving Madden - AGAIN It would be fair to say Ayr boss Ian McCall and ref Bobby Madden arent the greatest of pals. McCall made his feelings on the whistler well known after Ayrs trip to Ibrox earlier this season - and United were on the end of a string of hotly disputed calls here. Madden waved away two first half penalty shouts and angered Ayr with a number of other baffling calls which threatened to send the game past boiling point in the second half.  McCall wins battle of the bosses On a day when all eyes were on the Thistle dugout and Gary Caldwell making his home debut, Ian McCall made yet another triumphantto his old stomping ground. Ayrs wily gaffer made two big calls in starting Craig Moore and Declan McDaid and his men responded in style with another fine performance. McCall is not afraid of the big decisions and appears to be juggling his squad to perfection at the moment, as proven by this display where his team selection and tactics proved spot on.

two-child cap on claiming tax credits.Michelle Ballantyne, who is a former Selkirkshire councillor and leader of the local Conservatives, was defending welfare reforms during the session at the Scottish Parliament yesterday .Universal Credit was introduced as part of the UK Governments overhaul of the welfare system.Critics say cuts to payments and widespread problems with its implementation have led to many people falling into hardship or dropping out of the benefit system altogether.The introduction of the two-child benefit cap, limiting tax credits and Universal Credit to a familys first two children has also been attacked.And the Tory list MSPs attempt to justy the two-child cap this week was met with anger and disbelief.Ms Ballantyne told Holyrood: \"The two-child limit is about fairness.\"It is fair that people on benefit cannot have as many children as they like while people who work and pay their way and dont claim benefits have to make decisions about the number of children they can have.\"Universal Credit may have its flaws, but the thinking behind the system is sound.\"It is about making it better to be in work than not to be in work.\"MSPs were debating inequality, austerity and poverty when Ms Ballantyne mounted her defence.Nationalist MSP Tom Arthur described her words as one of the most disgraceful speeches Ive ever heard.He said: \"In my two and half years in this parliament, the contribution from Michelle Ballantyne was one of the most disgraceful speeches I have ever heard.\"Six minutes of pompous Victorian moralising, that would have been better suited to the pages of a Dickens novel.\"And to suggest that poverty should be a barrier to a family, that people who are poor are not entitled to any more than two children - what an absolutely disgraceful position.\"Ms Ballantynes words were also met with anger in Westminster today.Pete Wishart, the SNPs shadow leader of the House of Commons, told Parliament: \"We dont want these

condemnation has come from across party ides.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard describing Ms Ballantynes words as abhorrent, nasty and archaic.He added: \"The reality is that the Scottish Tories

InChorus.The choir has been celebrating its tenth birthday this autumn and members have just ed from an exciting long weekend of performances and appearances in the Catalonian city.The choirrsquos programme of main events began in the wonderful Palau De La Musica Catalana - a UNESCO World Heritage Site of extraordinary beauty, the modernistic design and decoration of which is quite unique.After a tour of the building, choir members were askedthey would like to sing on the main stage.Choir manager, Lorna Turnbull told us: ldquoThe design of the Palau is mind blowing and the acoustics are amazing.\"We were told that we could sing just one song, but having heard us, we were asked to sing another.\"This happened on the first morning of the trip, and I was afraid that everything  we had planned for the weekend would be an anti-climax. I neednrsquot have worried.

The rampant home side completely outplayed the visitors who looked out of sorts and overwhelmed by the occasion.For those who witnessed the second half, what followed was one of the finest and most unlikely comebacks they will ever experience.Claremont blitzed the unsuspecting Pupils from the outset, scoring in their first attack of the match.Before a breath was drawn, a surging run and cross by Claremont’s tall centre-forward was promptly dispatched into the back of the net at the back post.It was a case of backs to the wall for the visitors who, after a number of close shaves, found themselves two behind midway through the first half.This time the damage was self-inflicted, when an innocuous cross from the left was palmed into the path of the incoming striker who scored with ease from close range.The alarm bells now ringing loudly, with  minutes of the half remaining the visitors somehow conjured a goal against the run of play.A breakout by Ryan Deans ended with a fine pass to set up Sary Rhama, whose pace and parting shot almost took the net away.The home side, however, were unrelenting in their efforts and deservedly restored a two-goal cushion with a goal just before the break.A reading of the riot act at half time appeared to have the desired effect as, after a number of changes, both positional and to personnel, the second period produced a whole new ball game.Leading the line from the front, the introduction of Cameron Wylie was the key to the comeback, his unrelenting efforts to close space soon rewarded as his team responded in kind.A quick interchange of passes between Deans and Grumoli brought its reward, leaving the latter free to curl a wonderful shot into the top corner of the net. The comeback was on.Liam Renton joined the act in the th minute of a strange match after a headed clearance met with a flush volley as a superbly struck shot thundered into the net for the equaliser.There was time aplenty for the Pupils to shoot themselves in the foot again, and Claremont regained the initiative when Fraser Wylie mistimed a clearance to send the ball into his own net.At the opposite end – possibly goal of the match.Astothe gesture, a deep free kick from Renton produced another equaliser, the home defence’s attempted clearance rebounding off a fellow team mate and into the net.So came the final moments of the game, with Cameron Wylie again involved.A crunching challenge on Wylie seemed to be an obvious free kick, but the referee waved play on.Gary Grumoli sent an inch perfect pass to the back post, for Ross Brown to score his first team goal and the Pupils# eventual, but by now, deserved winner.In a clf-hanging finish to a game that had everything, Alastair Ferguson produced a wonderful one-handed save to deflect a perfectly struck free kick to safety.Campbeltown Pupils are at home tomorrow with a pm kick off against second-placed Neilston.See posters and social media for further information.A previous celebration for Gary Grumoli and Liam Renton two stars of Saturday#s match. _cpupils_celebration"},{"url":null,"title":"letter perfect bus service","story":"Last week I went to Glasgow, travelling on the .am bus and arrived only  minutes behind schedule despite the Rest and Be Thankful road closure.I was very impressed with West Coast Motors# handling of the situation which must cause transport companies huge logistical problems.Margaret Mathieson,Campbeltown."},{"url":null,"title":"seniors sway at tea dance soiree","story":"Senior citizens and friends were serenaded at the last tea dance of the year.Singer Robert McCallum#s golden oldies got almost everyone dancing at Saturday#s event in Campbeltown#s Lodge St John’s No .At the event organised by the Monday Social Club, guests were also treated to traditional tunes courtesy of Carradale#s Alex MacKinnon and his accordion.It wasn#t just seniors who enjoyed the afternoon, as ten-year-old Hannah Conley, who attended with her granny, Isabel, who turned  on Tuesday, was rarely off the dance floor.The icing on the cake was the copious amounts of home-baking and tea and coffee on offer, making sure everyone who danced the afternoon away remained hydrated.The event raised £ for Monday Social Club funds.For more photographs, see next week#s Courier.Ten-year-old Hannah Conley, right, danced the afternoon away with her granny#s friend Anna Viola. _cteadance"},{"url":null,"title":"down memory lane october 26 2018","story":"In the Courier, of November  ,  years on from Armistice Day, the Remembrance services were reported with six paragraphs on the front page and no pictures.Perhaps this was because the world seemed a more dangerous place.The Vietnam War was at roughly its mid-point and was to continue for another seven years.Horric pictures, shot war photographers such as Don McCuillin and Tim Page, filled #s daily papers and television news.In the UK The Troubles had just begun in Northern Ireland after a civil rights march, on October , led to widespread rioting.That  report states: #Highland Parish Church was the venue for the main service with contingents of ious armed forces and youth organisations parading there.#Unfortunately, the annual service at the War Memorial on the Esplanade had to be cancelled because of inclement weather and the service was held indoor at Victoria Hall.#Representatives of the RAF, the Royal Navy, the TA, Sea Cadets, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides and Army Cadets marched to the Highland Parish Church where Reverend C.

The remains of the castle are ancient and the oldest part is called Goblin Ha. It is partly underground, and its name means Goblin Hall.According to legend, a wizard named Hugh de Gford made a deal with the Devil nearly  years ago, and inan army of goblins swarmed up from hell and built Yester Castle for him. Goblin Ha is the part of the castle dating from that time and thatrsquos how it got its name.It is said goblins lurk in the shadows of the ruins, and especially in Goblin Ha itself. At sunset, when night falls, they come out of their hiding places and crawl about in the darkness.One autumn day quite recently a dad decided to take his two children on a trip to find Yester Castle. He worked long hours during the week so he kept weekends for his children.His daughter Suzie had just turned  and his son Jake was eight. Jake was mad about Harry Potter and wizards, and when he discovered there was a castle nearby made by goblins for a wizard he begged his dad to take him. Suzie was given the choice to stay at home with her mum, but at the last minute she decided to come.It was sunny when they set off. ldquoA perfect day to explore a castle made by goblins, said the dad jokingly. They parked at the golf course and walked towards the woods.ldquoMaybe the goblins play golf, Suzie joked to her wee brother.ldquoYou shouldnrsquot make fun, they might hear you, he said.They finally reached the edge of the wood and peered into it. Suzie found the bridge over the ravine that led to the ruins but then Jake ran ahead very excited, looking for goblins.It was dficult to imagine what the castle had originally looked like because it was so ruined. Jake said it reminded him of the ancient ruined temple in The Jungle Book movie. But one thing was for sure: it had an eerie atmosphere. As they explored, the dad walked under an archway and suddenly felt a shiver down his spine. He turned round and saw something move in the shadows.For a moment they stood absolutely still. Then a bird flew out, giving them a fright. The dad and Suzie burst into laughter.ldquoJust a stupid bird! said Jake, disappointed.After a careful search they found the entrance to Goblin Ha. It was a small entrance leading to a low, dark passageway. Jake bravely led the way, with his sister and dad close behind.A cold and damp atmosphere hit them as soon as they entered the chamber. Although it was dark, two windows above gave just enough light to see.ldquoSo all this was supposed to have been made by goblins  asked Suzie.ldquoYeah, said Jake, who was still getting over the excitement that he was actually in Goblin Ha, ldquoand they came from hell up that stairway. He pointed to the dark steps in the corner.All three stood peering into the dark stairway which plunged deep into the ground.ldquoAccording to the legend, this stairway was made by the Devil after he had done a deal with the wizard and it leads to hell. But itrsquos blocked up now, explained Jake. He looked at his father: ldquoCan we go down dad, please!ldquoSeems a bit dangerous to me son.ldquoAw, come on dad, said Suzie, ldquowe canrsquot come all this way and then not go down the stairway to hell.ldquoVery well, but Irsquoll go first and wersquoll use the torches on our phones, said the dad.Slowly they began to climb down the stairs. The light from their mobiles lit up the old walls and ancient worn steps as they descended. Suzie took photos in the darkness, although the flash wasnrsquot powerful enough to light up everything.Eventually they reached a point where great stones blocked the way so they couldnrsquot go any further. ldquoThey were put there to keep out the goblins, said Jake. His sister was now feeling a bit uneasy: ldquoCan we go now, dad  Itrsquos too spooky down here.ldquoScared of the goblins are we  her wee brother mocked.ldquoYes, letrsquos go back up, said the dad. Jake led the way up to Goblin Ha. ldquoItrsquos time we should be going, wersquove found the place so mission accomplished. Itrsquoll be dark soon, letrsquos go now while therersquos still good day light.So they left the ruins and walked back across the golf course, laughing and talking and admiring the beginnings of a sunset and a full moon in the darkening sky. They were at the car when Suzie realised she didnrsquot have her mobile phone.ldquoIt was in my back pocket, it mustrsquove fallen out, she insisted.ldquoAw no Suzie, it could be anywhere, her dad said, annoyed.ldquoDad, we have to go back to get it, please. I know I had it in Goblin Ha, it might have even fallen out there. The dad wasnrsquot happy but the mobile was expensive and so reluctantly he agreed.They retraced their steps all the way back to the castle. It had only been  minutes since they had left the ruins but the atmosphere in the dim twilight was very dferent.Finally they reached the entrance to Goblin Ha.ldquoYou go first, dad, said both children at the same time.And so the dad put on his torch and entered. His children followed close behind.When they emerged into Goblin Ha it was dark so the dad shone his torch on the ground, searching. ldquoWhere could you have left it  he asked Suzie.ldquoAnywhere, she replied, shrugging her shoulders.They couldnrsquot phone it as there was no reception, so they kept searching.It was Jake who heard it first: a faint sound coming from the dark stairway. He lted his head and looked in its direction but it was too dark to see anything. There it was again, it sounded like breathing.Jake froze in real terror. ldquoDadhellip he whispered, ldquodad, therersquos something there.ldquoStop it you wee bam, said his sister, ldquoyoursquore just trying to spook us. But then she heard it too. It was louder this time, a strange breathing sound. It was definitely coming from the stairway.Intrigued, the dad shone his light down the steps, although the mobilersquos torch wasnrsquot strong enough to completely light up the dark.Then suddenly a pair of red eyes appeared, staring back at him.The dad screamed, making his two children scream as well, and they instinctively ran for the exit. But it was dark and they couldnrsquot see the way.ldquoDad, for Godrsquos sake shine it over here, cried Suzie, now completely terried.The dad shone the torch and they ran through the passageway in a total panic. Once outside there was more light, from the full moon.ldquoWhy did you scream, you scared the hell out of me! Suzie shouted angrily at her dad.ldquoIrsquom sorry Suzie, it just gave me a fright, I didnrsquot mean to scare you, he said.ldquoWhat gave you a fright, what did you see dad  asked Jake, who was now scared himself despite his earlier bravado.ldquoNot sure really, I thought I saw, erhellipldquoYes, yes what  asked Suzie stretching out her arms impatiently.The dad hesitated, then said: ldquoWell it looked like eyes.ldquoI am now officially freaked out, said Suzie, ldquoplease letrsquos just get out of here, never mind the sodding phone.ldquoIrsquom sure it was some kind of animal, maybe a fox or even an owl, said her dad, trying to reassure her, ldquobut yes itrsquos too dark now, we should go back to the car and maybe we can come back tomorrow in the light to look for your mobile.Jake was suddenly distracted. He saw something in the passageway.ldquoDadhellip dad, whatever it is, itrsquos coming after us, look!The shadow of some creature was in the passageway, moving towards them.Both Suzie and Jake were now in a state of complete terror and they ran.ldquoNo, no, itrsquos dangerous, therersquos a steep fall there, donrsquot run! called out the dad.The kids stopped just in time. In the moonlight they could see they were standing on the edge of a steep fall. Their dad caught up with them and took their hands. They walked together carefully with hearts racing through the trees towards the bridge that led to the golf course.Behind them, a dark shadow came out of the entrance and crawled into the wood.They were just past the arched wall when they saw the dark shadow move in front of them, blocking the way. The dad shone his torch directly at it, and for a split second he saw it before it vanished into the darkness. He looked shocked.ldquoWhat the hell was that, dad  shrieked Suzie.ldquoI honestly donrsquot know, he saidWhatever it was, it was still in the woods, moving in the darkness. Then it came towards them once again, this time making strange noises.Jake suddenly yelled out: ldquoOur father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come thy will be done, in heaven as it is on earthhellip Whatever it was made a sound like a scream and retreated back into the dark wood towards Goblin Ha. Jake continued the prayer and finished with a loud ldquoamen.ldquoLetrsquos get out of here, said the dad. All three ran in the moonlight out of the shadows of the wood onto the golf course. They kept running until they reached the car park, legs aching and completely breathless.The dad fumbled for his keys while the children stared at the golf course, looking for a moving shadow.Finally the dad found his keys and they were in the car and away as fast as possible.Suzie was the first to speak: ldquoI ask again, what was it ldquoI think the dark was playing tricks on us, said her dad, ldquoit was an animal of some sort.ldquoBut what about that horrible scream  she asked.ldquoFoxes can make a strange screeching noise at night, Suzie, thatrsquos what I think it was, said her dad, trying to reassure her.ldquoIt was a goblin, wasnrsquot it dad  asked Jake.ldquoAye right, replied his sister sarcastically, ldquoyou read too much Harry Potter. And what was all that praying about  That was just weird.ldquoIt was a redcap goblin, said Jake, ldquoyou canrsquot outrun them and the Lordrsquos Prayer is the only thing that will stop them. I had memorised it before our visit, just in case.ldquoHowrsquod you know that  asked SuzieldquoI read about it, said Jake.Suzie was just about to say something when her dad winked at her and interrupted: ldquoWellit was a redcap then the prayer seemed to work. He hoped this would stop them arguing. And it did. Jake smiled and put on his earphones.ldquoIrsquom sure it was a fox, whispered the dad to his daughter, ldquoor maybe a big rat, but just let Jake think it was a goblin.They got home with a story to tell their mum!In a quiet moment, when the children were busy, she asked the dad: ldquoSo what was it you saw He hesitated to answer the question, ashe wouldnrsquot be believed.ldquoTo be honest, I donrsquot know, he said. ldquoI told the kids it was a fox because I didnrsquot want to spook them, but I really canrsquot say.Who knows the truth of it all  If Suziersquos phone is ever found, the photos she took in the dark stairway might reveal what was really hiding in the darkness on that day."},{"url":null,"title":"be-prepared-for-next-beast-from-the-east-says-council-emergency-planner","story":"Severe weather is the biggest risk to people living in East Lothian, according to Sandy Baptie.And he has issued advice ahead of a one-day workshop to help communities prepare for any future emergencies.It includes going back to old-fashioned handsets in a time when more people rely on mobile phones.Mr Baptie, East Lothian Councilrsquos emergency planning, risk and resilience manager, has been visiting community councils and groups in the wake of the lsquoBeast from the Eastrsquo snowstorm, which brought much of the country to a standstill in February and March this year.Heavy snowfalls and strong winds caused chaos on the roads and left many people stranded in their homes.It also saw a surge in community spirit, with tales of people helping neighbours and looking after the more vulnerable people.Now Mr Baptie is hoping that spirit will help all communities prepare a Community Resilience Plan which they can use in case another severe weather front hits the county.And he has issued some advice for people to prepare in their own home for what could happen.He said: ldquoSevere weather is the biggest risk to East Lothian.ldquoBeing prepared for it is important and people can do things themselves, such as keeping an old-fashioned phone in their house in case mobile signal is lost, having a torch to hand in case power goes.ldquoIt is also important to stock up on food when warnings that severe weather is on its way are issued.More than  people are expected to attend the community resilience workshop at The Brunton, Musselburgh, on Saturday.The one-day event, which is being funded by EDF Energy and the Scottish Government, will bring together representatives from community councils, groups and schools.Advice on a range of aspects of drawing up community resilience plans will be available, including ensuring groups who take on responsibility are covered by insurance.It will also inform people of services they can sign up to with energy companies to ensure they receive a phone callpower goes out.North Berwick Community Council, which already has a plan and implemented it successfully during the Beast from the East, will be there to talk about how they did it and what worked.Mr Baptie hopes the event will result in community plans from across the county, with each one appointing a Single Person of Contact or SPOC.He said: ldquoThe idea of a SPOC is that there is one point of contact between each community and the council so we can get information to them and they can let us know what is happening, for examplepower has gone out in one area.ldquoThe plans are about drawing up lists of vulnerable people in the community, finding out who has a x and can get medicine to people or take them to hospital or the doctor.ldquoIt is about being prepared.

This is a very concerning piece of news, especially given the fact that the Tesco bus also serves the health centre.ldquoIt comes at a time when we are being told that we need to use public transport more because of dire warnings about the impact of climate change and when massive house building will lead to gridlock unless newcomers can be persuaded onto buses.Mr Turner added: ldquoEast Lothian generally, and Musselburgh in particular, is now renowned for its excellent bus services so this announcement comes as a blow and runs counter to all that has been achieved on the public transport front in the last few of years.ldquoLetrsquos hope that the council, working with the operators, can come up with a proposal to replace the extremely useful Tesco bus, and in doing so letrsquos try to serve some places that are currently remote from buses ndash Edenhall Road and the Muckletts, for example, both had buses until a few years ago and theirwould, I am sure, be welcomed by elderly residents.ldquoI think the Tesco bus should be replaced by something very similar, perhaps marketed as the Musselburgh community bus. It should not just parallel other bus routes, which is what the Tesco bus does, but should serve some of the residential areas that are cut off from buses. Goose Green is another area remote from a bus route.A Tesco spokesperson said: ldquoWe have made the dficult decision to stop the provision of the T and T bus services to and from our Musselburgh Extra store.ldquoUnfortunately the services make a loss, which means we are no longer able to provide them.ldquoWe have worked with local bus providers to ensure that all affected areas will continue to have a bus link that connects them to our store, including a newly introduced  bus from Longniddry to Fort Kinnaird.ldquoOur priority now is to ensure our customers who use the bus are aware of our decision and of all these alternative routes so that they are able to plan their journeys.ldquoWe apologise for any inconvenience this causes.A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: ldquoEast Lothian Council was notied of Tescorsquos intention to withdraw the T and T services in September and we are fully aware of the impact this may have on the local community.

published inMay.Her remarks coincided a leak to the Scottish Daily Mailrevealingthe committee had backed ending the ban on prisoner voting.The Scottish Tories immediately issued a press release condemning the idea, which included quotes from Ms Wells about the committees work.She said: \"The Scottish Conservatives do not support these proposals.ldquoThere is absolutely no public support for these proposals, and at no time did the Committee hear directly from victims of crime on this matter.\"Only the Scottish Conservatives will stand up for victims and their families.Thereport was not made public until three days later.The Tories today insisted Ms Wells did not leak the report, but had merely commented on material which was already in the public domain.Ms Wells, a member of the committee, was reported to Scotlandrsquos Standards Commissioner by fellowSNP member Gail Ross.The Commissioner concluded Ms Wells, the Scottish Tories mental health spokeswoman, had breached Holyroodrsquos confidentiality rules.At Thursdayrsquos meeting of the Standards Committee, convener Bill Kidd said: ldquoThe Committee has considered a complaint from Gail Ross MSP about Annie Wells MSP.ldquoThe complaint is that Annie Wells sought political advantage by making advance public comment on the Equalities and Human Rights Committeersquos report on ldquoPrisoner Voting in Scotland.ldquoThis Committee is unanimous in the decisions reached on the complaint.ldquoFirstly, it agrees with the findings in fact and conclusion of the Commissioner that Annie Wells breached paragraphs ,  and  of Section  of the Code of Conduct for MSPs by making public press comment in advance of the publication of the Equalities and Human Rights Committeersquos report.ldquoSecondly, the Committee considers that the breaches justy the imposition of sanctions on Annie Wells.ldquoI propose that the Committee will recommend in its report that the Parliament excludes Annie Wells MSP from all meetings of the Parliament and all meetings of its Committees for five sitting days.The sanction, which must now be ratied by MSPs, does not exclude Ms Wells from the Holyrood campus, but she cannot take part in any debates or committees.She will not lose any salary while excluded.A vote of MSPs is expected soon, and the sanction will begin this month.In previous parliamentary sessions, former Tory MSP Brian Monteith and former LibDem MSP Mike Pringle received similar one week bansfor leaking committee reports.Tory MSP Alexander Burnett recently received a two-week ban on lodging written parliamentary questions after failing to declare a personal financialinterest in some of the subject matter.Former SNP minister Mark McDonald, who now sits as an Independent MSP, recently finisheda month-long ban from Holyrood that included a loss of salary for sexual misconduct.Ms Wells said: \"Numerous media outlets contacted our office seeking comment on a story on the front page of a national newspaper that morning on prisoner voting.ldquoSo I responded to that, as every MSP would, by issuing a statement to them reiterating my opposition to allowing prisoners voting rights.ldquoMy response did not contain details of the report that werenrsquot already known, nor was I responsible for the original leak of the document to the paper, and we still donrsquot know who was.ldquoIndeed, I did not receive the final report until after it had featured in the national media.ldquoI will continue to work on behalf of my constituents and I will continue to oppose giving

the UK Government would \"take action\" on any amendments to the Brexit deal motion approved by MPs but added that it might not be possible for ministers to \"proceed on the basis of an amended vote\".Her remarks came after Ken Clarke, the former Conservative Chancellor, warned UK ministers against offering MPs the choice of deal or no-deal.Pete Wishart for the SNP also claimed that Theresa May could, in Game Of Thrones-style, be \"consumed by the flames\" of Brexit as he pushed for assurances over the \"meaningful vote\".Mrs Leadsom also announced the Commons business following next weeks short November recess, with no further Brexit legislation listed but with time scheduled for a debate on the th birthday of the Prince of Wales.Speaking at Business of the House Questions, Mr Clarke said Mrs Leadsom had confirmed a \"meaningful vote\" in response to questions from Mr Wishart.He added: \"She confirmed were going to have meaningful votes because there are going to be amendments to that motion.\"She was of course right to say the Government cant raty a draft agreementthe House rejects it but will she accept that the meaningful votes on the amendments mean thatan amendment is passed, the Government will feel it should go back to Brussels and try to negotiate a deal as amended by the majority of this House \"I hope shes not reverting to the arguments that its the deal weve got or no deal at all, which the Government was defeated on when we were actually debating the Withdrawal Bill earlier this year.\"Mrs Leadsom replied: \"The facts of the case are that the Government will be bringing forward a vote on the deal that the Government has negotiated.\"It will be an amendable motion of the House, and, should the House amend that motion, then the Government would take action on those amendments.\"However, I must point out to the House again that, having negotiated a particular deal with the European Union, it may not be possible for the Government to proceed on the basis of an amended vote.\"While this House will be asked to decide whether it agrees for the Government to negotiate on the basis of the agreed deal or not will be a matter for this House.\"Earlier, Mr Wishart compared the Prime Ministers Brexit stre to Game Of Thrones as he demanded further clarication on the current state of negotiations with the EU.\"The chill is in the air and, like winter, Brexit is coming, declared the Perth MP.\"The undead white walkers of the ERG have breached the wall and Westminstros is under siege and, while the Prime Minister is no mother of dragons, she does have fire breathers to contend with she might just be about to be consumed by the flames.\"In the battle with the  kingdoms apparently were told to expect a deal on November  for a Brexit agreement only for Dexu to issue a statement downplaying the signicance of this date.\"Can the Leader of the House explain what exactly is going on, when will we have this meaningful vote, on what conditions and what basis will it be put to the House and what range of options will we have to consider and can she assure us that this meaningful vote wont be a meaningless vote \"Mrs Leadsom responded with her own quip, saying: \"Well, he mentions ious excerpts from the Game Of Thrones and all I would say to him is: You know nothing, Jon Snow and Im afraid that is often the case in this place.\"She added: \"It is absolutely the case that this House will be invited to give its views and to lend its support to the deal that the United Kingdom will be seeking to agree with the European Union it will be vital that we have that approval in order to proceed.\"Such a motion will be a motion of the House, it will be amendable, but to be very clear, as I said last week and the week before, it will be important that the Government has the permission of the House to go ahead with a deal that has been agreed. If it doesnt have that permission, then it will not be able to proceed with that deal.\""},{"url":null,"title":"off-airport-parking-saves-you-money-but-adds-a-new-level-of-stress","story":"But getting to Disneyland Paris was a nightmare.

the majority of those shown are in lower ranks.He also interviewed each of them, and tells their stories in text which accompanies the exhibition.The artist said: ldquoI had been thinking about World War One, and the soldiers from that war are dead, but many of the soldiers I spoke to, they had family members who had fought in the war: like surgeons and teachers, being in the army seems to run in families.ldquoThe basic idea, really, of mine was that army portraits tend to be of the high-rankers, the upper crust of the army, but I really wanted to keep this to normal people, to make portraits of them and see what they had to say about being the army, for themselves.: Portraits of World War One figures on Scottish beachesHe added that as his project developed, British Army representatives spoke to him, initially, he believes, nervous about the project and how it might portray the army.Mr McKendrick said: ldquoThe army is a top-to-bottom place, and I think they were worried about the impression that would be given.ldquoBut what struck me was I was dealing with some people who had been gravely wounded, and some who had seen and experienced some horrendous things, but they all had this immense pride, to a man and woman, in being in the army.ldquoI personally didnrsquot have any bias or prejudgement on what I would find.ldquoWhat I found was some outstanding, but very ordinary, people.The artist created the portraits on paper with mixed media, using acrylics and pastels as well as some watercoloursand oil.The exhibition includes an image of Corporal David Timmins, QGM, who lost an eye and suffered multiple injuries in an explosion in Afghanistan in .: How Scotlands beaches will remember war deadOf Corporal David Timmins, McKendrick writes in the book that accompanies the show: ldquoCorporal Timminsrsquo story is indeed many stories.ldquoAmong them, the extraordinary skill and dedication of surgeons and nursing staff, the human ability to survive devastating injuries and a manrsquos unwillingness to admit defeat.ldquoDavidrsquos route to recovery has been hard and it will continue to be so for many years to come.Those depicted have a myriad of military experiences.It includes Sergeant Bert Stone, who was at Monte Cassino, Sergeant Allan McKinlay at Anzio, and Major Mandy Islamwho saw service in Northern Ireland, Bosnia, Iraq and Afghanistan.Elizabeth Dent, writing in the book, notes: ldquoTom is capable of creating objects and paintings of great beauty.ldquoHe does not glory war, but in this exhibition of soldiers, he honours the ordinary men and women who do extraordinary things.The artist added: ldquoI would say people will see the show, perhaps they will see a  year old gentleman in a chair and think nothing of it, then they will read that as an -year-old, he parachuted in behind enemy lines.ldquoYou might then look back at the painting, and your view of it may completely change.He noted: ldquoThe show really is a composite, there is a lot of writing in it.: Artist revisits his acclaimed Blitz paintingsMcKendrick was born in Clydebank in .He served an aprenticeship as a lsquoLoftsmanrsquo in John Browns Shipyard before studying at Glasgow School of Art from  to , and has since exhibited widely and awards for his work.His exhibitions include Blitz, Submarine, Rivet Temple, Iron and Heavier Than Air.The artist added: ldquoAll of these dferent stories are of survivors, but they represent millions of untold stories from the First World War to the present day.ldquoThe men and women who look out at us are dignied, determined and stoical.

The Scottish Government carried out the enforcement in  to ensure the Cairngorms National Park Authority could extend the Speyside Way across the estate.The Kinrara Estate was once home to Jane Gordon, Duchess of Gordon, a Scottish Tory political hostess who threw lavish high-society parties and had a sprung dance floor installed along the fullof the house.She also founded The Gordon Highlanders infantry regiment in .Kinrara House was extended around  and again in , when it was let to Sir George Sitwell before eventually being passed to the Duke of Richmond and Gordon after the death of the last Duke of Gordon.Further alterations were made in , at the height of the Arts and Crafts Movement, by Inverness architect William Laidlaw Carruthers.From around  until , Kinrara was home to Lucy, Lady Houston, a former showgirl known as Poppy who saved the Spitfire aircraft from being stillborn nine years before the Battle of Britain.She donated huge sums to keep research going into its predecessor ndash the Supermarine S, a single-engined racing seaplane ndash when Ramsay MacDonaldrsquos government pulled funding for the project during the Great Depression in .Without her backing, it is unlikely to have faced the Luftwaffe in the Second World War.Kinrararsquos sale by Salisbury-based owners Clouds Estate follows the recent deaths of family members and tenants Major Robin McLaren and we Annie, who lived thereat Kinrara for many years.Selling agents Savills, announcing the sale, stated: ldquoWith the next generation of the family based in the south, after much soul-searching they have come to the decision that it is now time to pass the estate to a new owner who has the time, energy and passion to look after this incredible property.\"Evelyn Channing, of Savills, said: ldquoKinrara has it all, tranquillity and beauty and a range of possibilities for developing income streams.

Or make up an entirely new word.Of course, men arent having to deal with such indignities. It seems \"man\" is still an inoffensive word. It is \"woman\" that is the issue. Same as it ever was.Language and the weight of meaning is having a moment.The BBC slipped up in a tweet about the President-elect of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro. With a list of quotes from the far-right politician, it asked the question: \"Racist, sexist and homophobic or a refreshing break from political correctness \"After an outcry about the way fascist views are being framed as mainstream, the broadcaster retracted the tweet with: \"The intention was to reflect the spectrum of opinion on such statements but the language of the post may not have reflected this accurately.\"Next, to the American broadcaster CNN, which took a potshot at President Donald Trump. The Obfuscater-In-Chief went off on one of his bizarre rants accusing CNN of claiming he had been directly responsible for a bomb sent to its offices by a Trump supporter.CNN released a statement: \"We did say that [you] should understand your words matter. Every single one of them. But so far, you donrsquot seem to get that.\"Sir Philip Green, the owner of Topshop, finds himself emphatically denying charges of sexual harassment and racist abuse of staff. In his  years in business, there has \"Been some banter,\" he said. \"And a bit of humour.\"Ah, the old banter defence. The last bastion of students in Nazi Halloween costumes and ponytail-pulling politicians everywhere.Its hard to argue with the idea that language has power. That words might amount to harassment. That thoughtless statements may incite violence in someone primed to lash out. That giving equal weight to mainstream and extreme political ideologies legitimises hate.So, does the slow erasure of the word \"woman\" mean anything  In order to be inclusive and to prevent causing offence to trans people, the word \"woman\" has become a problem.A national newspaper last week ran a story about womens experience of dealing with period pain at work, but the word \"woman\" was replaced with \"menstruator\". That word is very slowly becoming increasingly used to acknowledge that trans men and non-binary people have periods too.There was a story on the website of another national newspaper this week that managed to tell a y story about periods while completely avoiding using the word \"woman\" or \"girl\", despite the fact the story was about a schoolgirl who was caught short and a male classmate who very kindly helped her.\"Chest feeding\" in place of breast feeding is another inclusive term and a particularly odd one, given that men do have breasts. \"Pregnant people\" is now preferred to \"pregnant women\"The Wellcome Collection, a London museum, was berated last month over its use of the word \"womxn\" to promote a new event aimed at women. How would one even pronounce it  Sounds like bollx.During the summer Cancer Research UK launched a campaign to encourage the uptake of smear tests. It was aimed at \"everyone aged - with a cervix\".Inclusive in a way, but arguably exclusive. Its complex language for, say, people who dont speak English as a first language and for groups where women might not be aware of all the words relating to their biology.One of the arguments in favour of changes to the Gender Recognition Act in Scotland, which would bring into force gender self-ID and remove current bureaucracy for trans people, is that whats in your pants shouldnt matter.Yet, by replacing the word \"woman\" we are doing just that - placing an emphasis on biology and bodily s. Its dehumanising and it is problematic for the very fact that women have fought for recognition and a voice in a male-dominated world thanks to acceptance of \"woman\" as being a political class.We are pleased that women are being recognised, finally, on bank notes. Yet we are still fighting for gains to be made in board rooms, on sports fields, the political sphere and so on.We can only losewe allow the word \"woman\" to be erased in the name of progression.Is this progressive or is a clever trick on the part of the patriarchy  The answer lies in the fact that, as I said, it is not the word \"man\" causing problems. Women have fought ferociously to have the same status, rights and respect as men.Of course, all groups deserve equal rights, protections and dignity and must be afforded those. But there has to be another way to ensure inclusion. Otherwise we are going backwards in a vain attempt to move forwards."},{"url":null,"title":"is-david-cameron-planning-a-return-to-politics-god-no-pleads-one-mp","story":"Was it impassioned commentary on Fiscal Philrsquos anti-austerity Budget or a decisive move in those painfully protracted Brexit negotiations  No.It seems David William Donald Cameron is ldquobored s***less and wants to come back to Whitehall.Le, it appears, during the months at the bottom of the Cameron garden in the Cotswolds, holed up in his pound, shed, writing his political memoirs and le thereafter has been somewhat drab for Dave and the former premier, at just , wants toto the cut and thrust of British politics ndash post Theresa May and post Brexit.One source told The Sun: ldquoDavid is dedicated to public service and has often said he wouldnrsquot rule out a public role, domestically or internationally.

Jim therefore tried to find historical accuracy as far as possible by researching contemporary documents and manuscripts that held vital evidence.\"There are certain liberties you can take, like for example the drumming used by the armies preparing for battle and that is often for dramatic effect.\"The film is billed as a \"true David versus Goliath story\" of how the great th-century \"outlaw king\" Robert the Bruce used cunning and bravery to defeat the larger and better-equipped occupying English army.At the films debut during the Toronto Film Festival last year there were a few raised eyebrows when American actor Chris Pine, who plays Bruce, appeared full-frontal naked in one scene.Directed by Oscar-nominated film-maker David Mackenzie the epic was shot in ious Scottish locations throughout  and Jim spent six months working on the diegetic soundtrack.Jim said: \"I had a meeting with David Mackenzie just a few weeks before the shoot and none of this particular aspect was planned.

We all love it.\"Gill Arrowsmith and Shirley Sinclair both thought the painting was \"fantastic\" while Annemarie Simpson thought that a similar venture in Wick would help tackle the \"towns eyesore\" buildings.While on that subject, one dissenting voice condemned the piece and said there was a \"masterpiece eyesore now in Wilson Street thanks to Caithness Horizons\".Beauty is, of course, in the eye of the beholder.The mural depicts a portrait of Thursos renowned botanist and geologist Robert Dick surrounded by a kaleidoscopic representation of the CHMAG facade and the scientists specimen collection.The bold use of line and colour based on modern urban graffiti cannot fail to be noticed just like the mural on nearby Tollemache House but is sited in a much less conspicuous space ndash the gallerys car park.CHMAGs curator Merran Gunn, who was instrumental in commissioning Delaye to create the work, said the artist had also spray painted a wall within the building as part of a show running called Graffito.His earlier piece has an explosive anime style figure punching out of the wall toward the viewer.\"Marcs work is bold and vibrant, electric colours jostle for dominance, and the new outside mural is no exception with tangerine skies set behind the historic Thurso of Robert Dick,\" said Gunn.Thursos illustrious scientist had his herbarium collection feature in an earlier work by the artist Joanne Carr which in turn is featured within Delayes mural ndash a clear case of one artist paying homage to another.\"Graffiti and street art is more relevant than ever whether it be in the art world ndash with the recent record sale of Banksys girl with a balloon ndash or here in the Highlands where graffiti has made its way onto the syllabus at Farr High School through art teacher Tracy Wilkinson,\" she said.After garnering great positive feedback from the current show Merran decided to \"have a moment of spontaneity\" and raised funds through a crowdfunding website and the Dounreay Communities Fund to commission Marc Delaye to breath some le into a fairly drab corner of the town.Tracy Dodson, commercial manager of CHMAG, said that the gallery was \"breaking boundaries\" with Graffito.\"It questions what actually constitutes art and what gets shown in a gallery. Graffito is an exhibition that celebrates artwork that is available to everyone.\"Traditionally graffiti has been seen as anti-social, fringe or even as criminal vandalism, but with an emphasis on social inclusion, we are celebrating street, pop, comic and zine work as mainstream art for hanging in our gallery.\"Tracy unabashedly declares that Graffito is \"aimed at young people and the young at heart, as a way of inviting new and future audiences to a museum and gallery experience\".\"This is a multicoloured on-the-wall exhibition devoted to all manner of graphic mark-making and breaking the boundaries of what art is all about,\" she said. \"We have also hosted street painting and comic workshops, guided gallery tours, and collaborating with our local schools and council.\"Marc Delaye is an established community projects artist with Freshpaint.org which is based on the Black Isle.\"Murals are as alive now as ever before and an excellent way to introduce art to internal and external spaces, giving iniduals and communities something that they can be proud of and enjoy each and every day,\" said Marc.The murals can be privately commissioned and can be an \"ideal means of advertising products, services, messages and campaigns\".Other exhibitors at Graffito include Andy Strachan, of Comic Creations Studios Dundee, David Robertson of Fred Egg Comics and Zu Dominak, all of whom work at the University of Dundee within the Masters degrees in Comics and Graphic Novels ndash the only course of its kind in the UK.Other exhibitors include Victor Nobis and his series Fallen Giants ndash a fantasy dream space where cities like Edinburgh rise and twist through the torso of neon lit giant figures.Graffito finishes on Saturday with a day of childrens workshops, guided tours and a colouring competition.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"November ,  at : pmThough there won#t be as many fireworks as expected, this weekend, there#s still plenty to see and do.

The project is supported by Orkney Islands Council’s Arts Development team.It will run on a loop eight times from pm each evening between now and Remembrance Day on November .At around .pm each night it will come to a rest on the final image — a tree, made up of the names of Orcadians who died in WWI, in a field of poppies.Glasgow-based specialists Playdead were engaged to create the film and pupils from Glaitness Primary and Kirkwall Grammar schools were involved in the creation of the work.Kevin McCrae, creative director and founder of Playdead, said: “After speaking to local people and school children about what they’d like to see and seeing what we could draw on from archives as well, we thought it would be good to develop a series of sequences which looked at the war and its impacts in Orkney from a range of angles.“Spectators will see snippets of what soldiers would have experienced, but also there are scenes which explore how farmers and school children would have been affected, as well as a look at what propaganda people here would have seen, and images from after the war of how the end of the conflict was celebrated and how it was commemorated.“There are some big technical challenges associated with projecting onto a surface like the St Magnus Cathedral. It’s such an iconic building in the heart of Kirkwall and we wanted to do justice to it # so we have done a lot of work to take into account the uneven surfaces and to choose a colour palette that would really work with the beautul red stone.The Great War: An Orkney Memorial Experience will run for the final time between pm and pm on Remembrance Day,  November.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

This is not some dry, academic debate. The potential health consequences of ministers failing to heed the advice of their own experts are serious.“I hope the Health Secretary will use her influence, therefore, to persuade her colleague, the Housing Minister, to accept the case for using a Rural Minimum Income Standard to help define fuel poverty in rural and island areas.  This is the only way of ensuring those who need help get the support they need.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Now in its seventh consecutive season, the Sanday Sealcam is online once again.A camera has been set up overlooking two small coves in a part of the island that is rarely visited — except by seals, otters, rabbits and birds.Set up with the kind permission of local landowners, the Towrie family, the camera is linked to a radio dish that transmits the signal, by line of sight, to a distant receiving dish, and the apparatus is powered by solar batteries — and this year for the first time, a supplementary wind-generator # at the site.Here, the live action is streamed to the internet and can be watched by anyone who logs on to the sealcam website.Sandra Towrie, Chair of Sanday Development Trust said: “Sanday Development Trust is delighted to work with Triscom as it is a hard task to stream the camera using remote, rural broadband and get high-quality live footage successfully being streamed onto the web. The Sanday sealcam allows visitors a unique opportunity to see Orkney’s amazing wildle up close and personal, and follow the highs and lows of an Orkney seal colony during pupping season from the comfort of their armchair — perfect for those unable to visit the island in person.”In recent years, Northlink Ferries have part-sponsored the Sealcam, while Sanday Development Trust continues to fund repairs, replacements and maintenance of the equipment and the time involved in camera control.Thousands of people, from all over the world, have looked at Sanday Sealcam. From the comfort of your computer-desk, or even your laptop in an armchair by the fire, the website brings you the sights and sounds of seals on an Orkney beach. It’s a particularly impressive atmosphere when the tide is high and the weather rough.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

She said: \"Our children are subject to appalling conditions. Only today my daughter had to sit in her classroom with her coat and hat on as it was so cold. A classroom that incorporates the staff toilet and staff room. To avoid the staff room, children are having to go in and out of the classroom via outdoors.\"Dingwall and Seaforth ward councillor Angela MacLean invited childrenrsquos minister Maree Todd and the arearsquos MSP, Kate Forbes, to support a push for funding for a replacement. Ms MacLean said: \"I think the staff do a fantastic job and it is incumbent on us to try and get a solution and all work together. Having it on the capital programme with a reduced capital budget has been dficult but everyone who has seen it knows it is badly needing replaced. Whether it be Scottish Government or Highland Council we all have to work together. Given the children that go to St Clementrsquos, it does make it more urgent because they are our most vulnerable young people.\"Mrs Todd, a Ross-shire-based Highlands and Islands MSP, declared the school not fit for purpose when she visited this year.She said shersquod be \"more than happy\" to meet local councillors but added: \"As a member of the ruling administration, Ms MacLean will know that St Clementrsquos had not previously been prioritised by Highland Council in their capital spending plans.\"Since my visit to St Clementrsquos this year Highland Council has now prioritised it. Should they require my support in making further progress, I am happy to help.\"Dingwall-based MSP Kate Forbes previously described the school \"as like something out of Oliver Twist\".She said: \"Highland Councilrsquos plans for school buildings seem to be entirely reliant on additional Scottish Government funding when it is the council who has statutory responsibility for school buildings and their annual budget settlement recognises that.\"Shesaid Highland Council had been the second highest beneficiary of the Scottish Governmentrsquos Schools for the Future funding scheme, receiving poundmillion. The next school buildings funding programme is expected by the end of the year.Renewing an appeal for progress, Ms Ferguson warned of \"promises broken and deadlines long passed\" and accused the council of breaking the law over conditions. She said: \"Our children face another winter in cold classrooms having to go out in all weathers to access already disgracefully inadequate facilities ndash itrsquos shameful.\"Let us know what YOU think.

The Highland Council appreciate the work by Network Rail to introduce this innovative solution.\"Despite the reducedof daytime closure windows the road will remain shut each night from pm to am.

They are looking into this after we contacted them.“We do not comment on inidual cases but we have followed government and local authority policies and guidance, as we do for any asylum admissions matter.”The school takes on asylum seekers as required.‘Brandon Lee’\u2028In Scotland in , a -year-old man spent a year at a prestigious school posing as a -year-old pupil.\u2028Brian MacKinnon, who called himself Brandon Lee enrolled at Bearsden Academy, Glasgow, in August .

When Spanish police searched his hotel room, they found two passports - one showing him as a -year-old, the other as a -year- old.Language BarrierThe student accused of lying about his age is currently in year  after joining the school in September of this year.He is believed to be from Iran and speaks very little English.Pupils claim teachers are unable to properly communicate with him due to the language barrier.But concerns have been raised that he is still studying at the school while investigations into his age are carried out.One mum, whose son is in the same year, said: “Parents at the school have been pulling their children out of school left right and centre.“Looking at photos of this man, he is clearly older than .

I am terried to think what would happenhe started a relationship with a young girl who thought he was her age.“My son has always said that he looks older and he says the man does not even speak English. He sits in the class but cannot speak or learn “What makes it worse is that the school has made no contact with any of the parents or called us in for a meeting yet we are all up in arms and worried about our children’s health and safety.“Something needs to be done and soon because this is likely to be happening all over the country and the Home Office is doing very little to help.“Undocumented people are being let into our country and no tests are being done to find out their age.“I won’t have my son studying with a -year-old man.”Others took to social media to share their views.‘p****d off with the school’Mum Hollie Dayinn said: “So My son’s school now let’sin ‘ year old men’ claiming to be a  year old.“He’s been there since the start of last term.

It is a huge security breach these situations should be looked at closely.”Mum Stacey Bonner, , wrote: “The school have confirmed to me by phone this morning that he is still attending school and there is nothing they can do until the Home Office prove his age.“The school should have him removed immediately.”Lee Northcott added: “I am shocked and outraged that this has happened when my son and nephew attends this school.“They need to get to the bottom of this and get it resolved as soon as possible.”But one man, Toby Bignell claimed to feel sorry for the asylum seeker.Asking not to be named, he said: “It’s clear why he’s doing it, he’s an asylum seeker from another country whose qualications don’t count for anything here so he’s just trying to get some qualications so he can work and do something with himself.“It is more an indication of how there isn’t anything in place for people coming from war torn places for refuge who actually want to work and contribute to the country that has saved them ultimately you’ve got to feel bad for the guy.“He feels that this is what he has to resort to and he’s taking a big risk by doing so.”Stoke High School is an co-educational academy in Ipswich, Suffolk with  students.The school which is rated ‘requires improvement’ by OfSted gained Academy status in .©Johnston Publishing Ltd..Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.The project, costing around £ million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in .

It is part of the Year of Young People activities.The youngsters involved will come up with ideas but they are also keen to hear what other young people would like to see on the mural.Year of Young People ambassador Jonathan Dorrat said: “We’d really like children and young people aged eight to  years to come forward with designs or concepts for the new mural. Some of the themes could be, #What do you enjoy about Shetland #, #What makes you proud of Shetland #, #What is Shetland famous for #.# Send any ideas, before Friday th July , to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.The SIC#s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.#This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People .”Are they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be doneI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish##.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc###and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of le or some other pointless title.Over the years art has very much lowered its standards signicantly to make and justy it becoming more commercially viable####.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called # limited edition rubbish #.I would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at###atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.No doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and le experience###..despite the fact everybody  looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.Love the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildle centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me .. Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!Why not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like    It#s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.There are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined. Next you#ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!I think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.If you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, #The Arts#, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved    SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, #Status Quo#, thanks, Malcomn Younger and #Scottish National Ballet, #Highland Fling #, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildle centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £ million on that. A scientic, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.Would not even need a bar!!!The Shard in London, an amazingly beatul structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass. Building methods change along with building materials.I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.Come on Haydn I agree there are many beautul building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.The Shard is a massive glass pyramid#.I#m wholly indferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug##.Mareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.If I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used # There#s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.All the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.Call me old fashioned but I would love to see the modernbuilding business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of  to  tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles,all done  years ago.It#s true you really can#t get the staff nowadays. I wonderthe Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops # the British ways of one can#t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is aboutto finish offanother burgeoning industry.I’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up! As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in theirbucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.Aluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.I’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of theterm ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much inidentying the material nature of that being used but more an attemptto denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure Rather like calling a van a box on wheels  I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaningcomments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.If it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.@ Haydn Gear.When there is nothing of note to dferentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.Pretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.Unless you already know Mareel#s purpose and that its supposedly an #iconic# design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that#s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname #The Pagoda# as soon as it was built.Let us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for #Mareel# to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst#s #Pickled cow and calf.#, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel#s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.I have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel. What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kickout of venting there spleens in those directions.I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.Leaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man Those of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.Purely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda wasin any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it I wondertakeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architecturalsimilarities.The viking was a chippy when it opened.#What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.# Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, # is their primaryto stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments  #, #I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever# and # Pig ignorant prats.# Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!Well Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there  All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , prolerate.Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.Love hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my le involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of someby those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and tomaintaincredibility from the watchful public at large. In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.Look what happened!So let today’s critics mock onit makes them feel better.Paraphrasing MGM#s famous motto, the phrase #Arse gratia artis#, springs to mind. LOL 🙂As an artist myselfdoing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildle, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.I have been to many art exhibitions andart shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as # ripping off the customer # with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody  can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.It takes me about  hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.I have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products dficult to accommodate should pay a visit. Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spenceis an all too common feature in mostwalks of le —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns isnot too far removed from theactions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!So talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.Nobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as #pig ignorant#. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such #arty things#.We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £ million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained consecrated.No doubt it was deliberate and theopportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !Had you checked out Ian#s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I#d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous #Sam the Eagles# among us. That said, it#s a concept I wouldn#t wish to see spread any farther!🙂No insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to #The Black Mountains#. Iwill try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found inMareel#s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing , nasty little creatures!!! .Fairenough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artistswhen it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of le. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.HGIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the # shock value # when it comes to expressing what art is or should be Personally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it # And the winner of the Turner Prize is#. #. lol“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is###. ”.Go on David,since you are consumed with what is appropriate why not have a go yourself  You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is##.David Spence.

LoLThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.Based on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say # there is a strong likeness to themselves # and they are very pleased with the outcome.Alternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.I could always get away with this by saying # It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art # and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lolWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself andyou look at my products you would find this to be true. My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generatesympathetic responses.It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear..."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.It is rare enough for a local game to end -, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.Astonishingly, Delting’s - triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.The final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.Delting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.Devonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.This is the th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back  years for Southend’s solitary success.Apologies to older readersI’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in , but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.The quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw - with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay - away from home.The semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another - draw and another replay was necessary.After Delting won that one - at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.Delting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.Although it was tough ask to play two games in about  hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.So on Saturday th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.Goals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a - lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.Player manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.It was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.But it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.: : : : : : : :In professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.The benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the  clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.During the - campaign the clubs benefited from over £. billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £ million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £ million.Just where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.While players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.On the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Cha, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.In Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.Following Rangers’ - draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.It could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.That was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.Perhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes findsdficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.Rogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.There are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.: : : : : : : :One of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.Although the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and  runs.Much has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.Unfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.I’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.Maybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.The only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped dfuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.Some apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.In answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame. Kohli would do well to take note. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 25 ","story":"Those responsible finally saw sense this week, reversing the ridiculous decision to play both Scottish League Cup semi-finals at Hampden Park on the same day.Celtic, one of the four sides involved, had indicated that a draw should be made to determine which game was moved to Murrayfieldthe original plans were scrapped.But the holders’ game against Hearts will now take place in Edinburgh at .pm on Sunday th October. The Rangers v Aberdeen tie will be played at Hampden at .pm the same day.Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers described the process as “irrational and discriminatory”, saying he had never been to Murrayfield in his le.This is the same man who could not offer any comment when quizzed at the weekendit was unfair to ask Aberdeen fans to travel to Glasgow for a noon kick-off.The handling of this by the authorities has been a shambles, and it was a bit rich to hear Scottish Professional Football Leaguechief executive Neil Doncaster say that the U-turn was because the situation had changed.Initially Hampden Park Ltd had insisted on sticking to its contract to host all semi-finals involving Celtic and Rangers, Doncaster said. The SPFL was unwilling to breach that contract and risk legal action and apparently Police Scotland were okay with the original decision. Incredibly it was said to be “the best and most practical solution”.But after the inevitable outcry, Hampden Park Ltd changed its mind and decided to waive the legal obligation.No-one should really be surprised at such a monumental cock-up, however, as you’d be hard pushed to find two organisations with as little credibility as the SPFL and Police Scotland.The idea of staging both games at Hampden on the Sunday, with Rangers taking on Aberdeen at noon and Celtic meeting Hearts at .pm, was beyond belief.Dons supporters were rightly up in arms, having been forced ious times in the past to travel to Glasgow for lunchtime kick-offs. Unless Scotrail, another organisation not known for covering itself in glory, agreed to put on extra trains the first was due to arrive in the city  minutes after the match had begun.Aberdeen manager Derek McInnes pointed out that the scheduling would have little or no effect on his team’s preparations which would just go ahead in the usual fashion. That may be so but for the fans it would have been a complete nightmare.Hearts boss Craig Levein was more outspoken, which is becoming a regular feature of a man who was once seen as boring. He described the SPFL’s decision as absolute madness.The Edinburgh club’s owner Ann Budge also voiced concern, given the dficulties that could arise from having over , supporters from four dferent clubs in Glasgow on the same day.She was quite correct. The probability that it would deter younger Hearts followers from travelling, as it could be a very late trip back to the capital, was a very real one.Budge was one of those who asked the SFPL to think again, saying the body should be encouraging fans to attend and not making it dficult for them.If the first game had gone to extra time and penalties it could have been well after pm before the stadium was emptied. That would not have given much time to clear up the inevitable mess, get rid of , people and get another , in.If any evidence was needed about what is wrong with Scottish football, here it is. The Scottish football authorities had placed all its eggs in one basket with Hampden and had no option but to try and justy the daft move. It really did beggar belief.: : : : : : : :Fortunes have been mixed for Shetland’s rugby teams so far in their mainland competition endeavours.The men’s side began by losing all three games and finishing bottom of group one in the oddly named North Region Referee’s Cup, although they were only well beaten in one of the ties.Then, on the back of a promising home league win against Aberdeenshire, they unfortunately came up short on Saturday after a long trip to the Western Isles, going down - to Stornoway.The revamped Tennents Caledonia North  ision looks very competitive, with the likelihood of most teams being able to beat anyone on their day.Shetland, as we all know, will be a match for most at home. But it remains dficult to do the same when travelling, with so many players not able to commit due to one reason or another.The depth of the squad is very important, which is why it is heartening to see more youngsters coming into the equation. They, after all, are the future of the club.The women’s team, on the other hand, have enjoyed a great start to the season, beating both Banff and Inverness Craig Dunain and currently leading the Tennents North League table.Last year’s league winners Orkney have already lost a game against Inverness, and a fascinating battle could ensue at Clickimin on Sunday when the island rivals go head to head.: : : : : : : :As someone who has supported Manchester United for over half a century, it pains me to see the state of the club under manager Jose Mourinho.This week’s home peformance against Valencia was abysmal, with several players totally devoid of pace and urgency and obviously not doing the business for the man in charge.The stunned silence among the fans was something that has rarely,ever, been seen before. Many of them began leaving Old Trafford with  minutes still remaining, and you really can’t blame them.The once-great club has been on the way down ever since the retiral of Alex Ferguson. The treatment of his replacement David Moyes was shocking, being sacked after only eight months in charge, and the appointment of the next incumbent Louis Van Gaal was a mistake.The worst move of all though was to hand the job to Mourinho. Winning the Europa League and the League Cup in his first season obviously gave  hope to some but he really was an awful choice.This walking advert for narcissism needs to go now before things become even worse. But the question is who will be next in line. Zinedine Zidane has been tipped because of his supposed “humility”, in contrast to Mourinho, although that was hardly evident with the infamous dismissal for head-butting Marco Materazzi in the  World Cup final.Others who have been tipped include Didier Deschamps, who led France to World Cup success a few months ago, or former United player Laurent Blanc who was recently in charge at Paris Saint-Germain.While it will most likely be another foreign manager who succeeds Mourinho, I reckon the club could attempt to reverse the trend by appointing an Englishman.Why not give someone like Eddie Howe of Bournemouth the job  He is one of the brightest young bosses in the country and has performed wonders at a club where the ambitions are basically to stay in the Premier League. But sadly I can’t see it happening.: : : : : : : :Contrary to my views on Mourinho, it was very disappointing to see the likeable Steve Bruce handed his marching orders by Aston Villa this week.Bruce led the club to the final of the Championship play-offs last season, but was sacked on Wednesday after a - home draw with Preston North End the previous evening.Villa are now th in the table but had they beaten Preston they would have risen to fth equal, only five points behind the leaders. A couple more matches and things could have been on the up again.Bruce had a cabbage thrown at him by a so-called fan before the game on Tuesday and later said the incident unfortunately summed up society at the moment.“There’s no respect for anyone any more,” he told interviewers, a statement which was borne out by the actions of the Aston Villa board of directors the following day. raquo.."},{"url":null,"title":"whalsays new research arrives in lerwick for first time ","story":"The Research leaves Symbister with bunting flying as she heads for Lerwick on Saturday.

He deserves all the support possible.Tomorrow’s match, despite being outside the Six Nations, should still be hotly contested. In the absence of Hogg and Barclay, English-based Sean Maitland and David Denton, and half-backs Finn Russell and Greg Laidlaw who now ply their trade in France, it gives an opportunity for some youngsters to make their mark.Those include Blair Kinghorn and Adam Hastings who have been named in the starting line-up, while Darcy Graham, George Horne and Matt Fagerson may get their chance later in the game.He won’t be making an appearance on this occasion as he plays for Welsh side Scarlets, but I am particularly interested in seeing Kiwi import Blade Thomson in the next three tests. Hopefully he can make an eye-catching debut to match his name.: : : : : : : :Family, friends, work colleagues and a good number of former footballers gathered on Friday to say farewell to Alastair Johnston from Cunningsburgh.When I first met him in the early s he was still an excellent player. He had represented Cunningsburgh, Ness United and ious Shetland select sides, once making a trip to Faroe with a county squad.Alastair was probably a wing-half in his early days, but after the change from -- to modern formations he usually formed part of the central defence.He played alongside the late Ian Manson for Ness, while for Cunningsburgh his long-term partner was Douglas Halcrow. They were part of a team which enjoyed many successes in Southern League football, and also which won the Parish Cup in  and .Cunningsburgh had a number of outstanding players in that era, not least twins Billy and Malcolm Adamson and the late George Adamson, but Alastair was definitely one of the most consistent.Very similar to his -year career at The Shetland Times, he was as dedicated as it was possible to be, someone you could always count on whatever the issue.As former goalkeeper Peter Farmer said after the funeral last Friday, “I played behind Alistair for  years and he was so reliable, the way he read the game.”Football runs in the family. His younger brother Gordon also played for Cunningsburgh and Ness while another brother Jim represented Shetland in  and . Nephews Raymond and James Aitken and Tony and James Johnston did likewise, with the latter becoming the county’s equal most-capped player.When the Times started a works league team in the s Alistair was persuaded to come out of retirement and take part in the very first match, a friendly against Bressay. That was where his we hailed from and I recall him saying that “I better no score a goal or Margaret will nivver spaek ta me again”.He also came with the works team on a trip to Orkney. He was a bit unsure about that and actually got injured in one of the matches, but as far as I recall he had as good a time as anybody where the after-match entertainment was concerned.Alastair and Margaret had three daughters, Wendy and twins Susan and Alison. They were all musically gted while Susan and Alison excelled at hockey.One of his grand-daughters, Sophie Moar, is a top athlete. At the island games in Jersey three years ago she won a bronze medal in the long jump and was a member of the gold medal-winning # metres relay squad. Alastair and Margaret were there to see it and I would imagine that was one of his proudest ever moments. After his retiral in  our paths crossed a few times but unfortunately not all that often. He was always friendly and good company.The last time I saw Alastair was earlier this year when I visited him and Margaret at Bremmer in Cunningsburgh. It was a very dficult experience as by then the dementia had taken its toll, and he was a shadow of the vibrant figure he had been. He still knew me though, which made it worthwhile.Alistair was a tremendous guy. I know Margaret, their daughters and grandchildren, and the other family will miss him greatly, and I would like to give my condolence to them all.: : : : : : : :News came this week that Crystal Palace footballer James McArthur had retired from Scotland duty as he believed it was the only way he could “continue to play at the top level”.There was a time when representing your country was considered the “top level” but sadly that is not a view shared by an increasing number of people in the game.McArthur, who won the last of his  caps a year ago, says he has found it increasingly dficult to manage a number of physical issues. He is only .The Crystal Palace midfielder will continue to turn out for his club in what could be -odd games a season. However, he has deemed the half a dozen or so he could be required for his international side to be just too much.McArthur follows in the wake of a number of Scottish players who have taken this decision, the highest profile being Celtic captain Scott Brown. Others, such as Alan Hutton, are still performing regularly for their clubs.There were also the recent instances where both Leigh Grfiths, Robert Snodgrass and Kieran Tierney asked to be released from the international squad because of perceived “fatigue”.No doubt McArthur, like the others mentioned, has his reasons for arriving at this decision. But I cannot help thinking that players from a dferent era would never have done so.Some, notably Denis Law and current Scottish boss Alex McLeish, have said they have never retired from their country. They would still be availablerequired. Attitudes have definitely changed, and not for the better.: : : : : : : :The Australian Cricketers’ Associationthis week called for the bans to be lted on the three players who were involved in ball-tampering in South Africa earlier this year.The association has laid part of the blame for the incident at the door of Cricket Australia, who it has labelled “arrogant and controlling”.Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were all “contrite men who have suffered enough”, a review carried out by the ACA stated.Smith, who was captain at the time, and vice-captain Warner are seven months into their one-year bans, while Bancroft, who carried out the cheating, will be eligible tonext month.While the three may have endured both a degree of humiliation – Smith’s tearful confession was felt by some to be meaningful – and financial penalties, lting the ban now would send all the wrong signals.Cheating in sport, however apologetic the protagonists may appear in the aftermath, is an anathema which needs punishing.

A lot of visitor experiences are going to be marred.\"Adam Gough, CairnGorm Mountain representative, who had told of the need for the slopes aimed at beginners and intermediates, was clearly stunned by the rejection.Asked immediately after the decisionan appeal was likely, he said that a statement would be issued later.CNPA head planner Gavin Miles had stressed from the outset the application had to be determined on planning issues ndash landscaping impacts in particular ndash and not on its commercial merits, which had generated much argument.He said the business case was a matter for Natural Retreats.Mr Miles told the committee the articial slope would not extend the ski area in any signicant way but the footprint of obvious development would increase.He commented: \"Initially the team were very concerned about the landscaping but as more information was given to us by the applicants it was considered that in the long term planting would mitigate against that. There would be an impact in the short term of the dry ski slope.\"Whether it will ever be an attraction in its own right and generate signicant income, who knows, but that is not a consideration of the planning process.\"In effect it is a ersication of business in this area and therefore acceptable andit was to strengthen the stability of CairnGorm Mountain then thats a good thing.\"He said there were some hefty planning conditions attached to control the development.CairnGorm Mountains representative said some  per cent of total visits to the resort were in just three winter months of the year.Mr Gough had told the committee Natural Retreats had explored several options in depth to remove the reliance on winter income including mountain biking and zip-wiring but this plan was the most viable at this time.He said it was imperative the attraction can provide year-round employment in order to retain its best staff. This site was the most sheltered for the ski slope and close to other facilities without impacting on other slopes, he said. It could also be used for tubing and other activities.Mr Gough acknowledged the clamour for better ski uplt at CairnGorm which has been overtaken as Scotlands most popular ski resort.He said: \"We would like nothing more than to be able to upgrade ski infrastructure to improve the snowsports experience for everyone but this has to be a long term process built on solid commercial foundations.\"He said the slope could be in operation for  per cent of the year outwith winter and ice would not be a problem as it was easy practice to break it up.ABA secretary Alan Brattey said history showed articial slopes at Scottish resorts including the Lecht, Glenshee and Glencoe had not worked.He also said a bright green Snowflex slope would stand out like a sore thumb and no consideration had been given by the operator to an alternative by market leader, Neveplast, which could be camouflaged.He said that of just over  votes on Facebook on the application,  per cent were against it.Tessa Jones, of the Badenoch and Strathspey Conservation Group, asked the committee: \"What are you going to say to the world about this peatland destruction \"Committee member Dave Fallows moved the application be refused and he was seconded by Carolyn Caddick.He said he appreciated the efforts to mitigate against the ski slope but said: \"It cant possibly soften in the long term the impact that this makes on the area.\"Mrs Caddick said: \"We are going to see it for miles and miles around.\"Peter Argyle had moved in favour of the application saying he had faith in the planning officers conditions but was not supported.Mr Brattey said after the vote: \"This was very much the right decision and wed like to congratulate the planning committee for deciding to reject this planning application against the advice of their planning officials.\"We very much hope that common sense will now prevail and that the plans for the Ptarmigan Building will be dropped.\"We are left to wonder just exactly why HIE allowed their tenant to take such a madcap plan all the way to the CNPAs planning committee who were very decisive in their rejection of it.\"He said HIE should ert the pound million to new uplt. \"The hill business requires to be funicular proofed as soon as possible,\" said Mr Brattey.Friday  Nov  : PM"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04118000/04118063.jpg","title":"Green light for Dalwhinnie quarry work","story":"Gavin MusgroveA quarry operator has said that measures are in place to allay concerns that their excavation plans could lead to a surge in speeding lorries in a Badenoch village.Leithshas been given the green light by the Cairngorms National Park Authorityrsquos planning committee to recommence operations at the site at Carn Dhomhnuill Bhain on the doorstep of Dalwhinnie.The company has said that it is not contingent on winning a contract to supply aggregate to the dualling of the A but that the produce will be used for housebuilding and other local construction projects.The firm was granted temporary permission for  yearsatthe CNPArsquoslatest planning committee meeting at Boat of Garten Community Hall.Production will be stepped up dramatically at the quarry around one mile north of Dalwhinnie by the A.It was previously in operation up to .But now Leiths has permission to extend the site from two to  hectares.

Importantly that means that visitors will be travelling through the Sleat peninsula, where communities have worked long and hard to build up a viable industry.“In the midst of the important debates about ferries and not least the importance of the MV Coruisk to the Armadale-Mallaig crossing, it’s important to celebrate the huge contribution that RET has made to the island economies.”If CalMac#s league tables of ferry route usage tell us anything, it is that moving the MV #Coruisk# from its purpose-built harbours on the busiest crossing in the north-west remains inexplicable.If the two tables of passengers and coaches highlight anything , it is that CalMac badly needs its two new ferries from the Clyde to be delivered according to their revised schedule and not experience a third delay.It is a mild surprise, as Kate Forbes MSP says, to discover that more people sail between Mallaig and Armadale in Skye than between Stornoway and Ullapool and that more coaches cross the Sound of Sleat than make any other journey on CalMac#s itinerary.It is good news not only for Sleat but for the whole of the island. It is good news which is tempered by the fact that this busy, bustling route is now served only by whatever ships CalMac can spare, when the tide permits them, while its purpose-built vessel, the MV #Coruisk#, which can dock at Armadale in all tidal conditions, is ploughing between Mull and Oban  nautical miles away.If CalMac had the ships, Mallaig Armadale would be dependable and therefore even busier, Mull would have a vessel of its own and almost everybody would be happy.CalMac do not have the ships in large part because two new deep-sea vessels which were commissioned in  from Ferguson Marine Engineering at Port Glasgow show no sign of turning up for duty.One of them is due to operate on CalMac#s busiest passenger route between Ardrossan and Arran. The other is to work between Uig, Tarbert and Lochmaddy, which last year carried almost , people.The delivery date for those two ships has been put back twice. On each occasion, the £ million contract to Ferguson Marine — which is the property of one of the Scottish Government#s friends, advisors and allies, the billionaire tax exile Jim McColl — was topped up by a multi-million-pound handout from the public purse.If all was on schedule at least one of those ships would now be in service, and CalMac would have substantially more leeway in manoeuvring its fleet from one part of the west coast to another. They might even be able to keep the #Coruisk# on the Sound of Sleat.They are very far from on schedule. The new Ardrossan Arran ferry is now supposed to be delivered next summer, and the new Uig Tarbert Lochmaddy ship in spring .Will they be delivered  Or will we experience a third delay, which would certainly plunge CalMac into even greater chaos as its ageing fleet breaks down or requires routine maintenance somewhere in the Baltic Those are important questions. As we reported last week, the chief executive of Outer Hebrides Tourism, Rob MacKinnon, has criticised the Scottish Government for a lack of any #tangible action# to address the islands# ferry problems.The Scottish transport ministry, said Mr MacKinnon, must #pursue all feasible options to increase ferry capacity in both the long and the short term for the benefit of both visitors and islanders#.As we report this week, Labour#s Western Isles# candidate Alison MacCorquodale has added her voice to the many demanding to know the precise terms of the private finance initiative deal which has bound the Scottish Government into using just one ferry for all passengers and freight between Ullapool and Stornoway, with unacceptable consequences.Ullapool Stornoway may not yet carry as many tourists as Mallaig Armadale. But it is the definition of a leline service, with , passengers last year, many of whom found themselves unable to squeeze onto an overbooked #Loch Seaforth#.We should be told how and why one of our biggest and most important ferries came to be owned by Lloyds Bank.We should be toldJim McColl is going to deliver two badly-needed ships at the third time of asking.It is not enough to say, as does transport minister Michael Matheson, that building CalMac#s ferries is #providing vital support to our shipbuilding industry#The way things are going, building and rebuilding CalMac#s ferries will keep Scottish shipbuilding alive well into the next decade. Their higher purpose, and Mr Matheson#s job is to provide vital support to the Hebridean ferry service.

Published by LilliputPress, Dublin. Price hardback €. Like Fenianism itself, this book hadmodest beginnings but grew to cover all of Ireland, a good part ofthe globe and half a century. Eva Ó Cathaoir began a study ofFenians in Tipperary which has evolved into one of the mostcomprehensive and important scholarly works on the Irish RepublicanBrotherhood yet published. If the film ‘Black ’ is a storyof revenge set during the Great Hunger, the phenomenon of Fenianismarose to a great extent as a political response to that colossalcrime against the Irish people by the landlord system and the Britishregime. But there was far more involved than simple vengeance.Fenianism was a democratic movement, consciously in the tradition ofthe United Irish leaders of the s, and rejecting privilege andclass distinction. In  the IRB staged the funeral of TerenceBellew McManus and brought many thousands of people onto the streets.The working-class character of the movement was clear from thisdemonstration and the author quotes the following from the haughtysnobs of the ‘KilkennyModerator’, lamenting the absence of the‘great and the good’ from the procession:“When we look back to the O’Connellgatherings or even the Young Ireland ‘Confederation’ assemblies,and remember the array of names, of borough magistrates, professionalmen and traders, accustomed to put forward as representing Kilkennyon such occasions, we cannot but view in the most ludicrous light,this miserable farce of an ‘imposing demonstration.’” The recent visit of the Pope reviveddebate among Irish republicans about the role of the Roman CatholicChurch in Irish politics. This book shows again that, with very fewexceptions, the hierarchy abhorred the IRB for its democratic andrepublican principles and the ‘princes of the Church’ fearedFenian inculcation of their ‘flocks’ with a sense ofindependence, no longer reliant on clerical and aristocratic leadersto guide them. Such guidance had led to catastrophe during the GreatHunger as the passivity preached by Daniel O’Connell and thebishops facilitated the peaceful passage of food out of a starvingcountry.Students of Irish history will befamiliar with the story of the Fenian leadership on both sides of theAtlantic, abortive rebellion and invasion, the internecine disputesand personality clashes. This book recounts all that but it goes muchdeeper. For example it tells of the Fenian women, whose storiessurely need to be rediscovered. They were treated as subordinates bymost of their male comrades but many played important roles. It was atime of deep chauvinism with even otherwise progressive Fenians suchas John Boyle O’Reilly opposing votes for women. The book covers all aspects ofFenianism and a great part of its value is in its first Appendix‘Biographies of Munster and Kilkenny Fenians’ which providesbrief profiles of , rank and file Fenians. I have never beforeseen any ‘Roll of Honour’ of the IRB but this is now providedwith a list of ‘Fenian Casualties -’ while the book closes,appropriately, with a list of Fenian monuments in Ireland andManchester. This is a beautully produced book anda credit to the publishers Lilliput Press and of course to theauthor.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27481  ","story":"• Mícheál Mac Donncha and Robert Ballagh Mícheál Mac Donnchaby Robert Ballagh published by Head of Zeus. back in the late s. For anartist of his stature this was courageous, dependent as he was, tosome extent, on commissions from people who, to say the least, wouldnot be subscribers to our paper. But this was an artist who went hisown way in art and who acted as a citizen with a conscience in anIreland where State-imposed censorship distorted not only politicaldebate but also national self-image. For Robert Ballaghcreative work and active citizenship have gone hand in hand all hisle. This is depicted in his double self-portrait ‘Upstairs No.’,one of the many illustrations of his work in this superbly writtenand beautully presented book. It is not a standard autobiographywith chapters set out in chronological order beginning with genealogyand ending with this week’s news. As you would expect from Ballagh,he takes a dferent approach, starting towards the later years andcircling through his days in no particular order before coming backto the present. More than that, he weaves narrative, anecdote andreflection together seamlessly and conversationally showing a skillwith words akin to his skill with brushes. He has a story to tell ofa very ied le, from his unusual family background to his time asa showband guitar player, through his unorthodox beginning as apainter and his development as an artist and an activist. Withfrankness and clarity he tells us how he learned and matured as anartist and his brief commentaries on many of his works areilluminating both of how they were made and the concepts behind them.It makes the reader want to look again and more intensely at thepictures. The Prologue isessentially a dedication to Robert’s late we Betty, his lelonginspiration, mentor and most important critic. The first chaptertells the harrowing story of how Betty, in her serious illness, wasdisgracefully let down by a healthcare system which basically allowedher to die through neglect, as was admitted in legal proceedings. Butthis does not cast a shadow over the book, as her positive presenceis felt throughout, and is celebrated by the author. These days I rarely getthat urge immediately to re-read a book when I reach the end, but Idid with this one. Thankfully the chapters are so well defined thatthey can be read as stand-alone essays or stories. Take just twoexamples: ‘Who Fears to Speak ofEaster Week’ recounts the tremendous people’s commemoration ofthe  Centenary in which Robert played a central part, aculmination of his activism which has included campaigning againstapartheid, for the Birmingham Six, for artists’ rights, with theIrish National Congress opening border roads, in solidarity withPalestine and as an enthusiastic participant in Féile an Pobail inWest Belfast from its commencement.‘Dining at McDonald’s’is a brilliant critique of the dominant and stultying modernistideology and practise in art and an appeal for an opening up. Ballaghattacks “the notion that the artists’ choice imbues a givenobject with special properties which are tantamount to a metaphysicaltransformation of the object that it ceases to be a pedestrianartefactand becomes,by virtue of the artist’s choice, art”. This ideology leads tothe absurdity of much of the ‘installation’ stuff in galleriesthat baffles all but elitist insiders and, as Ballagh recounts, theclaim by loyalist killer Michael Stone that his attack on Stormontwas a piece of performance art. He argues that the bureaucracies mustset aside this ideology and make galleries more open and democratic .For these views and forhis artistic method and, among some I suspect, for his politics,Ballagh has been frowned upon by certain elites. One prominent figurein the Irish art world said of him with dripping condescension thathe is “not a real artist, he is a mere illustrator”. Typically,Ballagh responded with humour and defiance in a self-portrait wearinga t-shirt saying ‘Fuck the Begrudgers’. I cannot recommend thisbook highly enough. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27482  ","story":"Pearse Doherty: The Interview  Ruairí Doyle“Society is organised in the wrong way - we should not have a housing crisis - what is happening with our children in emergency accommodation is immoral. It is a scandal that we will look back at in twenty years with shame.” - Pearse Doherty TDSinn Féin TD and Finance spokesperson Pearse Doherty has spoken of his origins, his le and how they influence and inform both his political ideology in an extended online interview. He also outlined his vison for a New Ireland that provides achance for people to live, to work and to raise their families without thechronic levels of deprivation and inequality facing so many today. Speaking ahead of Sinn Féin’s Alternative Budget launch nextweek Deputy Doherty laid out his party’s vision “for a new economy for a NewIreland”.The Donegal TD was born in Glasgow and lived with hisparents and five siblings in a one-bedroom flat in Ibrox before the familyed home to Gweedore in Donegal in the ’s. This informed his belief that no matter when someone leftIreland, evenit were  or  years ago, they still have a great sense ofbelonging, of that tangible bond with home “that’s home - you know - Níl aontinteán mar do thinteán féin - that’s their home”, commented Teachta Doherty.Pearse, who has been a TD since , talked about his drivehome when the Dáil wraps up at the week’s end, crossing the border twice on hisway up the winding road to Donegal to his we and four boys. He also gave aninsight into the dficulty of the balance between work and home le, and theunique challenges of being a public representative. The Gaoth Dobhair resident added that it is not solely challengesthat come with being a Teachta Dala. He said: “It is what shapes you and your values. It’s yourexperience - it’s your past experience - it’s your family experience and it’swhat shapes you in Irish society, the people that are around you. The peoplewho influence you and that help shape you and that’s the values that I bring tomy job today as Finance spokesperson for the lead opposition party. It’s thevalues I will bring to the job as Minister for Finance,I am in thatposition.”Sinn Féin regularly faces accusations of employing “fairy-taleeconomics” or “economic illiteracy”.Pearse dismisses these comments as cheap throw-away remarks,designed to stunt political debate. This is a debate that Pearse opines that the establishmentparties do not want because “any fair minded person would see clearly thatthere is a need to build houses, to bring our children out of emergencyaccommodation instead of cutting taxes for the wealthiest in society.”He continued: “Where despite the fact that the three main banks aremaking €. billion in profits every year, they don’t pay any Corporation Taxand some of them won’t pay for the next twenty years.  That’s the debate they don’t want to have.”As Pearse puts it, the Budget is not just about numbers -it’s about our values and ensuring we create a new economy with strong publicservices and shared prosperity where no one is left behind and no child goeswithout.Deputy Doherty said: “Society is organised in the wrong way. We shouldnot have a housing crisis. What is happening with our children in emergencyaccommodation is immoral and it is a scandal that we will look back at intwenty years with shame.  “What is happening in our hospitals is outrageous, in a country thathas the wealth that it does.  “It is just not shared properly and it is not allocated properly andthat isn’t the fault of citizens. That is fault of politicians that decided onBudget day that the resources created by the Irish people are going to beallocated in this way.”Touching on the spectre of Brexit, as a TD for a borderconstituency, Pearse argues that the North of Ireland remaining in the EU andgiven a Special Designated status is the only way to protect people on bothsides, particularly Donegal which is isolated from the rest of the  Counties.Pearse also remarks that “the debate about Irish Unity needs to go toanother level”. He continued: “We are moving, in my view, to a position where we willhave a border poll. Where a majority of people will vote for Irish unity.  “And that will come about because of demographic changes. It will comeabout because Sinn Féin is agitating for it, and other people are recognisingthat it is in their interests that we have an end to the Irish border.”Sinn Féin is not interested in maintaining the status quoand not content to merely “tinker along the edges - where you might get anincrease in public services, an extra few gardaí, an extra few public sectorworkers, a little tax cut here” Pearse Doherty said. This Budget, and every Sinn Féin Budget, would be about our vision fora new Ireland and that vision of an equal and fair society. We would also focuson the political choices that have always been available to create that society one is prepared to make them. Teachta Doherty states in the conclusion of his interview: “Our job isto provide opportunities so that people can live and work at home. We need togive people the opportunity to raise their families at home, so that they canget through le and reach their opportunities and reach their potential athomethat’s what they wish.” test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27483  ","story":" Mary Lou McDonaldPresident of Sinn FéinWe are facing into a politically challenging time.

They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.- Mary Lou McDonaldDUP Leader Arlene Foster has called for fundamental changeto the Good Friday Agreement to facilitate Brexit. In other words an agreement endorsed by the majority of people north and south must make way for Brexit, a proposition rejected by a majority in the north. The latest position of the DUP leader lays bare the root of thecrisis in the north. Remember, the DUP opposed the Good Friday Agreement, campaigned for a No vote in that historic referendum and they continue to oppose the Agreement. An Agreement that has underpinned peace for over two decades.They oppose the all Ireland nature of the Agreement, they oppose the rights and safeguards of the agreement and they oppose power-sharing.   to be in them.” The institutions in the north could no-longer bear the weight of this contradiction and collapsed. This was brought to ahead by the continual refusal to implement agreements, opposition to marriage equality, rights to an inquest, an Irish language Act and the financial scandal that is the RHI Cash for Ash scheme.Add to the mix a British Government that has no understanding of Ireland, our economy or our agreements. The Tories are at war with themselves over Brexit and seem intent to bring their own country down with them. This same Tory Government entered into a toxic deal with the DUP to stay in power. That is why there are no institutions in the north, and why the DUP leadership walked away from the deal they had made with Sinn Féin in February this year to get the Assembly up and running.These latest comments by Arlene Foster are a desperate throw of the dice by an increasingly marginalised Unionist leadership. The deal with the Tories will end. Its only legacy will be Brexit. Meanwhile Ireland north and south is changing and a New Ireland is emerging. The joyous revolution of Marriage Equality and Repeal of the Eighth has resonated with a new generation in the north. The largest political demonstration in Belfast is Pride. A magnicent event that celebrates the ersity of identities that make up our communities.Similarly there is a growing demand for access to abortion services. As a placard proudly announced in Dublin Castle when the Repeal result came through, “The North is Next”.Brexit has also unied those who voted to remain within the EU. Brexit will be a disaster for the economy in the north, particularly for agriculture. A community that values prosperity and access to the EU is looking beyond Brexit and Westminster and instead towards Irish Unity. We are facing into a politically challenging time. However it is one which we can and must navigate. The position of the Irish Government and the EU is critical. They must ensure that the British Government cannot renege on their agreement to protect the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, in the Brexit process.As for Arlene Foster and the DUP - the game is up. If their leadership want the institutions in the north up and working then they must support real power sharing, respect, equality and the rights of others. When this happens Sinn Féin will be a willing partner. Now is the time for political courage, to look forward in the interests of all communities. Meanwhile the debate on Irish unity and a unity referendum grows. I am confident that we can build a New United Ireland, a home for all that share this island. That is the big challenge for our generation. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27484  ","story":"• RUC unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons Mícheál Mac DonnchaCivil Rights campaigners in Derry had been pressing for a march in their city which had long been a byword for unionist sectarianism and discrimination.Using gerrymandered electoral boundaries and a corrupt voting system which allowed wealthier citizens to have multiple votes in local elections, the unionists maintained a majority of members on the council in a city with a nationalist majority.Nationalists lived in very poor housing conditions and were affected disproportionately by the % unemployment rate in the city.Unionists had long regarded the old walled town as a citadel that could never be surrendered and their dominance was symbolised by the walls towering over the crumbling th century terraced streets of the nationalist Bogside. The last time nationalists had attempted to hold a parade inside the walls was on St Patrick’s Day  – when they were batoned by the RUC.Housing was a massive issue in Derry and the Derry Housing Action Committeeprovided the focus for leadership as the Civil Rights campaign took off. The DHAC had organised a James Connolly commemoration in the city in July  which was banned by the unionist government.The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Associationagreed to hold a march in Derry on  October. The loyalist Apprentice Boys organisation immediately announced a counter-demonstration with the purpose of forcing the unionist government’s hand to ban the Civil Rights march. But the regime at Stormont did not require forcing because the Home Affairs Minister was ultra-unionist William Craig, who promptly imposed the ban.NICRA held an emergency meeting with the DHAC. Many on the NICRA Executive and some Derry nationalist figures, including John Hume, wanted to cancel the march, but the majority of Derry activists were determined to defy the ban. They won out and the march was to proceed as planned.It was a relatively small march, beginning on Craigavon Bridge with several hundred people. The objective was the Diamond in the city centre.The march was stopped in Duke Street by the RUC. A meeting was held with speakers including Gerry Fitt, Betty Sinclair, Eddie McAteer, Ivan Cooper, Austin Currie and Eamonn McCann. Three Westminster Labour MPs were also present.After the meeting, the marchers found themselves hemmed in on all sides by the RUC. They could not disperse and after a tense stand-off the RUC, oblivious to the presence of TV cameras and photographers, unleashed an unprovoked attack on the crowd with batons, boots and fists. Water cannons were then used.Bernadette Devlin McAliskey, then a young People’s Democracy activist, recalled:“Quite deliberately, they hosed in the upstairs windows and shopfronts, and they went right across Craigavon Bridge, hosing all the onlookers. The police just went mad.”The RUC attack in Duke Street brought the Civil Rights struggle in Ireland to a world audience for the first time. It was a complete eye-opener to many people in the  Counties and in Britain. But most profound was its effect on young nationalists.Derry man Mickey Devine , the last of the ten Hunger Strikers to die in the H-Blocks of Long Kesh in , recalled:“Like every young person in Derry, my whole way of thinking was tossed upside down by the events of  October . I didn’t even know there was a Civil Rights march I saw it on television.“But that night I was down the town smashing shop windows and stoning the RUC. I developed an intense hatred of the RUC. As a child I had always known not to talk to them or to have anything to do with them, but this was dferent.The RUC attacked the Civil Rights march in Duke Street, Derry, on  October .test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27485  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering and pain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contested narratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.- Declan KearneyThis week the NIO consultation on dealing with the legacy of thepast in the north of Ireland closed.It will inform a legislative process and bringforward future legacy legislation.Failure to deal with the past remains one of the most signicantimpediments to political progress here.It is a barrier to the development of a comprehensivereconciliation and healing process in this society.British state policy has been the primary factor in preventinglegacy issues from being addressed or resolved.Powerful sections of the British military and intelligence systemhave never embraced the peace process. They remain psychologically andpolitically locked into a conflict mind-set even twenty years after the GoodFriday Agreement was signed.The role of British State forces and their agents, a refusal toacknowledge and be accountable for their actions, combined with a disregard forsuccessive binding court rulings, has defined the British state’s approach tolegacy matters.That has been reinforced in recent times by a cynical and narrative, including interventions by the British Prime Minister Theresa May,and British Secretary of State in the north, Karen Bradley, to suggest thatonly state forces were being made subject to legacy investigations.These statements are offensive and wrong, and are an egregiousdemonstration of the partisan nature of British policy towards dealing with thepast.They are consistent with the British practice of denying wrongdoing, concealing the truth, and preventing accountability.This poses a major challenge to ensuring that a robust,independent, and impartial facilitation of the legislative process will emergefrom this consultation on addressing the legacy of the past.All sides suffered, and caused suffering to each other during theconflict.There are multiple narratives regarding our tragic past. There isno single narrative despite the attempts of the British state and politicalunionism to assert otherwise.The past cannot be changed, nor can our shared hurt, suffering andpain be undone. While there may never be agreement on the ious contestednarratives of the past, these must all be respected and acknowledged.The Stormont House Agreement, , , set out an agreedframework of legacy mechanisms which provided an unprecedented opportunity tocomprehensively deal with the past in all its aspects.Subsequent draft legislation reneged on the British government’sobligations under the SHA by introducing a national security veto, which hadthe effect of blocking a way forward on the issue of legacy.Full implementation of the SHA on a human rights compliant basispresents the best opportunity to deal with the legacy of our past and guaranteea framework which is victim centred.Facilitation of any future legislative process will require thatthe British government must ensure all victims are treated with equality,respect and dignity that the legislation reflects the policy intent of theAgreement and, that the legacy architecture is fully independent, human rightscompliant, and properly resourced and funded.The following key principles should be central to the operation offuture legacy legislation and mechanisms.-          Allprocesses should be victim centred-          Allprocesses must secure the co-operation of all relevant parties to ensuresuccess-          Allprocesses should be based upon equality, respect, and dignity-          Allprocesses must be free from political interference and be absolutelyindependent-         Acknowledgement should be central to the operation of the legacy framework-          The aim ofthat framework should be to enable reconciliation and healing within widersocietyIf there is to be a collective and comprehensive engagement withthe past in a human rights compliant manner, there can be no hierarchy ofvictimhood or humanity.There must be no change to the definition of a victim.High-quality services should be provided to all victims at thepoint of need.This should extend to the immediate provision of a pension for allseriously and psychologically injured during the conflict.The British Government should also immediately release therequired funding to resource the Lord Chief Justice’s inquest plan, as aseparate distinct process from any new legacy mechanisms.The Office of the Police Ombudsman should be adequately andimmediately resourced.Any attempt by the British state to introduce a statute oflimitations to protect its forces and agents would be a violation of the SHA and must be opposed.Full participation and unfettered disclosure by British stateforces and its agents with the legacy mechanisms will be essential to achievefull public confidence in their ability to deliver on behalf of all society.Periodic reviews should be carried out to inform the extent offunding requirements and necessary timeframe, for all legacy mechanisms.Legacy processes should not be limited or impeded by closedmaterial proceedings. In addition, for future legacy mechanisms toasintended, it is essential families are given full access to legal aid.The legacy legislation which ultimately emerges from theconsultation must comply with the policy intent of the SHA by:-          Promotingreconciliation-          Upholdingthe rule of law-         Acknowledging and addressing the suffering of all victims and survivors-         Facilitating the pursuit of justice and information recovery-          Beinghuman rights compliant-          Beingbalanced, proportionate, transparent, accountable, fair, and equalThe full implementation of that Agreement representsthe best potential and opportunity to address the legacy of our politicalconflict and the suffering experienced by everyone during the conflict inIreland, Britain and beyond. So, it is now time to finally deal with the past.  It is time tobuild for the future.

permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office”Ive been wondering lately whether anyone in Democratic Unionist Partyleadership circles actually try to reflect upon what republicans, nationalists, and other progressive minded citizens think about the current political situation.Do they even care what others think The evidence suggests not.Several days ago the DUP leader pronounced that her party could and would change the Good Friday Agreementat a whim. There was no hint of irony in her claim – the DUP has spent the last  years opposing the GFA, ever since it was signed.In another extraordinary, but not untypical, outburst she declared her blood red line position on Brexit and, that in the same week as the consultation on dealing with the past was concluding!Of course the DUP leader, and other key figures have form in making offensive and provocative political interventions.Her dehumanising description of republicans as \"crocodiles\" in  comes to mind.Notably, she previously called republican and nationalist Ministers in a ing Executive ‘rogues and renegades.Only the DUP knows whether this leader is naturally predisposed to being rhetorically gaffe prone, or is being deliberately offensive.Perhaps some figures in the DUP do think about wider opinion: the DUP is not a monolith after all.But, those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power sharing.  They oppose equality and rights, and reject reconciliation.Instead they have chosen to join forces with the extremists in the British Tory party to help steer the Brexit train wreck.The DUP leadership is living in a delusional bubble.Meanwhile, the party brand has become indistinguishable from the financial scandals of recent years such as Red Sky, NAMA, Brexit dark money, and financial relationships with Sri Lanka.The ongoing RHI inquiry exposé of how the DUP behaved in government makes a complete mockery of its purported adherence to good governance’.The party MPs have become power drunk through their pact with the Tories, and a serious misconception that they are king makers in Westminster.  Edward Carsons cautionary words have clearly been forgotten or disregarded.  He warnedWhat a fool I was.  I was only a puppet, and so was Ulster… in the political game that was to get the Conservative party into power.’ The DUP has a tactical approach towards everything including maintaining the status quo on its own terms, slowing down and frustrating progressive societal change, and maintaining sectarian dominance within the unionist constituency.The DUP leadership is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic norms, social modernity, political integrity, and standards in public office.  Its inability and refusal to embrace dference or celebrate ersity is reflected in an institutionalised bigotry against, and intolerance towards the Irish national identity and cultural traditions, and LGBT rights.The partys contempt and sharp practice in government has destroyed wider public confidence in the political institutions, and led to the decisive tipping point of RHI and withdrawal of the Líofa grant scheme in the winter of .As a result of its ingrained arrogance and lack of political humility the DUP leadership is constantly in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarianism, homophobia, and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists, and many others, including sections of civic unionism, do not believe the DUP is serious about restoring genuine power sharing. These citizens want the institutions to be restored, but not at the risk of allowing the DUP to continue practicing discrimination, disrespect, intimidation, bigotry, and sharp practice. They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power on that basis.  And, neither will Sinn Féin.The DUPs behaviour, and the onslaught of Brexit have together brought back graphically into focus the denial of rights which resulted in the Civil Rights Movement fty years ago.A generational realignment has occurred within northern nationalism.Acht Gaeilge, marriage equality, womens reproductive health rights, legacy justice rights, and the demand for a Bill of Rights are the modern day acid test equivalents of one person, one vote.  The current crisis in the north of Ireland is the visceral culmination of  years of DUP push back against the GFA.Intoxicated with its imaginary power at Westminster, the DUP leadership has finally over played its hand. The political institutions could have been re-established by the th February last, but the DUP leaders walked out of negotiations.Instead of selling the deal which they negotiated in February with Sinn Féin, the DUP leader, deputy leader, party chief executive, and its senior talks team bottled out.Since then the party has been convulsed with the resultant internal fall out.  There has been no meaningful contact with Sinn Féin, and absolutely no willingness demonstrated to resume negotiations.Any advocacy of blood red lines is a total anathema to democracy.The wider nationalist constituency is fed up to the back teeth with the subversion of the political process by the DUP, the British Tory government and others in political unionism.It is more impatient than ever for equality, rights and parity of esteem.  The history of  is being replayed. Thousands marching from Duke Street in Derry city on Saturday th October to mark the iconic civil rights march  years before is the latest example of that.  An exciting momentum for change is taking place across Ireland, north and south.  Old orthodoxies are being eclipsed by discussions about new, modern, all-Ireland constitutional and political arrangements. The permanent unionist electoral majority is gone and demographic changes are irreversible.All of this puts the onus back upon both governments to act decisively to address the denial of rights.The Irish government needs to take the lead because for now the DUP has this British government over a barrel.  But thats a short-term situation.  A British general election in the immediate to mid term cannot be ruled out.A new political discourse has begun about the future. All sections of society need to be involved in this and the unionist is critical in all of this.Brexit, the GFA, citizens rights, and an Irish unity referendum are central to that. Progressives should explore common ground and alliances for change.Republicans and unionists need to start to face the same way.  We have to begin looking at each other through eyes of the future.The benchmarks of a rights-based society guaranteeing civil and religious liberties and equality for all, are set.  These are not negotiable.So, whoever is actually in charge of the DUP for the time being has a lot of serious thinking to do...Who now leads the DUP  Do they have the authority to negotiate and stick to an agreement Are they committed to a shared future with republicans, nationalists, and others in the north Unless, and until the DUP can clearly answer these questions for the rest of society, it will remain exactly where it is now – out of power, and facing the inevitable fate about which Carson warned: getting dumped by the British Tories.test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27487  ","story":" Mícheál Mac DonnchaThe Liberal Party was in government in Britain and had introduced the Home Rule Bill with the support of the Irish nationalist MPs in Westminster.

In , he opposed a resolution at the Presbyterian General Assembly condemning Gladstone’s second Home Rule Bill. He was also a strong critic of landlordism.In , he again opposed a resolution against Home Rule at the Presbyterian General Assembly.Calling for freedom of conscience for Protestants to support or oppose Home Rule, Armour slammed the intolerance of Carsonism when he told the assembly:“If you deny the right of private judgment and of free speech, how much do you have of Protestantism worth keeping  Nothing at all.”Armour organised a public meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney to support Home Rule and oppose Carsonism. Banners in the hall proclaimed “No provisional or provincial government for us” and “Ulster for Ireland and Ireland for us”.The resolution stated that the meeting of Protestants of Ballymoney and the protests in The Route“against the claim of Sir Edward Carson and the self-constituted Provisional Government of Ulster to represent the Protestant community of north-east Ulster” and “disputes the narrow claim that dferences of creed necessarily separate Irishmen and women into hostile camps”. Among the speakers at the Ballymoney meeting were JB Armour himself, historian Alice Stopford Green, Jack White, son of a British Army general and later a leading figure in the Irish Citizen Army, and Roger Casement, who was executed in . This was Casement’s first appearance on a political . With his Antrim family background, Casement regarded the occasion as hugely signicant and in his speech he denounced any notion of partitioning Ireland. The meeting was a once-off and failed to turn the tide of Carsonism but it did show that a signicant minority of Protestants in the North-East were still prepared to stand up for Irish unity and self-government. The meeting of Protestants in Ballymoney in support of Irish self-government was held on  October ,  years ago this week. test"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27490  ","story":" Declan KearneySinn Féin National ChairpersonThe labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.- Declan KearneyLast weekend the Irish Congress of Trades Unionsand Irish Labour History Society organised a conference to commemorate William Walker in Belfast.Walker was an anti-Home Rule unionist who was a leader in the Belfast Independent Labour Partyin the early twentieth century.When James Connolly, Irelands most signicant historical, socialist republican leader called on the ILPs membership to support socialist unity in Ireland, his appeal provoked a rebuke from Walker.This led to a robust debate between both figures in the pages of Forward between May and July .Their debate came to be known as the Connolly Walker controversy and later became an historical reference point for the anti-imperialist struggle in Ireland.I participated in a  alongside veteran trade unionist Joe Bowers, Ulster Unionist councillor Chris Mc Gimpsey, and ICTU Assistant General Secretary, Owen Reidy, to discuss the post Walker years and the current situation in the north.Not surprisingly we delivered four very dferent perspectives on Walker and his legacy as well as, Brexit the north strategy and politics on the Left and, future prospects.A very challenging but fraternal debate ensued between the lists and the audience.I opened my comments by saying that any consideration today of William Walker’s legacy needs to be within the historic and contemporary reality that the advancement of socialist and Labour politics has been held back due to the effects of British colonial policy in Ireland.He was a product of his native Belfast and directly influenced by the communal environment within which he grew up.He was a protestant in a largely protestant workforce. Sectarianism in the late s and early s stalked Belfast.While Walker was severely limited in his political analysis he was committed to improving the conditions of his fellow workers.He is an integral part of Belfast’s industrial history and his contribution to the city’s labour heritage deserves recognition.British policy in Ireland and its consequences for Irish society has ided Irish workers along communal lines. It has paralysed the labour movement from effectively challenging partition and championing the strategic aim of Irish unity.Partition is the central fault line at the heart of Irish society and politics.Sectarianism remains a visceral blight in this state.Following partition, it was used by the ruling unionist elite to cement the foundation of the state and prevent unity among citizens on issues of common concern.The fact is Labour was indeed told to wait as the resurgent struggle for national independence grew in momentum just over  years ago.The counter revolution which took place post partition represented a strategic setback for labour and working-class interests in the new free state.It eclipsed the seminal influence which socialist republicanism had on the  Proclamation and the Democratic Programme of the First Dáil.The rights of workers became subservient to the conservative elites, north and south.However, sections of the labour movement were compliant with British policy in Ireland and the imposition of partition.That was personied in the political thinking of Walker and others pre partition.This tendency opposed Connollys core position that \"the two currents of revolutionary thought in Ireland, the socialist and the national, were not antagonistic but complementary\".Walkers debate with Connolly reflected a key contradiction inherent in the Irish labour movement and its relationship with the Irish national liberation struggle, and anti-imperialism generally.That contradiction has existed ever since.Walkers brand of ‘Municipal Socialism’ was in reality a euphemism for self-imposed strategic and political limitations which went on to define the Trade Union movement in the north.As a result, the Irish labour movement, particularly in the north has failed to challenge partition and modern British political policy towards Ireland.Partition has been an abject failure. It was never designed to make the northern state a political or economic success.From the beginning this state has carried within it the conditions of inherent instability.It was built upon institutionalised and structural sectarianism which ensured that a substantial minority was destined never to be treated as equals.The Civil Rights Movement fty years ago exposed the inability of the unionist state to treat the minority as equals.That belligerent opposition from powerful sections within political unionism against reform of the northern state persists today in the form of political unionism, and specically DUP hostility towards implementation of the Good Friday Agreementsince .Refusal by the DUP to embrace a rights-based society and equality, culminated in the collapse of the GFA political institutions in January , and our associated political crisis which has continued since then. Those currently in charge of the DUP have turned away from power-sharing.The party brand is now indistinguishable from financial scandal and sharp practice in government.As a party, the DUP is permanently in conflict with all accepted democratic reforms, social modernity, and standards in public office.Its project is negative and tactical, and entirely focused upon slowing down and blocking progressive change, while maintaining a sectarian hegemony within the unionist constituency.The DUP is in denial about how society in Ireland views its sectarian, homophobic and toxic pact with the Tories.The overwhelming majority of republicans, nationalists and many others, including sections of civic unionism, have concluded that the DUP has had its chance and cannot now be trusted in government.They will not be giving the DUP permission to get back into power at the risk of allowing it to continue practicing discrimination, intimidation, bigotry, or sharp practice.The enduring political crisis is accentuated by systemic structural weaknesses in the regional economy.The required investment in local public services and protection of workers’ rights are confronted with a combination of Tory austerity and Brexit.Pressures on public services are intensying.The regional block grant, or public expenditure settlement, has been reduced by .%.Real term cuts to public funding are now factored into future budget profiles alongside ·         Actual net cuts in take home pay for public and private sector workers·         Welfare cuts and the universal social charge·         Higher inflation and living costs, adults in working families live in relative povertyAverage wages in the north remain lower than ten years ago.Precarious working conditions, zero hours’ contracts, and the scam of bogus self-employment used by some employers are in common practice.Workers’ rights and protections are being systematically reversed.The onset of Brexit will be a catastrophe for the regional and island economiesIt will deepen an existing race to the bottom by further undermining the potential for economic growth, and new investment.The Brexit agenda, twinned with Tory austerity threaten jobs across all economic sectors, workers’ terms and conditions, and, any potential for sustainable public services in the north.The dawning political and economic reality is that Brexit has changed everything.It has exposed the negative role that partition continues to play in Irish affairs, and the fundamentally anti-democratic nature of the union with Britain.  The British state has been pushed into an unprecedented, existential political crisis.Brexit is a train wreck being jointly steered by the DUP and extremists in the British Tory party.But it also has become a defining moment for these islands.A new generation is questioning partition.There has been a seismic sht in the ambitions and expectations of citizens in the north.A new political discourse has begun about the future of Ireland north and south, and our relationships with Britain and EuropeThe debate on Irish unity and the timing of a unity referendum have moved centre stage.The time has come for a fundamental paradigm sht in British government policy towards Ireland.The Irish government needs to begin preparing constitutional, political and economic transition towards Irish Unity.It should facilitate an open, inclusive national conversation involving all citizens, political parties, social partners, and civic society.That is a dialogue about our collective future on this island which addresses all the concerns, accommodations and compromises relevant to negotiating a new, all Ireland, constitutional, pluralist democracy.Today this new focus upon Irish unity provides Irish trade unionists and workers with an opportunity to influence the debate about future constitutional and political change.Previous moments of political change have required that labour should wait.The emerging challenge for the Irish labour movement north and south is to engage with this emerging discussion.To paraphrase Connolly in his opening contributions to the Connolly Walker debate\"Constitutional change then is almost a certainty of the future.”The labour movement will only successfully put its mark on the Irish unity debate by arguing for the primacy of economic democracy, and the case for a rights-based society in a new Ireland.I said to the Belfast conference this reality will require Irish trade unionists to take strategic positions on supporting an Irish unity referendum and then to campaign positively for constitutional change.On Monday of this week I reiterated that opinion when I met Patricia King, General Secretary of ICTU in Dublin.Of course, this will be a challenging discussion for the Irish labour movement, as comrades noted both during and after the plenary discussion. But it should not be feared or avoided.Today in modern Ireland there is a battle for hearts and minds about how society is organisedThe status quo has failed us all.Connolly’s vision of a united Ireland which serves the interests of the many instead of the few will not be wished into existence.Labour should not wait again.The Irish labour movement needs to assert itself on the Irish unity debate by introducing a progressive labour agenda to the unfolding discourse on future constitutional and political change.test"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1106582.jpg--.jpg?1540373104000\n","title":"allen s meats moves to larger premises in cullybackey","story":"AFTER  years serving the people of Ahoghill Allens Meats has moved to larger premises to meet the demands of the growing business.The butchers shop has relocated to Cullybackey to take over the former Lamont Butchers at  Main Street in the village.Allens Meats needed to acquire larger premises and decided to make the move to Cullybackey after David Lamont retired.Lamont Butchers has been based in Cullybackey since  and Derek Allen and his team will continue to provide the same excellent customer service and top quality produce.Derek said: “The business is growing and we needed more space to enable us to offer a wider range of products.“We would like to thank all our customers in Ahoghill for their support over the last  years.

McConnell said he was ‘really shocked’ when the Bishop of Connor, the Rt Rev Alan Abernethy, contacted him.“I am honoured that the Bishop thought of me.“It is recognition that I have been in ministry for more than  years, and is also a great encouragement for me.“This is doubly special because Lisburn Cathedral is the parish church in which I was born and raised for the first  years of my le.“That is quite something. Lisburn Cathedral is where the seeds of faith were sown and where I felt the first call to ordination.”After A Levels, Mark joined the Northern Ireland Civil Service where he worked for more than seven years, ending up in IDB House where his job was to encourage exports from Northern Ireland overseas.In his mid-s, Mark felt a strong calling to commit more to his faith.He said: “I didn’t see ordination as the way forward but wanted to know more about faith and Christian service.This led him to Oakhill College in north London.He continued: “The structure allowed people to find their direction within the studies.“This could have been anything from youth ministry to army chaplaincy or evangelism.”It was during his three years at Oakhill Mark decided ordination was for him. Halfway through the course, he began contacting bishops.“St Alban’s Diocese took me under their wing. They accepted me for ordination training in the Church of England.“God opened doors for me.”.After graduation from Oakhill, Mark had the opportunity to do a familiarisation year on his way to ordination, and he did this at St James’ Parish, Muswell Hill, north London, where he had the opportunity to do anything that needed doing!During that year he married Cherith, a native of Omagh and a primary school teacher.Mark was ordained in St Alban’s Diocese and served his first curacy in Christ Church, Bedford.He and Cherith felt called back to Northern Ireland, and Mark became accustomed to the ways of the Church of Ireland through a second curacy in Bangor Parish, Diocese of Down and Dromore. During this time he did a lot of work with the congregation of The Primacy, a small church on a large housing estate shared with the Methodist Church.Mark was later appointed rector of Killyleagh in Co Down, and after seven years moved to Connor Diocese as rector of Ballyclare.He remained in Ballyclare for more than  years before the move to Ballymena, where he currently ministers along with his we Cherith and their three children, Daniel, Matthew and Erin.A date for his installation to the Chapter of St Saviour has yet to be set, but Rev McConnell will continue to be rector of the Ballymena Parish while a Canon of Lisburn Cathedral.

A founding member of the Ballymurphy Massacre campaign and member of Relatives for Justice, Carmel will ask for American support for the campaign at public events and Congressional meetings. MPs have called for an end of former British troopers being “hounded and pursued” by murder investigations, while Theresa May praised the “heroism” of British crown forces who “upheld the law”. RFJ believes that while not specically referring to Ballymurphy, such claims may impact an inquest considering whether British forces upheld the rule of law in the case.AOH Freedom for All Ireland Chair Martin Galvin said: “The Ballymurphy Massacre is a fundamental test of Britain#s ability to give legacy justice. If victims cannot get justice where  people, including a Catholic priest and mother of eight children were killed by British troops, how can we expect justice in any killings or collusion murders where British forces were involved AOH National Vice-President Danny O#Connell and National Secretary Jere Cole recently promised the Ballymurphy families that America would stand behind them in their battle for justice.

The De La Salle student will travel to London on Friday and fly out to St Petersburg on Saturday. The preliminaries for the rd FIG Trampoline Gymnastics World Championships take place Wednesday, November  with the finals taking place two days later on Friday, November .Devine came out on top of a high-class field in the senior men’s DMT competition in Birmingham at the end of September to win his first British title and secure his place in the World Championships. His coach, Simon Flannery, was delighted with his performance in Birmingham and is hoping some adjustments to his routines will yield a further improvement in Russia next week. “Each competitor completes two routines and the top eight go through to the final,” stated Flannery.“The routines he did in the preliminaries for the British Championships are the routines he will now in the prelims in Russia. “Those routines would have placed him second in the prelims for last year. “We know he is in around the area he needs to be to make it to the final. “He was brilliant in Birmingham. He had a tough build-up to the Championships. The routines we wanted to do at the Championships weren’t quite there yet, so we had to make a decision not to compete with those. It paid off because he done a modied last routine and he done it really well and won.”He added: “Since then, we have upgraded those routines and he is looking phenomenal. He had a training camp last week with the GB team and he smashed all his classes. “In our sport, it comes down to tenths of points, so every step you take, or wobble, or bend of the arms can cost you. “Every tenth you lose is tripled because the three judges scores are counted.“The last training camp is about fine-tuning the little details to maximise your score.”As British champion, Devine will have high hopes of continuing his rapid rise in the sport by securing a medal. Flannery believes Devine has the ability to progress to next Friday’s finals and is hopeful of another fine showing from the West Belfast prospect. “He is hoping to get into the finals, which is the main thing,” said Flannery.“I think his routines will easily put him into the top five. “We’d love to come away with a medal.“He is excited and a little bit nervous, but he turns that into a real positive. He gets adrenaline from it.” Flannery, who recently relocated Andersonstown Trampoline Club to Mallusk to merge with Flight Gymnastics, also revealed that Devine will be targeting Olympic qualication in the New Year. The -year-old will have a well-earned break from competition after the World Championships in Russia before embarking on a two-year goal to qualy for Tokyo in . “We have got a break after Russia then, next year, the qualication starts for the Olympic Games ,” added the Flight Gymnastic coach. “It starts in February and he has to compete in a run of events over the next two years. Only the top  men and the top  women make the Olympics. “We are working very hard to get him into the top  so he can qualy for the Olympics.“If you take out the Russians and the Chinese, then a lot of dferent counties can make up that top . It comes down to whoever is the most consistent during the qualication events. “He has shown this year that he is very consistent in the top competitions so hopefully he can get a spot.#"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"historical treasure trove revealed at clifton house","story":"THE BELFAST Charitable Society has uncovered a suitcase of letters and material from World War One while preparing for its autumn series of lectures. letters tell the story of Irish Pfficer Patrick Dixon’s le at the front during the war through correspondence with his parents in upper middle class Dublin.Paula Reynolds, CEO of the Belfast Charitable Society, said: “Our colleague and volunteer, Jim McFerran, has been tirelessly working his way through the Dixon family papers ensuring they are all documented and sorted appropriately.“When our Archive and Heritage Officer unearthed the letters we were astonished at first of all the amount of the material, as well as the condition of it.” Aaron McIntyre, Archive and Heritage Officer at Clton House, said: “These letters and material are of great importance and we are very excited about their signicance. It is rare to see so much detail and well written legible letters which gives us a fantastic insight into the Dixon family and Patrick’s le at the front.“Within these letters we see Patrick discuss Irish political developments such as the  conscription crisis, the impact of the Spanish flu pandemic in Ireland and the torpedoing of the RMS Leinsteroff the Irish coast.He also describes his excitement at the signing of the Armistice, in a letter dated th November , and the long wait for demobilisation.Highlights from the collection include a soldiers’pantomime programme for January , emergency issue Francs, a German Disabled War Veteran Fund ticket picked up at the front, and never before published photographs of the front, taken by Patrick himself. Speaking about the origin of the material, Paula added: “We believe Patrick’s sister, Margaret, who became a GP in the Dunmurry area, married a Mr Wynne, who was involved with the Belfast Charitable Society and thus the material deposited in the Society#s attic for safekeeping. This is all very timely as Clton House is hosting an autumn series of historical lectures, including a symposium on th November  to mark the ending of the Great War. Philip Orr, the playwright and historian, and Dr Éamon Phoenix, the historian and broadcaster, will deal with the Irish contribution to the war and its impact on this island. This event will now include an exhibition of the Dixon War Letters, unveiled to the public for the first time. We’d also like to find the descendants of Patrick Dixon and we would like help in tracing members of the Dixon or Wynne families who may be able to shed light on this incredible collection of war letters.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Screen-Shot-2018-11-02-at-09.52.44.png","title":"last chance to cast your vote for our inspirational youth","story":"WITH just hours to go until voting comes to a close for the Inspirational Youth of the West awards, rest assured – there is still time to cast your vote.With over , online votes so far counted across  categories, our youth and their sterling work and endeavours will be honoured on Friday, November  at the Devenish Complex for the gala congratulatory evening hosted by Pamela Ballantine.

That’s the key message from the company, not just me,” Mr Cable said.Questioned on a Brexit deal being struck within weeks, he said there is “a lot of smoke and mirrors” and European diplomats were playing down expectations of any imminent deal.He said there is widening cross-political backing for a so-called People’s Vote on the final Brexit deal, which his party is campaigning for.A Diageo spokesman said: “We’ve made it clear that a frictionless border in Ireland is the best outcome for every business large and small.“Regardless of the outcome, rest assured we will ensure Guinness, the world’s favourite stout, is available to be enjoyed throughout the UK and Ireland for decades to come.”"},{"url":null,"title":"which scientists might feature on the new","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeRHI ScandalBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalBrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHomes  InteriorsSeptember CarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday Guide -Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Later it will discuss resumption in Arizona, Calornia and Toronto, its other test sites. Arizona suspended the company’s permission to test after the crash.Ms Herzberg’s death was the first involving a fully autonomous vehicle, raising questions about the safety of computer-controlled cars being built by Uber and dozens of other companies, including Google spin-off Waymo.Uber took the first step towards resuming tests in Pittsburgh in July when it put vehicles on the road with safety modications and additional driver training, but the cars were not free of human control, nor did they respond to ride-hailing calls.“We are engaging with the city, with the officials, and are very eager, I think, to ensure that we make ato the road in self-driving mode in consultation and close partnership with them,” said Miriam Chaum, head of public policy for Uber’s self-driving vehicles.The company also promised in its reports that it would reduce the time delay between when its autonomous vehicle sensors spot a person or object and action is taken by its computer system.Uber said it improved the performance of its system so it can better predict what a person, vehicle or other object will do as the autonomous vehicle approaches.“We are now able to detect objects and actors sooner and execute safe reactions faster,” the company said.Back-up drivers will now be interviewed about safety before they are hired, and will also be monitored by a camera in real time to ensure they are paying attention, Mr Zych said."},{"url":null,"title":"major street cleaning initiative carried derry housing estate","story":"A huge street cleaning initiative was carried out in a Derry estate earlier this week.Sinn Féin Councillor Eric McGinley welcomed the operation, which took place in Ballymagroarty area.Councillor McGinley said: “In response to requests from residents the Council, Housing Executive and Teamworks have been involved in an extensive street cleaning exercise through the Ballymagroarty estate.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refresh\"Given the physical layout of the estate it is inevitable that an accumulation of refuse and garbage will gather in the laneways and cul de sacs over a period of time and this does require a dedicate effort separate from the weekly street cleaning schedule.\"I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Council, Housing Executive and Teamworks for their quick response and I would reassure residents that we will continue do all we can to ensure that the Ballymagroarty estate is kept as clean as possible.”"},{"url":null,"title":"new figures reveal derry second cheapest place uk run three bedroom home","story":"A three bed in Derry will set you back £,. per month, according to the survey by MORE THgtN insurance.This is £ cheaper than the UK average.Derry is just behind the cheapest in the UK, which is Antrim at £, per month.The report, which takes into account everything from mortgage or rental costs right down to the price of garden maintenance, reveals that nearly half of all household income is spent running the home, and owning a three-bedroom home in the UK now has the annual running cost of £,., that’s £,. per month.For renters, residing in the average home comes in just £,. cheaper at £,. per year, or £,. per month.Compared to , this is a £, increase in running costs for homeowners, which equates to an extra £ per month.

This is particularly worrying as I remain unconvinced that the current site can accommodate an extra  or  students, without this having a detrimental effect on their wellbeing and the quality of teaching.ldquoI also have signicant concerns about the impact the single site option would have on traffic in the Saul Road area, given the congestion issues and poor infrastructure already in the town.He said he was ldquoworried about the impact that moving teachers and pupils, which he argued would be inevitable in the transitional phase, would have on timetabling.Cllr Brown said he was ldquoslightly more enthusiastic about a two-school option, though he claimed there was ldquostill a lack of clarity from CCMS about how this would work in practice.He added: ldquoI hope the CCMS can produce more detail on this during the post-consultation stage. Officials have informed us that they hope to implement this amalgamation as early as September .ldquoIf that is the case, much work needs to be done to assuage the concerns of parents, secure long term capital funding mdash and potentially a new site mdash and ensure the inevitable challenges occurring during the transitional period do not become permanent fixtures of any new school.Mr Lyttle said that while Alliance was strongly opposed to academic selection and believed in the need for integration and rationalisation of schools across the province, ldquothese changes must always be made while putting the wellbeing and educational outcomes of children first.He added: ldquoThere does appear to be practical concerns with this proposal, particularly regarding implementation which will need to be addressedany amalgamation is to be delivered in a way that will benefit all pupils.ldquoIt is vital that the concerns of parents and other stakeholders are considered and the change management process is handled in a way which delivers for everyone in the community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Annsborough school forms community forum group  ","story":"A NEW community engagement forum has been launched at Annsborough Integrated Primary School.This exciting new development will involve parents, governors, staff and past pupils working with officers from the Northern Ireland Council for Integrated Education, supported by investment from the Integrated Education Fund.Speaking at the launch last Thursday, Lynda Brown, school principal, said she was pleased at the investment and support being offered by NICIE and the IEF.ldquoThere is a great buzz in the school tonight and itrsquos lovely to see so many parents, governors and families attending from within our local community, she remarked.Ms Brown welcomed Tina Merron, Chief Executive Officer of the IEF, Roisin Marshall, CEO of NICIE, and Denise Morgan, Senior Development Officer with NICIE.She said the school community looked forward to working with them to build on the Integrated education being offered at Annsborough IPS.ldquoWe are keen to work with our local community to ensure that integrated provision is available for all who desire it in future, she added.Ms Marshall said she was ldquodelighted to be at the school to discuss the future growth of integrated education in the area.She remarked: ldquoItrsquos always really nice to get the chance to meet people who are committed to working together for their local communities to ensure that children and adults can have opportunities to work together under one roof mdash Protestant,Catholic, other faiths and none.

Little was seen of Ards attack in the first half, but with  minutes gone Nathan McShane had to be alert to head an in-swinging corner from Brian Cabraley off the line.McGrady, Branagan and Telford continued to give the Ards defence plenty to think about and with  minutes gone Downpatrick made it -. Branagan worked his way into a good position on the right and fired over a tempting cross that flew into the top left hand corner of the net, giving the visiting goalkeeper no chance.Downpatrick went in at the break, worthy of their three-goal advantage, but they were unable to kick on from there in the second half.Ards were the more aggressive after the break and Downpatrick were put under a certain amount of pressure, but Anthony Doherty, Conor Moore, Nathan McShane and Caolan Logue all defended superbly and provided resolute cover to captain Kieran Gordon in goal.Gordon was only beaten once and that was in the th minute when McCleary tucked away a cross from Dunlop in a clever move.Ards continued to push and probe, but a hard-working Downpatrick side refused to give way and thoroughly deserved their first three points of the season.Downpatrick FC: K Gordon, C Logue, N McShane, C Moore, A Doherty, J Branagan, C McGrady, Adrian McCoubrey, M McGarritty, Andrew McCoubrey, P Telford.

It was a conflict in which his uncle, Charlie Dunbar had been persuaded to volunteer for ldquoto fight for his religion.But the experience of what Charlie saw left a deep scar and changed him forever.Adrian was the focus of the ldquoWho Do You Think You Are  on RTE on Sunday evening, and it was a fascinating watch.As we all get a little older, many of us seem to have an increasing interest in our own past, especially our own family history. In Ireland, family is still a powerfully symbolic and emotive part of our DNA, and the programme often reveals some interesting context for inidual celebrities.As Adrian said: ldquoAll of us are interested in our backgrounds where we come from and what yoursquore born into. Those things shape who you are.Therersquos no doubt that we will have been particularly interested in Dunbarrsquos journey into his background after all hersquos one of our own.But the interest in the programme went much deeper and much more meaningful. With several little vignettes showing the complexity of identity in Ireland.A word used frequently these days in all sorts of context is binary, meaning only two parts or ision into two groups. Itrsquos particularly apt to the world view of Northern Ireland. Protestant equals Unionist British, Catholic equals Nationalist Irish, would be the perception.It isnrsquot the case, of course, and shouldnrsquot be. But the troubled th century in Ireland, particularly the last quarter of it, saw both groups driven further into a silo mentality.Irsquove always felt that there was a certain irony in the fact that a violent Republican campaign to achieve Irish unity did, actually, create more ision.Now, the current circumstance of changing demographics in the north combined with the Brexit crisis are focusing on identity as we go forward.Adrian Dunbar is a clever inidual and, indeed, a perceptive one and the story of his family background in the programme was punctuated with comments which should evoke some thought about the past, present and future.Adrian was brought up in Enniskillen in a mainly Nationalist area, though for a few years the family moved to Portadown, Garvaghey Road in fact, where he recalls loyalist paramilitaries parading close by in a show of strength to people in Nationalist areas to know their place. The memory of two communities living apart is eloquently described by Adrian as ldquosocial engineering to suit sectarianism. While Enniskillen was much less hostile, the time, the place and the neighbourhood environment where he and his siblings grew up were far from ideal recruiting ground for the British military.And yet, on his mother Pauline Camplingrsquos side, there is an incredibly strong link and a history of service going back three generations.Adrian visited St. Michaelrsquos Church where Frankie Roofe was able to give him intriguing detail of his great-great-grandfather coming to Enniskillen as a soldier from England and converting from Church of England to Catholicism.Recounting some of the history of the Inniskilling Fusiliers, when the regiment ldquoheld the line for Wellington at Waterloo about half of the  men were killed, Adrian himself pointed out that about a third of the men spoke only in Irish. Itrsquos a quirk of how history develops that hundreds of years later the native tongue of men who died serving the British Army is somehow portrayed controversially as anti-British.Adrianrsquos grandfather, Walter Campling served in the Inniskillings, and three of his sonshad distinguished service in the British military in world war.The programme shows Adrian coming home to Enniskillen to discuss this with his brother Liam.Interestingly, though, Liam said that because they were brought up in Nationalist areas they didnrsquot go round talking about their ancestorsrsquo British military service. And Adrian himself said that the idea that he and his siblings would have followed the tradition of their three previous generations had gone.Such service to the British military by Catholic Nationalist families was common, as a look at the names of both communities on the Enniskillen War Memorial show.Yet, it was a feature not talked about in recent history and illustrates the complexities of identity that weave their way through our communities.Conversely, of course, the perception suggests that all Protestants consider themselves ldquoas British as Finchley and thatrsquos just as much an oversimplication. Surely the two identities donrsquot slot handily into their own homogeneous monolith There were a couple of telling moments, I thought, in the Dunbar programme.His uncle Charlie, whom Adrian remembers fondly dishing out sixpences, had been convinced in the late s to join the Irish brigade fighting for the fascist Franco in the Spanish Civil War under the guise of fighting to preserve the Catholic religion against the evils of Communism.On hearing some of the shocking atrocities that his uncle witnessed, Adrian reflected: ldquoPeople do a lot of things in the name of religion, donrsquot they  Sadly, as we know only too well in the north.And he added: ldquoThe combination of religion and politics is not a good one.And there was another line which struck me. Adrian was shown a photo of Queen Victoriarsquos state visit to Dublin in  when the city was still under British rule.He was shown the regimental band, including his grandfather, and considering the protest and fight for independence in Ireland which was about to change everything, Adrian referred to his grandfather and other comrades as being ldquoon the wrong side of history.A century on from that Royal visit, the country saw a war of independence, a civil war, decades of conflict in this part of the island and more recently more Royal visits by the current Queen both north and south of the Border.And now itrsquos a pertinent question to ask what side of history the ious identities are on now.The confusion and uncertainty over future membership of the European Union has thrown the subject of identity to the forefront, and there is the suggestionthat the issue of Irish unity is firmly on the agenda.To be honest, I donrsquot think evena Border poll was held that it would result in unity just now.But herersquos a thing. On Sky News last week, journalist Adam Boulton was interviewing Scottish Deputy First Minister, John Swiney and his opening question was: ldquoWhat do you think is more likely to happen first, a united Ireland or an independent Scotland The fact that he asked it seriously is telling, as is Swineyrsquos serious reply which began, ldquoItrsquos a close run thinghellip.In the current political climate, the DUP say they are engaged in a ldquobattle for the Union. Aside from the fact that all politics here seems to boil down to that, in this case the DUP may well be right.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

I have been moved to tears by so many honest and heart-wrenching accounts.I canrsquot even begin to imagine the pain of losing a child at any stage of le it is inconceivable for those who have never suffered such a loss. But sadly, itrsquos more common that we imagine.It is estimated that one in four pregnancies in the UK ends in miscarriage, defined as a loss of pregnancy up to a gestation of  weeks and  days. A loss after that is considered stillbirth and in  there were , stillbirths ndash thatrsquos nine babies stillborn every day ndash and , neonatal deaths.As part of baby loss awareness week, bereaved parents, along with their families and friends have been coming together, joining with others across the world, to commemorate their babiesrsquo lives.The campaign was started  years ago and yet the fact remains that in our society, it is really only in the last couple of years that we have started to talk openly about baby loss.Indeed it remains a subject that few of us feel completely comfortable navigating. I will admit that before I became a mother three years ago, I had conversations with women who lost their baby during pregnancy and I know I didnrsquot handle those conversations very well.Maybe there isnrsquot a right thing to say, but I recognise now that that I, like so many of us do, shied away from much,any, conversation. Despite knowing that the phrase ldquoIrsquom so sorry was lacking, I refrained from empathising any further or asking questions because I felt I didnrsquot have the right words, I was afraid of saying too much, of saying the wrong thing, of being insensitive, and most of all I was afraid of upsetting that mother.But what I have learned since is that many women ndash and men ndash who have said goodbye to a child in pregnancy or during birth, want to talk about the loss. They donrsquot want you to cross the street to avoid them. Many want you to askthat baby had a name, or when his or her birthday would have been. Of course, itrsquos hard to know any of this unless we have the opportunity to have open and transparent conversations about such a sensitive and dficult issue.Talking about the subject of death is still quite taboo in our society, particularly when it is the death of a baby. But we shouldnrsquot underestimate the importance of talking about baby loss. Not only does it help those who are grieving, helping them to process what has happened, to stop blaming themselves and feel less alone in what can be an emotional and physical rollercoaster, it also gives us all the opportunity to develop the tools and language to discuss this emotive subject with greater understanding, helping to normalise something that is common - and indeed normal - but not talked about enough.Itrsquos ironic and perhaps a cruel reality of social norms that women are encouraged not to tell people about pregnancy until after the first trimester when sickness abates and the risk of miscarriage is greatly reduced. Surely the early stage is when pregnant women need compassion and understanding. The expectation to remain silent during the first  weeks of pregnancy means many couples faced with loss are left to grieve without the support that they need. After all, it doesnrsquot matter whether the loss of a baby is at eight weeks gestation or  weeks, the trauma felt by those who loved and wanted each child are the same. They had imagined their new family they had probably considered whether that baby was a boy or a girl and all sorts of other exciting plans.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

This campaign is aided and supported by a number of the Prime Ministerrsquos own Conservative Party members.Sadly, what we are witnessing from many sections is an anti-British position rather than a debate based on any sound principles as to why there are not more pragmatic positions on providing a good deal for everyone involved.As someone who voted to remain within the EU I am extremely disturbed at the antagonistic stance being displayed by the European Union towards the democratic wish of the majority of the citizens of the United KingdomThis has brought me to thinking thatthis is their attitude in general to the UK, then we are better out of this vastly over regulated group. What is even more surprising is the attitude of the Irish Government. They are our near neighbours and have signicant trade with the UK, but are certainly making no attempt to have a conciliatory attitude to finding a positive deal.Given the potential economic loss to the Republic of Ireland, Irsquom curious as to why they are not attempting to use their influence, by their public utterances and in discussions with other EU members, to provide a more assuaging attitude to the situation. This I feel would be more conducive to sustaining beneficial trading relations between the two nations post Brexit.Thankfully the United Kingdom has a strong economy which has supported and assisted many smaller nations, including the Republic of Ireland in the EU for many years.It is hugely positive that Northern Ireland is part of the UK, the fth largest economy in the world. Moreover the UK is a signicant influencer throughout the world and a society that is a leader in freedom of democracy.This website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Projected as three-screens, the film was cleverly edited to juxtapose the ying yellow line constructions, from the scouts lining up their yellow kayaks to the farmers forming their line of yellow bales.With the use of dramatic aerial shots, the formation of the yellow lines could be seen clearly as they cut through the landscape, representing both the Border and itrsquos people. The film received great response from the audience participants as they witnessed the powerful result of their involvement.With lsquoAcross and In-Between,rsquo Suzanne Lacy highlights the wit and cleverness of Border le in the face of political pressures, focusing on the power of play in creatively responding to complex issues.Suzanne commented: ldquoOur project draws those who live along the often-invisible boundaries between countries into a conversationmdashmetaphoric and literal ndash on personal and symbolic meanings of this border and by extension all such borders drawn by political forces.ldquoThe artwork explores inverse paradigms: visible and invisible, official and unofficial, rural and urban, the real border and imagined ones.

In  he was jailed in the Republic for RIRA membership.   Martina Anderson, Sinn Feins MEP is lobbying against the extradition of Liam Campbell to Lithuania His brother Michael was jailed in Lithuania in  for trying to buy a large haul of weapons for the RIRA. Liam has been facing extradition by Irish courts to Lithuania to face charges of involvement in the same plot and has up until now been backed by Republican Sinn Fein.But now Sinn Féin MEP Martina Anderson has written to Taoiseach Leo Varadkar calling on him “to protect the human rights” of Mr Campbell. Ms Anderson said: “I met with the family of Liam Campbell who is currently facing extradition to Lithuania about their concerns over the implications for his human rights. “The Supreme Court already ruled against the extradition of Liam Campbell to Lithuania as it found that prison conditions there could breach his right to freedom from torture, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It is utter hypocrisy for Sinn Fein to demand the pursuit of British soldiers through the courts, whilst at the same time intervening to demand that terror suspects be given a free pass“There is a concern that,extradited, he could face a y period in detention before his case comes to trial in conditions that have been criticised by the UN’s Committee on Torture.” “I have now written to An Taoiseach Leo Varadkar expressing my concern about Liam Campbell’s case and asking him to meet me as a matter of urgency to discuss it.”She has also written to the EU’s Commissioner for Human Rights, she said.But DUP East Belfast MP Gavin Robinson noted he had been found liable for the Omagh bombing.    Real IRA member Liam Campbell pictured at the High Court in  where he was appearing in connection with the Omagh bomb. Photo: Niall Carson PA Wire “He is wanted as a result of allegations that he was trying to buy large amounts of arms and explosives on behalf of the Real IRA in Lithuania,” he said. “It comes as no surprise that same party who continue to glory IRA terrorists is calling for Mr Campbell’s freedom. Whilst Campbell clings to human rights laws today, victims today will ask what about the human rights of the maimed and murdered in Omagh in .”UUP Justice spokesman Doug Beattie said it is “perhaps hardly surprising that a convicted bomber such as Martina Anderson should come to the aid of someone found liable for the Omagh bombing in a civil trial”. He added: “It is utter hypocrisy for Sinn Fein to demand the pursuit of British soldiers through the courts, whilst at the same time intervening to demand that terror suspects be given a free pass.”Stormont talks: All-party meeting ‘an utter waste of time’Walk for Disappeared due today at Stormont Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Asked to explain why it was intervening in the case now, Sinn Fein pointed to Ms Anderson’s statement.Former IRA prisoner turned historian and journalist, Anthony McIntyre, said Sinn Fein has lobbied for dissident republicans before.“It is a no cost approach and has the potential to take the sharp edge out of some dissident criticism of them,” he added.try catch     .               ..

Secretary of State Karen Bradley But the parties emerged after just  minutes to deliver scathing criticism of Karen Bradley’s handling of the process.Ulster Unionist leader Robin Swann said the meeting had been a box-ticking exercise, and labelled it “badly briefed and badly advised”.He said Ms Bradley must now either take “ownership of the process”, or introduce direct rule for Northern Ireland from Westminster.SDLP leader Colum Eastwood described the meeting as a “complete and utter waste of time”.“It is quite clear that the British Government are totally unprepared to take the necessary next steps to get powersharing restored.“Today is an embarrassing day for the Secretary of State. Quite simply, it is not her job to wait for a ‘consensus’, her job, alongside the Tanaiste, is to kickstart the talks process.”Alliance leader Naomi Long said the restoration of devolution was now further away than it had been when talks collapsed in February.Branding the briefing “counter-productive”, she added: “I think relationships between parties, and indeed the secretary of state, are possibly now at an all-time low.”The Sinn Fein delegation gave a short statement to the media after the meeting, before leaving without taking questions.Sinn Fein MLA John O’Dowd accused the government of “treating large sections of this society with utter and complete contempt”.The DUP has not yet given a reaction to the meeting.Fred Reynor: Second World War veteran to be laid to rest Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BELF | Article Teaser\"Speaking ahead of the meeting, Mrs Bradley said she intended to brief the parties on the Northern IrelandBill, which is intended to allow time and space for political parties to agree ato powersharing government.She added: “I want to get those parties in a room together and really go through with them how this act will deliver for them.“But they have to do the right thing, come back into government, and I want to see them do that as soon as possible.”Devolved government at Stormont has been mothballed since January  following a breakdown in relations between the DUP and Sinn Fein.Numerous attempts at talks to agree to theof the Executive have ended in failure.try catch     .               ..

Knowing this, John gave up his teaching course and took a full time job at the boatyardhellipand the rest is history.Mr Freemantle moved from Penarth and started his own boat building workshop in South Clive Street in  with British Road Services ndash now National Freight Consortium.In , the business was expanded and relocated to a greenfield site within Cardf Marina, which is now the exact location of Bayscape.The boat yard at the time stored around - boats. Long before the Cardf Bay Barrage was built, the water was tidal and boats moored in the middle of the river.As there was no road to the marina, Mr Freemantlebuilt a track to enable him to get to and from the boat yard. In  he put pontoons for the boats and laid the first cement for the slipway which was all created by Mr Freemantles own hands.In  the Freemantlesset their sights on retiring and sold the boat yard - which had grown to storing more than  boats - to a family friend of their business partner who used to visit the boat yard as a child. And so Bayscape began.One day the couple were walking along the waterrsquos edge and looked across to see the unique development taking shape in the exact spot of Mr Freemantles beloved boat yard, where  years previously they brought in the original electrics, telephone line and water. The couple decided to move back to where they had spent many happy years.Mrs Freemantlesaid: ldquoWe love living here, it feels really safe and therersquos a great sense of community. I look forward to coming home.To find out more about Bayscape, visit www.bayscape , call    or email info@bayscape. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

As well as being a memorable occasion for the Accelerators, we believe it is important to help MPs understand the vital role that our company and the wider pub and bar industry play in offering, not just jobs, but worthwhile progressive careers, with arguably the best opportunity out of any industry to go from the bottom rung right to the very top. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is available for hire as a wedding venue, as well as for other events.The Vale of Glamorgan Council own the site, with Penarth Town Council handling its operation.The Vale council is currently undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets in the Vale, which includes the Kymin. The town council has stated that staff are waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its grounds.But Mrs Gardner, Mrs Herniman and Mrs Huxtable say they heard rumours it could be sold and say they want to ensure it is kept for the community use.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoIt is a fantastic venue with lots to offer.ldquoThe Kymin has childrenrsquos parties here, bowling outside, craft fairs and everything you can think of here. There are many rooms and there are wonderful grounds here as well.ldquoWe have had my sonrsquos wedding here and barbecues here. As members of PODS we have our annual barbecue here every year.But the women say they believe the number of people and groups who use The Kymin has dropped over the years.Mrs Herniman said: ldquoI think its underused, I donrsquot know why that is particularly.ldquoWhen I have come down here, I would just see one group in the building. It is a big building and itrsquos a shame to just see one room being used instead of it being lively and filled with a iety of groups.ldquoIt would be a crying shame for it to be taken away from the public because it is underused.Mrs Gardner, , added: ldquoWe want to be proactive about this rather than just sit back and not know whatrsquos going on.Neither the Vale of Glamorgan Council or Penarth Town Council confirmed or denied that the building and grounds could be sold.But Penarth Town Council did say they had enquired about the transfer of the site as a community asset.A spokesman for Penarth Town Council added: ldquoThe Kymin is a Vale of Glamorgan Council asset which has been operated for a number of years by Penarth Town Council.ldquoThe Vale of Glamorgan Council are undertaking a ldquostrategic review of assets which will take several months to complete. Penarth Town Council is waiting to be formally advised of what the Valersquos intentions are for the building and its groundsldquoThe Vale council advised Penarth Town Council that it would not enter into a transfer of the Kymin as a community asset. The town council had requested to do so in order to improve the facilities for the people of Penarth and future generations.Cllr John Thomas, the leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, said: ldquoThe council recognises The Kymin is a strategically signicant asset for the Vale of Glamorgan as a whole, due to its prominent location in Penarth. Work is currently under way to consider how the Penarth Esplanade area can be further enhanced to deliver attractive uses for the townrsquos residents and visitors.ldquoWe recognise that there will be many people with an interest in the future of the site and we will continue to engage with the town council, as current tenants, and others as work continues in exploring options. ldquoThis will need the council to be creative with our ideas for how the arearsquos assets are managed at a time of diminishing budgets, as we continue our work to further enhance this important location.. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has recently written his le story. Journalist TomosPoveysat down with himONE of the culinary worldrsquos most talented figures has revealed his extraordinary journey, from the hardships of being made redundant to achieving the dream of opening his own restaurant, in a new book.James Sommerin released his -page autobiography - Generations - two months ago.The book takes readers on a turbulent ride, which documents the fall and remarkable rise of this multi-award winning chef.In no time at all, it has proved a major hit for the -year-old, with more than  copies having being sold.This is not surprising for this is no ordinary autobiography, as it also contains many eagerly-anticipated recipes and picturesque images.ldquoThe book is basically a round-up of my le so far, he said.ldquoIt also has a lot of personal information about me that people do not know. It has my childhood and when I was travelling, as well as some recipes in the back.ldquoIt was quite hard to come up with the title.ldquoAfter a lot of thinking, I came up with the name and it sums up what the book is about. It was my grandmother who inspired me to cook.ldquoI dedicated the book to her because she got me involved in cooking. I would cook with her on weekends and holidays.ldquoMy children are also involved with cooking. With these two points in mind Generations came forth.The chef, who was brought up and educated in Caerleon, left the area aged  and moved to Scotland.In the book he talks of Scotland in great depth, as this is where he ldquolearnt the craft.ldquoI did corporate and cooking in Caerleon. I then took my first full-time cooking position at the Cwrt Bleddyn Hotel, near Usk. Shortly afterwards I then moved to Scotland and it was there that I learnt my craft.ldquoThere was so much that I learnt when I was there and it helped me a lot in broadening my skills.He added: ldquoWhen I was there I also met my we. Then I came back to Wales a few years later and the rest is history.Despite the dficulty of doing so, Mr Sommerin also re-lives the ldquolowest point in his le by putting into words how he felt when the unthinkablehappened.ldquoThe book also gives the highs and lows, he said.ldquoDue to my wersquos persuasion, I also include the lowest point in my le. This was when I was made redundant from the Crown at Whitebrook.ldquoI had started there in  and was later made head chef.ldquoWhen I was made redundant it was a massive low for me: I went from an exceptionally good salary and having my first Michelin Star to nothing.ldquoI talk about this in depth in the book. I was devastated when I had to go. I even lost my cars.ldquoI had no income yet had to support my family.ldquoTo bring in money, I had to resort to cooking in peoplersquos homes.ldquoIt was dficult to writeabout this. But later I went on to open a restaurant in Penarth and that for me was one of my highest achievements. In the beginning it was a headache. It is not for the faint-hearted to open a restaurant. There were delays and things not falling into place.ldquoBut now Restaurant James Sommerin is a high point because this place is a family restaurant and we are all involved in it. My daughter is training to become a chef too.ldquoAnother high point for me was getting a Michelin Star. It is a hard thing to put into words how it felt, really.And for all the foodies wondering ldquoare there any recipes included  there is a plethora of mouth-watering dishes to cook at the back of the book.Mr Sommerin said: ldquoThere is about  recipes in the back ndash some are complicated and others easy. There are vegetarian dishes too.ldquoSome of the dishes are for a more challenging cook, rather than an amateur.The Michelin Star chef also expressed gratitude to his we for putting the book together, saying: ldquoThe book would not have happenedit were not for some strong people.ldquoThe strongest person is my we, who wrote it all.

He said: ldquoWe were blown away by such a generous offer. Our playgroups and workshops make a real dference for people who arenrsquot always able to access creative activities, and we have been lucky to secure funding this last year to run our playgroups free of charge for families and help the community.He added: ldquoBeing not-for-profit it is always a stretch to buy resources and sadly the instruments get worn out quickly and are expensive to replace. The children and adults we work with benefit hugely from music and creative expression and always enjoy having a go with the instruments. A donation like this means so much and the new instruments have been very happily received.\"Music is a universal language that transcends ability, age and every other demographic. We are so grateful to Phil and Adrian, the patrons of Penarth Acoustic Club, Grfin Books and of course Pencerdd who were really helpful and accommodating too.KeyCreate welcomes new families to the playgroups and invites anyone to get in touch.

They will also prepare the puppy for her future as a working guide dog by taking her on trains and buses, and into shops.After a year or so in their care, Gem willto the charity to begin specialised guide dog training.ldquoIt was a challenge at first, especially as we never owned a dog before, but we felt it was a really worthwhile thing to do, said Mrs Arthur.ldquoI was aware of the isolation experienced by many people with a vision impairment and wanted to make a dference by giving something back to the community. Itrsquos been le-enhancing for us, and wersquove made all sorts of friends.ldquoPenarth town is a really good place to train a guide dog puppy, with a small arcade and local shops. People are very amenable and love being part of Gemrsquos education. We have the Esplanade, beaches and country parks, and wersquove even taken her to Ikea.\"People are very interested in the puppy and we rarely go on a walk without someone enquiring about what we are doing. Gem is so sociable and would like to say hello to everyone.The couple remember vividly the arrival of their first guide dog puppy, a yellow Labrador retriever named Gilly.ldquoWe were excited, very well prepared, and fell in love with her straight away, said Mrs Arthur. ldquoIt was the most joyful and wonderful experience, but you have to be prepared to put in the hard work to train the puppy.ldquoHanding her back after a year was hard, but we were kept informed of her progress and wersquore proud that she is now a qualied guide dog.The charity is seeking more puppy raisers in the Vale of Glamorgan area. Volunteers need access to a car and must be free to spend time with the puppy for most of the day. Their yard or garden will also need to be securely fenced so that the puppy remains safely within its confines.Guide Dogs supplies basic equipment, covers all veterinary and feeding expenses, and provides a network of support and advice.To find out more about becoming a puppy raiser for Guide Dogs, ring Steve Kersley on   and leave a message, or email Steve.Kersley@guidedogs.org.uk article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It aims to maximise independence, which research has shown is the outcome that matters most to people.The project is informed by a similar initiative developed in Canterbury, New Zealand and has a number of key elements which will improve how health and social services work together.Some these elements include a well-being website which will link services across the community and allow health and social care professionals to share information about patients and multi-disciplinary teams.During a visit to Redlands Surgery in Penarth last week, Mr Gething met members of the Cardf and Vale team and some of the team visiting from New Zealand to see the development of the project.Mr Gething said: ldquoWith an increase in le expectancy and our continued public health challenges, our health and social care services will continue to face increasing pressures. This is why, in our long term plan for health and social care, we have set out the need to truly transform the way we deliver care to ensure it is sustainable in the future.\"This will require better integration of health and social services to reduce reliance on hospitals and deliver care closer to home. The Transformation Fund will be used to fund a small number of projects which have the most impact in developing and delivering new models of care, and which have potential to scale up so they can be used across Wales.\" article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log ---- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment        -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Now firmly embedded in their respective communities, these centres – coupled with our expert sectoral advisors – are on hand to help business owners identy opportunity and risks and how best to mitigate or capitalise upon them.”Richard Donnan, head of Northern Ireland at Ulster Bank, says it “is strongly committed to supporting businesses of all sizes, from micro firms right through to large corporates”.“Our latest results show a % in small business drawdowns, and we continue to work hard through initiatives such as our Boost initiative and our Entrepreneur Accelerator to build mutually beneficial relationships with firms across Northern Ireland. “A key focus for the bank is the development of digital services that make it simpler, easier and safer for customers to bank with us. “Our digitally active customer base grew by % year-on-year and we are continuing to respond to that change, for example, by introducing our Business Growth Enablers and through the development of our digital s such as our mobile app.”But it’s not all bank financing. The Growth Loan Fund offers assistance to Northern Ireland-based companies who demonstrate growth, and tend to work within the manufacturing, engineering or tradable services sectors. “Loans will be typically unsecured and personal guarantees will not be sought. The loans provided are expected to be complementary to existing sources of finance, including banks, trade finance sources and equity investors.”Some of the companies availing of the finance include Belfast-based BLK BOX Fitness, which secured £, to grow its online  and boost exports, along with Fermanagh gin-maker Boatyard Distillery.Meanwhile, the BGF was set up in  with £.bn and has since backed close to  companies. Last year, BGF was the UK’s top institutional investor and ranked the seventh most active private investor in the world by number of investments. Upstream is a Belfast-based alternative finance company specialising in SME funding, and has also now introduced a trade finance option for clients. The market-first solution unlocks the ability for businesses to finance their working capital needs end to end, from supplier to buyer.Niall Harkin is director of customer journeys at Danske Bank. He says “personal engagement is still really important” when dealing with small and medium-sized firms looking at expansion.“That’s why last year we introduced a team of  dedicated small business advisers back in to key branches across Northern Ireland, giving customers access to expertise in their local area to discuss business plans and explore funding options,” he said.“Meanwhile, teams of experienced relationship managers supported by specialists in areas such as cash management, markets and trade finance, support our larger SME customers.“At the same time, we’re investing heavily in our digital offering, and recently added the capability for SMEs to get lending decisions in a matter of minutes in ious situations. ‘future financing’ makes the whole credit process much easier for our customers. For an overdraft, we’ve seen approvals in four minutes and access to money well within  hours. “In the future, customers should be able to go online and request an overdraft increase on a smartphone at home.”But aside from the financial support, businesses here can also turn to the support from hubs. That includes Ormeau Baths’s Barclays Eagle Labs – which is located at the south Belfast listed building – and the Ignite NI Propel Pre-Accelerator. The options are out there and available for companies wishing to take that next step, whether traditional banking or alternative streams are the way to go.

Belfast City Council’s planning committee approved Primark’s listed building consent application for the Bank Buildings. It means the conservation-led works to take down the top two floors of Bank Buildings can now begin. “Once these unstable elements are removed, works can take place to install a facade retention scheme,” the council said. “It will also make it possible to reduce the cordon and restore pedestrian access between Royal Avenue and Donegall Place, subject to health and safety considerations as work takes place.” It also means Primark will be able to open up once again, at the building’s new extension. Aodhan Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium , said: \"This is terric news for Primark and for the retail hub of Belfast City Centre. Now that planning has been granted they can start the work to bring down the facade and put up the protection that will allow the cordon to reduce and for stores within the cordon to open. “This will be a le line for those traders in the cordon and those without who have seen their footfall drop by over %. We also welcome the news that Primark will open again soon as it will serve as a footfall draw to this part of the city which has been devastated. We now look the Chancellor and his budget next week to seecentral government will step up to support the city centre.” The latest footfall figures from the NIRC showed footfall across the city was down by more than % in September.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":null,"title":"donegall house on sale for m","story":"Posted on Thursday November  by Ulster Business A prominent Belfast building has gone on the market for offers over £.m, it can be revealed.Donegall House, which sits across from City Hall on Donegall Square, is now being marketed by Osborne King and CBRE.Built in , the building was refurbished in .
