At least one of the singer\u0027s attorneys says he urged her repeatedly over the years to draft one.\u0027I tried to convince her that she should do not just a will but a trust while she was still alive,\u0027 says Don Wilson, a Los Angeles lawyer who worked on entertainment matters for Franklin for nearly 30 years. \u0027She never told me, \u0027No, I don\u0027t want to do one.\u0027 She understood the need. It just didn\u0027t seem to be something she got around to.\u0027Laura Zwicker, an attorney who specializes in estate planning but is not affiliated with the Franklin estate, says she sees it happen all too often in her work.\u0027People don\u0027t like to face their own mortality,\u0027 Zwicker says. \u0027I had a client who had a $70 million real estate portfolio who had had end-stage diabetes. He had plenty of conversations with me about estate planning but would not sign the documents.\u0027  She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin (pictured), Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardianPapers filed in Michigan\u0027s Oakland County court last week by David J. Bennett, the lawyer who worked most closely with Franklin, lay out the few known basics:She was not married and left four sons, ages 48 to 63: Clarence Franklin, Edward Franklin, Kecalf Franklin and Ted White Jr. Clarence, Aretha\u0027s eldest, is incapacitated and is represented by a guardian. And a niece of hers has accepted the role of executor.  Family members embrace at Franklin\u0027s funeral. A niece of hers has accepted the role of executor Under Michigan law, as in most states, the sons will equally ide their mother\u0027s assets in the absence of a will, and so far no signs of conflict have emerged among family members. Bennett did not respond to phone and email messages seeking comment.Aretha Franklin\u0027s friend Ron Moten, a Michigan businessman, gave the four sons some guidance in his speech at Friday\u0027s funeral.\u0027Remember your family, and friends that have been with you for years,\u0027 Moten told the men. \u0027Because you are about to meet a lot of people who will now want to be your new best friend. You will also meet some people that will have the best investments in the world for you. My advice? Go slow, be careful and be smart.\u0027The documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estate. The figure almost certainly runs into the tens of millions, but there will probably be widely varying estimates as her attorneys seek to downplay her wealth for tax purposes and the IRS tries to maximize the amount for its own reasons.Franklin maintained ownership of the songs she wrote and did well by them, Wilson says, though of her major hits, \u0027Think\u0027 is the only one that\u0027s her own composition. She also wrote some lesser hits, such as \u0027Rock Steady.\u0027  Jordan Franklin, left, pauses alongside his sister Victorie Franklin while speaking about their grandmother, Aretha Franklin. Documents make no mention of the value of Franklin\u0027s estateThough her records were played millions of times, she earned little in radio royalties from smashes like 1967\u0027s \u0027Respect\u0027 because such payments go overwhelmingly to the song\u0027s author, not the performer. In the case of \u0027Respect,\u0027 the royalties go to the estate of Otis Redding, even though the song owes nearly all its popularity to Franklin.\u0027I would imagine she probably felt she was entitled to more, but probably received more than a lot of artists from the time, especially African-American artists,\u0027 Wilson says.Among Franklin\u0027s more tangible assets are several pieces of property in the Detroit area that according to tax assessors\u0027 estimates are worth at least $2 million, with a market value that could easily be twice that.Star of Marvel\u0027s Luke Cage apologizes after appearing to...Bill Clinton is VERY impressed with mini-dress wearing...Share this article    Some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent   \u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 lawyer Laura Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent\u0027Once the value is established - a process that could take years - the IRS will take any back taxes Franklin owed, then will tax her estate at 40 percent for any assets beyond $11.2 million.Kenneth Abdo, an attorney who specializes in probate law and has worked on the estate of Prince, who also died without a will, says the IRS will conduct an audit of her holdings.Wilson, her entertainment attorney, says she would not have wanted to see her finances publicly aired: \u0027She was a private person.\u0027As for why some clients don\u0027t make out a will, Zwicker said some heirs, like Franklin\u0027s son Clarence, may need more than others, and that can be a difficult and touchy decision for a parent.\u0027One arrangement may be fitting for one child, where other people need more help,\u0027 Zwicker said. \u0027To accept that and put it on paper can be hard for a parent.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/13/15/4E32FB4100000578-0-image-m-59_1531493474914.jpg","title":"Britains Got Talent host Amanda Holden dogs womans best friend","story":"Amanda Holden, 47, shows off her sensational physique in...How to look this good at 47 without ever going on a diet:...Share this articleIt was love at first sight and Ruth says their long walks together are her ‘stress-reliever’ from hectic working life. ‘Stroking your dog releases stress – I totally believe it now.’SHIRLEY BALLAS: ‘MY POOCH FLIES FIRST-CLASS WITH ME’There’s no expense spared for the Strictly judge’s beloved pet (both pictured, below).

Drivers often receive less than the valuation offered online.In 2011 the now-defunct Office for Fair Trading took action against the website after finding that 96 per cent of customers received less than its valuation tool indicated. But it remains very popular among drivers who do not want the hassle of selling their car privately.The business model has helped generate a fortune for Mrs Palmer-Baunack andd she now joins an almost exclusively male list of executives who have found themselves embroiled in controversy over excessive pay.On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, she also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.In leaked emails seen by The Mail on Sunday, one former male colleague remarked that he might have been better off if he had a ‘pair of **** like Avril’.Shareholders have also been encouraged to vote against the bonus scheme, with a report by advisory firm Glass Lewis calling the £29million pay-out ‘extremely disproportionate’.The board faces a showdown with investors at its AGM in London on Thursday.Victory for Johnny Bobbitt: Couple, accused of stealing...Freeway of Love! 130 pink Cadillacs owners come from all...Homeware giant Robert Dyas BANS sales of £2.99 caustic soda...Schoolchildren will be BANNED from buying energy drinks: PM...Share this articleBut the vote is only advisory, meaning she can keep her bonus – unless she feels obliged to appease shareholders.Given her hard-nosed reflections on executive pay and the workplace, that seems unlikely.Mrs Palmer-Baunack, who has a grown-up son and daughter, is married to a German executive at Volkswagen. She previously defended her £7.1million pay package in 2015 by saying: ‘Anyone who says they don’t want money is talking b*******’.The former Saturday girl at Marks \u0026amp Spencer has also shown little sympathy with the idea that women are discriminated against in the workplace.She once said she was ‘very cynical’ about the existence of ‘glass ceilings’ – a term describing the reluctance by companies to give top jobs to women. In an interview two years ago she said: ‘If you get up and do a good day’s work, you are respected for it.’During her first full-time job at a car rental desk in Kennington, South London, she realised she was good at selling and that the job was ‘all about up-selling everything’. ‘Upselling’ means persuading customers to buy extras or more expensive items.          On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, Avril Palmer-Baunack also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.British Car Auctions has defended her remuneration, arguing it needs to pay a ‘competitive rate’ to attract top people. But MPs are likely to take a dim view. Theresa May has published a public register to name and shame firms which have faced a revolt from shareholders over high pay.More than a fifth of Britain’s FTSE listed-firms appear on the list, including Burberry, Sports Direct and Sky.Earlier this year the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon announced he would hand back £25million of his £100million pay package, to pacify shareholders.The award for Jeff Fairburn was generated by a 2012 long-term incentive plan. However, Mrs Palmer-Baunack’s haul is dwarfed by Denise Coates, who founded private online gambling firm Bet365 in 2000 from a Portakabin in a Stoke car park.The billionaire awarded herself £217million in pay and idends in 2016. That is about 1,400 times more than the Prime Minister.One of the few highly paid female bosses of firms listed on the stockmarket is Emma Walmsley.

Today, he describes how he and his BBC cameraman went in search of the rarest animal of all . . . Our footsteps echoed with embarrassing loudness on the hotel lobby’s polished wooden floor. There seemed to be nobody about. We coughed apologetically and waited.My cameraman colleague, Geoff Mulligan, and I had been warned that hardly anybody stayed at this hotel — why would they, situated as it was deep in the inhospitable forests of eastern Madagascar? But it seemed the perfect place to base ourselves in our search for one of the island’s most elusive creatures: its largest lemur, the indri.After several minutes a door at the far end of the hall opened to reveal, to our astonishment, an extremely glamorous woman. Her lips were heavily reddened and her lashes blackened with mascara, and she wore a chic but flimsy silk housecoat that barely succeeded in covering her ample figure.She was not yet fully awake, though it was by then almost midday. As she tottered towards us on stylish high heels, she was blinking sleepily and doing her best to rearrange her upswept coiffure.Jeanine, as we were to discover later, was no ordinary hotel boss — she had once been a model and the proprietor of a fashionable bar in Madagascar’s capital, Tananarive, which she had been forced to leave because of what she darkly referred to as ‘un grand scandale’.She required a great deal of reassurance that we had not come to the area by mistake, but were hoping to book rooms for a fortnight or so. When we at last convinced her, we unloaded our belongings and went to meet the local forestry officer, an elderly Frenchman.Our conversation was not profitable as he was lacking his dentures, and my French is passable at best. But he kindly offered us the services of a deputy, Michel, to show us the areas most likely to harbour the rare, mysterious and beautiful indri.I had read as much as I possibly could about this extraordinary animal before I left Britain, and established that it is around 3ft tall, is coloured black or black-and-white and has huge hands, six times as long as they are broad.What intrigued me most was the resemblance it bore to ancient drawings of a creature known to early explorers as the ‘dog-headed man’ peculiar to the area. It was always depicted as standing upright, with a shaggy coat and enormous, human-like hands and feet. Its body was tail-less and proportioned like a human being’s, but with a face and a snout like a dog’s.Could the ‘dog-headed man’ be the indri?There were few eyewitness accounts — the one attempt to study it in captivity 20 years before had failed dismally. A group of indris sent to a Paris zoo all died within a month, the keepers having been unable to replicate their highly specialised diet of leaves.Now here we were, with the chance to see one for ourselves. To watch and film one would, for me, be a glittering prize well worth all the effort and anticipation.As Geoff and I followed Michel into the twilight of the rainforest, our spirits sank.This was the thickest bush we had encountered so far. Not only was it very dark, but the vegetation was so dense that unless we were lucky it would be impossible to get a filmable view of any creature more than a few feet away.But the forest was extremely rich in animal life. From a small stream nearby came the honk of frogs, while from overhead came a confused chorus of birdsong.As I stood trying to unravel this cacophony, the birdsong was suddenly drowned out by a chorus of spine-chilling, unearthly howls.          Indri (pictured), also called the babakoto, is the largest lemurs of Madagascar‘Babakoto,’ said Michel, triumphantly — the local word for the indri. The noise was deafening — and eerily like the sound of a crying human child. But nothing could have prepared me for the volume. Even a gang of the noisiest children could not have produced a tenth of these decibels.Desperately, we peered through the palisades of trunks and leafy curtains. But we could see nothing — not the tiniest patch of black fur, nor the flash of an eye.Then, as abruptly as the wailing had begun, it stopped and the crickets, frogs and parrots took over once again. We were jubilant — the indris were really here.‘Always they sing at the same time,’ said Michel. ‘They will be here again tomorrow. If they don’t sing, then call to them with their voice, and often they will reply.’We turned up the next day with all our equipment, and the next, and the next. But of the indris there was neither sight nor sound. Hour after hour we waited, doing our best to imitate their calls. But no reply came back from the trees. There seemed nothing else to do but be patient.After a week, I was beginning to lose faith in the possibility of ever seeing an indri. Had they moved on? We decided to try a different part of the bush.Our first foray provided almost immediately a minor success, albeit not the one we had anticipated. Looking down to see where I was putting my feet, I noticed I was about to step into the middle of a collection of shiny olive-green objects the size of golf balls.When I picked one up, a split opened on one side to reveal that it was in fact a huge insect with around 20 pairs of frantically waving legs. The creature straightened itself out, unfurled a pair of knobbly antennae and began walking determinedly up my arm.I identified it as one of a strange species of millipede and I was sure they would make a wonderful display in London Zoo’s insect house. We filled our pockets and took 100 or so back to the hotel.The millipedes were not our only acquisition. A few days later, the elderly forestry officer drew up at the hotel in his smart saloon car.He was on his way to a meeting, but en-route had met some men carrying a newly-caught tailless tenrec — a comical, spiny creature looking like a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater.Remembering us, he had given the men a few francs for the animal and, as he had no cage or sack handy, had put it loose in the boot of his car. It was, he said, extremely lively and ferocious.Mindful of this, we assembled gloves, sacks and an empty cage, and the forestry officer cautiously lifted the boot lid an inch. I peered inside but could see nothing.He widened the crack two inches, then, warning us to pounce swiftly, threw open the lid. Geoff and I lunged. But there was absolutely nothing upon which to pounce. The boot was empty!Gingerly we removed the tool-bag, the jack and the spare wheel. Again, nothing. As we wondered what to do next, we heard a scrabbling deep inside the chassis somewhere between the front and back mudguards.\u0027We didn’t know we were playing with the clothes of Dad’s...Share this articleBy this time we had drawn a crowd of curious onlookers, and there was no lack of helping hands when I suggested that unscrewing the panels lining the interior was the only way to reach our quarry.The invisible tenrec spurred us on by rattling about in his metallic cavern.The forestry officer was starting to weary of the sight of his car being dismantled, and proposed driving on to his meeting.I pointed out that this would be most unwise, as the poor creature would almost certainly die — and if it did the smell would make his car unusable for at least a week.A far better plan would be to shut the lid, join us for coffee and see if the tenrec would clamber out of its uncomfortable refuge in the chassis and return to the relative spaciousness of the boot.Two hours later, we quietly opened the lid again. The tenrec was sitting at the back nonchalantly washing himself. He was the size of a large guinea pig, with an absurdly long tapering nose, immense whiskers, beady eyes and enormous hindquarters.We pounced and seconds later he was in one of our travelling cages.By the time we got him back to London and handed him over to the Zoo he had grown tremendously, increasing in both girth and length. But he never lost his passion for trying to cram his paunchy body down even the smallest suspicion of a hole.My hotel room was now well stocked. Chameleons sat goggling at one another on the curtain rail. A frilled gecko hung upside down on a piece of bark in a cage next to the tenrec. The millipedes slumbered in a box in one corner and three boa constrictors occupied a slowly moving sack in the other.          David with cameraman Geoff MulliganEvery day we discovered fresh creatures to fascinate us: moths, beetles, snakes, lizards, black parrots, strange frogs — but we still had not found the indri.An Ornithologist friend had asked us to record the song of the Madagascan magpie robin — a sound he considered to be among the finest produced by any bird.Geoff and I made our first attempt one day soon after dawn. When we arrived we found one, a handsome cock bird, singing heartily. Quickly, I plugged in the microphone and aimed it at him.For several minutes the tape moved steadily. Then, suddenly, a deafening eerie wail pealed out from the trees beyond, so loud that the recorder needle thrashed against the stop pin of the dial and clung there shuddering. It was the indri. But this time it was louder and closer.Geoff snatched his camera and I frantically searched the trees, but we could see nothing. The calls stopped, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a body sailing through the air. The indri had gone. Once more, we had failed.‘Well,’ said Geoff as we trudged back for breakfast. ‘At least we have a recording to prove it does exist, and that once upon a time we were within a few yards of one.’Then I thought of a trick used by ornithologists to locate a bird they wish to study — playing a recording of its song to attract others. I didn’t have much confidence, but we had tried everything else.For the next few days we played Geoff’s recording in several parts of the forest with no luck. Then, one morning I was about to pack up when the sound of the tape was suddenly drowned out by a series of trumpeting hoots.They were unlike any animal sound I’d ever heard, and I couldn’t imagine what was making them.I looked up and saw one of the hooting creatures in a tree in a small dell nearby — a big, furry black-and-white lemur, sitting on a branch 30ft from the ground.His chest, forearms and legs below the knee were white and he appeared to have a black cape round his shoulders, a pure white cap and black socks and gloves.‘It’s a ruffed lemur,’ I whispered to Geoff. ‘We can get shots of them in Tananarive Zoo.’ Nonetheless, we started filming, for he was a most beautiful creature.Our tape recorder continued its indri wails. The lemur glared indignantly at us with bright yellow eyes. Once more he hooted his irritation, and another trumpeting sound came from a tree on the left. I turned and saw two more of the animals sitting with their necks craned forward, staring at us in puzzlement.The first one reached up and pulled himself upright on to the branch above. I made a mental note that his movements were not like those of other lemurs, which are all four-footed. Then, as the animal sat down once more, I blinked in surprise.‘Where’s he put his tail?’ I muttered. ‘He should have a very long, black one.’‘Perhaps it’s curled up between his legs,’ said Geoff.The animal raised a long hind leg and grasped the tree trunk. He did not have a tail. Stupidly, it took me a few seconds to reach the only possible conclusion. ‘Geoff,’ I said quietly, ‘that is an indri.’There was no doubt. There is only one tailless lemur. We were jubilant. We had found them — and Geoff had already shot a full 400ft of film.Cautiously, he moved nearer to get shots from a different angle, but it was too much for the indris. With a gigantic bound, the first one leapt away, springing from trunk to trunk so rapidly that he seemed to ricochet from one tree to the other. The other two followed and within seconds were out of sight.Before dawn we returned and there they were again, just as Michel had said they would be. Every day for a week we watched this little family: the big male, his mate and a younger pair, slowly getting to know their habits, routine and personalities.The old male was of a sedate disposition, often sitting on a branch with his back against the main trunk and his long legs outstretched in a comically human-like position. Although he could leap huge distances, he spent most of his time clambering happily from branch to branch in search of the most succulent young leaves.The two youngsters were an extremely affectionate couple, and spent hours each day caressing one another. The position they chose in which to practise their endearments, crouching on a high horizontal bough, seemed perilous, like a pair of circus acrobats nonchalantly enacting episodes of their daily lives on a high wire.The fourth member of the group, the older female, we seldom saw. Only after several days did we learn the reason for her reticence. Clinging to her back was small, black-faced baby with hairy ears and bright eyes, barely a foot long.He was an enchanting creature, sometimes riding on her back, sometimes clambering round to suckle. His mother behaved with endearing tenderness, licking him gently from time to time.Our detailed knowledge of the family’s daily routine made our task of filming them easy. We photographed them feeding, dozing and caressing one another, but one shot we lacked — we had not secured any good pictures of them leaping, for when they moved off they always jumped away from us.If we were to get the film we wanted before we left, we urgently needed a new approach.We knew the location of the tree where they sang at lunchtime, and that they moved to an area further away to sing in the late afternoon. To get from one to the other, the indris would have to cross one of the area’s few wide roads.Retracing their movements, we worked out that at only one place was the road narrow enough for them to leap comfortably across. A simple calculation was enough to show that they must make the crossing at between three and four o’clock in the afternoon.Accordingly, at half-past two, Geoff and I set up our cameras a little west of the trees we judged they would use for their leap.Prompt at half past three, the old male duly appeared in the take-off tree. The young couple joined him, then the mother and baby emerged from the forest behind to sit on one of the branches overhanging the road.As soon as they were assembled, the old male climbed leisurely to the most outstretched branch. Geoff began filming.The male poised himself, then made a single, soaring jump right across the road to the tree the other side. One by one the rest followed him and disappeared.Geoff switched off his camera, beaming. After weeks of hope and crushing disappointment, our film of the private life of the indris was complete at last.Were the creatures we had filmed really the origin of the dog-headed man? It was impossible to know. But of one thing I was certain. Of all the strange and wonderful creatures we had filmed in Madagascar, this was the rarest, the least documented and the most endearing.  Aware of the BBC’s team’s disappointment at not being permitted to catch any lemurs, the Madagascar Scientific Institute presented them with two ring-tails and a ruffed lemur from its own collection. Their descendants thrived at London Zoo for decades.The indri remains in critical danger of extinction, with a 2015 report revealing that no zoo has yet worked out the complexities of its diet, and that it is unable to breed in captivity.Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

Mr Murray and his wife Sally said they understand the council\u0027s position and are now going to modify the recipe to get the treat back on the menu.\u0027But I think you would have to eat a lot of it to be affected by the booze - you probably would be sick before you felt the effects of the alcohol.\u0027Mr Murray stated the cost of purchasing a licence for the rum and raisin ice cream would cost up to £1,000 in total.And while the flavour is a popular one, the Murray\u0027s, who opened their shop four months ago, feel the cost of a licence is not worth the purchase, but are hopeful that their plan to burn off the booze could see the ice cream return to the business in the future.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/09/02/12/4FA0EA4000000578-0-image-m-52_1535887369967.jpg","title":"Scottish voters splitting United Kingdom Brexit poll finds","story":"    When asked how they would vote if a referendum on Scotland\u0027s future was held after the UK leaves the EU, 47 per cent said they would support independence, with 43 per cent saying they would opt to stay part of the UnionWhen asked how they would vote if a referendum on Scotland\u0027s future was held after the UK leaves the EU, 47 per cent said they would support independence, with 43 per cent saying they would opt to stay part of the Union.But if the UK stayed part of the EU, those figures would be reversed, with 43 per cent saying they would vote for independence while 47 per cent said they would back remaining part of Britain.In both scenarios, 10 per cent of the 1,022 people who were questioned did not know how they would vote.Gordon Brown demands Labour FINALLY adopt the full...Michel Barnier savages May\u0027s Chequers plan for undermining...Share this articleMeanwhile, 52 per cent of voters in Northern Ireland said they would vote for a united Ireland outside of the UK after Britain leaves the EU, with 39 per cent favouring the province staying part of the UK while 7 per cent did not know and the remainder said they would not vote.Support for a united Ireland would increase if there ended up being a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, according to the poll.Of the 1,199 people questioned in Northern Ireland, 56 per cent said the return to these arrangements would lead them to vote for a united Ireland which was outside of the UK.However, if Brexit does not go ahead, only 35 per cent said they would support a united Ireland outside of the UK while 52 per cent would vote for Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK, with 11 per cent unsure how they would vote and the rest would not take part in the ballot.          52 per cent of voters in Northern Ireland said they would vote for a united Ireland outside of the UK after Britain leaves the EU, with 39 per cent favouring the province staying part of the UK while 7 per cent did not know and the remainder said they would not voteBest for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said the research was \u0027compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again\u0027 on Brexit.She said: \u0027This is compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again.

The great land battles were being remembered at a number of ceremonies as the dates occurred,\u0027 writes Macdonald. \u0027The great clash of steel titans at sea, the Battle of Jutland, was poignantly remembered, as were the inidual sinkings of some famous ships such as HMS Hampshire and HMS Vanguard. \u0027But for many ships and their crews, sent to the bottom by mine, torpedo or collision, there was no such act of remembrance. Now, therefore, as these great 100th anniversaries passed, it seemed an appropriate time to write about some of the famous World War I naval shipwrecks that lie around our British coastline, in my own act of remembrance to those who perished.\u0027The Rio de Janeiro Maru was requisitioned by the Japanese Navy and was active until September 1943 when she was reconverted into a transport ship, however, in February 1944, she was bombed during Operation Hailstone by the USA.              Crockery on the Helmet Wreck bears generic markings of an eagle on top of a globe          A er swimming alongside the bronze lettering which still rings around the Rio de Janeiro Maru\u0027s stern          Paul Haynes carefully holds a katana samurai sword found inside the Rio de Janeiro Maru in Truk Lagoon          Rod Macdonald and Paul Haynes with the bell of British Steam Ship SS Creemuir which was sunk as it made its way north along the East Coast of Scotland by German aircraft          Rod  left, and Paul Haynes, right,  fly the flag of the Explorers Club, a group which promotes the scientific exploration of land, sea, air, and space          The stern of Audacious, the first British battleship to be sunk by an enemy attack during World War One  The images have been released as part of a new book by Rod who is an internationally renowned Scotish er, called Deeper into the Darkness: The Diving Trilogy 3Macdonald has previously written about some of the greatest shipwrecks around the UK and his latest book also charts his own journey from novice to technical er as well as highlighting the history of some of the world\u0027s greatest wrecks.\u0027I decided to write a follow-on to Into the Abyss and The Darkness Below - a third volume in the story of my ing career, which by complete chance, mirrors and charts the development of our sport of technical ing from its origins in the dangerous deep air days of the late 1980s, through concepts such as extended range ing, the use of decompression gases such as nitrox, the use of deep ing trimix gases using helium, through open-circuit trimix ing and on to the present day, when we use amazingly complicated closed-circuit rebreathers that greatly extend the time you can spend on the bottom and the depth you can go to with ease, whilst minimising as far as possible the length of time it takes to ascend safely and decompress,\u0027 continues Macdonald.\u0027Of necessity, reading about ing, and particularly technical ing, means grappling with a number of specialist concepts and pieces of kit that can seem confusing and daunting to the non-er to begin with.\u0027Rather than providing a dull glossary, each time something specialist comes up for the first time I\u0027ve tried to explain it in simple terms so that as you progress through the book, these concepts and pieces of kit will become more familiar.\u0027Don\u0027t worry if you don\u0027t understand something at a first reading you will by the end of the book.

Drivers often receive less than the valuation offered online.In 2011 the now-defunct Office for Fair Trading took action against the website after finding that 96 per cent of customers received less than its valuation tool indicated. But it remains very popular among drivers who do not want the hassle of selling their car privately.The business model has helped generate a fortune for Mrs Palmer-Baunack andd she now joins an almost exclusively male list of executives who have found themselves embroiled in controversy over excessive pay.On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, she also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.In leaked emails seen by The Mail on Sunday, one former male colleague remarked that he might have been better off if he had a ‘pair of **** like Avril’.Shareholders have also been encouraged to vote against the bonus scheme, with a report by advisory firm Glass Lewis calling the £29million pay-out ‘extremely disproportionate’.The board faces a showdown with investors at its AGM in London on Thursday.Victory for Johnny Bobbitt: Couple, accused of stealing...Freeway of Love! 130 pink Cadillacs owners come from all...Homeware giant Robert Dyas BANS sales of £2.99 caustic soda...Schoolchildren will be BANNED from buying energy drinks: PM...Share this articleBut the vote is only advisory, meaning she can keep her bonus – unless she feels obliged to appease shareholders.Given her hard-nosed reflections on executive pay and the workplace, that seems unlikely.Mrs Palmer-Baunack, who has a grown-up son and daughter, is married to a German executive at Volkswagen. She previously defended her £7.1million pay package in 2015 by saying: ‘Anyone who says they don’t want money is talking b*******’.The former Saturday girl at Marks \u0026amp Spencer has also shown little sympathy with the idea that women are discriminated against in the workplace.She once said she was ‘very cynical’ about the existence of ‘glass ceilings’ – a term describing the reluctance by companies to give top jobs to women. In an interview two years ago she said: ‘If you get up and do a good day’s work, you are respected for it.’During her first full-time job at a car rental desk in Kennington, South London, she realised she was good at selling and that the job was ‘all about up-selling everything’. ‘Upselling’ means persuading customers to buy extras or more expensive items.          On top of her £29million bonus, linked to the company’s share price, Avril Palmer-Baunack also received an 8 per cent rise in her basic salary to £525,000.British Car Auctions has defended her remuneration, arguing it needs to pay a ‘competitive rate’ to attract top people. But MPs are likely to take a dim view. Theresa May has published a public register to name and shame firms which have faced a revolt from shareholders over high pay.More than a fifth of Britain’s FTSE listed-firms appear on the list, including Burberry, Sports Direct and Sky.Earlier this year the chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon announced he would hand back £25million of his £100million pay package, to pacify shareholders.The award for Jeff Fairburn was generated by a 2012 long-term incentive plan. However, Mrs Palmer-Baunack’s haul is dwarfed by Denise Coates, who founded private online gambling firm Bet365 in 2000 from a Portakabin in a Stoke car park.The billionaire awarded herself £217million in pay and idends in 2016. That is about 1,400 times more than the Prime Minister.One of the few highly paid female bosses of firms listed on the stockmarket is Emma Walmsley.

Today, he describes how he and his BBC cameraman went in search of the rarest animal of all . . . Our footsteps echoed with embarrassing loudness on the hotel lobby’s polished wooden floor. There seemed to be nobody about. We coughed apologetically and waited.My cameraman colleague, Geoff Mulligan, and I had been warned that hardly anybody stayed at this hotel — why would they, situated as it was deep in the inhospitable forests of eastern Madagascar? But it seemed the perfect place to base ourselves in our search for one of the island’s most elusive creatures: its largest lemur, the indri.After several minutes a door at the far end of the hall opened to reveal, to our astonishment, an extremely glamorous woman. Her lips were heavily reddened and her lashes blackened with mascara, and she wore a chic but flimsy silk housecoat that barely succeeded in covering her ample figure.She was not yet fully awake, though it was by then almost midday. As she tottered towards us on stylish high heels, she was blinking sleepily and doing her best to rearrange her upswept coiffure.Jeanine, as we were to discover later, was no ordinary hotel boss — she had once been a model and the proprietor of a fashionable bar in Madagascar’s capital, Tananarive, which she had been forced to leave because of what she darkly referred to as ‘un grand scandale’.She required a great deal of reassurance that we had not come to the area by mistake, but were hoping to book rooms for a fortnight or so. When we at last convinced her, we unloaded our belongings and went to meet the local forestry officer, an elderly Frenchman.Our conversation was not profitable as he was lacking his dentures, and my French is passable at best. But he kindly offered us the services of a deputy, Michel, to show us the areas most likely to harbour the rare, mysterious and beautiful indri.I had read as much as I possibly could about this extraordinary animal before I left Britain, and established that it is around 3ft tall, is coloured black or black-and-white and has huge hands, six times as long as they are broad.What intrigued me most was the resemblance it bore to ancient drawings of a creature known to early explorers as the ‘dog-headed man’ peculiar to the area. It was always depicted as standing upright, with a shaggy coat and enormous, human-like hands and feet. Its body was tail-less and proportioned like a human being’s, but with a face and a snout like a dog’s.Could the ‘dog-headed man’ be the indri?There were few eyewitness accounts — the one attempt to study it in captivity 20 years before had failed dismally. A group of indris sent to a Paris zoo all died within a month, the keepers having been unable to replicate their highly specialised diet of leaves.Now here we were, with the chance to see one for ourselves. To watch and film one would, for me, be a glittering prize well worth all the effort and anticipation.As Geoff and I followed Michel into the twilight of the rainforest, our spirits sank.This was the thickest bush we had encountered so far. Not only was it very dark, but the vegetation was so dense that unless we were lucky it would be impossible to get a filmable view of any creature more than a few feet away.But the forest was extremely rich in animal life. From a small stream nearby came the honk of frogs, while from overhead came a confused chorus of birdsong.As I stood trying to unravel this cacophony, the birdsong was suddenly drowned out by a chorus of spine-chilling, unearthly howls.          Indri (pictured), also called the babakoto, is the largest lemurs of Madagascar‘Babakoto,’ said Michel, triumphantly — the local word for the indri. The noise was deafening — and eerily like the sound of a crying human child. But nothing could have prepared me for the volume. Even a gang of the noisiest children could not have produced a tenth of these decibels.Desperately, we peered through the palisades of trunks and leafy curtains. But we could see nothing — not the tiniest patch of black fur, nor the flash of an eye.Then, as abruptly as the wailing had begun, it stopped and the crickets, frogs and parrots took over once again. We were jubilant — the indris were really here.‘Always they sing at the same time,’ said Michel. ‘They will be here again tomorrow. If they don’t sing, then call to them with their voice, and often they will reply.’We turned up the next day with all our equipment, and the next, and the next. But of the indris there was neither sight nor sound. Hour after hour we waited, doing our best to imitate their calls. But no reply came back from the trees. There seemed nothing else to do but be patient.After a week, I was beginning to lose faith in the possibility of ever seeing an indri. Had they moved on? We decided to try a different part of the bush.Our first foray provided almost immediately a minor success, albeit not the one we had anticipated. Looking down to see where I was putting my feet, I noticed I was about to step into the middle of a collection of shiny olive-green objects the size of golf balls.When I picked one up, a split opened on one side to reveal that it was in fact a huge insect with around 20 pairs of frantically waving legs. The creature straightened itself out, unfurled a pair of knobbly antennae and began walking determinedly up my arm.I identified it as one of a strange species of millipede and I was sure they would make a wonderful display in London Zoo’s insect house. We filled our pockets and took 100 or so back to the hotel.The millipedes were not our only acquisition. A few days later, the elderly forestry officer drew up at the hotel in his smart saloon car.He was on his way to a meeting, but en-route had met some men carrying a newly-caught tailless tenrec — a comical, spiny creature looking like a cross between a hedgehog and an anteater.Remembering us, he had given the men a few francs for the animal and, as he had no cage or sack handy, had put it loose in the boot of his car. It was, he said, extremely lively and ferocious.Mindful of this, we assembled gloves, sacks and an empty cage, and the forestry officer cautiously lifted the boot lid an inch. I peered inside but could see nothing.He widened the crack two inches, then, warning us to pounce swiftly, threw open the lid. Geoff and I lunged. But there was absolutely nothing upon which to pounce. The boot was empty!Gingerly we removed the tool-bag, the jack and the spare wheel. Again, nothing. As we wondered what to do next, we heard a scrabbling deep inside the chassis somewhere between the front and back mudguards.\u0027We didn’t know we were playing with the clothes of Dad’s...Share this articleBy this time we had drawn a crowd of curious onlookers, and there was no lack of helping hands when I suggested that unscrewing the panels lining the interior was the only way to reach our quarry.The invisible tenrec spurred us on by rattling about in his metallic cavern.The forestry officer was starting to weary of the sight of his car being dismantled, and proposed driving on to his meeting.I pointed out that this would be most unwise, as the poor creature would almost certainly die — and if it did the smell would make his car unusable for at least a week.A far better plan would be to shut the lid, join us for coffee and see if the tenrec would clamber out of its uncomfortable refuge in the chassis and return to the relative spaciousness of the boot.Two hours later, we quietly opened the lid again. The tenrec was sitting at the back nonchalantly washing himself. He was the size of a large guinea pig, with an absurdly long tapering nose, immense whiskers, beady eyes and enormous hindquarters.We pounced and seconds later he was in one of our travelling cages.By the time we got him back to London and handed him over to the Zoo he had grown tremendously, increasing in both girth and length. But he never lost his passion for trying to cram his paunchy body down even the smallest suspicion of a hole.My hotel room was now well stocked. Chameleons sat goggling at one another on the curtain rail. A frilled gecko hung upside down on a piece of bark in a cage next to the tenrec. The millipedes slumbered in a box in one corner and three boa constrictors occupied a slowly moving sack in the other.          David with cameraman Geoff MulliganEvery day we discovered fresh creatures to fascinate us: moths, beetles, snakes, lizards, black parrots, strange frogs — but we still had not found the indri.An Ornithologist friend had asked us to record the song of the Madagascan magpie robin — a sound he considered to be among the finest produced by any bird.Geoff and I made our first attempt one day soon after dawn. When we arrived we found one, a handsome cock bird, singing heartily. Quickly, I plugged in the microphone and aimed it at him.For several minutes the tape moved steadily. Then, suddenly, a deafening eerie wail pealed out from the trees beyond, so loud that the recorder needle thrashed against the stop pin of the dial and clung there shuddering. It was the indri. But this time it was louder and closer.Geoff snatched his camera and I frantically searched the trees, but we could see nothing. The calls stopped, and I caught a momentary glimpse of a body sailing through the air. The indri had gone. Once more, we had failed.‘Well,’ said Geoff as we trudged back for breakfast. ‘At least we have a recording to prove it does exist, and that once upon a time we were within a few yards of one.’Then I thought of a trick used by ornithologists to locate a bird they wish to study — playing a recording of its song to attract others. I didn’t have much confidence, but we had tried everything else.For the next few days we played Geoff’s recording in several parts of the forest with no luck. Then, one morning I was about to pack up when the sound of the tape was suddenly drowned out by a series of trumpeting hoots.They were unlike any animal sound I’d ever heard, and I couldn’t imagine what was making them.I looked up and saw one of the hooting creatures in a tree in a small dell nearby — a big, furry black-and-white lemur, sitting on a branch 30ft from the ground.His chest, forearms and legs below the knee were white and he appeared to have a black cape round his shoulders, a pure white cap and black socks and gloves.‘It’s a ruffed lemur,’ I whispered to Geoff. ‘We can get shots of them in Tananarive Zoo.’ Nonetheless, we started filming, for he was a most beautiful creature.Our tape recorder continued its indri wails. The lemur glared indignantly at us with bright yellow eyes. Once more he hooted his irritation, and another trumpeting sound came from a tree on the left. I turned and saw two more of the animals sitting with their necks craned forward, staring at us in puzzlement.The first one reached up and pulled himself upright on to the branch above. I made a mental note that his movements were not like those of other lemurs, which are all four-footed. Then, as the animal sat down once more, I blinked in surprise.‘Where’s he put his tail?’ I muttered. ‘He should have a very long, black one.’‘Perhaps it’s curled up between his legs,’ said Geoff.The animal raised a long hind leg and grasped the tree trunk. He did not have a tail. Stupidly, it took me a few seconds to reach the only possible conclusion. ‘Geoff,’ I said quietly, ‘that is an indri.’There was no doubt. There is only one tailless lemur. We were jubilant. We had found them — and Geoff had already shot a full 400ft of film.Cautiously, he moved nearer to get shots from a different angle, but it was too much for the indris. With a gigantic bound, the first one leapt away, springing from trunk to trunk so rapidly that he seemed to ricochet from one tree to the other. The other two followed and within seconds were out of sight.Before dawn we returned and there they were again, just as Michel had said they would be. Every day for a week we watched this little family: the big male, his mate and a younger pair, slowly getting to know their habits, routine and personalities.The old male was of a sedate disposition, often sitting on a branch with his back against the main trunk and his long legs outstretched in a comically human-like position. Although he could leap huge distances, he spent most of his time clambering happily from branch to branch in search of the most succulent young leaves.The two youngsters were an extremely affectionate couple, and spent hours each day caressing one another. The position they chose in which to practise their endearments, crouching on a high horizontal bough, seemed perilous, like a pair of circus acrobats nonchalantly enacting episodes of their daily lives on a high wire.The fourth member of the group, the older female, we seldom saw. Only after several days did we learn the reason for her reticence. Clinging to her back was small, black-faced baby with hairy ears and bright eyes, barely a foot long.He was an enchanting creature, sometimes riding on her back, sometimes clambering round to suckle. His mother behaved with endearing tenderness, licking him gently from time to time.Our detailed knowledge of the family’s daily routine made our task of filming them easy. We photographed them feeding, dozing and caressing one another, but one shot we lacked — we had not secured any good pictures of them leaping, for when they moved off they always jumped away from us.If we were to get the film we wanted before we left, we urgently needed a new approach.We knew the location of the tree where they sang at lunchtime, and that they moved to an area further away to sing in the late afternoon. To get from one to the other, the indris would have to cross one of the area’s few wide roads.Retracing their movements, we worked out that at only one place was the road narrow enough for them to leap comfortably across. A simple calculation was enough to show that they must make the crossing at between three and four o’clock in the afternoon.Accordingly, at half-past two, Geoff and I set up our cameras a little west of the trees we judged they would use for their leap.Prompt at half past three, the old male duly appeared in the take-off tree. The young couple joined him, then the mother and baby emerged from the forest behind to sit on one of the branches overhanging the road.As soon as they were assembled, the old male climbed leisurely to the most outstretched branch. Geoff began filming.The male poised himself, then made a single, soaring jump right across the road to the tree the other side. One by one the rest followed him and disappeared.Geoff switched off his camera, beaming. After weeks of hope and crushing disappointment, our film of the private life of the indris was complete at last.Were the creatures we had filmed really the origin of the dog-headed man? It was impossible to know. But of one thing I was certain. Of all the strange and wonderful creatures we had filmed in Madagascar, this was the rarest, the least documented and the most endearing.  Aware of the BBC’s team’s disappointment at not being permitted to catch any lemurs, the Madagascar Scientific Institute presented them with two ring-tails and a ruffed lemur from its own collection. Their descendants thrived at London Zoo for decades.The indri remains in critical danger of extinction, with a 2015 report revealing that no zoo has yet worked out the complexities of its diet, and that it is unable to breed in captivity.Adapted from Journeys To The Other Side Of The World: Further Adventures Of A Young Naturalist by Sir David Attenborough, published by Two Roads on September 6 at £25. © David Attenborough 2018.

I don’t ask my cover stars to do a blood analysis. \u0027What else is dangerous is we have a crisis about mental health and body image.

During the debate, Shameless and Brookside star Tina Malone (right), who lost 12 stone and 4 pounds, revealed she started missing out on work due to her weight loss\u0027She is representing to them an image that isn’t right.

They were once part of a migrating community of reindeer herders but today, in their old age, they spend most of their days in the village of Yar-Sale, cut off from their nomadic relatives and friends.Though the men are encouraged to stay within the wandering community as they grow older, the women often find themselves facing the struggles of ageing in isolation.Life in the village might seem more comfortable than life as a migrating elder in the wild tundra, but it comes at the cost of great loneliness and a loss of purpose. In the past, each woman held an essential role in her community. Pudani, for example, was a leading herder, while Liliya was the only person in her tribe who knew how to read. Over many cups of tea, these women shared their life stories. They told me about magical snowy landscapes, lost parents and partners.  I asked each woman for permission to take their portrait in the natural light of their homes and wearing a precious item from their past. Using their stories as a guide, I also documented the wild landscapes they once wandered.Autipana Audi (born 1941). During her lifetime, Autipana experienced many sad losses. She lost her husband, son and daughter to diseases, and a few years ago her entire reindeer herd perished to starvation during a cold wave. Almost unable to walk, she spends her days mostly limited to her bed. Autipana, who was born in the tundra, says that “walking in the snow” is what she longs for most.Necla Audi (born 1928). Although Necla was 89 when this portrait was taken, she still wishes to live with the migrating community. “I was born in the tundra and spent all my life there, it’s the only way of living I know.” At the far left of her bed is a picture of her two sons taken when they were young. Now, both of them are herders in the tundra.Angelina Serotetto (born 1942). Angelina was part of a family of shaman women and her mother taught her to read the future using sacred objects from nature. “Yes! I miss those days in the past,” she says. “But I try to remain optimistic. I view everything with a loving eye. I think you learn it as you get older”. Vaynoto Vera (born 1967). Having living in nature throughout her entire life, Vaynoto’s daughters rented her a small apartment in the village of Yar-Sale so that she could live in comfort. They come to visit her whenever possible but as they are obliged to return to their herds and migrating journeys, Vaynoto is often left alone.Zinaida Evay (born 1946) and her cat Persik (“peach” in Russian). Zinaida was married for many years, and she shared with me that she had a beautiful and loving bond with her husband, right to his last day. Now that he has passed away she is living in a small apartment alone, with their mutual cats, with almost no friends to come and visit. “All that is left are the lullabies I sing to myself.” Liliya Yamkina (born 1944). As a child she was the only one in her clan who knew how to read. She said she still remembers how important she felt when she read everyone their letters and formal documents. However, the importance of her reading skills to the clan was also the reason that her father prevented her from going to college and that caused many conflicts between them. Now, in her apartment, she writes love songs about the Tundra and her dream is to publish them in a magazine. “I did not fully understand the importance of tradition and family when I was young. I argued so much with my parents. I wanted to escape from my roots.” But, she adds: “I remember how much I liked it when they told me folk tales around the bonfire. I miss them so much.”Pudani Audi (born 1948). Like her ancestors who have wandered the frozen landscape of northern Siberia for thousands of years, Pudani was born in the tundra and roamed since birth. During her adulthood, she was a leading herder, leading the precious herd through one of the most extreme environments on earth. She told me that she is still hoping to return to wander, but without her community’s support it is clear that this longing will never be realised. In this portrait, she is wearing a fur hat, the sole object she was left with from her wandering days."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a57a5332af7526044b1e575fabb53fbed34f9fd6/0_0_5161_3478/master/5161.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=af172702cd0000e4e97b04e013d8d176","title":"mark carney to face mps questions over future at bank of england","story":"Treasury committee to address speculation governor could stay through Brexit processMark Carney will face questions from MPs over his future at the Bank of England on Tuesday amid mounting speculation he could extend his stay as governor in order to guide the British economy through Brexit.Carney is expected to answer questions on Tuesday afternoon over his future when facing MPs on the House of Commons Treasury committee, which is tasked with scrutinising appointments at the central bank. Several members of the committee have told the  that keeping the governor – who is due to leave in June next year – would help smooth Britain’s departure from the EU on 29 March.“Carney has done a very good job in what, in many cases, have been very difficult economic circumstances. There would be a lot of merit in the chancellor asking him to extend his term should that be the decision the chancellor were to take,” he added.However, Downing Street played down reports on Monday, suggesting Carney could stay until 2020, saying it was still the plan for him to leave in 2019 after six years in charge at the central bank.Speaking to reporters after the BBC said the Treasury was in talks with Carney over extending his contract, Theresa May’s spokesman said: “He has said he is stepping down in June 2019. The Treasury have said we’ll start recruiting for a new governor. And that is the plan.”Asked if Carney had done a good job at Threadneedle Street and should therefore be kept for longer than planned, the spokesman added: “The prime minister thinks the governor has done a good job.” The Queen appoints the Bank of England governor, but on the recommendation of the prime minister and the Treasury, which will lead the recruitment process under Philip Hammond.Carney has also attracted the ire of leading Brexiters, including Jacob Rees-Mogg, for his repeated warnings over the economic consequences of Brexit. Carney has said the chance of a no-deal Brexit is uncomfortably high and would be highly undesirable.Investors in the City of London have however responded favourably to the idea of the governor remaining in his post, arguing it would help remove an additional layer of uncertainty about Britain’s economic policy after leaving the EU. They have also praised Carney’s ability to calm financial markets, which could be rocked by the UK crashing out without a deal.Colin Jackson, an analyst at the stockbroker Goodbody, said extending his term would be welcome. “It removes an element of uncertainty over the effectiveness of the Bank of England to implement appropriate policy in a post-Brexit world, while it would also reduce the headache faced by the Treasury as it fights for a soft Brexit within the UK government,” he said.Speculation over Carney’s future first arose after a report in the diary pages of the London Evening Standard last week, suggesting the Treasury was struggling to find an appropriate replacement and had asked him to stay. Officials said last week they “did not recognise the reporting” by the newspaper.Although the diary pages are usually reserved for gossip from around London and Westminster, the newspaper is edited by the former chancellor, George Osborne, who was responsible for hiring Carney in November 2012.The Bank of England declined to comment. A spokeswoman for the Treasury said: “There is no update from us on governor recruitment plans, we will announce details in due course.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/42482b2e33e8eb38e05c95fb9e7b5dd812232645/0_128_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4eb9c06347f5c9f869e5fa5a4090a5ea","title":"tsbs apologises another online services disruption","story":"Customers report problems logging in to accounts again, following massive April outage TSB has apologised again to its customers after its online banking services were disrupted on Monday, locking thousands of customers out of their accounts.The bank has not revealed how many customers were affected but admit a proportion of the 1.9 million customers who use its digital banking services experienced problems.Customers trying to log in on Monday morning reported they were denied access for using the “wrong” login and password details, even though they knew they were correct.

After a year in which the government has played down the chances of the UK leaving the EU with no agreement even on withdrawal issues, no deal is back with a bang. It was perhaps inevitable that, as the Brexit endgame approached, people were bound to start thinking again about the implications of the whole thing ending in a car crash, with no deal signed between the UK and the European Union.And so we at The UK in a Changing Europe decided to revisit the report we did on this subject more than a year ago. After all, for all the sound and fury of the Brexit debate, it has become predictable. Oozing from the pages of the government’s technical reports on no deal was the perceived need to placate Brexiters by signalling that “no deal” preparations were being made, while simultaneously underlining the problems such an outcome would entail. Reactions were equally predictable. Remainers emphasised what they saw as the lunacy of a no-deal outcome, while leavers settled back on tried-and-tested claims about “project fear”. Time, we thought, for an impartial assessment.Our conclusions are every bit as grim – if not more so – than they were first time round. In sectors ranging from air transport to agriculture and fisheries, the impact of no deal would be profound and overwhelmingly negative. The absence of any clear legal framework to regulate the UK’s commercial and other relations with the EU and numerous other parts of the world will wreak havoc on trade. And the rights and status of millions of our fellow citizens in the UK and in the EU will be put in doubt.Happily, we do not see a no-deal outcome as the most likely one. Clearly, there are still significant hurdles to be cleared in the negotiations. And it is far from a foregone conclusion that a parliamentary majority can be cobbled together for whatever deal is arrived at. Yet both sides have a vested interest in securing a deal – or at least postponing the day of reckoning – and, let’s face it, the eleventh hour is when the EU tends to strike its agreements.What has been perhaps most striking as the no-deal debate cranks back into action has been the profound lack of understanding that continues to mark the conversation. For one thing, the analogy of a “deal” has itself proved to be profoundly misleading. In virtually all social and commercial situations where deals are the order of the day, “no deal” simply implies the status quo ante. Take a simple example. If I drive my car to the garage, determined to secure a deal on a new one, the worst that could happen is that I fail and take my old banger home again.With Brexit, this is simply not the case. No deal does not mean we return to the world as it was prior to the negotiations. It means a whole raft of rules that regulate our commerce with the EU (and, via it, with many other parts of the world) will simply cease to apply. It’s almost as if my old car died on the way back from the garage.Some people counter such claims with the idea that, in the absence of an overall Brexit agreement, inidual deals with the EU might keep the wheels on the wagon. This assumption too shines out from the pages of the government’s technical reports. Yet consider how such an outcome might come about. A collapse in the negotiations would doubtless lead to bitterness and mutual recrimination. We can already see how some politicians are preparing to blame the EU for a damaging outcome. As for the union itself, no deal would mean that those “withdrawal” issues it had prioritised from the start – the Brexit bill, citizens’ rights and the Irish border – were left unresolved. Why should Brussels start negotiating ways of mitigating the impact of no deal before a satisfactory resolution of these issues?This is why we have focused our analysis on what we have termed a “chaotic Brexit”: a no-deal situation where few if any mitigating deals have been struck with Brussels. This would be the reality of no deal. Whatever the merits of trading on World Trade Organisation terms (and they are overstated by Brexiters) over the longer term, our report makes clear that the WTO provides little or no shield against short-term disruption. The issues would be about day-to-day trading arrangements, about access to supplies of everything from blood to nuclear isotopes, to the components needed for a variety of manufacturing processes.This is the reality of no deal. Not a glorious trading future under whatever rules we choose to adopt. But uncertainty and strained relations with our largest trading partner. Politics sometimes generates outcomes no one wanted. In this case, politicians would be well advised to prevent it doing so.• Anand Menon is director of The UK in a Changing Europe and professor of European politics and foreign affairs King’s College London"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0f174b7869d79c49ac360d8bfdf7c85b772a0a87/0_0_2560_1707/master/2560.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=af064f6be1afef056469322ee90e008a 1400w","title":"sunset review laszlo nemes","story":"Son of Saul director László Nemes deftly conjures the death throes of the Austro-Hungarian empire in an atmospheric mystery dramaLászló Nemes, Hungarian director of the Oscar-winning Holocaust tragedy Son of Saul, now comes to Venice with this lucid nightmare of a film about pre-first-world-war Budapest. It’s a very mysterious and even bizarre film in many ways, shot in what is becoming Nemes’ signature style: long takes, a persistent closeup on the lead character’s face, and a shallow focus that allows the surrounding reality to intrude only intermittently. The dialogue is often spoken in a subdued murmur, as if each speaker is in possession of a secret.Sunset is an occult mystery drama about the fin-de-siècle anxieties of the dying Austro-Hungarian empire. It takes place in Budapest in 1913, with a distinctly disturbing coda in the wartime trenches, a setting that is itself ambiguously real or imagined. All the fears and premonitions of war and the violent overturning of an old order are projected on to an elegant hat store in the city. There is disorder in the air the film has something of Conrad’s The Secret Agent and also, in one scene concerning a fortune teller, Eliot’s The Waste Land. I also found myself thinking of the Jonass \u0026amp Co department store in 1920s Berlin, whose Jewish owners were evicted in 1933 after which the building was the official premises of the Nazis, and subsequently used by the East German communists after the war. (It is now the premises of the Soho House Berlin members’ club.)Juli Jakab plays Irisz Leiter, a beautiful, intense but haunted young woman (with a faint look of Emma Watson) who has come to Budapest with the intention of applying for a job as a milliner at the celebrated Leiter store, founded by her late parents. They died in a fire on the premises after which the store was rebuilt and re-established as a lucrative concern, keeping the brand name of Leiter by a sleek businessman, Oszkár Brill, played by Vlad Ivanov.The catastrophe that killed her mother and father happened when she was two, after which she was placed with a family in Vienna, where she has been working with a milliner. But now Irisz has returned, on a mission to find the truth about her brother, whose existence in Budapest is a shadowy and terrifying rumour. He is thought to have caused the fire himself, to have made an attempt on the life of Brill and murdered a certain count whose wealthy but disturbed and drug-addicted widow now hosts fashionable musical soirees for the cream of society.A coachman called Gaspar (Levente Molnár) knows where Irisz’s brother may be found: he is now involved with a criminal gang of robbers who have what could be anarcho-nationalist or separatist leanings, resenting the haughty German-speaking royalty from Vienna. And the awful truth is that Brill continues to cultivate a special relationship with this alien ruling class. It is not simply that the royals are the most prestigious hat-buying customers Brill maintains a stable of beautiful young women as his milliners, the most favoured of whom will be selected as an employee of the royals, perhaps as a kind of lady-in-waiting, although Nemes’ drama suggests something more sordid or obscurely sacrificial than even this. As someone says to Irisz about the Leiter hats: “The horror of the world hides beneath these infinitely pretty things.” Irisz and Nemes’ camera move through the city and through the drama as if in a dream. The film does not have the traditional structure and variation of pace that might accompany a conventional drama about a woman – or indeed a man – progressively discovering the truth. Irisz and her brother are maybe not so very far from Holly Martins and Harry Lime in The Third Man.Nemes shoots the city in bleached-out colours, a kind of sepia style, and Budapest is brought to life as if in one of the picture postcards of the era. There are some wonderful set pieces, particularly a little party that Brill puts on in a park to advertise the store, complete with hot-air balloon. But beneath this outward display of celebratory prosperity there is something dark, fetishistic and mad: a premonition of tyranny and war. An entirely absorbing film."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ef19eff78953aec43cfa5e886dc14a25b66a7746/0_267_2712_1628/master/2712.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2fdc87865db62b545657dc6c3d360a56","title":"rachel roddy recipe italian rice salad","story":"This summer stalwart is studded with a selection of pickled vegetables, tender beans and tuna for a velvety but sharp dishPunto Simply, the small supermarket on the corner of Piazza Testaccio and Via Bodoni, is a peculiar shape. It has several interconnecting rooms made maze-like by the arrangement of narrow aisles and shelves stacked so snugly that you often have to wriggle items out in a sort of supermarket Jenga. It is air-conditioned, but not aggressively – or not enough to smother the ripe, insistent scent of the loose fruit and vegetables in baskets in the corner behind the cereal shelf. The deli counter just off to the left is even fuller than the shelves. Decked with strings of salami bunting, it is as much fairground as supermarket, with pink rounds of cured pork, domes of soft white cheese, Russian salad, olives, tomatoes, prawns and fish-sticks under oil and, next to that, multipacks of mini Campari sodas and aperitivo snacks.The layout and smells, the pop of the strip lighting, the familiar things – frozen peas, tea, caster sugar – made unfamiliar by another language ... it is all these things. The same things I felt aged 12, drinking Portokalada orangeade in an Athenian supermarket. It is also the Italian allocation of space to everyday items that still, after more than 13 years in Rome, feels foreign to my eyes: the 19 varieties of breakfast toasts, five sorts of cherry jam, a wall of pasta shapes and almost the same of tomatoes, and an entire section of vegetables – artichokes, peppers, mushrooms, aubergines – preserved in vinegar – sott’aceto or in olive oil – sott’olio including a ready-mix for rice salad called Condiriso – a diced assortment of pickled carrots, peas, peppers, olives and artichokes.From June to September there is usually an offer on Condiriso, which, according to family and friends, became popular in the 60s, along with Vereco glassware and Adriano Celentano, and has remained a standard for many ever since.In her 1969 step-by-step guide to antipasti e salse, Lisa Biondi has six versions of insalata di riso, including flamenco – with chorizo and omelette, del buongustaio – with salted tongue and fontina cheese, and saporita – with asparagus tips and mayonnaise. According to a column in La Cucina Italiana magazine from about the same time, insalata di riso is a summer classic, which should be ben colorata e fantasiosa and, although open to improvisation, is particularly good with egg, tuna, prosciutto, cheese, peas and – essential – pickled vegetables. My partner’s uncle – a retired chef, who these days would rather be on the beach reading thrillers than simmering rice – says two things are important: that the proportions of rice to other ingredients are 5050 and that everything is mixed together while the rice is still warm.Like pasta, prawn cocktail, egg mayonnaise and other popular food, rice salad is ripe for prejudice and snobbishness, which is a shame. Like everything, it can be terrible, especially if it isn’t dense with things you like and dressed properly – a dry, fragmented salad is hard work and no fun. It can also be good, and not some gesture of ironic retro chic, but a real pleasure to make and eat. Alongside the cooked long-grain rice (80g dry weight per person), my main components, measured by eye, are tuna, white or borlotti beans (tinned as they are reliably tender), anchovy fillets snipped into bits with scissors, capers, olives, vinegary red peppers from a jar, and finely sliced red onion, soaked in half waterhalf red-wine vinegar for 20 minutes, which takes away the eyewatering pungency and gives a nice, vinegary\u0026nbsprasp.“More is more” is apt here. If the tuna and vegetables do not provide enough olive oil, add more until you have a united tumble. Black pepper is essential, as is lemon juice and quartered, hard-boiled eggs on top. The effect should be as colourful, busy and as good as the deli counter at Punto Simply."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/21d38d4ca418c736afdca02ad28eb1233ab2224c/134_252_5074_3045/master/5074.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4fb97b62ea7095ed3ee251bdc5f4406c","title":"we are fed up of being patronised readers on energy drinks for children","story":"With the announcement that the government will ban the sale of energy drinks to children in England we asked you to share your viewsOverstimulation in the classroom has, in my anecdotal experience, as much impact on a young person’s education as missing school completely which is why I think they should be banned. Regularly, I will have pupils enter my classroom at 8.30am drinking high-caffeine, cheap-to-buy energy drinks. These pupils are unfocused, disruptive and unable to keep still. It’s such a shame that profits are put above the interests of our health, especially where children are concerned. Moreover, I believe schools across the country should do more to educate pupils about the impact of unhealthy food and drink products. This would hopefully create an informed generation that will not reach for the Red Bull and packet of crisps on their way to school in the morning.Children, especially in the classroom, who have consumed energy drinks are harder to educate and create additional concerns for staff to consider, such as the pupil’s wellbeing and ability to keep themselves focused. I drank energy drinks a handful of times when I was a teenager and found them to increase my self-awareness and overstimulate any sense of anxiety I had at the time. Safe to say, I have not touched them in years.Young people should be educated on risks not banned from buying things like energy drinks. We are fed up of being patronised because older people think we can\u0027t understand things. I have very few concerns about energy drinks. I don\u0027t drink them because I don’t think they taste nice, but I know those who do. They may do some harm but so does pretty much anything. Life can\u0027t be wrapped in cotton wool.I think teenagers should be banned from buying energy drinks, because as a parent of an ADHDASD teenager and a governor of a special needs school, I know how hard it is to get children to sit down and concentrate and the effects high sugar consumption has on this. I often see teenagers drinking energy drinks on the way to school – I suspect as a substitute for breakfast. The sugar and caffeine is not only inidually very unhealthy but I suspect contributes significantly to wider classroom disruption and a lack of concentration at school - a nightmare for teachers to deal with. I also suspect there is a strong socio-economic component to this problem with the effects of these products having a stronger negative impact on those from less educated backgrounds. We see the effects a bad diet has on the children in the school where I am a governor. As a result of which they are given breakfast before school so that a bad diet is not adding to their challenges in the classroom.I think young people need to have the option to freely try life out for themselves to learn from it. Banning anything doesn’t help. I have no particular concerns about energy drinks. I only bought one as a 14-year-old teenager and can\u0027t really understand why anybody would buy them as they taste awful. I speak about any nutrition and drugs with my children and they learn about it in school as well. Banning or taxing sugar is for those who can\u0027t buy high quality food and have to focus on buying high-nutritiousness foods for the little money they have. It would make more sense to give those more money and time to spend on food and encourage them to think about what they buy rather than banning or taxing items.For years we have battled to teach a huge number of students who turn up to school having consumed enough of these drinks to already be unable to concentrate beyond 10 seconds. My concerns about energy drinks i.e. sugar content, its contribution towards poor concentration, poor nutrition and obesity are now agreed upon by the government. Now we can start helping students achieve their potential. A massive hurrah!While I absolutely agree that excessive consumption of energy drinks is a problem I do not think a ban is the right solution. It is same with the ‘sugar tax’. Why does the UK think the solution to every problem is either a ban or a tax? Do alcohol, cigarettes or narcotic laws really prevent teenagers from using or abusing them? Shouldn\u0027t we take a more proactive approach and educate both parents and kids about safe use of any products available? Not to mention the fact that teenagers might use energy drinks to self-medicate from a variety of conditions like ADHD, for example, due tonot being able to get the necessary medication or diagnosis. Instead of banning we should understand the cause of excessive use and target that. Maybe kids use them because they do not get enough sleep, or maybe they need to stay up at night to study, or after stressful week use them to stay up to have a night out. Whatever the cause is this is what should be addressed rather than trying to enforce a silly ban and thinking this will solve the problem.My concern with energy drinks is their taste. While it is highly unlikely that anyone would consume five coffees with a lot of sugar in one sitting it is very easy to drink many energy drinks as you do not taste the caffeine. I do not agree that they really cause any specific behavioural problems, as such, since caffeine is only a mild stimulant and its main mechanism of action is on adenosine receptors which mostly makes you more alert. I tend to use energy drinks when I need to stay up at night however they have little to no effect on me. I think they tend to be popular because of the assumed effect they have - like being able to stay awake all night either to study or party. On top of that I think they are often mixed with alcohol which is already not available to teenagers.There\u0027s no real reason for young teenagers to need energy drinks which is why I think they should be banned. They\u0027re simply seen as something cool to drink when you\u0027re too young for alcohol to be appealing. I remember they were extremely popular when I was 11-15. They taste very unnatural and sickly sweet and make you very hyperactive. Consumption of large amounts of caffeine can be very harmful. There\u0027s nothing to stop you from drinking multiple energy drinks one after the other and consuming insane amounts of caffeine, whereas with coffee the strong taste prevents most people from wanting to drink as much."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7564b9c4e586f956a273152ff2814e79fe185e0a/0_217_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0d85080f192bc1850031f0b2033ba463","title":"daniel levy frustration spurs new stadium wembley","story":"• Stadium delays are ‘disappointing, costly and frustrating’• Spurs’ Champions League group games will be at WembleyDaniel Levy has described the delay in opening Tottenham’s new stadium as “disappointing, costly and frustrating” as the club announced details of more fixtures to be played at Wembley.Spurs will host Manchester City in the Premier League at the national stadium on Monday 29 October, a day later than planned because Wembley is hosting an NFL match on the Sunday.

The following night 53,451 people would fill Real Betis’s stadium with noise but for now it was quiet. “So,” Quique Setién asked, “what do you think? How do you feel?” Joaquín Sánchez looked at him and said he didn’t know still not quite right. He knew better than anyone that this was the game – nobody’s played more of them – but a calf injury meant he was yet to appear this season and he wasn’t convinced. Setién was. What about 15, 20 minutes towards the end, he asked. No need to run back, just find a way through. Ok, Joaquín said. And so it was done.It was still 0-0, Sevilla had just gone down to 10 men, Roque Mesa sent off with a second yellow card for the terrible crime of being attacked by Pau López, and the clock showed 69.49 when Joaquín set off up the touchline to warm up 73.56 when he came on to replace William Carvalho and 79.18 when he got his first touch. Dashing into the area, he headed in Aïssa Mandi’s superb cross from a couple of yards. “Bish, bosh, in,” he grinned: five minutes, one touch, and all lunacy was let loose, the derby won. Racing to the corner, Joaquín tore off his shirt, team-mates piling on. At full-time, victory secured, leapt into the arms of Setién. “It was a miracle we didn’t kiss,” he said. “We were emotional,” Setién said. “Levitating,” declared Diario de Sevilla.None better than Sevilla. “Win the derby and everything will change,” Inui said, and Betis flew at their opponents. Canales sent one in towards Loren at the near post Inui produced a lovely nutmeg and a less lovely shot Andrés Guardado slipped in and drew a save Carvalho put Loren through. All inside 13 minutes. Betis, though, hadn’t scored, and familiar fears resurfaced. When Canales did, it was ruled out for offside, and by the time Joaquín was sent on, they still hadn’t got the goal: for all their play, for all the possession, they were approaching 260 minutes without scoring. Sevilla, meanwhile, had made chances of their own – Pablo Sarabia and André Silva drew saves in the first half – and the supply of opportunities had slowed. So, in the heat, had the game.Then Mesa was sent off for a second yellow. As he walked, Betis’s fans chanted “Stupid! Stupid!” at him and maybe it wasn’t that wise, but the decision was still baffling. He had drifted towards but not directly into the path of Pau as the Betis goalkeeper looked to throw the ball out quickly. Seeing him, Pau leapt sideways, crashing into the back of him, forearm first. “A picture is worth a thousand words,” said Pablo Machín. “It was an agresión, a red card, a penalty. Instead, Roque got a second yellow. He’s indignant. It wouldn’t be the first time a player said something that wasn’t entirely true but I’ve seen the footage now and it happened exactly as he said. The VAR’s supposed to be there to impart justice. I’ll have to go back to school so they can explain it to me. They denied us the chance to win. If that’s what the VAR is for, they might as well do if from the bar, drinking a few beers.”At the end of the press conference, Machín apologised: “I didn’t want to come here and talk about this, but it conditioned the game so much,” he said. “We had reached that point in the game, were in our best moment, still in it, and we were preparing fresh players – that was our plan but we couldn’t apply it.”Instead, it was Betis who did. “It had to be him,” AS said: everyone’s favourite cheeky scamp, Betis fan, youth teamer, captain, shareholder, and match-winner. “Joaquín is eternal,” AS insisted, calling this “Joaquín’s derby.” “Joaquín smiles, Betis smile,” El Mundo said. And it’s not just that: for all the one-liners, the giggles, the silliness, and the chicken hypnosis, with Joaquín it’s not all jokes. It’s not being funny that keeps him in football it’s not even the symbolism: “He’s a genius, a grande,” one member of the coaching staff says, and far cleverer, more responsible and serious than people realise.Not so long ago, few would have expected him to get this. At 37 years and 43 days, Joaquín is the oldest player to score in the Seville derby this century and the oldest to have ever scored in any Andalucían derby. No one has scored in more Spanish seasons but the last time he got a goal in the derby was 16 years ago. It is 18 years now since he made his debut, against Compostela in the second ision. He was away for nine years but this was his 20th derby, equalling the record. And when he tore off his shirt and pouted, his tongue was wedged in his cheek, but the physique was striking: he is leaner, more muscular now than he was then.He is enjoying it more than ever too, embracing every moment, clinging to it. At one end, a banner declared, “whenever you feel weak, look at our badge: the most beautiful thing in the world” high at the other, Sevilla’s fans replied: “Look at ours and tremble.” For a decade of so, they might have done, but no more. Betis won 5-3 at Sevilla last season, and drew at home, and now this: three without defeat, a first win since 2006. “All those years we’ve waited a long time. We face them as equals now, and that feels different,” Joaquín said afterwards.Standing there after the game, still in his kit and Betis flip flops, a No 17 drawn on the front, he grinned. “I dreamed of this lots of times. No lie: me scoring the winning goal against the eternal rival, at home. I have no words to express the happiness I feel. When I see them singing my name, the affection they give me, I know I can leave football a happy man.” • Twenty-thousand hats, 50,000 bottles of water, and four goals.

Goalkeeper Rui Patrício joined Wolves for free and Lille snapped up promising forward Rafael Leão. After years of Premier League interest, William Carvalho has also moved on – but Real Betis were the surprise name at the head of the queue. The Seville side have spent well this summer, signing Japan winger Takashi Inui for free and loaning Giovani Lo Celso from PSG. Carvalho, an accomplished box-to-box midfielder signed for less than £15m, may be the pick of the bunch.The going rate for a talented young goalkeeper has skyrocketed. Manchester City, Chelsea and Liverpool have collectively paid out more than £150m for three keepers under the age of 25, and if Gianluigi Donnarumma leaves Milan, he will surely become the first £100m keeper. According to a CIES report, Donnarumma is the best under-20 player in the world – the man in second is another goalkeeper, Alban Lafont. Starting out as an attacking midfielder for his youth team before switching to nets, the former Toulouse keeper made his Ligue 1 debut at just 16. Blessed with raw talent and the right temperament, Lafont could soon be worth 10 times what Fiorentina paid this summer.Paris Saint-Germain have had to rein in their spending after last summer’s purchases of Neymar and Kylian Mbappé and they may have grabbed a deadline-day bargain in Juan Bernat. The left-back can also play in midfield and central defence, and has wide, varied experience for a 25-year-old. The Spaniard will provide cover for Layvin Kurzawa, who may need surgery to resolve a persistent back problem. Bernat’s Champions League experience could also help the team overcome their struggles in Europe.It was a mixed summer for Monchi, the Roma sporting director – Javier Pastore and Steven Nzonzi arrived for less than £25m each, but the club were left red-faced by the failed move for Malcom. The shrewdest signing of all may have been Olsen. Sweden’s No1 did well at the World Cup and has Champions League experience with Copenhagen and Malmö. Olsen has big gloves to fill after Alisson’s departure but he should be a safe pair of hands, secured at just over a tenth of the Brazilian’s £65m fee.Moutinho heading to Molineux for just £5m was one of the summer’s biggest surprises – although Jorge Mendes’ ties with player and club tempered the shock somewhat. The midfielder may be a proven winner – he has won titles in two countries, a European trophy and Euro 2016 with Portugal – but small, skilful playmakers the wrong side of 30 are not a guaranteed hit in England. Moutinho has adjusted quickly, forming an instant understanding with compatriot Rúben Neves at the heart of Nuno Espírito Santo’s team.Southampton were desperately short on firepower last season – Charlie Austin top-scored with seven – but an injury-prone forward lacking match fitness did not appear an obvious solution. It’s early days, but Winchester-born Ings looks a perfect fit, scoring twice and bringing a new tenacity to Mark Hughes’ front line. The fee payable next summer isn’t cheap, but if Ings keeps his team up, Hughes will happily hand it over.Dortmund had a curious transfer window under new head coach Lucien Favre. Young talent arrived in the form of defenders Abdou Diallo and Achraf Hakimi, but Favre went for midfield experience with Axel Witsel and Thomas Delaney. Their best recruit may be up front, where they have rescued Alcácer from his purgatory at Barcelona. Now 25, the Spanish forward was hot property at Valencia before his move to Camp Nou, and could make the difference in a competitive Champions League group.Schalke saw two of their best players, Leon Goretzka and Max Meyer, leave for nothing this summer with Goretzka joining Bayern. Domenico Tedesco has brought in seven players for £46m, including Bayern midfielder Sebastian Rudy, as the team returns to the Champions League. Most intriguing is 20-year-old Morocco left-back Mendyl, wanted by a number of Premier League clubs but swayed by Tedesco’s reputation for developing young players. Do not be surprised if Bayern come calling next summer.Rafa Benítez has become accustomed to scouring the market for bargains, and may have found his best yet in the Swiss centre-back. Schär has played in La Liga, the Bundesliga, the Champions League, two World Cups and Euro 2016 – and he’s still just 26. Alongside fellow newcomer Federico Fernández, Schar brings a wealth of experience to a defence that was the Premier League’s seventh-best last season. He is worth much more than the £3m release clause Newcastle paid after Deportivo’s relegation.Capped by two different countries, Ghoddos was a key member of Graham Potter’s Östersund side and will pose a versatile danger to Ligue 1 defences. Born in Malmö and developed in Sweden’s lower leagues, Ghoddos has experience as a striker, winger, playmaker and central midfielder. The 24-year-old scored 41 goals in 93 appearances under Potter and set up 25 goals, including two in the Europa League win at the Emirates. That led to a Sweden call up before Ghoddos opted to play for Iran, featuring in all three of their World Cup games this summer."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/81dcf15c4d06ee7c6d5eb2b47f451c03b4441bbb/0_0_4623_2774/master/4623.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a7538a0e13bef8ac84b6ac89ad566563","title":"seven ways to help avoid dementia","story":"One in 14 people over the age of 65 in the UK will develop dementia and while there is no cure, scientific evidence shows there are several ways you can guard against it Among the biggest risk factors for dementia are diabetes and mid-life obesity, which can double your chances of dementia at a later age. Links have also been found between elevated blood pressure, high cholesterol levels and the risk of dementia, although these are not conclusive. Monitoring your weight and cardiovascular health in middle age could greatly reduce your likelihood of dementia.The brain may be affected by the long-term consequences of heavy smoking. Scientists have found smoking to increase the risk of cognitive decline in old age, with one study showing that middle-aged people who smoked more than two packs a day more than doubled their risk of later-life dementia.Numerous studies have shown that regular, vigorous physical activity - and in some cases, even mild exercise such as walking - can preserve your faculties in later life. Staying active is particularly important for the elderly, with studies finding that older iniduals who began a regular exercise programme experienced improved cognitive function. However, younger people should avoid sports where they are prone to repeated head traumas, such as boxing or even football. There is growing evidence that even moderate traumas increase the risk of developing certain forms of dementia.People with more years of school and university education are known to have a lower risk of dementia, but there is evidence that everyone can reduce their risk of dementia through trying new things as they get older. Taking up new hobbies, learning new skills and partaking in a daily intellectual activity such as doing crossword puzzles are all thought to have neuroprotective effects.Maintaining social activities as you get older, such as going to clubs or volunteering, has been found to have a protective effect against dementia. Studies have shown that iniduals who maintain a larger social network into old age tend to have better cognitive functions and a reduced risk of cognitive decline.Scientists are still not completely clear on how various nutrients, vitamins and food groups affect your risk of dementia. However, there have been a few studies focusing on the Mediterranean diet – which consists of small amounts of meat, and an emphasis on whole grains, fruits, vegetables, fish, nuts and olive oil – that suggest it can reduce risk of dementia, possibly by preventing high blood pressure.Sleep disturbances, for example chronic insomnia, have been linked to increased risk for cognitive decline in later life. Taking steps to deal with any sleep problems could reduce your chances of getting dementia. However scientists still don’t understand exactly how disturbed sleep may contribute to the condition, and whether certain dysfunctional sleep patterns pose more of a risk than others."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e2a405dc37b48d89fba33af88aa78c5105f59060/0_0_4800_3200/master/4800.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c15756755c96a8b1d96235f03e16fffa 720w","title":"aping each other how similar are humans and orangutans","story":"From umbrella-making to learning how to self-medicate, we share plenty of skills with our fellow great apesWhen scientists talk about animals using tools, they’re not normally talking about the implements you might use to knock up some shelves. But while animals generally confine themselves to bashing things with the odd rock, in extraordinary footage broadcast last year as part of the BBC’s Spy in the Wild series, a wild female orangutan is seen using a saw she has found outside a hut to cut through a log – even pausing to blow away sawdust before continuing.In the wild, orangutans use large sticks to get at honey inside logs, shelter from the rain by fashioning umbrellas out of leaves and hold bunches of leaves in front of their mouths to lower the pitch of their calls to scare off predators. Captive orangutans have been taught to use hammers, screwdrivers and keys.Researchers have even shown that orangutans learn and generate new sounds – an ability until recently considered largely the preserve of humans. The ability to consciously vibrate twin bands of muscle tissue in the larynx called vocal folds – important in generating many new sounds – was thought to have evolved after we erged from chimpanzees, our closest great ape relatives, some 5-7m years ago.Then, an international team of researchers caught wind of reports of a male orangutan called Rocky using sounds reminiscent of the plaintive groans made by Chewbacca, of Star Wars fame, to attract the attention of his keepers at Indianapolis Zoo. In a study published in 2016, the group compared Rocky’s call to other known orangutan sounds and found it to be novel.They then taught him to imitate a human who was making versions of his call at different pitches. “This shows the ability to change the frequency of calls through control of the vocal folds was likely to have predated the last common ancestor of humans and orangutans,” says Prof Serge Wich, of Liverpool John Moores University, one of the study’s authors.Orangutans have also been shown to have human-like, long-term memories. In 2009, Danish scientists showed a group of orangutans and chimps how to retrieve a piece of banana by reaching through a slot with the longer of two sticks, and then hid the sticks in boxes in nearby rooms. Three years later, all bar one of the orangutans knew what to do to get the food in the same set-up.Just as the list of tool-using animals has grown in recent years, so too has the list of those that use plants as medicine. Lizards eat certain roots to counter snake venom, macaws consume clay to aid digestion as well as to gain minerals, and pregnant lemurs nibble tamarind and fig leaves to boost milk production. Orangutans are among a smaller group of primates that self-medicate by rubbing substances into their fur.Behavioural ecologist Helen Morrogh-Bernard, of Exeter University, and co-director of the Borneo Nature Foundation, last year reported observing child-bearing female orangutans chewing the leaves of the shrub Dracaena cantleyi to form a soapy foam that they then rub into their upper arms or legs. Chemical analysis showed it has anti-inflammatory properties. Local people use the same plant as pain relief. Unlike many other similarities between orangutans and humans, this one has cultural rather than evolutionary roots. And not in the way you might think. “When we surveyed local people,” says Morrogh-Bernard, “they told us their ancestors started using a number of plants as medicines after seeing orangutans doing so.”So our two species are very similar – to the extent that we sometimes even have things to learn from them.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

But palm oil cultivation in south-east Asia is clearing forests and contributing to the decline of orangutans. Here are the key points Think back over the past week in your life. If you’ve applied lipstick, eaten toast or put on a load of washing, chances are, you’ve used a product containing palm oil. Indulged in ice-cream or washed your hair? Palm oil. According to the World Wildlife Fund: “It is in about half of all packaged products sold in the supermarket.” And it’s linked to the destruction of the rainforest and many of the species that reside in it.To stop palm oil being listed as “vegetable oil” or as one of a long list of hard to pronounce synonyms, an EU law was passed in 2014, stating that all food products containing palm oil should be labelled clearly. But the same cannot be said for cosmetics and household products in which palm oil is often used.Indonesia is home to some of the most bioerse areas in the world, including the Leuser ecosystem, the last place on Earth where Sumatran orangutans, elephants, tigers, rhinos and sun bears coexist naturally. The Tropical Heritage Rainforest of Sumatra – of which the Leuser ecosystem is a part – is a Unesco world heritage site, but it’s still in danger from palm oil plantations, pulp production and infrastructure projects. Orangutans are keystone species, which, according to National Geographic, means they help define entire ecosystems. If a keystone species – sea otters, elephants, honey bees, for example – disappears, no other species can fill its shoes, and the ecosystem changes irrevocably. Mainstream media now regularly covers palm oil, campaigns such as Say No to Palm Oil have sprung up and the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil runs a certification system, which aims to ensure all palm oil with its stamp comes from sustainably managed plantations. Genuine change is yet to occur, however, prompting campaigners to put pressure on brands that use palm oil, urging them to use their power to genuinely reform their suppliers.Help create a movement to stop companies using dirty palm oil.

He said in a recent speech that the simplistic solutions provided by rampant nationalism of the kind advocated by Salvini’s League could lead to a return to 1930s fascism.The governing Italian coalition between the Five Star Movement (M5S) and Salvini’s League is ided on the gas pipeline issue. In July, Salvini said he would support the pipeline project claiming it would help to drive down gas prices in Italy, where there was little competition in the energy market. “The south of Italy needs infrastructure,’’ he said, “we need to move forward.’’A few days later, Barbara Lezzi, the M5S Italian minister for the south, responded, saying: “We do need infrastructure: we need roads, schools, train stations,” but suggested that the building of the pipeline would be useless and harmful. Luigi Di Maio, the Italian deputy prime minister and leader of M5S said: “The party has not changed its mind over the building of the pipeline.’’Italian environmentalists claim that Puglia, which has two Unesco world heritage sites, will suffer as a result of the pipeline. There are fears – refuted by the consortium – that the pipeline will contaminate freshwater supplies.Activists say the local beach will be turned into a building site, threatening the habitat of the local Mediterranean monk seals.Interest in the Trans Adriatic Pipeline has been on the rise as opposition grows in Europe to the current plans for the larger Russian-backed alternative gas pipeline, Nord Stream 2, which would take gas from Russia to Germany, possibly bypassing Russia’s regional rival Ukraine.Many countries, including Poland, the US and the UK, are fiercely opposed to Nord Stream 2, arguing that it will strengthen Russia’s influence in Europe, weaken Ukraine’s finances and entrench the power of Russian gas in the European energy mix.Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, has come under growing criticism for supporting the pipeline and insisting it has no broader security consequences.The Trans Adriatic Pipeline, taking gas from Azerbaijan to Italy, would run through Greece and Albania. Although it is dwarfed by the size of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, it helps fulfil European commission calls for a more ersified supply of gas for Europe.Merkel, responding to the growing international political criticism of her support for Nord Stream 2 last month visited Azerbaijan in a bid to show she was committed to ersifying energy supplies to Europe.It is estimated that the Shah Deniz gas field in Azerbaijan has gas reserves of 1.2tn cubic metres and the EU is expecting to receive 1.2m cubic metres per day from the pipeline. Although Blair and Salvini may be polar opposites in terms of solutions, they might agree on the causes of populism. Blair’s institute has suggested that concerns about social change, uncertain economic futures, social abandonment and political powerlessness have led to the rise of populist leaders."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6fc4899252d23dee6ee5a1833960775da7dc9be/0_0_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b299c8ec879b690be02c8aabd1a2671d","title":"how is the size of your home affecting your happiness and health","story":"England has the smallest homes by floor space area of any EU country.

I have achieved more than I could have ever imagined and feel very privileged to have played for such a long time alongside some of the greats of the English game.“The thought of not sharing the dressing room, again, with some of my teammates was the hardest part of my decision but I know the timing is right.“I have loved cricket my whole life from playing in the garden as a child and will never underestimate how special it is to pull on an England shirt. So I know it is the right time to give the next generation of young cricketers their turn to entertain us and feel the immense pride that comes with representing your country.”Cook went on to thank his long-time mentor, Graham Gooch, whose England Test runs record of 8,900 he passed in 2015, as well as England’s supporters and his family. His wife, Alice, is expecting their third child imminently.He said: “There are too many people to thank inidually but a special mention must go to the Barmy Army and all supporters for their constant encouragement for the team and also a special mention to Graham Gooch.“Graham was my sounding board, especially in the early years of my career, spending hour after hour throwing balls at me with his dog stick. He made me realise you always need to keep improving whatever you are trying to achieve.“My family and I have had 12 wonderful years fulfilling my dreams and this could not have been done without them. So I wish to thank my parents and brothers, my wife, Alice, and her family for their quiet, unwavering support behind the scenes. As cricketers, who travel frequently, we often don’t realise just how important our families are to our success.“I would also like to thank Essex for their help and support ever since I was 12, and I can’t wait to get fully involved with them in the 2019 season. I wish the England team every success in the future and I will be watching with great excitement.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7fbfc405641cd4ab2b196d1d71df74b87f99e34d/0_31_2034_1220/master/2034.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3920b0f307d8de8a06d4ec2c0221cefe","title":"lewis hamilton pressure f1 duel sebastian vettel","story":"Lewis Hamilton believes the intensity of his Formula One fight with Sebastian Vettel is the greatest he has ever experienced. The pair clashed at the Italian Grand Prix, with Hamilton going on to win, while Vettel’s misjudgment in hitting the Mercedes driver meant he could finish only fourth.Hamilton also said his mental preparation is proving key to executing successful races.Ferrari had the quickest cars at Monza and Vettel and his teammate Kimi Raikkonen had locked out the front row and were expected to win. When Hamilton went to pass the German at the Roggia chicane, Vettel struck the Mercedes and . He dropped down the field while Hamilton went on to pass Raikkonen and now has a 30-point lead over Vettel in the world championship.Vettel and Hamilton are both attempting to win a fifth drivers’ title and their battle is exceptionally close. The lead has changed hands five times and their cars have generally been evenly matched. However, Ferrari have enjoyed a speed advantage since the British Grand Prix and an engine upgrade at the Belgium GP has given them more power than their rivals.Hamilton said Monza reflected what was an enormous struggle between the two drivers. “The heat is there, and the intensity is there. It is unavoidable for me and him,” he said. “It is very difficult for people watching who are not in it to feel what we feel. The pressure is at its highest I can ever remember. That is the pressure you put on yourself because you want to succeed, the pressure of all your desires and fears, of all the people depending on you, which is a lot of people.”For Vettel the race was another missed opportunity and the fifth mistake this season that has proved costly. Hamilton has been ruthless in making the most of every opportunity, winning three of the past four races, all of which Ferrari went into with the upper hand.Hamilton is in the right zone in terms of his driving. “You have to find the right balance of being aggressive and not making mistakes,” he said. “Sometimes you overdo it and leave stuff on the table and on Sunday I did not want to walk away having left something on the table, and think: ‘If only I’d braked two metres later I could have passed him.’”He stressed that achieving this took commitment. “It is so hard to prepare, to be in the mindset that I have right now,” he said. “To be consistent, not make mistakes, to continuously deliver, takes everything and more. I don’t just arrive with it, I have to work for it every single day.”With seven races to go, he added: “We are not being complacent. We have to deliver results like this more often. Monza could easily have been the other way and we could have lost a lot of ground.”McLaren will replace Stoffel Vandoorne with Lando Norris, the British team’s reserve driver, at the end of the season.

There are currently only around 10,000 public tickets left for the European showpiece next May, which Saracens will be hoping involves another trip to Tyneside for them. If their Australian forward Will Skelton, who has slimmed down by 15kg since the end of last season, can maintain the promising form he showed in Sarries’ bonus-point win at Kingston Park, it will do the north Londoners’ prospects no harm. Robert KitsonRob Baxter has always been an admirer of Matt Kvesic. He tried to sign him a few years ago, but the flanker chose Gloucester. Now the Exeter director of rugby has had his man for a season, and showed off the revamped version to great effect. Baxter reckons he had become too fixated on the defensive aspects of his game, but the reason he had wanted him was as much for his attacking prowess, which now looks as if it has been rekindled. Much more of this, and he will join a host of younger men who might appeal to England as conforming to the conventional model of a “seven”. Michael AywlinTwo international fly-halves made their competitive debuts for their new clubs and in their markedly different ways, Danny Cipriani and Dan Biggar will be pivotal if Gloucester and Northampton are to break into the top four. Cipriani has sometimes been tagged as too inidual for a team sport, but he is calculating rather than impetuous, and if he occasionally flits to the margins of a gameplan, he is always mindful of it. It is not so much that opponents do not know what he is going to do but more, at crucial times, that they cannot stop him. He measures his involvement in a match, unlike Biggar who likes to be at the centre of events. Cipriani profited from the dominant pack on Saturday and his ability to create space was the catalyst for his side’s two tries. Biggar will have more fulfilling afternoons for the Saints, but standing flat rather than deep, kicking the ball less than Cipriani despite touching it more, he was the eyes of his side’s new attacking ambition. Paul ReesPlenty about Worcester’s 21-20 defeat beyond the final scoreline will have given pause for thought among the other Premiership clubs and the pundits who almost universally tipped them for the drop. The hosts caused Wasps a raft of problems, much of it stemming from their Springbok-Scottish half-back combination of Francois Hougaard and Duncan Weir. Having established a rapid 13-0 lead, Worcester did not go behind until the 69th minute and could still have clawed it back when a late Weir drop-goal went wide. Wasps, who stuttered in the early part of last season, will be relieved to get the win and eager to put in their southern hemisphere signings, Brad Shields and Lima Sopoaga, sooner rather than later. Claire TolleyMarcus Smith believes a summer spent at the world under-20 championship rather than with England in South Africa is behind his blistering start to the season after scoring 26 points against Sale to ensure Paul Gustard’s reign at Harlequins began with a bang. The 19-year-old is well known to Gustard having been included as an apprentice in a number of Eddie Jones’s senior squads, but was overlooked for the South Africa tour, instead helping England’s Under-20s to the final in France. “I learned a lot from that experience,” said Smith. “I learned how to take control and try and lead a team, and I tried to take what I learned from the seniors experience into that World Cup. I want to add a bit of control to my game. It’s every kid’s dream to play for England but I need to let my performances do the talking here and hopefully get Eddie calling me.” Gerard MeagherThere was no London double-header at Twickenham this year but those in charge of the new Gallagher Premiership could not have wished for a more stimulating way to launch the season. While Bath were disappointing, the occasion was first class and the appetite for big-time rugby in Bristol has been gloriously refreshed. If Stephen Luatua, George Smith, Ian Madigan and Luke Morahan can sustain their opening-night form the Bears will not just be good to watch but will ask questions of most visitors to Ashton Gate. Bath, surely, will not be as sluggish in this weekend’s clash with another rising West Country force, Gloucester. One early setback does not automatically define a season but they will have to sharpen up considerably, not least at half-back, to avoid another chastening derby experience.

But when the show first aired in 1999, it was genuinely innovative. Back at the height of ladette culture, you might yell “Girl Power!” before sinking a pint or four but feminism was a dirty word, associated with stuffy weirdos who took life too seriously. Sexual harassment? You’ve got to laugh …Into this minefield of gender politics skipped Loose Women, with its ironic title and cheerful determination to speak informally about modern womanhood. The first all-female panel show in the UK and one of the first in the world (it was preceded by The View, created by US journalist Barbara Walters a couple of years earlier), its very existence was revolutionary – daring to suggest that women might have life experiences that were worthy of discussion, unmediated by men (as the majority of daytime TV still is).For women stuck at home due to illness, retirement or caring responsibilities, it offered something that was hard to come by in the days before blogs and Facebook groups: community. And not just figuratively – you could call in with your opinion and actually have a discussion, rather than clicking “Dunno” on a Twitter poll. Sure, the eye-searing yellow, pink and turquoise colour scheme made the set look as if it had been pilfered from Play School, and early discussions about whether it’s scandalous to sunbathe topless or selfish to not want a baby suggested this wasn’t a hard-hitting enterprise. But it still had gravitas: former reporter Kaye Adams was usually head panellist, and had the brains, empathy and quick thinking needed to guide a live daily show without appealing to the lowest common denominator.The other original panellists – Nadia Sawalha, Karren Brady and Jane Moore – seemed to have been picked for their ability to respectfully express opinions, but as time went on, people were hired on the basis of name recognition rather than the quality of their conversation. Debates descended into slanging matches and, perhaps inevitably, a line was crossed when Janet Street-Porter compared Penny Lancaster to “someone in Hitler’s Germany”.The show became more isive after Adams left in 2006, even as Ruth Langsford and Andrea McLean gamely tried to fill her peacemaker role. She’s back occasionally, but the old magic isn’t. The show’s producers recently sensed that participating in clickbait culture would bring them publicity, and so it has become a showcase for manufactured outrage and the most obvious perspectives (e.g. the recent clash between Kim Woodburn and regular panellist Coleen Nolan).When Katie Price became a regular in 2016, it seemed as if it might finally be time to put viewers out of their misery. But after 19 years and more than 3,000 episodes, the programme shows no signs of stopping. The average woman’s life is 83 years, but Loose Women could outlive us all."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6a56cc12732b650700225c92112bfd317755c141/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=842b928ff61be015ea648f1bdc95bf09","title":"russian tv launches series devoted vladimir putins weekly activities","story":"Show praises president’s physique, love of children and ability to drive away bearsVladimir Putin’s “wonderful” physique and his love for children have been hailed in the first episode of a new television programme devoted to the Russian president’s weekly activities.Moscow. Kremlin. Putin, which aired at prime time on Sunday evening on the Rossiya 1 state television channel, also joked that even wild animals were afraid of the Kremlin strongman.The hour-long show aired hours after thousands of people had marched near Red Square to protest against unpopular pension reforms that have driven the president’s approval ratings to a four-year low.It praised Putin’s willingness to “take responsibility” for the “necessary” reforms, but made no mention of the protests.After a segment on Putin’s attitude to young people, the presenter Vladimir Soloviev said: “When Putin talks to the mother of a child or looks at a child, it’s clear how much he loves children. He has a human, sincere attitude toward children.”Dmitry Peskov, the Kremlin spokesman and studio guest, replied: “Putin doesn’t only love children, he loves people in general.”TV Dozhd, an online opposition channel, likened the Rossiya 1 show to the Soviet-era personality cult around Vladimir Lenin. Other critics expressed disbelief that state media could find more space for coverage of Putin among its already wall-to-wall coverage of the president. Rossiya 1 devoted more airtime to Putin than all the other candidates combined in the run up to March’s presidential elections.The programme also featured footage of Putin’s recent holiday in Tuva, a remote region in Siberia. “This is wild nature, there are bears there,” Peskov said. “Bodyguards are armed in an appropriate manner, just in case. Although if a bear sees Putin – they aren’t idiots – they will behave themselves properly.”Amid the relentless praise for Putin there was also an unexpected mention of the prominent Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny.During a segment about a meeting between Putin and some students in Sochi, a teenage boy called Yegor Ryabov could be seen wearing a “Navalny 2018” T-shirt partly covered by a grey hooded top. Navalny, who was barred from this year’s presidential campaign, is blacklisted by state media.Ryabov said he had covered up the T-shirt during a briefing with Kremlin security officers before the meeting but unzipped his top when Putin appeared.“This was an act of political disobedience,” Ryabov said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ebd136d73b61379bfa82fa4aeba46af0859a207/0_518_7750_4651/master/7750.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e1790ab8d09af22caa2456ef0f4cea80","title":"sweden elections everything you need to know","story":"Scandinavian country’s 7.3 million voters go to polls on 9 September. What are the key issues?Anti-migrant feeling fuels Swedish far right as election loomsSweden’s 7.3 million voters go to the polls on 9 September, electing a new parliament and government to succeed the Social Democrat-Green coalition of the prime minister, Stefan Löfven, which has run the country since 2014.Current opinion polling suggests his centre-left party may remain Sweden’s largest, as it has for more than a century. But it, the main centre-right Moderate party and their respective blocs face a stiff challenge from the rightwing populists of the Sweden Democrats, who could well end up holding the balance of power.After Italy’s election of a far-right, populist coalition in March, the performance of the anti-immigration, anti-EU party will be watched across Europe – though its support appears to have been fading since early summer, when it led some polls.The 349 MPs in Sweden’s Riksdag are elected through proportional representation, 310 of them by the country’s 29 constituencies (each of which has a set number of seats depending on their population).Europe’s 2015 immigration crisis, in which Sweden received 163,000 asylum seekers (more, per head of the population, than almost any other EU country), propelled immigration and integration to the top of the political agenda.Although the present government radically tightened asylum laws, the Sweden Democrats – whose roots lie in the neo-Nazi movement, but under leader Jimmy Åkesson have been mostly purged of their openly racist elements – have kept them there, hammering their core message that Sweden’s generous welfare state is at risk.Sweden is also increasingly alarmed by violent crime following a spate of shootings and grenade attacks, often in deprived areas with high concentrations of immigrants, masked youths recently torched more than 80 cars in Gothenburg and other west coast towns.The far-right party’s other main policy, holding a referendum over whether Sweden should leave the EU, has little support among voters. Sweden’s economy, motoring along nicely, barely features in the debate. After this summer’s record heatwave, however, climate change is also now a major electoral issue.Many analysts believe that could clear a path for Moderate leader Ulf Kristersson to become the next prime minister, even at the head of a minority government, if the anti-immigration party votes down Löfven.A strong performance by the Sweden Democrats could create its own problems for the anti-immigration party, however: although it might force mainstream parties to engage, compromising on their fundamental principles for a share of power has rarely won populist parties more votes."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612489.1535973437!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pricewatch no tv blatant lies and lack of communication from sky","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSeveral other readers have been in touch with us in recent months with very similar stories. File photograph: Leal-OlivasAFPGetty ImagesThis story about Sky may sound familiar to eagle-eyed Pricewatch readers. Deirdre Lanigan signed up with Sky television and broadband at the end of last November in a Sky outlet in Thurles Shopping Centre in order to avail of a free television offer. “There was no mention in the shop of having to ‘claim’ my television through an email which would be sent to me,” she says. “There was no sign of the television which initially didn’t worry me, as I was trying to get the broadband sorted,” she writes.“During the course of a broadband conversation in January I inquired as to when I should expect my television, and was told that I would have to have paid at least three months of bills before I could expect that. Having seen no sign of the television and with seven months of bills paid, I contacted Sky again. I spoke to reps on the phone and their managers. I was told that as an email had been sent to me on December 21st and I’d failed to claim the television, there was nothing I could do.“I never received such an email. I looked for transcripts of my phone conversations. At that point, a manager said she would ring me the next day, either having sorted the television situation or telling me how to get the transcripts. I carried my phone with me all day, into every room and every building I entered – no phone call. I rang back the number the next day and was greeted with an automated message stating that they had tried to ring me the previous day and with no further information or options. By now I was furious. This was a blatant lie,” she says.Just before she went on holidays earlier this summer she rang Sky again and said that she wanted to make an official complaint. “I was given an official complaint number and told that I would hear from a manager in the next three to five days by phone or email. I explained I would be away on holidays, in case I didn’t answer the phone immediately, until August 3rd. At that point, I thought they said I would receive an email if they couldn’t reach me by phone. That was on July 19th. I have had no contact with Sky since.”She says she is “beyond frustrated. I found Sky great to deal with solving my broadband issue. This has been a whole other scenario. They even said I lied about signing up in the shop, as the numbers didn’t match and it wasn’t possible. The shop, however, rang Sky to back me on this issue, and with regard to the television – to no avail. “I’m just wondering where do I go next. My heart sinks at the thought of ringing Sky again and going around in the same circles. How are they getting away with such poor customer service and telling of blatant lies? I would have thought that after you highlighted the situation in your article that things would have improved. They haven’t.”We contacted the company and a spokeswoman said: “Our free TV offer is one of the most popular promotional campaigns that Sky runs. On this occasion the manual entry of an incorrect email address resulted in the customer missing out on the promotional offer email. In subsequent communication with this customer we fell short in terms of the excellent customer service we pride ourselves on. Sky has been in touch with the customer and has resolved this matter with them. We have also introduced a number of new steps which should eliminate similar issues arising in the future.” Several other readers have been in touch with us in recent months with very similar stories."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612605.1535713095!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"pricewatch reader bought a bed from littlewoods but it never arrived","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDHL had noted the shipment was delivered on July 16th but I had not received it. Photograph: Ralph Orlowski Bloomberg“I tracked the shipment, it noted it had been passed twice to a third-party courier. On July 20th I called DHL, they told me Littlewoods items are handled by the ‘Supply Chain’ , they gave me a number to ring. I rang five different times on different days, it rang out every time. I left a message on the voicemail with my number, no one contacted me,” she says. Also on July 20th she called Littlewoods customer service. “After holding for some time while the girl I was speaking to made inquiries, she told me the bed was sent to a third-party courier as it was a ‘high-value item’ and they have ‘escalated’ its delivery status with them to be delivered by the following week, and that the delivery company would call me to arrange the day and time and she would arrange a call-back for me on July 27th to check it had been delivered. No delivery company called, no delivery came and no call back from Littlewoods either.” Five days later she called again and asked for the same girl as before. “She checked the status again and said she would again try to ‘escalate’ its delivery status to highest level and investigate what was the issue but if it was not delivered this time that she could offer a refund. I did not ask for a refund. She said she would monitor the issue and arrange a call-back. No delivery.”When Jaclyn wrote to us she said she was “so lost now, I don’t know where to go to get an answer. The bed is for my little girl, I wanted to get her settled in it with plenty of time before school starts.”She says she understands that as a bigger item it may need more time for delivery and she has no problem with that. “My partner runs an online business from home, we have all the courier companies here on a daily basis so I know there is no problem with them coming to us. I thought ordering from an international company, it would be a smooth service. I was so wrong. I would not take issue with having to wait longer because of logistics etc, but the lack of communication is unacceptable.”She says Littlewoods has no communication from purchase to delivery. “You track your parcel from your online account but it’s very limited information there’s no automated shipping notification email, nothing. When the email asking for a review arrived, I reviewed it based on the facts above. An email came back almost immediately to say my review had been moderated, as it contained delivery details, not information on the quality of the item. It would not be published as it’s not helpful to customers’ decision-making. Yet, still no one from Littlewoods contacted me.”She says that if it was truly the case that the item was shown to be delivered on July 16th she does not understand why they weren’t able to tell her that on the first customer service call, “if they had ‘investigated’. I purchased the bed at sale time, it was €389 it is now online for €579. If I was cynical I would think there’s more to it, luckily I am not . . . yet. I had to take my daughter out of her cot so now she’s sleeping on a mattress on the floor. I have a chronic illness, this is just adding to my stress levels.”A spokeswoman for Shop Direct Ireland said: “We’ve looked into the details of Ms Maher’s case and identified a number of service failings. We’ve contacted her to say sorry, refunded the item and sent €100 to reflect the stress and inconvenience caused. The service Ms Maher experienced does not meet the high standards we set ourselves. We are now investigating this case to help ensure that the same mistakes aren’t repeated.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Four presidential hopefuls make pitch for nomination to Kerry County CouncilActing commissioner Donall O\u0026rsquoCualain stepped down at 00.01am on MondayDuffy secures support from 17 of the 40 councillors, 11 of whom abstained from voteFormer Fianna F\u0026aacuteil TD says office of president has become a unifying figureWoman dies in Drogheda collision and 76-year-old man dies in LimerickCannabis and cocaine worth \u0026euro3,500 as well as \u0026euro34,000 cash seized at apartment\u0026lsquoWe don\u0026rsquot agree with his approach on climate change.

Photograph: Brian FarrellLast Friday the shutters came down on three town centre shops in Carrick-on-Shannon and locals spent much of the day dropping in with good wishes and cards. A fourth shop in the Co Leitrim town had said a final farewell to customers the previous day.Two of the businesses, Prior’s on Main Street and Gartlan’s on Bridge Street, were family-run newsagents that had survived for generations. Scented Meadows, a gift shop styling itself “the lavender experience”, opened in Carrick five years ago but, according to owner Nicoletta Pantano, she was closing for the sake of her sanity. “I was often sitting here for eight hours not talking to anyone, with no cars passing,” she explained.A children’s clothing store, Sherbet, also shut last week, although it is to continue as an online business. Three more businesses have either recently closed or are preparing to go.In a town frequently lauded in the tourist guides for its vibrancy and picturesque location on the banks of the Shannon, the closure of at least seven town centre shops is a talking point.There are two motions before Monday’s meeting of Leitrim County Council urging that something be done. “Is there some reason for these closures that we can address?” independent councillor Enda Stenson is asking officials, echoing the bewilderment locally at the scale of closures.The reasons are varied and complex, but the development of out-of-town retail parks and online shopping are being cited as factors. The proprietors of one popular boutique are closing for family reasons, while another boutique has little choice because the landlord is selling up.The impact of Carrick’s popularity as a destination for hen and stag celebrations ides opinion, with some saying it kept the town going during difficult times, while others believe the regular weekend influx of revellers is keeping other potential customers away.“Hens and stags bring €28 million annually to Carrick and create 800 jobs, including part-time work,” said Colm McGrath, president of the chamber of commerce. He agrees that seven shop closures is a cause of concern “in the short term, but medium to long term I think the future looks positive”. McGrath says that once funding is secured to improve the streetscape in Carrick, investment will follow.Fellow chamber member Leslie O’Hora does not share his enthusiasm for hens and stags. “We have a population of 4,000 but get an extra 1,000 every weekend, most of them well-behaved but some obviously boisterous,” said the businessman. “Families will not come into town if there are people marching up and down the streets carrying inflatables and bottles and glasses.”O’Hora, a business consultant and former Green Party election candidate, argues that only a handful of “superpubs” are benefiting from the hen and stag trade and says the same people provide accommodation and transport for the visitors. “It’s a beautiful town with fantastic hotels, 20 restaurants and some lovely boutique shops, but it is destroyed at weekends.”Jim Gartlan, who sold tourist souvenirs in his newsagent, points out that 13,000 people reportedly visit the Rosebank retail park on the Dublin side of town every Saturday.“People can get all they need on the edge of towns. It’s not just Carrick,” he said. His grandmother Eileen Murray started the business on Main Street in the late 1930s, a time when most families lived over their shops creating a close-knit town centre community.Gartlan says “a combination of 20 different things” including a sharp drop in overseas visitors, made closure inevitable.Colm Prior’s father, Denis, bought the business in 1953, “so after 65 years Prior’s is retiring”. Prior says the “last straw” for him was when the traffic flow was changed and commuters travelling from Leitrim and Drumshanbo could no longer turn right and pass his premises. “We were never consulted,” he said. “From the first day we saw a difference,” his partner, Bernadette Keenan, said.They had no problem with hens ands stags, especially hens. “They’d come in for coffee and to buy confectionery for the kids before going home on Sunday. The lads, in fairness, were here to drink,” laughed Prior.Claire McGovern, editor of the Leitrim Observer, believes there are multiple reasons for the spate of closures, including traffic issues. “The town is well known for being a bottle-neck as motorists cross over the bridge, and this can put off people coming into Carrick.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3615936.1535911516!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"irish honey among world s healthiest study finds","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPhD student Saorla Kavanagh of DCU, who led the research that has found Irish heather honey as having health benefits comparable with manuka honeyIrish heather honey contains health benefits comparable with the world renowned manuka honey from New Zealand, according to a study from researchers at Dublin City University and Trinity College Dublin.Honey provides many benefits for overall health, with antioxidant, antibacterial, antidiabetic and anti-inflammatory properties.Manuka honey is produced in New Zealand by bees that pollinate the native manuka bush. Advocates say it has particularly strong properties that are useful for treating wound infections and actually prevents damage to cell tissue.The Irish research found a similar overall presence of powerful antioxidants called phenolic compounds in Irish heather honey as has been found in manuka honey.Researchers also found that multifloral honeys produced by urban bees had a greater level of antioxidant phenolic compounds than their rural counterparts – a finding possibly due to the flower ersity and abundance surrounding hives.The findings are published in the prestigious journal Food Chemistry.The research was led by PhD student Saorla Kavanagh of the school of chemical sciences and DCU Water Institute, and supervised by senior academics Dr Blánaid White of the school of chemical sciences in DCU and Prof Jane Stout of the school of natural sciences, Trinity College Dublin.Honey samples for the research, which was funded by the Irish Research Council, were donated by beekeepers across Ireland.The research also represented the first ever comparison of Irish single-origin honeys heather, ivy and oilseed rape and multifloral honeys.– Honeys with a dark colour typically have a higher total phenolic content and thus a higher antioxidant capacity.– Urban multifloral honeys had a higher total phenolic content than rural multifloral honeys.– Irish heather honey had the highest total phenolic content of all Irish single origin honeys and had a higher total phenolic content than manuka honey.– Ivy honey was the darkest Irish honey analysed and its total phenolic content was less than that of heather and manuka honeys.Dr White said the research “shows that Irish honey is a high-quality product and something that we should really value.Prof Stout said finding a difference in honey composition between urban and rural hives probably reflects the difference in flower availability in urban and rural areas in Ireland”."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3616778.1535982072!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gavin duffy secures presidential nomination from meath county council","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tGavin Duffy has received the first county council nomination in the presidential race.

Of the 40 councillors, 11 abstained and 3 were absent.At least 12 county and city councils are expected to hold votes to nominate Independent candidates for the presidential election this week, with businessman Seán Gallagher the frontrunner to get the first endorsement.Ten prospective candidates have already addressed councils with an 11th, businessman and Dragons’ Den panellist Peter Casey expected to address Leitrim County Council on Monday.A number of other councils are expected to vote on presidential nominations, or hear submissions from candidates. They are Meath, Cork City, Leitrim, Kerry and Monaghan. Other councils who will hear from councillors in the next week include Clare, Roscommon, Fingal, Offaly and Cavan, which is expected to endorse Mr Gallagher.Wexford was due to discuss nominations but the meeting has been adjourned following the death of the mother of the council chairman, Keith Doyle.Mr Gallagher is believed to have secured sufficient backing in Leitrim, Roscommon, Cavan and Wexford, which will give him the required minimum of four local authorities.On Monday Mr Gallagher told Leitrim County Council the Frontline programme featuring ‘tweetgate’ had “changed the outcome “of the 2011 presidential election.Mr Duffy and Ms Freeman are seen as the next most likely to secure four council endorsements.Until now Mr Duffy, Patrick Feeney, Ms Freeman, John Groarke, Marie Goretti Moylan, Sarah Louise Mulligan, Kevin Sharkey, Gemma O’Doherty and James Smyth have addressed councils.Ms O’Doherty, a freelance journalist, has refused to withdraw a claim she made at an anti-corruption meeting in Waterford* that investigative journalist Veronica Guerin was murdered by the State.A number of criminals involved with the John Gilligan gang were convicted in relation to Ms Guerin’s murder, including Gilligan himself, Brian Meehan, Paul Ward and Patrick “Dutchy” Holland.Ms Guerin’s brother Jimmy, an independent councillor, has described Ms O’Doherty’s comments as offensive and hurtful to his family.“She is trying to abuse Veronica’s name,” he told the Sunday Independent, saying she was propagating conspiracy theories.However, on Twitter Ms O’Doherty seemed to stand over her controversial comments.She claimed she had been told by a person in authority that Ms Guerin was “silenced because she was exposing high-level corruption in the gardaí and judiciary.”In another post she claimed: “Veronica Guerin was exposing corruption at the highest levels of the justice system, and collusion between gardaí and criminals. Why was she hauled into court for speeding on the day of her murder when ‘reporters’ close to gardaí could get their offences wiped?”She was challenged by other users on the social media platform to produce evidence to back up her claims."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

At the end of the show, or if you need to use your phone during the performance, you can take the pouch outside of the phone-free zone to have it unlocked.Other artists such as Jack White and Chris Rock have imposed similar bansBut Hart\u0027s ban does not include any such technology - which fans saying was unrealistic as people needed to be contactable.Dan Steele revealed three members of his party were escorted out of Manchester Arena after they were seen texting their babysitters before the concert. He wrote to Hart of Facebook stating: “Before the show had started, 3 of the 6 were thrown out because they sent a text message to there babysitter, asking if there children were ok. “Now in the real world, this is what people need to do in order to unwind and enjoy your show. We have people we need to know are ok.”Amy Yates also vented her frustration online after she was told to leave, for sending her mother a text.She wrote: “I didn’t try to record and photograph anything in the arena literally sent a text yet I got escorted out the whole of the building by several members of staff. “God help anyone that has a genuine emergency whilst sat down in the Arena because you literally will be escorted out if you touch your phone.”Prior to both events the venues warned attendees of the strict policy that was in place. During Hart’s performance at the O2 \u0026#39cell phone security\u0026#39 were spotted at the venueManchester Arena reminded visitors that “at the request of the artist, the use of mobile phones is strictly prohibited at this event.”Adding: “There is also a no camera policy in operation. As on all of Kevin Hart tour dates, his own security, in conjunction with arena staff, will be monitoring the audience and anyone found taking photos, or using their mobile phone during the performance, will be asked to leave the show.”The O2 also offered a the same caution to fans warning: “Anyone caught using a phone or camera before or during the show will be ejected with no refund.”During Hart’s performance at the O2 “cell phone security” were spotted at the venue whilst leaflets were also handed out to fans stating “no cell phones before or during the show or you will be ejected, no refunds issued.” This included texting, talking, tweeting, cameras, social media and recording devices according to the flier. Hart’s agent has been contacted for comment. Downing Street hits back at Boris Johnson and says he has \u0026#39no new ideas\u0026#39Rachael Bland, BBC presenter and cancer blogger, reveals she has just \u0026#39days left to live\u0026#39Royal Academy nudes to have \u0026#39gender equality\u0026#39 in new post-#metoo exhibition Aunt of Alan Kurdi calls for UK to speed up refugee intake on third anniversary of his deathJeremy Vine takes over The Wright Stuff, review: a slick first day juggling both Brexit debates and Roxanne Pallett\u0026#39s first interviewUK weather: 2018 beats 1976 to become England\u0026#39s hottest summer on recordIf Chequers is dead, what now?Israel threatens attack on Iranian assets installed in IraqOne in 18 migrants die crossing the Mediterranean as death rate soars amid isions over EU rescue policyBA passengers are being shunted onto a budget Belgian airline this weekPolice in Austria hunt mysterious kangaroo on the looseComment: Victory for Brussels is inevitable.

Pictured are thousands of sun-seekers flocking to Bournemouth beach last weekThis year was the hottest summer on record for England, with average temperatures narrowly beating those seen in 1976. But despite the weeks-long heatwaves, 2018 was only the joint-hottest summer on record for the UK as a whole, the Met Office has said.UK temperatures for June to August 2018 reveal that this year is top of the league table in records dating back to 1910, along with 2006, 2003 and 1976, all of which are within 0.03C of each other.To the nearest 0.1C, all four years - 2018, 2006, 2003 and 1976 - saw an average temperature for the summer of 15.8C (60.4F).Summer 2018 was notably dry and sunny too, although the dry, sweltering conditions seen in much of the country in June and July gave way to a much more average August, the Met Office said.And autumn looks set to get off to a good start, with high pressure dominating the UK\u0027s weather, with warm, dry and sunny days for many in the first part of September, the forecasters said.The scorching summer could give way to an autumn of above-average temperatures, forecasters have said.The three-month outlook - covering August, September and October - shows an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK.Sea surface temperatures at near-record levels following the hot weather also make above-average temperatures more likely, according to the long-range prediction system.The report said: This would result in more settled UK weather conditions overall.The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than normal, but while the chances of below-average temperatures are considerably smaller, they remain a realistic possibility.While a weather warning is not looking likely, thunder and hail storms could hit the UK on Friday, a Met Office spokeswoman said.On Thursday we are looking at some heavy showers for the northern half of England. There\u0027s some potential for thunder and hail, she said.Also on Friday that becomes a little bit more widespread with a chance across much of the country.Temperatures are forecast to be in the high teens and early 20s towards the weekend.Downing Street hits back at Boris Johnson and says he has \u0026#39no new ideas\u0026#39Rachael Bland, BBC presenter and cancer blogger, reveals she has just \u0026#39days left to live\u0026#39Fans kicked out of Kevin Hart gig after artist introduces a ‘zero tolerance’ mobile phone ban at UK gigs Royal Academy nudes to have \u0026#39gender equality\u0026#39 in new post-#metoo exhibition Aunt of Alan Kurdi calls for UK to speed up refugee intake on third anniversary of his deathJeremy Vine takes over The Wright Stuff, review: a slick first day juggling both Brexit debates and Roxanne Pallett\u0026#39s first interviewIf Chequers is dead, what now?Israel threatens attack on Iranian assets installed in IraqOne in 18 migrants die crossing the Mediterranean as death rate soars amid isions over EU rescue policyBA passengers are being shunted onto a budget Belgian airline this weekPolice in Austria hunt mysterious kangaroo on the looseComment: Victory for Brussels is inevitable.

Friel will play disorganised mother-of-three Lisa Kallisto, who juggles her hectic family life with running a business.Penned by Indian Summer writer Anna Symon, the series aims to take a modern look at families, the pressure of busy lives, and an exploration of what it means to be a perfect mother.Polly Hill, head of drama at ITV, said: Anna has cleverly woven together two of Paula\u0027s brilliant novels, to create a wonderful modern and layered series.It\u0027s about three very different women on their own incredible and often shocking journeys, whose lives connect at the school gates.It\u0027s funny, sexy, truthful and often outrageous, and should have the audience asking what they would do to hold their own family together.

Now a new book collects photography and stories from the communityClick to followThe IndependentThe community designed a flag, appointed ministers of state – including actor David Rappaport as foreign minister – made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitorsThere was a lot of talk, in the wake of the Brexit referendum, suggesting that London should stage its own exit from the United Kingdom, declare independence, and ask to rejoin the EU as a nation state.Ignoring for now the fact that not everyone – though\u0026nbspit might seem that way to London – outside the capital voted to leave the EU, it seemed a satisfying, though jokey, postscript to the Brexit vote. Indeed, more than 180,000 Londoners signed an online petition calling for the mayor, Sadiq\u0026nbspKhan, to “declare London independent, and apply to join the EU –\u0026nbspincluding membership of the Schengen zone”.But what a lot of the signatories might not have realised was that there was indeed a precedent for London seceding from the UK. Or at least, one street of the capital.\u0026nbspWelcome to the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia. Or, what’s left of it, which these days amounts to the Frestonian Gallery, keeping the name and spirit alive of one of the most curious episodes in London’s history. It\u0026nbspbegan on Halloween\u0026nbsp1977, when the residents of Freston Road in Notting Dale, West London, which was largely comprised of squats and communes, declared independence.Threatened with eviction, the squatters said they were no longer part of the UK and appealed to the United Nations to send in peacekeeping forces to prevent Greater London Council turfing them out of the homes they had claimed. They designed a flag, appointed ministers of state, and even made their own postage stamps and issued visas for visitors.The short-lived story of the Free Independent Republic of Frestonia has now been documented in a new book of photographs by one of its residents, the photographer Tony Sleep, who was resident on Freston Road from 1974.\u0026nbspSleep describes the Frestonia experiment as “part publicity stunt, part theatrical protest”, and adds that while it wasn’t a serious attempt to break away from the UK, there was never any need to, because what became Frestonia “was already on a different planet”.He writes in the lavish book: “Frestonia was rooted in the counterculture of the time. The period is now dismissed as little more than daft clothes and hair, accompanied by a great soundtrack and the invention of sex and drugs.“It was, we are told, youthful self indulgence that ended badly because it was irresponsible and naive.”Frestonian Gallery)Frestonia was born out of problems that young people will recognise today: the lack of affordable accommodation. Sleep points out that the millennial generation might have a beef with the baby boomers who grew up in the 1960s and 1970s because they had it easy, and accommodation was cheap and plentiful. Not a bit of it, he says.“Rented flats were in very short supply, and mostly slum standard. You might achieve a rented bedsit as long as you weren’t black, Irish\u0026nbspor a dog. Then, as now, landlords wanted ‘professional’ people.“Council housing lists were only for families, and backlogged for decades. Despite what now seem like absurdly low prices, only the wealthy and secure could obtain mortgages at a time before easy mass debts. Less than half the population owned their own homes at the start of the 1970s.”Freston Road, where squatters and activists founded housing coop and community Frestonia\u0026nbsp(Getty)Many of the houses on Freston Road were empty, having been condemned as unfit for human habitation, and most of the residents had been relocated to the new highrise blocks of flats that began to go up in the 1960s and 1970s. There had been a move to demolish the vacant properties, but residents in neighbouring communities had complained that they would be looking out onto swathes of barren, rubble-strewn land that would encourage flytipping, so the authorities decided to take the cheaper option and just leave the buildings standing for a while.Freston Road might have been abandoned, but that didn’t mean it was unused. From 1974, squatters began to break into the empty houses and set up home there Tony Sleep, aged 24 at that time, was one of them.He recalls:\u0026nbsp“Squatting is distinctly equal opportunity. If you can gain possession, it’s yours. This led to an interesting mix of people who had little in common except needing somewhere to live and being poor for one reason or another. While some tried to make their new homes habitable, several houses were quickly wrecked.”Sleep remembers well his first sight of Freston Road. He’d been living in a “dismal rented basement” in west Kensington, but as he and his girlfriend parted company, he needed somewhere else to live, and heard about a street of empty houses. Some of his friends went to have a look and broke into two of the houses.“That night I paid them a visit,” writes Sleep. “Eight people, four guys, four girls, in one candlelit room, the only one that had windows. There was no toilet, no water, no electricity.”But his friends set to work installing plumbing and wiring as best they could, found an old toilet, rescued carpets and furniture from skips, and Sleep asked if he could move in with them.By 1977 Freston Road had settled into an unorthodox community, of sorts. But the attention of the GLC wandered back to these old, abandoned homes, and the squatters were told that they were to be evicted from these properties.The council offered to place the squatters in what were considered “hard to let” properties dotted around London, and some took the flats –\u0026nbspand, says Sleep, were promptly replaced in Freston Road by other people desperate for somewhere to live.\u0026nbspThe GLC announced its intention to bulldoze Freston Road after all, and a meeting was called, attended by 200 people. They decided – inspired by the Ealing comedy Passport to Pimlico – to go it alone. The Free Independent Republic of Frestonia was born. And the battle was on.The Frestonian National Anthem was written (“Long live Frestonia! Land of the free – not the GLC”) and a community newspaper, The Tribal Messenger, was distributed. Frestonia made the international press, and the Daily Mirror ran a piece declaring “All Hall, Frestonia”. The actor David Rappaport was made foreign minister, and playwright Heathcote Williams became ambassador to the United Kingdom.It was all a bit jolly and, of course, more than a pinch of Ealing comedy. But, Sleep points out, Frestonia was also an interesting way of putting British society under the\u0026nbspmicroscope.“Communities are defined, more or less, by what people have in common,” he writes. “That’s usually class, background or aspiration, sometimes race or religion. What people have in common helps them feel safe and valued. What is different can be threatening or isive.Frestonian Gallery)“Families, on the other hand, are a matter of being stuck with people you sometimes struggle to tolerate, let alone like. Frestonia was a bit of both.“Frestonians were, beneath the veneer of pragmatic anarchy, from different cultures. There were the hippies, idealists of a sort. There were the punks, nihilists of a sort. And there were the itinerant street people, whose lack of youth and lost changes gave them a thread of bitterness to chew on together.”Over the next couple of years, fighting the threat of the GLC bulldozers, the anarchic squat collective organised itself more seriously, forming the Bramley Housing Cooperative with an aim that was less about the fun of independence and more about securing the future of the Freston Road community.Eventually, the GLC won the war, and demolition of the squats began in 1983. But the Bramley Housing Cooperative, working with the Notting Hill Housing Trust, continued to fight for Freston Road as a residential area. And, ultimately, they won.Sleep says, “Frestonia didn’t cease when the squats were demolished. How could it? They were only useful ruins. Frestonia was about the people, its improbable family.“If you walk through Frestonia now, there’s little to suggest it is much different from anywhere else. You’ll find a street of small, but perhaps unusually pretty houses, built in the mid 1980s. They look carefully designed, a bit too inidual to be social housing. You may not notice the enclosed communal gardens, or the sheltered housing scheme that the coop insisted on, you won’t know the coop ensured housing for some of the more vulnerable Frestonians.”It might be that Frestonia would be forgotten all together, but for Tony Sleep’s photographic record of the people, events and houses on Freston Road in the late 1970s and early 1980s.‘Pop-up squat’: Activists occupy property to protest Housing BillNew photography exhibition shows the tough reality of squattingChallenging consumption and overwork in a Danish communityThe name does linger on in the form of the Frestonian Gallery, opened in 2017 by Matt Incledon and Rollo Campbell, who have published Tony Sleep’s photographs and recollections in Welcome To Frestonia. A pair of, in their own words, “itinerant art dealers”, they opened the gallery in The People’s Hall, a Victorian building that was once at the heart of Frestonia.\u0026nbspFrestonian Gallery opened in 2017 to remember a most curious episode in London’s history\u0026nbsp(Tony SleepFrestonian Gallery)Becoming appraised of the story of Frestonia, they were introduced to Tony Sleep, and arranged an exhibition of his photographs. They write in their foreword: “It was an exhibition unlike anything either of us had worked on previously. Each day at the gallery provided a steady stream of visitors keen to revisit and share their own personal memories of Frestonia. It would be a nice point at which to say ‘We then decided a book of Tony’s work needs to be published...’ but again, in truth, the decision had been made for us already by the sheer emotional response to this unique exhibition.”Was it all worth it for the Frestonians? Did it make a difference? Tony Sleep closes his remarkable document of this time by musing, “Forty years on, the UK seems to have travelled in a large circle and arrived little the wiser, but probably angrier, more cynical and more ided than ever.\u0026nbspWe are all Frestonians, on this small blue dot in the middle of nowhere. We are all one family, whether we like it or not.”Welcome to Frestonia by Tony Sleep\u0026nbspis published by the Frestonian Gallery (frestoniangallery), priced £35Free Independent Republic of

which are within 0.03C of each other.England saw its hottest summer on record, with average temperatures narrowly beating those seen in 1976, but it is not the warmest for the other nations of the UK, the figures show.Summer 2018 was notably dry and sunny too, although the dry, sweltering conditions seen in much of the country in June and July gave way to a much more average August, the Met Office said.The Met Office\u0027s three-month outlook –\u0026nbspcovering August, September and October –\u0026nbspshows an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK.Sea surface temperatures at near-record levels following the hot weather also make above-average temperatures more likely, according to the long-range prediction system.The report said: This would result in more settled UK weather conditions overall.The likelihood of above-average temperatures is greater than normal, but while the chances of below-average temperatures are considerably smaller, they remain a realistic possibility.Additional reporting by Press AssociationEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are

the more long-term grant awards through Best would affect their work.”According to the territory’s conservation group, threats to penguins in the region include fishing, tourism, unlicensed egg collecting and invasive, exotic diseases like avian pox because of low resistance among the isolated populations.Best funding has also been used for a climate change project in the Falklands, the European Commission’s website said, designed to model the impacts of global warming on the islands’ plant life, as well as a Sei whale conservation scheme.Ms Barkman said she had “genuine concerns” that replacement UK funding would not be enough, adding that “we are yet to see any firm proposals” for a substitute.A government spokesperson said: “As set out in our 25-Year Environment Plan, we remain committed to taking action to recover threatened, iconic or economically important species, and to prevent human-induced extinction or loss of known threatened species in our overseas territories.“We recognise the great importance of these unique environments, and are considering how environmental funding for them can best be provided after we leave the EU.”The Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said overseas territories would still be able to apply for funding from the government’s Darwin Plus scheme, for which £2.5m would be available in

secretary of the Central Labor Union (CLU) in New York has also been posited as an alternative source.The first Labor Day was duly held on 5 September 1882 in New York City at the instigation of the CLU, with a street parade held in Union Square.Other cities followed suit and Oregon became the first state to make it an official holiday in 1887. By 1894, 34 states observed the date, prompting the president, Grover Cleveland, to sign a bill into law that June making it an official national holiday. \u0026nbspPresident Cleveland’s bill coincided with one of the darkest episodes in the history of American industrial relations: the Pullman Strike.The result of unrest born of poor working conditions and wages, the dispute saw 4,000 American Railway Union (ARU) workers employed at the Pullman Company plant on Chicago’s South Side engage in a series of wildcat strikes between 11 May and 20 July 1894.Pullman, a manufacturer of railroad cars, ran the local community as a company town, refusing to let its employees own their own homes. When it sacked operatives and slashed wages without lowering rents and utility bills, its staff downed tools in protest.Eugene V Debs, head of the newly formed ARU, subsequently stopped the movement of cars to railroads and called for the boycott of all trains that towed a Pullman carriage, the disorder resulting hit all railway lines west of Detroit, Michigan, with 250,000 workers in 27 states joining the cause.The company stood firm and refused to recognise the protests, resulting in rioting in which 37 people were killed, 57 injured and $80m of damage caused. Cleveland had to send in the US Army to restore order.Labor Day thus played an important role in stabilising, resetting and advancing America’s relationship with its working men and women in the aftermath of this tragedy.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/07/02/15/gettyimages-808789522.jpg","title":"labor day 2018 what is national holiday history why cleveland riots workers","story":"Created with Sketch.Holiday inaugurated in late\u0026nbsp19th\u0026nbspcentury celebrates American workerClick to followThe Independent USPeople watch a fireworks show in Queens, New YorkLabor Day takes place on the first Monday of September every year and honours the American worker.While many associate the occasion with the end of summer and an opportunity for parades, parties, picnics, cookouts and shopping sprees, the day was inaugurated in the late 19th century out of respect for organised labor and the rights of the inidual.Here’s everything you need to know about the date and its origins.The US Department of Labor describes the holiday, this year taking place on 3 September, as “a creation of the Labor movement and is dedicated to the social and economic achievements of American workers”.\u0026nbspFederal offices are closed across the country and the US Postal Service delivers no mail.Samuel Gompers, co-founder of the American Federation of Labor, explained its distinction from other national days accordingly:“All other holidays are in a more or less degree connected with conflicts and battles of man’s prowess over man, of strife and discord for greed and power, of glories achieved by one nation over another.\u0026nbspLabor Day is devoted to no man, living or dead, to no sect, race or nation.”Canada also marks the same occasion while the European equivalent is International Workers’ Day on 1 May.There is some debate over who first proposed Labor Day.Peter McGuire, general secretary of the Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners and vice president of the American Federation of Labor, is often credited with putting forward the initial idea in spring 1882.

(Ronen ZvulunPool Photo via AP)Benjamin Netanyahu has warmly welcomed\u0026nbspthe\u0026nbspcontroversial Philippine president, who once\u0026nbspcompared himself to Hitler, adding to mounting criticism of the Israeli prime minister’s close ties with authoritarian world leaders.Rodrigo Duterte, who is in Israel for a four-day tour, is the first Philippine leader to visit the country since the two nations established diplomatic relations 60 years ago. \u0026nbspThe firebrand president is expected to sign a major oil deal with Israel and to purchase Israeli arms, during the short tour in which he has been accompanied by an entourage of security forces.\u0026nbspMr Duterte has faced widespread criticism for his deadly crackdown on drugs back home which has left thousands dead and for several foul-mouthed comments, including comparing his war on drugs to the Holocaust, and most recently\u0026nbspjoking about rape.Despite the many controversies, on Monday Mr Netanyahu highlighted the two country’s historical\u0026nbspfriendship, including the Philippines’\u0026nbspdecision to vote in favour of Israel’s establishment in 1947, becoming the only Asian country to do so.We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years,” Mr Netanyahu said, after signing three agreements on trade, science and care-giving.Mr Duterte, who later visited the country\u0027s Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial and met top officials including President Reuven Rivlin, said they share the same passion for peace.Israel can expect any help that the Philippines can extend,” he added.We remember our friends and that friendship has blossomed over the years and especially over the last few years\u0026nbspThe Philippines has enjoyed\u0026nbspincreasingly strong ties with Israel over the years. In December it abstained from a vote at the United Nations General Assembly rebuking the US for moving its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Washington’s controversial decision recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital despite the fact it is contested city claimed by both Israelis and Palestinians. \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp \u0026nbsp\u0026nbspThe Philippine president is also seeking new sources of military hardware and emerged as a significant new customer in 2017 for Israel, with sales of radar and anti-tank equipment worth $21 million.Mr Netanyahu has been praised for forging ties with new allies abroad, where Israel has often lost support for its occupation of the Palestinian territories.However, in recent months the Israeli leader has come under fire for the choice of those partners.Why Netanyahu sees Poland as Israel\u0027s most important ally in EuropeIsrael\u0027s Netanyahu criticised for wooing Hungary\u0027s far-right PMWhy has Netanyahu pushed through the Jewish Nation State bill now?Benjamin Netanyahu questioned by police in corruption investigation Israel’s Benjamin Netanyahu flies to Europe to lobby May on Iran dealMr Duterte’s visit comes just weeks after Netanyahu welcomed Viktor Orban, Hungary’s four-time prime minister who was criticised last year for praising Miklos Horthy, Hungary\u0027s World War II-era ruler and a Nazi collaborator.Mr Orban was also accused of employing anti-Semitic tropes against George Soros, a Jewish Hungarian-American billionaire philanthropist, during his re-election campaign. During Mr Orban’s visit to Israel in July, Mr\u0026nbspNetanyahu praised him for combatting anti-semitism.Mr Netanyahu was also criticised for striking a deal with Polish President Andrzej Duda over his country\u0027s controversial Holocaust speech law, which would have criminalised blaming the Polish nation for crimes committed against Jews during World War II.Mr\u0026nbspDuterte, who assumed power 2016, did little to assuage fears on Sunday when he kicked off his four-day tour of Israel with a rambling expletive-ladened speech to members of the Filipino community in Jerusalem.During the hour-long talk he justified comments made on Thursday that the high rape rate in a Philippine city was due to the number of “beautiful women”. And he apologised for calling former US president Barack Obama a “son of a whore”.Duterte defended by spokespersonIn 2016, Mr Duterte drew world-wide anger when he said he would kill as many drug addicts as Hitler did Jews, adding “I’d be happy to slaughter them”. \u0026nbspIn the same speech he had also claimed three million Jews were killed in the Holocaust, half the number agreed by historians. The president later apologised, saying he had been misunderstood.But his comments were not forgotten in Israel. Left-leaning daily Haaretz\u0026nbspon Monday published an editorial headlined A Hitler admirer at Yad Vashem, while The Times of Israel asked why Israel was “opening its doors” to Mr Duterte in a piece entitled “this man has no place in our country”. Left-wing politicians, meanwhile, questioned why Mr Netanyahu wanted to “whitewash an illegitimate leader”.He “took pride in massacring his citizens and violating human rights… so why?

Far left Trotskyite infiltrators — operating under the banner of the Militant Tendency — took over the city council.Under the leadership of the charismatic but confrontational Derek Hatton they were set on purging traditional Labour voices and creating Moscow on the Mersey.They ramped up tension between the city and central Government by playing politics with council jobs.Their antics provoked then Labour leader Neil Kinnock into giving one of his most famous speeches when he condemned the “grotesque chaos” of a Labour Council sending redundancy notices to its own workers by taxi. Eventually, the moderates won, Militant was defeated and the city was saved.But now, fast forward 33 years and another titanic struggle for the future of Labour is being played out in Merseyside.Veteran Labour MP Frank Field who was the target of Militant in the Eighties, has sensationally been thrown out of the party he’s served all his life after resigning the whip in protest at the rise of the new extremists.But this time it’s not just Liverpool that’s being taken over by the hard Left but the Labour Party itself.And instead of Labour’s leader mounting a fightback for moderation, as Neil Kinnock did, the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is the heart of the problem.Corbyn will be in Liverpool later this month for Labour’s own party conference — where the fate of the party may be decided.Will it cement victory for the new militants, now calling themselves Momentum, or be the moment that we get, in every sense, the opposition we need?I’ve known Frank for many years and he’s Labour to the core.He’s dedicated his life to fighting poverty. He has been a tough critic of my party and speaks with the moral authority of someone whose whole life has been given to serving the poorest.He pursued Philip Green over the collapse of BHS and got millions back for the company’s pensioners.But because Frank is an authentic spokesman for working people, including on issues like Brexit, he’s been targeted by the new militants who want everyone to follow Comrade Corbyn’s rigid party line.Frank is also heir to the Old Labour tradition of fighting racism and intolerance wherever it comes from. A war baby, he cherishes the role Labour played in defeating fascism. So when he takes such a stand against the party he loves, and does so citing the leader’s own complicity in anti-Semitism, then this is an alarm bell no-one can ignore.Other Merseyside MPs including Luciana Berger and Louise Ellman have also spoken out against rising anti-Semitism and intolerance within Labour ranks and the abuse they have received is truly shocking.The question now must be, will others follow Frank?With not just local parties, but the leadership itself, implacably in the grip of the hard Left, can moderates stay, and thus lend cover and credibility to the current leader?Labour was the party, when Frank was a boy, which helped create the state of Israel as a homeland for the Jewish people, which helped build Nato as a bulwark of Western values and which put the interests of working people first.Now that Labour’s leadership is criticised by our own Chief Rabbi for its attitude to Israel and the Jewish community, now that Labour has a leader who doesn’t believe in Nato and a strong defence, now that Labour is more interested in single-issue protest than building a better future for workers, can the majority of Labour’s MPs, who are decent, hard-working and moderate, really stay?Frank is right to shine a light on the issue of anti-Semitism. And not just because it is truly horrendous that, after the horrors unleashed in the 20th Century, this intolerance should return.But also because attitudes towards the Jewish community are the best indicator of how free and progressive a country is.Throughout history, the countries where Jewish people have felt safest, like the Netherlands and the UK, have been among the world’s freest.Countries where Jewish people have faced growing prejudice, like Germany and Russia during the last century, have been countries slipping into darkness.And as the Chief Rabbi has reminded us, what starts with prejudice against Jewish people spreads to taint society more widely.The Jewish community is the canary in the coal mine.And if our democracy is to stay strong then we need to have political parties that are broad-based social movements and not increasingly ideological sects.I am a Tory but I grew up to admire and respect the patriotic Labour tradition of people like Clement Attlee, Ernie Bevin, Jim Callaghan, Peter Shore, Barbara Castle and Frank Field.I wish him well and hope that his bravery will prove the wake-up call his party and the country needs to ensure there’s a sensible party of the centre left once more.NO more heroes any more, the Stranglers sang. Well, they reckoned without Lewis Pugh, a man whose grit, endurance, idealism and dedication make him the very model of a modern hero.Lewis is the endurance swimmer who powered his way into the record books this week by covering the length of the English Channel – from Land’s End to Dover – in 50 days.He covered the 330 miles – past the Eddystone Lighthouse, the Isle of Wight and Dungeness Power station – in just Speedos, cap and goggles.In stormy waters, sometimes swimming in the dead of night, through rain and high winds, with shoulder injuries, jellyfish stings and treacherous currents to slow him down, Lewis triumphed in a trial of character and cojones, which takes the breath away.But what drove Lewis on was not a desire to etch his name in the record books.It was a swelling passion for our seas, the wildlife in them and the future of our planet.In our own waters, and across the globe, the seas have suffered as a result of past exploitation, the growing danger from climate change, acidification and the rising tide of plastic waste.We have an opportunity to change that now.Leaving the EU’s Common Fisheries Policy means we can have a more sustainable approach to managing the fish in our seas.And reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, as well as improving recycling, can stem the flow of waste into our seas.But there is still more to do and making sure that more of the Earth’s surface is protected from exploitation is critical.Lewis records that during the length of his swim he encountered jellyfish in abundance, happy to bask in our warming waters, but far fewer fish, dolphins and other marine wildlife than he would have expected.As another modern hero, Sir David Attenborough, has reminded us, our Blue Planet is a precious but fragile place and we all have a responsibility to think about our impact on our seas.But the good news is that more and more people in Britain are cutting down on plastic, recycling more and helping nature recover, which is heroic in itself.The tech giant is planning to co-operate with China to censor material online.But it won’t respond to calls from the UK, US and others to co-operate in removing horrific images of abuse.The company’s motto used to be “Don’t be evil” but that was dropped earlier this year. Now we know why.I’M not surprised Prince Harry burst into song – albeit briefly – when he and wife Meghan met the cast of hit musical Hamilton.The hip-hop lyrics are infectiously catchy, so much so the Gove family often sing along to them in the car.And a musical about breaking free from an overbearing and distant overlord who doesn’t govern in your interests does have a special resonance for us.Happily, she accepted and will presumably now promise to forsake all udders.SAD to see the lovely Kirsty Young having to take a break from Desert Island Discs to battle fibromyalgia.This terrible condition – marked by chronic pain and extreme fatigue – has no ready cure.It can strike any of us down, casting a shadow over even the simplest pleasures.I hope Kirsty recovers soon ­– and I also hope that the light shone on this illness hastens progress towards a cure.Almost everything you need for a healthy, balanced diet can be sourced from British farms and fishermen.And you know it will have been caught or grown in a way that respects the environment.Instead of our diet going south, why not save on the food miles and help the planet by buying British?THE return of Strictly to our screens this autumn divides the Gove household. But not in the way you might think.My wife can’t stand the show and my daughter cringes at it – but my son and I are hooked.We’ve cheered on Ed Balls’ Gangnam Style and rooted for Susan Calman last year.This year I think Casualty actor Charles Venn and Paralympian Lauren Steadman could become popular favourites.But no, I won’t be harbouring dreams of joining in.

They trust our laws and our financial services, they admire our Armed Forces and they envy our universities.Actually, that’s not quite true: everywhere I go in the world, except right here in the UK.There are some who can’t or won’t see the natural advantages we have and the opportunities that exist for us. I get frustrated when some people purposefully choose to ignore good news such as last week when China opened up their market to UK dairy products.Britain can and should be confident and the world needs a confident Britain.A confident Britain can bang the drum for free trade across the world, as more and more countries look to pull up the drawbridge and turn away from the huge benefits that we have seen in poverty alleviation.A confident Britain can work with African countries to tackle extremism and instability which threatens millions of people across the world, including right here in the UK, as the Prime Minister promised to do this week.A confident Britain with an independent seat at the World Trade Organisation can be a leading voice for free trade and prosperity.A confident Britain is good for the world, and it’s good for us at home too. Why?Because free trade means we can sell more world-class British goods and services across the globe. That means safeguarding and creating jobs as well generating revenues for the Treasury to spend on our vital public services.That’s why I launched the Export Strategy last month: to turn the UK into a 21st Century exporting superpower.We need to work together to ­create a more confident Britain that can export to the world.To do that, we need to support business the length and breadth of the whole UK.Over 99 per cent of our businesses are small or medium-sized, and 96 per cent are micro-sized, employing fewer than nine people.That means many thousands of Sun on Sunday readers either own one or work for one.You are the lifeblood of our economy — it’s your entrepreneurship, risk-taking and innovation that drives the entire economy.It’s your wealth creation that provides the income we all depend on for our public services, from funding our NHS to paying our brave Armed Forces.It also means that you might not be exporting — yet — because more than 90 per cent of companies aren’t currently seizing the opportunities of exporting.That’s where we can help.Government doesn’t manufacture products and doesn’t provide services for exporting.But we can help create the right conditions by intervening where only government can.We have created a network of Her Majesty’s Trade Commissioners to lead the Government’s trade and investment promotion and policy in high-growth regions across the world.And I as International Trade Secretary can step in and speak to foreign ministers about overcoming a trade barrier — as I did last week, when I signed a deal in Beijing to enable the UK to export seed potatoes to China or help a UK company close a deal in an overseas market or seal a partnership with a foreign company.And to support British businesses — whether they produce farm products, or manufacture playgrounds, or provide legal services — we are also creating a network of Export Champions, people who run businesses that successfully export, to guide their peers and share their expertise.As I’ve often said before, in the next ten to 15 years, around 90 per cent of global economic growth is expected to be outside the EU.I truly believe that Brexit is an ­opportunity.The positive response and engagement we’ve seen from the EU negotiators to the Chequers proposals makes me believe that a good deal is now more likely.At Chequers the Government agreed its proposal for an economic partnership with the EU after the UK leaves on March 29, 2019.It confirmed that the UK will leave the Single Market and the Customs Union and will seize new opportunities from trading with the rest of the world.That’s why the Prime Minister visited Africa, one of the fastest-growing regions in the world, this week.It’s why I visited China last week, and am visiting India later in the autumn, to ensure Britain can make the most of their breakneck growth.Booming countries across the globe are confident in Britain.They’re confident in our crucial role in supporting world prosperity, world security and world growth.If they have faith in us, we need to have more faith. Because a more confident Britain is a better Britain for the world.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

For a grown man to do that. Sick. Very sick. This is sad. Just sad.”“That’s horrible,” added David Cadogan, 40, a paramedic.“I got a son and nieces. I don’t play with stuff like that. There’s past a point where you tolerate certain behaviours.“I know people want to wait on the law. But if anything happens to him between now and then, I honestly don’t care.

But we owe it to children to do more. We must and I will.”In a strong hint of the ultimatum for tech firms coming today, Mr Javid adds: “I am also clear that all parts of society must play their part in this battle”.The Home Secretary also reveals the personal upset he has suffered since taking the job in April from detailed briefings on online child sex abuse.And he also revealed growth in horrific “abuse to order” services, where paedophiles direct abusers what to do to their victims over a two-way livestream.Mr Javid writes: “Invisible crime gangs are also now able to live stream these sick acts to online abusers for just over £10 – a quarter of what paedophiles were paying four years ago.“Abhorrent crimes where perverted offenders live stream the rape of innocent youngsters over a web cam – and are ordered to carry out gut-wrenching acts by their conspirators who are watching on a computer from the comfort of their own home.”He added: “They sicken me to the core. But I am also sickened by the sheer number of these vile abusers.“Horrifying cases like this leave an emotional scar on me as well.”Mr Javid will also offer more money today to the NCA and police forces fighting online child sex abuse.His ultimatum follows Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt’s searing attack on Google last week for refusing to cooperate with police forces to take down child abuse content.Children’s charity Barnardo’s last night welcomed Mr Javid’s new drive.Its chief executive Javed Khan said: “All children with access to the internet are potentially vulnerable to being groomed online and sexually or criminally exploited offline.“Of the victims of online grooming referred to Barnardo’s specialist support services, we know that nearly two thirds of them, some as young as 10, had also gone on to meet their attacker and were sexually exploited.”In a coordinated effort, the National Crime Agency also last night pleaded with tech companies to cooperate with police investigations more.Its officer in charge of child sexual abuse, Director Rob Jones, called on the California-based giants to be far more proactive on stopping sick material ever appearing on their platfroms.Mr Jones said: “The technology exists for industry to stop these images being shared.The monsters who commit these acts are beyond contempt.It’s staggering that there are 80,000 of them prowling the net — the equivalent of FOUR packed-out O2 arenas — and we must tackle these horrendous crimes with all the force Britain can muster.The police must be given the resources they need to find and pursue these twisted individuals.Social services and local council staff, who have in the past too happily looked away from systematic abuse in places like Rochdale and Rotherham, must be properly trained and report their suspicions accurately.But the tech companies who allow their platforms to be filled with depraved filth need to do more, too.Their deliberate ignorance is part of a pattern.Whether it’s far-right extremism, anti-Semitism or terrorist propaganda, firms such as Facebook and Twitter are all too happy to turn a blind eye.The web has turned into the Wild West, and the companies profiting from it refuse to play sheriff.If they continue to abandon their responsibilities, they can have no complaints if the Government steps in, sooner rather than later.The Home Secretary must act if the billionaires refuse to do so.Keeping our kids safe is all that matters.“Whilst some online platforms have taken important steps to improve safety, we are asking them to take it to the next step to innovate, to use their brightest minds, and to invest in preventing these online offences from happening in the first place.“That would significantly reduce the trauma to the victims whose images are shared, prevent other individuals from developing a sexual interest in children through accessing these images, and disrupt the methods used to access them.”National Police Chiefs Council lead for child protection Chief Constable Simon Bailey added: Only by working collaboratively with technology companies and law enforcement partners will we be able to minimise the risk posed to children online by predatory offenders.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It’s about a hundred from his email. And that means we’ve obviously been able to look very closely at how well-meaning those people are before we accept them.”Mr Banks himself was blocked by Tory chiefs from becoming a Tory party member two weeks ago.A row has exploded among pro and anti-Brexit Tory MPs on whether to welcome UKIP supporters back to the party.International Trade Secretary Liam Fox appeared to side with the Brexiteers yesterday by refusing to criticise Mr Banks.Dr Fox would only say: “I don’t comment on any one individual.“But people who believe that we believe are welcome in the Conservative Party.“If we get back people who voted UKIP before, who believe that having successfully delivered Brexit the Conservative Party is the best party to govern Britain they’re welcome in the Conservative Party.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He knows now.Last week, Field quit the Labour Party whip amid a barrage of “intolerance, nastiness and intimidation” from Corbyn outriders over his stand against anti-Semitism.Along with other moderate Labour MPs, he was battered by Twitter storms using the vilest language to wish him dead.Field bluntly accuses Jeremy Corbyn of racism and hints he is ready to force a by-election if kicked out of the Labour Party. Others facing deselection may follow suit.Leadership critics have endured relentless bullying and abuse, a trademark of the brutal machine which swept Jezza to power and intends to keep him there. As Frank Field himself now admits, Corbyn is going nowhere.The party might split but the ageing hippy “will lead Labour into the next election”. Corbyn’s sullen anti-Semitism triggered this revolt, but it is only a symptom of the sinister nature of hard-Left politics which brooks no criticism.Labour really is the Nasty Party. Jezza’s pro-Russian, anti-capitalist malcontents loathe everything the UK and other Western democracies stand for.They support some of the world’s most brutal tyrannies and catastrophic economies while railing against free speech and Press freedom.Corbyn sees no evil in these repressive forces and this week shelved an invitation from MI5 chiefs to show him the secret intelligence. On such evidence alone, it is fair to say Corbyn as PM would permanently damage this country, its freedoms and its prosperity.We knew all this when Ed Miliband threw open the party’s leadership to anyone with three quid to buy a vote. Thanks to his stunning act of stupidity, the “broad church” Labour Party of Clem Attlee, Hugh Gaitskell, John Smith and Tony Blair is history.It lives on in name only, an empty husk colonised by Momentum parasites who once fought the party they now own. Corbyn didn’t even want the job, telling supporters: “You’d better make f***ing sure I don’t win.”When he surprised himself by storming to victory in 2015, shell-shocked Blairite MPs assumed they could get rid of him if he stepped too far out of line.They tried that in 2016 — turning Jezza into the unassailable champion of the loony Left and handing over the keys to the asylum. Theresa May bolted him in place with her botched General Election. No wonder the Glastonbury millennials cooed: “Oh, Jeremy Corbyn.”Have we learned from Frank Field’s mistake? Or do we believe, as he did, voters will never be silly enough to give Corbyn the keys to power? Well, look at the polls. They show nobody much rates Jezza, but Labour remains neck and neck with the Tories.Theresa May has yet to navigate her way to a tricky Brexit deal with Brussels — or to a no-deal rejected by Commons Remainers. She has rightly turned her face against a second referendum, a democratic abomination.But who knows who will be leader by then? Boris Johnson is circling, helped by a growing team of sponsors and supporters. Mrs May would do anything to stop BoJo. She is even seeking official advice on another snap election gamble. Good luck with that, Theresa. But Remainers should be careful what they wish for.Corbyn, a fervent fan of arch-Eurosceptic Tony Benn, loathes the EU as much as the angry Labour supporters who voted Leave. But he would conveniently bury that hatred for the time being if it meant riding a Remainer wave into Downing Street.Pro-Brussels campaigner Keir Starmer would emerge, not for the first time, as a “useful idiot”.The Purge will have just begun.At a media event before his referendum, the ex-oil analyst confidently bet the price would not crash below 50 a barrel.

Sometimes you feel like Alfie is in him.She added: He frowns and stretches like Alfie, he is just a double. When I had him, I wondered what if he does resemble Alfie, how will I feel.Its nice to be able to say his name and feel positive.Emotional dad Tom was brought close to tears as he added: Sometimes you feel Alfie is in him. Youll say Alfie and Tom will smile. We will always have two children, no matter what.Were happy for what we had, and what we have still got because we have two amazing children and we will always have them.Alfies parents went to “hell and back” battling to keep their tragic son alive after he was believed to have been suffering from a degenerative brain disease.Alfie’s parents, from Liverpool, launched a legal bid to keep him alive after doctors applied to turn off his life support.Tom even flew to Rome to see Pope Francis when doctors in Italy offered to treat Alfie.But despite receiving an outpouring of support from the community - dubbed “Alfie’s Army”- the familys pleas were denied.Alfies life support was switched off despite pleas at the High Court, Court of Appeal, Supreme Court and European Court of Human Rights.Speaking today, dad Tom said the final days of his sons life were a waking nightmare, adding: You do everything you can for your kids like anyone else would at home. In the end it comes crashing down on you really.Kate added: Its the worst thing possible to go through. The first time I got told he was going to die it was like a physical feeling.I sort of knew it was going to come so I prepared myself for it, but you can’t prepare yourself. With the support I had round me we are holding it together.DECEMBER 2016: Alfie, seven months, is taken to Alder Hey Children’s Hospital after suffering seizures and goes into coma.DECEMBER 2017: Doctors say continued life-support treatment is not in the tot’s best interests.FEBRUARY 2018: High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden rules in hospital’s favour and says further treatment is futile.MARCH 2018: Parents Tom and Kate mount a challenge but decision is upheld.APRIL 2018: Supreme Court justices and the European Court of Human Rights reject a bid from Tom and Kate to consider Alfie’s case.APRIL 28: Alfie dies after life-support is switched off. His parents say: “We are heartbroken.”AUGUST 8: The couple’s second child, Thomas Evans, is born.Alfie died 100 hours later, with devastated Tom announcing on Facebook: “My gladiator lay down his shield and gained his wings.“Absolutely heartbroken. I love you my guy.”Pope Francis tweeted afterwards: “I am deeply moved by the death of little Alfie.I pray especially for his parents as God the Father receives him in his tender embrace.”The couple have since said they are pouring all their efforts into helping other sick children, no matter what condition they have.Both Kate and Tom carry a rare gene which sparked Alfie’s illness, so there were fears Thomas could inherit the same condition.A source said : “They have been left devastated by Alfie’s passing, but also vowed that they would carry on living for their son and are determined his death won’t break them.“It’s obviously tinged with sadness though as they know Alfie would have been a fantastic big brother, if only he’d managed to survive.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NINTCHDBPICT000350481218.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"german locals order british couple tear down patriotism temple","story":"Tree surgeon Gary Blackburn, 54, had created his Little Britain museum in the Rhineland of Germany to the general disapproval of locals, The Times reported.The free museum, crammed into a suburban garden in Linz, near Boon, was intended to bring Brits and Germans closer together but local authorities said it fell foul of building regulations.There’s no way of knowing if it was the double-decker buses, the life-sizes model of the Red Baron’s Fokker triplane, or the several Beefeaters that ticked off the locals.Equally it could have been the plastic daffodils, the bulls painted with Union Jacks, the wooden statue of the Mad Hatter or the cast of the Aardman film Shaun the Sheep.That doesn’t mean no locals enjoyed it.In May a party of Germans celebrated the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex by taking tea and biscuits next to a seated sculpture of the Queen.The order to shut up shop was reportedly prompted by objections from neighbours and ramblers on the Kasbach valley trail, which runs next to the park and over a patch of public nature reserve leased by Blackburn and his wife, Monika.Local resident Matthias Oppermann told the regional radio station Südwestrundfunk: “The tank stands there alongside figures of the Queen, Robin Hood and Mr Bean, and I think that just debases the whole thing.”Blackburn’s Little Britain even prompted a debate in the Rhineland-Palatinate state parliament.But it wasn’t the artefacts themselves that eventually led to the order, but Blackburn’s seeming total disregard for planning rules.A councillor said: “It’s not the district administration’s job to decide whether Little Britain is a jewel or an eyesore, repulsive or enchanting, tasteless or worthwhile.“Our duty is to ensure that the law is obeyed. The whole conflict is grotesque and could have proceeded much more objectively if certain basic rules were adhered to.”Blackburn wrote on his blog: “The mayor has asked us to demonstrate that we are ready to work together with the local community in a trustworthy fashion.”“So Little Britain is shut down and the Queen and Robin Hood find themselves behind closed doors.”Little Britain was set up two years ago with the intention of healing some of the wounds inflicted by Brexit.It remains to be seen if it has succeeded.In July local man Harald Hallerbach set up an online petition for the park to be saved.It has gained more than 1,000 signatures.One online commenter described Little Britain as “built with much love and is a terrific place to dive into another culture”.Others exhibited a typically German resistance: “I take my hat off to the civil servants responsible for this decision. Even to try and set up a petition against it is simply an expression of total ignorance of the relevant laws.”"},{"url":null,"title":"supermarket caught sticking googly eyes on fish to make them look fresher","story":"Kuwaiti police shut down the fish store on Saturday, the Al Bayan newspaper reported after they shared hilarious images of the fresh fish.One of the pictures posted online showed the fake eye slipping off the fishs face, clearly revealing a much more yellow eye underneath.As a joke, a fish company in Kuwait announced it was selling fish without cosmetics, alongside a picture of a fish and a selection of different coloured contact lenses.Social media users quickly mocked the shop owners attempt to get away with selling old fish with a series of hilarious memes that went viral.Twitter users tweeted a series of memes making fun of the googly eyed fish.Mohammed El Dahshan tweeted: Kuwaiti police has shut down a fish store that was sticking googly eyes on fish to make them appear more fresh than they are. :- via Al Bayan newspaper which got over 117k likes and over 62.5k retweets.Ashley Feinberg, another verified user, quoted the above tweet saying my strongest-held belief is that extremely creative crimes that dont involve maiming another person should be allowed.Some Twitter users took advantage of the situation to be punny.MBlockU, a verified user, quoted at El Dahshans tweet: Well this certainly looks fishy.

Theres some potential for thunder and hail.Also on Friday that becomes a little bit more widespread with a chance across much of the country.Meanwhile the heat appears to be playing havoc with Britains flora.Stunning pictures show a virginia creeper which has turned red unusually early at a historic country manor.Sandy Stewart noticed the breathtaking flower — which is meant to turn red during mid-to-late Autumn — turned red a month early.Sandy, 85, who lives at Ardvorlich House, Perthshire, said: It goes up like ivy outside the front half of the house.It normally turns red during Autumn but this year it has turned red unusually early.It is really stunning to look at because of the wonderful colour and I would say it gives the house a lot of character.We are certainly all chuffed by it.

The Birkenhead MP said he had huge support from people in his constituency, who had stressed I should simply get on with the job of representing Birkenhead. Therefore, I will not be calling a by-election, he said. The whole of my time will continue, as in the past, with trying to serve Birkenhead to the best of my ability and spearheading a whole series of major projects in the town. I also look forward to contributing further to the development of the Labour Party\u0027s programme of social and economic reform. Mr Field announced he would sit as an independent on Thursday after 40 years representing Labour in the Wirral seat. He said the party was seeing an erosion of our core values under Jeremy Corbyn , and cited a culture of intolerance, nastiness and intimidation among local members.  Speaking in nearby Liverpool on Monday as he prepared to travel across the north of England campaigning on transport issues, Mr Corbyn said: I\u0027m sorry he\u0027s resigned and I thank him for all the work that he\u0027s done as an MP and for the party, but I don\u0027t see why he had to resign.

The Tory record since 2010 is woeful after destructive tax rises and spending cuts in George Osborne’s so-called long -term economic plan snuffed out a promising recovery \u0026shyinherited from Gordon Brown’s Labour. Osborne’s successor as Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond watched, politically powerless in the Treasury, as Brexit extinguished much of what growth existed, plunging Britain into the relegation zone alongside Italy. The cost of austerity and Brexit’s lost years will be eye-boggling when the sums are finally calculated, costing every person in the country thousands of pounds.  We’re enduring inflation rising faster than incomes, low productivity and too many of the jobs created paying less than a living wage. Oh, and the Tories are still borrowing and a national debt now \u0026pound1.8trillion will continue to climb for years to come, despite the Conservatives fetishising reductions and vowing to balance the books by 2015. That four of Northern Europe’s 10 poorest regions are in the UK isn’t due to EU membership. Wales, North East England, Northern Ireland and Yorkshire \u0026amp Humberside struggle because British Governments in London fail them – not scapegoats in Brussels.  The anti-Semitism row damages Labour on two counts. Vile racism’s a uniquely poisonous stain on a movement preaching decency, Gordon Brown rightly arguing eradication is a battle for the party’s soul. And some of Jeremy Corbyn’s internal, as well as external political, opponents realise continued attacks consume oxygen a leader could otherwise use to champion Left-wing radical alternative answers. Theresa May is exhibit one by remaining mainly mute on Islamophobia in her own ranks while highlighting Labour’s woes.

In high school he’d been a hockey star and, when he left, he joined his family’s rubbish collection business. He had a bright future ahead of him. But before long, drug addictions had left Kyle, 29, in debt and he was increasingly distracted at work. His parents were upset they couldn’t get through to him, but they had no idea Kyle was working on an idea that would turn his life around. In May 2015, Kyle sent a text message to his girlfriend Jennifer Valiante saying he had come up with the ‘perfect plan’ that would ‘solve every single problem and give us a wealthy, amazing life.’ It got her interest. It seemed Kyle had found a way to get himself out of the rut he was in. Kyle’s parents, Jeffrey and Jeanette, owned J \u0026amp J Refuse, a rubbish collection business, in Easton, Connecticut. They’d given Kyle a job but knew he was a heroin addict. The couple were growing increasingly worried about their son.  They’d reached out to him about his drug use and offered to find him the help he desperately needed, but he’d refused. Jeffrey, usually a happy, positive man grew withdrawn. A friend later said that Jeffrey thought of nothing else but how they could help Kyle. A few years earlier, Jeffrey and Jeanette had helped their son buy a house, but he was falling behind with mortgage payments and bills. Finally, they decided it was time for some tough love. Jeffrey, 56, and Jeanette, 55, decided they were going to sell their company and stop financially supporting Kyle. Jeanette even told a friend they were ready to cut him out of their will, too. Somehow, Kyle found out. It motivated him to finally take control. It was then that he started to send his girlfriend text messages about his plan to fix everything and make them rich. He wrote about how he was going to ‘wipe out the virus and get money for life.’ On August 4, 2015, Jeanette and Jeffrey disappeared. Friends and family hoped they’d gone on an unannounced trip but their bank account was untouched and their pick-up truck was found abandoned in a car park. When questioned by police, Kyle claimed he and his mum had done a rubbish route together on the morning of August 4, and she’d been picked up by his dad afterwards.  It seemed like a plausible account and, at first, Kyle wasn’t a suspect. But he started to change his story, which aroused suspicion. Investigators looked into his phone records and discovered that Kyle’s mobile was in the same area as his parents’ phones on the day they vanished.  Two months later, their bodies were found in a wooded area close to a vacant house in nearby Weston. Workers had been clearing land and found their decomposed corpses in bags, buried under leaves. They’d been shot with a .40 calibre handgun. Police started to piece everything together – and Kyle was their prime suspect.  Murder supplies Investigators searched Kyle’s house. As well as drug paraphernalia, there was a blood stain that matched his dad’s DNA on a rug in the basement. There was also blood that matched his mum’s DNA in the boot of his truck. CCTV footage was found of Kyle and Jennifer at a local DIY store buying bleach, bin bags and drain unblocker – items police believe they used to try and cover-up the murders. They concluded that the ‘plan’ they’d been talking about for months was the murder of Jeanette and Jeffrey. They had been the ‘virus’ that Kyle talked about, and the way they were going to get wealthy was by inheriting their money before they could change their wills. Kyle and Jennifer, 31, were both arrested. Kyle was charged with murder and Jennifer was charged with conspiracy to commit murder and hindering prosecution. Investigators determined that Kyle had sat next to his mother in a garbage truck when she’d helped him out on his collection route. He’d pulled out a gun and shot her twice in the chest. His mobile phone records placed him at the scene. He then waited at home in the house his parents had bought him in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and a couple of hours later, he shot his father dead with the same gun.  Text messages Experts found text messages from Kyle to his dad on the day they were killed that suggested Jeffrey knew their lives were at risk, and he thought Kyle was going to set him up. ‘I’m not going home ‘till I know Mom is ok,’ Jeffrey wrote. ‘Did you hurt Mom?’ Kyle replied: ‘No absolutely not. Why would you think?’  ‘I go home and get framed for murder,’ Jeffrey replied. Kyle told him to stop being silly, and, although Jeffrey threatened to go to the police,  he must have gone to meet his son.  Kyle was held on a 2.5 million  bond and Jennifer’s was 2 million . At first, they both denied everything and pleaded not guilty. But the evidence was so convincing, they both changed their pleas. In April this year, the day before his trial was due to start, Kyle pleaded guilty to two counts of murder. He knew the damning text messages had sealed his fate and when prosecution indicated they would be used in the trial, he knew a jury would convict him.  When making his plea, the judge asked Kyle whether he agreed with the prosecutor’s version of how he killed his parents and he replied, ‘More or less’. At the sentencing, Kyle declined to make a statement publicly, saying he didn’t want to be a ‘show pony for the media.’ He was sentenced to serve 55 years for each of the murders and told they would run concurrently. He will not be eligible for early release. The judge called his actions ‘disgraceful and disgusting’. He pointed out that since 1986, there had only been 113 cases in the US of someone accused of killing their mother, adding that it was a ‘black-hearted crime’. ‘This idea of a killing by a child of his parents is exceedingly rare, it cuts against the fundamentals of our human condition, you don’t kill the people who gave life to you,’ he said. ‘One can only imagine the horror of Jeanette Navin when her son pulled a gun on her and shot her as she sat next to him.’ "},{"url":null,"title":"grandad who sank 10 pints","story":"NewsGrandad who sank 10 pints of lager before strangling wife to death in their marital bed jailed for seven yearsDavid Sadler, 62, killed wife Jill, 58, at their home in Moreton, Wirral, and blamed her for quickening the death of their daughterShare\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspCommentsByAlan Weston13:32, 3 SEP 2018Updated13:48, 3 SEP 2018NewsJill Sadler with her husband David, of Moreton, Wirral \"Get daily news updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A grandad who sank 10 pints of lager before strangling his wife to death in their marital bed has been jailed for seven years.

On Friday Sadler was cleared of murder following a nine-day trial, reports the Liverpool Echo .   Liverpool Crown Court heard the couple’s daughter, mum-of-two Joanne Reszczynski, 34, died of lung cancer in January this year.   Sadler said his wife’s “nastiness” in a sweary rant to Joanne before Christmas caused a permanent rift, which he felt hastened her death. He later told police: “I just snapped, she caused the death of my daughter. I was just fed up with all the pressure. She just went for me.” Today at Liverpool Crown Court Prosecutor Mr Denney read a victim impact statement Jill Sadler was loved, bubbly, and very sadly missed despite whatever flaws she had.     Judge Andrew Menary QC told the court: I accept you deeply regret what you did - you have lost the care and companionship of a woman you were married to for nearly 40 years. You have emphasised the bad times and forgotten the good times. She may have been loud and antagonistic, but she was also a loving mother and grandmother. She may have worn the trousers, but that is hardly a character fault. You felt that the actions of your wife contributed to the suffering of Jo.

The couple famously first met while studying at university in Scotland, but like any young love, they ran into difficult times and broke up for a brief period in March 2007, after dating for four years.  Like any heartbroken individual, Kate decided to take a trip after their split to get away and cheer herself up.   According to The Express , Kate headed to Ireland with her mother Carole Middleton and a group of her closest friends.   While there she visited Dublin and met with artist Gemma Billington, who would later attend her royal wedding in 2011.  Kate and Carole also explored the National Gallery of Ireland during their get away. The  reported that Kate politely declined to speak to reporters while at the gallery.  At this point it was not common knowledge that the pair had separated. Thankfully by June 2007, Kate and William had reconciled and were back together. They spoke about their time apart during their candid engagement interview in 2011. William said: We did split up for a bit.  We were both very young, it was at university and we were both finding ourselves and being different characters and stuff. It was very much trying to find our own way and we were growing up. It was just a bit of space. It worked out for the better. Kate admitted she wasn\u0027t happy about the break-up at the time, but in hindsight believes it was a good idea.

Dramatic video has emerged showing Caitlyn Rodriguez carrying the baby, which appears to be wailing, as she tries to flee officers. She allegedly sped away from police when they stopped a Mercedes-Benz SUV and discovered that she was wanted. The 29-year-old ended up smashing into the back of a truck before pulling the baby, in a portable car seat, out of the vehicle and running across a road in front of oncoming cars.  The incident happened on June 15, but aerial footage from a police helicopter was only recently released by the Texas Department of Public Safety. It shows the Mercedes weaving around other vehicles on a busy three-lane motorway, where it reached 100mph at times, as police follow behind. The SUV soon swerves to avoid a spike belt that a police officer had draped across the road, but it catches and pops the vehicle\u0027s front left tyre.  The vehicle speeds across a grassy median and onto a slip road as the two left wheels appear to briefly lift off the ground. It then drives the wrong way and blows through a red light as the tyre disintegrates. After the SUV ploughs into the back of a truck at a red light, Rodriguez, wearing blue jeans and a black top, jumps out and runs around to the passenger side.  As smoke seeps out of the crumpled bonnet, she grabs the baby and runs from the crash scene. She struggles to carry the car seat and runs in front of a car as she crosses the road. Rodriguez then passes in front of a white SUV before opening the door and jumping into the passenger side with the baby on her lap.

From women getting Kinder Eggs stuck in their vaginas, to men pulling their toes off - they\u0027ve seen it all. But one group of doctors have just been faced with a bizarre task they\u0027ve never had to deal with before, as a rather embarrassed 31-year-old man was admitted to ASST Great politan Hospital in Niguarda, Italy with a 23-inch sex toy stuck inside himself.  The unnamed man had been attempting to remove the toy for 24 hours before seeking medical assistance. He told doctors he was suffering from mild abdominal pain, but had no other serious symptoms.  His x-rays revealed a long and large-sized foreign body in his colon. Traditional removal tools such as a polypectomy snare and biopsy forceps were tried by the doctors, but all failed to retrieve the sex toy due to its smoothness and size.  Baffled, doctors were forced to get creative and invent a new method of removal. They threaded a piece of wire through a catheter to create a sort of noose. This was inserted into the man\u0027s body, with the wire end wrapping around the sex toy and being tightened until the item was able to be pulled out. The patient was discharged later that day.  Writing in a case study for the British Medical Journal , Dr Lorenzo Dioscoridi revealed the team: built a home-made device inserting a 0.035 inch non-hydrophilic guidewire doubled into an 8.5 Fr stent-pusher-catheter serving as an outer sheet in order to create a noose and we finally succeeded in the endoscopic extraction of the device. He added: We suggest this new technique as a valid option to remove large foreign bodies from the colon and rectum when standard endoscopic methods for foreign bodies extraction fail.

It protects the head, neck and spine better in a crash, said Kerry Chausmer, director of certification at Safe Kids , a charity that helps prevent childhood injury.  Kids are actually safer rear-facing, not just their head, neck and spine, but also their legs, so it\u0027s perfectly fine if kids\u0027 legs hit the back of the car seat, she added. Car crashes are the leading cause of death for children over the age of four in the US.

Thomas Cook customer Janice Bowles, 58, was reportedly trapped underneath the inflatable off the coast of Hurghada, in Egypt, on August 28. The Bristol grandmother was on holiday with her two daughters and other family, who have paid tribute to her following her death. The incident happened one week after tourists John and Susan Cooper, who had also booked with Thomas Cook, died after falling ill at the five-star Steigenberger Aqua Magic Hotel.  Ms Bowles\u0027 grief-stricken daughter Annmarie Cox paid tribute to her on Facebook, writing: It is with the heaviest heart that I am having to write this status. Unfortunately whilst my mum Janice Bowles was on holiday in Egypt, there was an accident and she sadly passed away. I am broken inside and don\u0027t know how to get my head around it. It is such a devastating shock to the whole family. She was the funniest, kindest, most loving mother I know and if I can aspire to be half the woman she is I know I\u0027ll do my girls proud.  I love you momma and cant believe I\u0027ll never hear your voice or get to make you p*** yourself laughing. Sleep tight you beautiful angel, visit me often please momma. Devastated relatives who were with Ms Bowles posted snaps online from the holiday, showing her onboard a boat and relaxing on an inflatable at a hotel swimming pool. They also posted family photos which show her using a wheelchair back at home in the UK. One holidaymaker told the Sun that Ms Bowles was part of a group that had been on a dolphin-watching tour and were taking turns on inflatables on the way back to the beach. He said: I could hear the woman\u0027s daughter wailing, as she knew that there was something seriously wrong with her mum.  They got the lady back on an they were doing chest compressions, but at no point were there any breaths given. Thomas Cook said it is investigating after it emerged the woman was on a holiday booked through the travel firm when the incident occurred. A Thomas Cook spokesman said: We can confirm that one of our customers sadly died last week while on an excursion in Egypt. We would like to offer our sincere condolences to the family, and our welfare team continue to do all they can to support them at this time. We are urgently investigating what happened. A Foreign Office spokesman said: Our staff are assisting the family of a British woman who has died in Hurghada.

Captain Richard de Crespigny was about to turn off the seatbelt sign on Flight QF32 when he heard a relatively small boom just four minutes after takeoff. A second later, he heard an enormous boom that was unlike anything he\u0027d ever heard before - and suddenly found himself in a life-or-death emergency. As he and his colleagues carried out urgent checklists, a trail of smoke, flames and debris filled the sky and terrified passengers feared they might die.  Some, who had been watching the takeoff on the plane\u0027s in-flight video, looked on in horror as pieces of the disintegrated engine were blown away.   The blast left wires exposed and short bursts of flames shooting through the air. Inside the cockpit, Capt de Crespigny desperately battled to save the lives of those onboard the 464-tonne aircraft - while repeatedly reassuring passengers.  He and his colleagues spent two hours in the air assessing the plane\u0027s damage and carefully planning their landing, the pilot writes in a new book, FLY! .  This included how far along the runway the aircraft would stop. They discovered it would come to a halt only 139m short of the end of it - and, in the event of overunning it, there would be disastrous consequences. A paddock, an access road, sand dunes and ocean were beyond the runway - so Capt de Crespigny needed to pull up quickly enough, according to the book. The flight, from London\u0027s Heathrow Airport to Sydney Airport, Australia, had taken off from Singapore\u0027s Changi Airport for the second leg of the journey.  The engine blew at 10.01am and the plane stopped on the runway at 11.46am. Remarkably, all of the passengers and the 29 crew members onboard survived the emergency on November 4, 2010, with no reports of any injuries. One Brit later said: When we got off and saw the engine itself and the back casing burnt off, that was pretty scary. I\u0027m just happy to be alive.  In a captivating extract of his book, published by news.au, Capt De Crespigny details the moments before and after the horrifying engine explosion.  An experienced pilot who loved his job, he says he experienced a perfect takeoff, with the aircraft\u0027s four Rolls-Royce Trent 900 engines \u0027roaring\u0027 into life. However, things soon turned disastrous. As we passed 6,000 feet it really was looking like a picture-book day, he says.  We climbed up through 7400 feet and at 10.01 I was about to turn off the seatbelt sign when we heard a relatively small boom, followed one second later by a huge BOOM! which was like nothing I’d ever heard before. He goes on to describe how a ‘stub pipe’ - which had not been manufactured to the correct specifications - inside engine two had fractured. Oil had leaked out into the engine, resulting in a fire, according to the book. Shockingly, the boom sound had come from hundreds of bits of shrapnel shooting through the engine, as its computers increased the fuel flow. For the next two hours, the crew worked on landing the Airbus A380 safely back at the same airport, knowing they would inevitably come in too fast and heavy. They would also have a broken wing and little roll control. After deciding to carry out \u0027control checks\u0027, Capt de Crespigny began the landing - while SPEED! and, later STALL! sounded from the plane\u0027s computers.  When the plane finally touched down and came to a stop - 3900m along the runway - it was met by fire crews who hosed its white-hot brakes with water. The pilot describes in the book how he was unable at one point to turn off engine one - which kept running despite several attempts to kill it. It was only hours later that it could be eventually stopped, By this time, shaken passengers, who had been kept calm by the cabin crew, had been able to safely disembark the aircraft down some stairs. Some later spoke out about their ordeal. As reported by the Mirror at the time, Briton Mike Tooke was watching the in-flight footage of the takeoff, shot from the tail plane, when the engine exploded. He said: Suddenly there was a loud bang and a puff of white smoke from one of the left-hand engines. Everyone let out a very large gasp, we all knew something had gone terribly wrong.  There was quite a lot of vibration as soon as the engine had pretty much disintegrated. We could see parts of the engine had blown away. Other fliers recalled how the aircraft \u0027vibrated\u0027 in the skies above Indonesia. Passenger Matt Hewitt, from Cheshire, said: There were smoke trails running from the wing. Some people saw the actual breakage of the wing. There were parts sticking up and wires hanging out. Another passenger added that she thought “this was the end”. As the emergency unfolded, Capt De Crespigny was reported to have calmly told people onboard the plane: I\u0027m sure you realise there\u0027s a problem. We have to find out what the problem is. He later successfully made the emergency landing back at Changi.

The freighter, called Sam Ratulangi PB 1600, was discovered by fishermen off Myanmar\u0027s commercial capital of Yangon. The navy in Myanmar say the huge container ship was being towed by a tugboat to a ship-breaking factory in Bangladesh but the crew abandoned the ship when they were caught up in bad weather. Authorities and navy personnel had boarded the Sam Ratulangi PB 1600 on Thursday to search for clues after it ran aground on a beach. Police and observers were baffled at how such a large ship, with no sailors or goods on board, had ended up in Myanmar.  The vessel, which was built in 2001, measures more than 580ft long, according to the Marine Traffic website. The location it was last recorded on the website was off the coast of Taiwan in 2009 and its discovery is the first reported instance of an abandoned ship appearing in Myanmar\u0027s waters, according to the AFP news agency. On Saturday, Myanmar\u0027s navy said it suspected the ship had been towed by another ship after two cables... were found at its head.  They later found a tugboat, called Independence, about 50 miles off Myanmar\u0027s coast. After questioning the 13 Indonesian crew members on board, they learned that the tugboat had been towing the vessel since 13 August, and intended to take it to a factory in Bangladesh that would dismantle and salvage the ship. However, some of the cables attached to the boat broke in bad weather, and they decided to abandon the ship.

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed. The shops at the Victorian Market shut at 5pm. Staying open later and having maybe street entertainers there in the evening could attract more people.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04106000/04106341.jpg","title":"Dont miss chance to nominate a hero","story":"TIME is running out to nominate someone you know to be one of this year\u0027s Highland Heroes.The awards, organised by SPP Media and now in their second year, celebrate people in the Highlands who make a real difference to our communities, healthcare, education, safety and wellbeing.Readers are being invited to nominate people in any of the 12 categories: primary pupil, secondary pupil, primary teacher, secondary teacher, carer, fundraiser, volunteer, community champion, brave child, health professional, emergency services or armed forces hero and public servant.The deadline for nominations is midnight tomorrow.SPP Media\u0027s editorial director David Bourn said: \"This is a last call for you to tell us about the real heroes who go above and beyond to make your community, workplace or school a special place.\"Highland Heroes wants to celebrate the contribution people in our area make to the lives of others by giving them the recognition they deserve.\"So if you know a Highland Hero, now is the time to share their story.\"To nominate somebody for the awards, visit www.surveymonkey/r/HighlandHeroes2018 or email heroes@spp-group with your name, address, email and phone number, along with the person you are nominating, up to 200 words to explain why, and their contact details.After the deadline closes, a judging panel will draw up a shortlist in each category before readers are given the opportunity to vote for their favourites in a special supplement we will publish in September.The winners of each category, along with an overall hero, will be announced at a ceremony at the Kingsmills Hotel in Inverness on Thursday, November 8.The awards are sponsored by Inverness Airport.* Click here to read more about Highland Heroes.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117280.jpg","title":"Exhibition plans revealed after dinosaur find","story":"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIt comes amid excitement at the recent discovery of dinosaur footprints near the city \u0026ndash the first time they have been discovered on the Scottish mainland.Inverness museum, which is bidding for \u0026pound15,500 from the Inverness Common Good Fund to stage the exhibition, says British Dinosaurs will have the \u0026ldquowow factor and believes it would benefit the city centre.In its application for funding, the museum stated: \u0026ldquoThere is huge public demand for a dinosaur exhibition but to date we have not been able to fulfil this demand because our venue is too small and the high costs involved are unaffordable.\u0026ldquoHowever, we have managed to source an exhibition which will be tailored for Inverness Museum and Art Gallery which will have the wow factor.The exhibition, set to take place between November and late January, will contain casts of dinosaur skeletons including a plesiosaur, the type suggested to be the Loch Ness Monster.Objects from Perth Museum and the Dinosaur Museum in Skye will also be on show plus interactive and holographic displays.Exhibitions officer Cathy Shankland said if it goes ahead, it would involve extending the usually reduced winter hours.\u0026ldquoEveryone loves dinosaurs, she said.\u0026ldquoThe fact there has been the discovery of footprints on the city\u0027 doorstep makes it even more exciting.Alison Parfitt, collections engagement curator, said High Life Highland services had run a summer activity programme with a dinosaur focus while a creative challenge, the Design-a-Saurus, is being developed with a strong science, technology, engineering and maths focus.Dr Neil Clark, curator of palaeontology at the Hunterian Museum in Glasgow, announced last week he had found dinosaur footprints, thought to be 170 million years old, at a coastal site near Inverness.- The latest applications to the Inverness Common Good Fund will be presented to the city committee on Thursday.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04013000/04013055.jpg","title":"Highland Council clampdown over budget worries","story":"HIGHLAND Council chiefs are bashing out revised proposals to defer spending, accelerate savings and \u0026ldquorestructure recruitment to avert a \u0026pound5.1 million budget overspend.A bitter political row overshadowed a resources committee debate on it. Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0027 vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0027 making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary.

It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0027 deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0027 the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline.

That is how it played out.“Steve is one of the game’s good guys but when I saw his phone ringing me when we finished training on Friday morning it was never really going to be anything that would be welcomed by us at that late stage.“How can you replace McKenna with five or six hours to go in a transfer window?“The figure that they offered wasn’t enough anyway but certainly the timing was the biggest factor in all of it.“We picked up an injury to Tommie Hoban and with Mark Reynolds out it is in not an area where we would have a lot of options.“So we wanted to have enough time to try to address that if the offer had been significant enough for us to accept it.“And it wasn’t.”McInnes was frustrated at the decision to dismiss Devlin just five minutes into the game and refused to rule out an appeal.He was also disappointed that referee Craig Thomson awarded a free-kick that Kilmarnock netted the opener from.He said: “We will look at maybe appealing that if it is going to be worthwhile.“But sometimes these things aren’t worthwhile.“I feel disappointed with some of the decisions.“It is tough when you go down to 10 men so early on.“Rightly or wrongly, whether he has deemed that as the last man going through, that is debatable to say the least.“We feel really aggrieved by the build-up to their first goal.“It was actually the player’s bad control on his own arm and the momentum pushed it forward in his own path and he got that side of my full-back Max Lowe.“That should have been deemed a hand ball.“My first thought was Graeme Shinnie had won the ball when Craig Thomson blew for the free-kick.“Brophy scored a fantastic goal over the wall which is well executed but there is a clear handball in the build-up.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/sports.jpg ","title":"aberdeens the perfect playground for freshers articleisfree","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFor students just starting at one of Aberdeen’s colleges or universities it can be daunting trying to figure out where to eat, drink and exercise.If you don’t know where to go, or have people to point you in the right direction, you can be lost in a sea of possibility.There’s so much on offer.

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process. If we want to find a treatment or cure for disorders of memory like Alzheimer’s disease then we need to have a test of memory in animals that is analogous to human memory tests.\u0026#8217Steve Bargeton, St Andrews\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"do you want to see inveraray bank crumble","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 05/08/18, 6:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowAnn Thomas\u0026#8217 latest cartoon depicts the growing worry over the potential closure of Inveraray\u0026#8217s branch of the Royal Bank of Scotland.The branch has been threatened with closure since the end of 2017, prompting protests and petitions.The status of the branch is still undecided and the bank remains open for now.The opportunity to have a say is quickly closing, with an online petition set to be hand-delivered by the person who initially set it up, Mid Argyll writer and journalist Marian Pallister.The petition will be handed over in Inveraray on Wednesday August 8.To sign online, visit the 38degrees website and search for ‘RBS Inveraray’.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor week 32","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 12/08/18, 6:15 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Sir,At the latest Mid Argyll, Kintyre and Islands meeting I stated a large number of my younger constituents have been contacting me in regards to the availability of housing.While a greater number of affordable rental accommodation is more than welcome, a larger amount of affordable housing to buy needs to be built across Argyll.I was also very happy at a recent meeting with my fellow Conservative councillors to discuss the huge importance of having a more streamlined planning service that helps rather than hinders economic strength across Argyll and Bute.An effective planning system plays an important role in supporting growth – promoting and enabling the homes, jobs and services that communities need, creating a more competitive local economy and minimising uncertainty and delay for those proposing or affected by development.We in Argyll are seeing a tremendous increase in our industrial output and we as a council must not place barriers in the way of future growth in this area.Councillor Alastair Redman, Islay.Sir,I\u0026#8217m calling on Argyll and Bute\u0026#8217s small shopkeepers to enter the Best Small Shops competition, celebrating the creativity of small shops and the central role they play in their local community.Argyll and Bute is a hub of small local retailers, many of which are a lifeline.The Best Small Shops competition is open to any small shop operating in the UK. The competition is free to enter and all shops who enter will also be promoted to consumers through an online Indie Retail Directory.Shopkeepers can nominate their businesses until Sunday September 9 via bestsmallshops. A shortlist of 25 of the most impressive applications will be shortlisted by a panel made up of established representatives from the independent retail industry.The judges will be looking for evidence of a small shops\u0026#8217 entrepreneurial spirit, ways that they have been innovative in their business and what they have done to have a lasting positive impact on their community.The shortlisted small shops will be invited to a parliamentary reception on November 13 to meet their Member of Parliament and find out who will be crowned Best Small Shop 2018.Argyll and Bute has an amazing array of small shops which help support our rural economy and I would love to see them recognised.Brendan O\u0026#8217Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,Since when is it okay for a man to stand in a layby and urinate in broad daylight?It has become more noticeable in recent years and is never a pleasant sight.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray. They searched all the places they had visited, including the George, but the keys were not found, so they returned to Cairnbaan by taxi.Fortunately the hotel found the keys and managed to make contact with them, and they returned to Inveraray by taxi to collect the keys from the staff who had been kind enough to wait for them.Once again I would to thank you for your help in making my guests\u0026#8217 stay memorable.Pauline Houston, Crinan Canal CottageSir,I was very happy to attend this year\u0026#8217s Islay, Jura and Colonsay Agricultural Show.It was great to hear about the terrific work being done by the Islay Development Initiative with their Islay Pollinator Initiative which generates employment, including two Modern Apprentices in Beekeeping.I spoke to local farmers about single farm payment delays, feed prices, fuel prices, broadband speed and the poor quality of our infrastructure. I also met with the Islay Book Festival team and heard from my constituents from across Islay, Jura and Colonsay about numerous local issues, all of which will addressed.A huge thank you to all the hard-working volunteers who helped make this year\u0026#8217s show possible.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and the Islands ward\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 33","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 19/08/18, 2:04 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There has been talk of a new rugby pitch for a while, but plans presented to community councillors on Monday go further than that.We hope everyone involved is as enthusiastic as Mid Argyll Rugby Club and more power to their elbow.This year\u0026#8217s has to go down as one of the best Mid Argyll Shows in recent times.The weather helped bring out the crowds in big numbers, but the real credit must go to the volunteers who organise the show.

All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit.

and the Caribbean island of Barbados.\nFirst screened on Tuesday , Scots in Paradise features the Barbados Celtic Festival \u0026ndash a large cultural get-together held in and around the capital Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion

National Piping Centre, led by Fifer Ian Lowther.\nSheila Sapkota from Selkirk\u0026rsquos Riddell Fiddle made headlines in Barbados this year when she performed with Jenni Borthwick, Robbie Sapkota

playing Scottish songs taught to them by the St Patrick\u0026rsquos head teacher, Glasgow born Sister Pauline Dempsey.\nAnd several of Sheila\u0027s performances were caught on camera for the STV programme Scots in Paradise.\nThis year\u0027s Barbados Celtic Festival closed with a ceilidh, presented by local dancers from the island\u0026rsquos Scottish Dance Society, led by Scottish ex pat Ken Thomson.\nThe Celtic festival celebrates the shared history between Scots and the people of Barbados.\nAround the 1700s, Scottish and Irish immigrants were shipped all over the Caribbean to be indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as Glasgow.\nA small community still lives in what is known as \u0026lsquoScotland District\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash an area of the island that became home to settlers when they eventually gained their freedom.\nAny musicians interested in taking part in next year\u0026rsquos Massed Band events in May 2019 can sign up at www.barbadoscelticfestival.\nScots in Paradise will be available to watch on

report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

link-up has been brought to my attention.This is something I strongly agree with \u0026#8211 if we are to encourage tourism and over all business growth on the island then joined up transport links are a must.Other issues mentioned included high roadside verges leading to roads being flooded, BT cabling not being properly buried and being left exposed at the side of roads, slow internet speed, poor mobile phone signal and many other issues.There has been some good progress with road repairs with many of the potholes that I had reported to our council\u0026#8217s roads department being now fixed, however there is still more that needs to be done.Also some of the much needed and long overdue association housing repairs have taken place but only after much pressure from tenants and myself and even then the wait was unacceptably long.The sight of more and more of our Union flags on display each time I visit Gigha is fantastic.As I said after my previous Isle of Gigha surgery I will work

grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats

local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus

And while a little young to be enjoying a champagne celebration, Maisie will be returning to her Upper Stratton home as one of the youngest actors to have starred in an Oscar-winning film.      THE.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.  Tim Porteus, Prestonpans storyteller and Courier columnist, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom disappointed. I recognise the council is under pressure to make cuts but they should say that it what is about: saving money."},{"url":null,"title":"merger-of-prestonpans-schools-proposed","story":"  East Lothian Council launches a public consultation exercise on Monday where members of the public are asked for their thoughts on the potential move.  If approved, the merger would follow the expected merger of Haddington Infant School and King\u0026rsquos Meadow Primary School, which have Jacqui McKinnon, headteacher at Cockenzie Primary School, as interim headteacher until their formal merger goes ahead.  According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, was surprised to hear the news.  He said: \u0026ldquoFirstly, I would like to see the details of it and what is behind the proposals because the infant school is a superbly-run school and works exceptionally well.  \u0026ldquoThe primary school is a very well-run and successful school as well \u0026ndash we have got two very well-run and successful schools.  \u0026ldquoWe would need to look at what the implications are.  Fiona Robertson, East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos head of education, stressed the local authority was \u0026ldquoabsolutely committed to continuously improving the quality of education at the two schools.  She said: \u0026ldquoOur Education Service Local Improvement Plan sets out a range of key outcomes, one of which is to ensure consistency in our approaches to planning learning, teaching and assessment.  \u0026ldquoWe believe that the proposal to establish a single school operating under a single management team offers the best solution to ensuring this consistency, improving transitions for children, and will deliver considerable educational benefits to all of the schools\u0026rsquo children and young people.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.  The consultation runs to October 2, with drop-in sessions held at both schools next month.  Prestonpans Infant School hosts a consultation event on September 4 from noon to 5pm, with the primary school event taking place a week later between the same times.  Finally, a public meeting takes place on September 26 from 7pm at Preston Lodge High School.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"action-promised-on-beach-eyesore","story":"  The sewage pipe on West Beach became visible for about 500 yards of the beach, one of the town\u0026rsquos most popular visitor attractions, as a result of the \u0026lsquoBeast from the East\u0026rsquo that plunged the county under snow for several days in March.  Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.  As well as being an eyesore at a popular tourist spot, sand and rocks collect around the pipe and are then blasted by the tide at the sea wall, causing it damage.  The town\u0026rsquos community council has long voiced concerns over the issue and claims houses overlooking the iconic West Beach are \u0026ldquoin danger.  North Berwick Community Council  contacted Scottish Water over the issue and the company\u0026rsquos response was read out at a NBCC meeting last week.  A letter from Brian Lironi, director of corporate affairs, said: \u0026ldquoWe are not able to re-lay this section of pipe. However, following an inspection of it, we plan to carry out some work on the casing around the laterals and raised manhole columns.  \u0026ldquoThis work will take place outside of the bathing season when the laterals are more exposed and the beach is less busy. This should help to improve the aesthetic of the pipe.  The letter added: \u0026ldquoOn the point of erosion, we do not believe our pipe is to blame for this. With that said, I am asking for this to be looked at in more detail as it is important that we take an evidence-led approach. This will not happen during the bathing season.  Mr Lironi said the community council would be kept informed of any developments.  Spring 2018 was not the first time that severe weather saw the sewage pipe badly exposed. The pipe was clearly visible in the aftermath of storms in December 2010 and it took many, many months before the tides re-covered it with sand."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  HADDINGTON...

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.  Iain said the band, which was formed in 1969 and continued following the tragic death of lead singer Ronnie Van Zant in 1977, were \u0026ldquoamazing live but also \u0026ldquolovely people.  He added: \u0026ldquoThey are down to earth, very friendly people in my experience and the people that formed the band are very approachable.  \u0026ldquoI have been very, very fortunate that I have been given access to the band over the years.  \u0026ldquoThat is something most fans would simply not get and I think that is down to trust and trusting me not to take advantage of their generosity.  The 55-year-old was delighted to be asked to write the foreword for the book, which is now available online.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure.

High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level.

However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come. This is a signal to developers we want to grow the number of jobs around the county.  The committee voted by nine votes to two to support the officials\u0026rsquo recommendation to refuse the plans."},{"url":null,"title":"transport-co2-emissions-on-the-rise-in-east-lothian","story":"  The latest data from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has revealed that CO2 emissions from freight and passenger transport rose by 4.2 per cent in the county between 2011 and 2016.  That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Duo Gymnastics, based at the Aubigny Sports Centre, Haddington, is keen to buy a new vaulting table, which costs about \u0026pound1,000.  Jane said: \u0026ldquoWhat I have been really impressed with is the way the club and coaches have adapted to him.  \u0026ldquoThere is mainstream gymnastics but they have adapted lessons for his needs.  \u0026ldquoIt has made him not feel different and he still feels part of the club \u0026ndash he really enjoys it.  \u0026ldquoCameron\u0026rsquos disability comes under Global Development Delay.  \u0026ldquoHe has a real difficulty with comprehension and understanding what is being asked of him, following instructions.  \u0026ldquoHe is also very sensitive to noise and sudden loud noises.  \u0026ldquoThat is what they have managed to do really well, break it down into small parts for him.  \u0026ldquoThrough time, it becomes a routine and he understands what is being asked of him.  Jane, who lives near Gifford, has been a keen swimmer for a number of years and represented Scotland in the 1994 Commonwealth Games, in Canada.  However, after a break from swimming she returned to the pool at the beginning of the year before swapping the pool for the sea earlier this summer.  She said: \u0026ldquoI kept swimming as a hobby and to keep fit.  \u0026ldquoI have always swam but it has always been indoor swimming.  \u0026ldquoI started looking about and had always had an interest in open-water swimming but never did it.  \u0026ldquoI came across the Firth of Forth swim and that quite appeals to me and thought I would give it a go.  The mum-of-two signed up in March for the swim, which sees swimmers head off from Hawes Pier and swim alongside the Forth Bridge towards North Queensferry.  Swimmers set off at 2.10pm and have an hour to complete the 1.4-mile swim.  In preparation for the fundraiser on September 22, Jane has taken to the waters off Dumfries and Galloway\u0026rsquos coast and has also linked up with the Bass Rock Swimmers, who are based in North Berwick.  Despite being an accomplished swimmer, Jane said there were still challenges.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe currents are certainly a big factor.  \u0026ldquoIt is just your awareness and you can go off track very easily and just that anticipation of what is below you and what you are swimming over.  \u0026ldquoI have enjoyed the challenge and it has certainly put me out of my comfort zone.  \u0026ldquoI have really enjoyed it and met some really lovely people.  \u0026ldquoMy thanks go to my husband, Garry, and family for support and encourage to take on the challenge and to Duo Gymnastics Club for the support and help they have given Cameron.  Pamela Fletcher, from the gymnastics club, said: \u0026ldquoThanks to Jane undertaking the swim, the club can purchase a new and much needed vaulting table for the gymnastics at Aubigny Sport Centre. Due to local support we have now met our target however donations continue meaning we can hopefully purchase some more equipment. Our club trains twice a week however classes are ran Monday to Friday through enjoyleisure so the equipment is well used by over 200 local gymnasts.

I\u0026rsquom now in my late 50s, and 60 is looming ahead of me like a cat waiting to pounce and have cruel fun. Yet I know people who are in their 30s and 40s who are much older than me, and folk in their 60s and above who are younger. My oldest daughter is in her early 20s and is already lamenting the fact she is no longer \u0026lsquoyoung\u0026rsquo.  The truth is that age is a mentality or, as is often said, \u0026lsquojust a number\u0026rsquo. Of course, deteriorating health and pain can come with age, as I have experienced, but even then, getting this far makes me very thankful despite the wear and tear.  I often say that life is like toothpaste: we use it with abandon at first and then, as we realise it\u0026rsquos running out, each squirt becomes increasingly more precious and satisfying.  \u0026ldquoA whole summer seems nothing these days, it\u0026rsquos over before you get used to it, a friend said to me recently. And indeed it is nothing if we measure it by days passed.  Yet if we measure not the passing of hours, days or years but the accumulation of memories and experiences, then time seems longer, both in quantity and quality. The trick, then, is to make those experiences and memories, and to truly live in them as they happen. This means understanding what is truly meaningful to us, and what gives genuine joy and fulfilment.  I think that is the secret to a long life, regardless of what number you reach. It\u0026rsquos not just about how much toothpaste is in your tube, it\u0026rsquos about how much you savour and use the amount you have. All of us savour key moments, of course. The first day at school for our children, our holiday time, time with friends or spent doing things we enjoy.  Yet inevitably such moments are less common than what we might call the daily routine of life. I suppose that\u0026rsquos what makes them stand out. Thus the daily routine of \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo life shoots us by, almost without us noticing. And that\u0026rsquos most of our life.  And so I am now more determined than ever to make my life \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo for as long as I may have left. This isn\u0026rsquot a commitment to hippy living in a campervan  but a conscious decision to savour every day as if it were my last. And what really helped me in this realisation was a conversation one day while waiting for a train. . .  One spring morning just before this summer, I was standing on the platform at Prestonpans station waiting for a train. I was not used to getting this early train and was surprised how busy it was. I was heading into Edinburgh to do some storytelling and so unusually sharing my journey with commuters.  It was a beautiful warm sunny morning, the herald of the heatwave soon to arrive. As I waited for the train I scrolled on my phone. Then I heard a voice behind me saying: \u0026ldquoOn your death bed, will you really look fondly back on the countless hours, equivalent to years of your life, spent scrolling on a phone? Will you remember just one per cent of that activity, or even want to?  I turned round to see who was speaking to me there was nobody. Then I noticed the hawthorn tree.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos better, the hawthorn said. It was resplendent with blossom, leaning over the edge of the side of the bridge which takes the cars below the station.  Perhaps I had seen it before, but this time I really noticed it because it had spoken to me. I studied its flowers and took in the immense beauty of it. It\u0026rsquos perfectly situated to admire, but the hawthorn seemed sad.  \u0026ldquoCan you imagine the effort it takes to get this magnificent and beautiful? it said. \u0026ldquoYet nobody seems to notice me.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure they do, I replied. \u0026ldquoNo, they don\u0026rsquot watch, insisted the tree. And so I did.  The hawthorn was right. People walked past the tree, stood next to it, but nobody seemed to notice it, and certainly nobody took any time to admire it.  \u0026ldquoBut they are busy, I said in our defence.  \u0026ldquoWe are all busy in different ways, said the tree. \u0026ldquoBut we can choose to be \u0026lsquotoo busy\u0026rsquo for some things while being busy doing others. Often you decide what is important to be busy with so you exclude what you think are the less important things.  \u0026ldquoLike looking and admiring you? I replied sarcastically.  \u0026ldquoPrecisely, said the hawthorn, perhaps not understanding a sarcastic tone.  Suddenly the train arrived. People put away their phones and I bade a hasty farewell to the tree. We all crammed into the carriage and it filled up to the brim. I saw the blazing white of the hawthorn\u0026rsquos blossom through the window. Then we headed for Wallyford.  The train ground to a halt and the doors opened. There was a crush and people calling out politely \u0026ldquoplease move up. I wondered if everyone would get on, and I think they did, but only just. Now the train felt overloaded and it literally ground its way out of the station.  When it arrived at Musselburgh, the doors opened to present a human wall made of commuters from the Pans and Wallyford. There was simply no way anyone was getting on. I watched from the privilege of my seat. Two young men with suitcases, obviously going on holiday had no chance, and didn\u0026rsquot even try.  As the train pulled away, leaving dozens of people stranded on the platform, I felt a sense of guilt at having a seat. At Waverley we were trapped in a bottleneck by ticket collectors, ensuring that none of the lucky ones who had actually managed to get onto the train would escape paying for their good fortune.  When I returned I had to cross the bridge to my car. And there was the hawthorn tree, showing off its blossom like a peacock trying to impress a mate with its feather display.  And I have noticed the hawthorn ever since. The blossom faded as summer arrived and now it bears it berries. Its haws glisten where once there was blossom, reminding me that summer has had its course, and asking the question of how I made it memorable.  I am so thankful for the hawthorn\u0026rsquos advice. It was simple but so important. The trick is to live in the moment to notice that which makes the mundane and normal extraordinary or beautiful or special.  We can pepper our daily life with simple but extraordinary moments of connection, so a day never really remains \u0026lsquonormal\u0026rsquo. We just have to truly live in that moment, to come out of our busyness and worries, and savour it.  Maybe the hawthorn tree will speak to you if ever you find yourself at Prestonpans train station. Or maybe someone else will your child, your grandchild, your partner, friends, your grandparents, your work colleague, or perhaps your inner self.  Maybe it wasn\u0026rsquot actually the tree which spoke to me. Perhaps it was my inner self. But then again, perhaps it was a speaking hawthorn, and you have to be \u0026lsquonot normal\u0026rsquo to hear it!"},{"url":null,"title":"leader-of-councils-conservative-opposition-steps-down-after-health-issues","story":"  Councillor Brian Small, who has held the position since being one of seven Conservative councillors elected in May 2017, stood down for a brief period last year following a severe bout of sepsis before returning to the post.

It\u0027s a four-way tie at the top for the hottest UK summer on record\u0026hellip https:t.co/MoGOnvVtRz          \u0026mdash Met Office  September 3, 2018  As well as being among the hottest summers on record, summer 2018 was notably dry and sunny \u0026ndash although the dry, sweltering conditions seen in much of the country in June and July gave way to a much more average August.  And this autumn could also see \u0026ldquoabove-average\u0026nbsptemperatures, a three-month outlook covering August, September and October from the Met Office suggests.  It shows an increased chance of high-pressure patterns close to the UK, while sea surface temperatures \u0026ldquoat near-record levels following the hot weather also make warmer than normal conditions more likely.  However the autumn shapes up, the summer\u0026rsquos heatwave and prolonged drought has already had an impact on one of the key signs of the season \u0026ndash and the traditional childhood favourite game of conkers.  According to the Woodland Trust, the fruiting of horse chestnut trees has been delayed by as much as six weeks, with the hot weather and lack of water potentially to blame.  Last year, reports from the Trust\u0026rsquos Nature\u0026rsquos Calendar project, in which members of the public record the signs of the changing seasons, highlighted the first sighting of a ripe conker was in Somerset on July 7.  The first sighting nationally this year was in Wiltshire on August 18, while many regions are yet to report any ripe conkers.  Martha Boalch, citizen science officer for the Woodland Trust, said:\u0026nbsp\u0026ldquoAlthough we\u0026rsquove only had a small number of conkers recorded so far, all is not lost for our favourite sign of autumn.  \u0026ldquoOver the next month, we would expect more fruit to ripen \u0026ndash but only time will tell whether this will be a bumper crop.  Across the UK, all four record hot summer years \u0026ndash 2018 2006, 2003 and 1976 \u0026ndash recorded an average temperature of 15.8C , to the nearest 0.1C.  In the Central England Temperature  series, which only covers an area of central England but dates back to 1659, this summer slips behind 1976 and 1826 for the hottest June to August.  Only 10 summers in the CET series have recorded average temperatures above 17C, six of which have occurred since 1976 and only two of which were pre-20th century.  This is consistent with the general picture of the climate warming globally and in the UK, the Met Office said.  Tony Juniper, executive director at WWF, said: \u0026ldquoAs people and wildlife baked this summer, we all felt this was a monumental event. This data confirms it.  \u0026ldquoUnfortunately, it looks like this will be the new normal, as our rapidly changing climate renders extreme weather ever more likely.  \u0026ldquoWe urgently need ambitious action to cut climate-changing pollution and to build a cleaner, greener economy.

Mrs Chaer-Yemlahi said: \u0026ldquoThe children miss their cousins terribly \u0026ndash they ask me many questions and often I don\u0026rsquot know how to answer them.

The council told Craig: \u0026ldquo[The child] had sustained serious injuries and by failing to be open and honest about the circumstances of the accident, there was a delay in the appropriate medical treatment being sought for [the child].  \u0026ldquoThis is likely to have resulted in unnecessary and prolonged suffering being sustained by [the child].  \u0026ldquoPeople that use services, together with the public generally, have the right to expect that registered social service workers, in whom they place their trust and confidence, will work responsibly and not engage in dishonest behaviour, or any other behaviour, inside or outside of work, that would call into question their suitability to work in the social services profession.

His determination to clear his name of allegations of sexual impropriety has the potential to tear the Scottish Government and the SNP apart. The two most important politicians in the modern history of Scottish nationalism have been pitted against each other at the very moment the party needs to unite over the future of independence.  We\u0027ve had the extraordinary spectacle of the former First Minister, and SNP leader, conducting a war of legal words over social media with the current First Minister, and SNP leader. In lengthy posts, Nicola Sturgeon defended the anti-sexual harassment procedures she introduced in January, and insisted on fairness for the complainants. Alex Salmond has condemned that due process as an unfair kangaroo court. Worse, he\u0027s accused the Scottish Government of leaking salacious details of the allegations to undermine him. Mr Salmond has even raised an action against the Scottish Government in the Court of Session.  For their part, Scottish Labour say that Nicola Sturgeon should already have suspended her predecessor from the party. That she has failed to follow the precedent set by the expulsion of the former Children\u0026rsquos Minister, Mark Macdonald. No formal complaint been lodged, however, with the SNP that could trigger such a disciplinary procedure. But to the dismay of many members, Ms Sturgeon has pointedly failed to rule out Mr Salmond\u0027s future defenestration. She can\u0027t.  The FM faces an acute dilemma. Under the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos procedures, complaints against former ministers are assessed by the civil service. If the result is problematic it is handed to the First Minister, \u0026ldquoin their capacity as party leader, so that the FM \u0026ldquocan take action to secure the highest standards of behaviour in the current administration. It\u0027s not clear what actions should be taken here, but you can be pretty sure critics will insist that suspension from the party is one of them. The allegations have been serious enough to be handed to the police.  However, the usual resignation argument that a minister cannot do their job properly until they\u0027ve \u0026ldquocleared their name does not apply. Alex Salmond sits in no parliament, holds no senior position in the party and is merely a sometime television presenter.  Labour\u0027s Rhoda Grant called for Mr Salmond to be suspended in order to create \u0026ldquoa safe space for his accusers \u0026ndash the two women who have made complaints. But it\u0027s not at all clear what kind of threat he is supposed to present to these women, or how removing Mr Salmond\u0027s membership card would make the space they occupy any more safe. The implication that Alex Salmond is some kind of crazed sex criminal, who cannot be allowed to walk free, is appalling. He\u0027s been found guilty of no improper conduct whatever.  Of course, the real damage was done by whoever leaked the confidential details of the allegations that he sexually assaulted two women. This vastly increased pressure on the First Minister to suspend Mr Salmond for the duration. He strenuously rejects the allegations and says he\u0027s been denied the right to see the evidence. That\u0027s assuming there is any concrete evidence.  Police and government agencies tend to work nowadays on the supposed Macpherson Principle that \u0026ldquovictims should always be believed, which is sometimes taken to mean that actual evidence is superfluous. Following a succession of miscarriages of justice, the politan Police has now abandoned this inversion of the presumption of innocence, and changed its guidance to say that accusers should be \u0026ldquolistened to rather than their allegations automatically accepted as fact. But it may be too late for Alex Salmond. In politics, you are now guilty until proven innocent. All the parties have tended to suspend politicians when allegations become public.  Many in the SNP are dismayed that Ms Sturgeon did not, at the very least, give her former mentor some kind of positive character reference last week, and then refuse to comment further. The First Minister placed herself at the forefront of the controversy, declaring that she was \u0026ldquo100% behind the Permanent Secretary, Leslie Evans, whom Mr Salmond\u0027s supporters believe has acted as judge and jury. Her remark that the complaints couldn\u0027t be \u0026ldquoswept under the carpet sounded damning.  The unalloyed glee among opposition politicians at what they see as the final humiliation of their greatest former foe is matched in the SNP by a kind of existential despair. It is hard to convey just how important Alex Salmond is to the independence movement. Political journalists and Women for Independence may regard the former leader as a hangover from alpha male politics, but for many ordinary nationalists he has hero status, comparable to that of Charles Stewart Parnell, the 19th century Irish Nationalist with whom Salmond used to compare himself. Unfortunately, that career ended with a sex scandal, too, over Parnell\u0027s adultery.  Irish nationalists always believed that Parnell was brought down by Establishment dirty tricks. There is an unshakeable conviction among many in the SNP that today\u0027s scandal must be, if not the work of M15, then a move by the deep state to silence an influential voice on the eve of a possible announcement of a second independence referendum. Salmond promised in his so-called Morningside Declaration in May to return to front line politics as soon as indyref2 is announced.  But if this is an establishment plot, then the unfortunate reality for Nationalists is that Nicola Sturgeon finds herself at the apex of it. As the new parliamentary term begins she\u0027ll come under intense pressure to suspend Mr Salmond from the party, or be accused of favouritism and hypocrisy. But if Alex Salmond were expelled on the eve of the most crucial SNP conference in years, the consequences would be unimaginable. The SNP has not just been rocked by this development it has been traumatised \u0026ndash and it may never be quite the same again."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8486553.jpg?type=article-full","title":"five-women-in-business-speak-out","story":"  All women can think of another woman who has inspired her to try a career in business, education or industry.

We will never see greater female representation in workplaces or as entrepreneurs if women don\u0026rsquot apply for the jobs or start the businesses in the first place.  Women in business are now as relevant as men and much of their success is down to determination, expertise and hard work.

It seemed the perfect job Helen didn\u0026rsquot drink yet was interested in finding out more about the process. Little did she know it would take her life in a whole new direction.  Rather than viewing distilling as chemical engineering, Helen found it felt far more artistic - all based on the creative expression of how it looks, smells and tastes. After inheriting an old family book detailing how her relatives used to distil on the family farm, Helen realised distilling was part of her history and heritage.    With derelict out-buildings on her family\u0026rsquos farm, Helen had a fresh appreciation for these old spaces once viewed as a millstone around her neck. Buildings that were near fresh spring water, surrounded by botanicals created a unique opportunity.  Gin attracted Helen initially as the old distilling manual described how people used to flavour spirits with whatever was around them. The farm had a wealth of natural botanicals, including Scottish juniper, so suddenly this untapped heather hill was incredibly valuable.  The gin is named Badvo, after Helen\u0026rsquos family farm where the stories of distilling inspired Helen when starting out. The heron logo represents the fresh spring water used, as only a very pure spring can support enough fish for a heron. To fund the start-up, Helen pre-sold the first batch of 105 bottles collectively for \u0026pound6,500, going on to use the money to unlock match funding, which snowballed until the entire distillery was grant funded.    Helen commented: \u0026ldquoI got a lot of flak for being a solo entrepreneur. Yes, there are downsides to being a one-man band, but it gives you the opportunity to be dynamic. You can make a decision and you don\u0026rsquot have to justify it to anyone or get it past any board.  \u0026ldquoIt hurts occasionally when people assume someone else set up the distillery as I am too young or too female to have accomplished this alone. I just don\u0026rsquot think some people can comprehend how you can cover so much ground at this stage in life, but I think this is the perfect time.

On the contrary, her peer group expected that students of both sexes could progress to further education, and into careers of our choice. This certainly was Julie\u0026rsquos experience.    Graduating from Glasgow University, Bachelor of Laws with Honours in 1993, Julie then went on to complete the required post-graduate Diploma in Legal Practice in 1994. A legal Traineeship commenced immediately, and she was formally admitted as a solicitor in 1995, at the age of 23. By 27, Julie had been promoted to partner. At that time, she was one of the youngest female partners in a law firm in Scotland. By 2015, more than 60 per cent of solicitors under the age of 40, practising in Scotland, were women \u0026ndash unimaginable in 1995, far less in 1918. For the following 11 years, Julie practised a wide range of areas of law and managed three of her firm\u0027s\u0026nbspbranch offices. She was in charge of HR, and worked long hours.  In 2010, Julie decided to leave the relative security of her large firm behind. Seeking a better work/life balance, she set up her own firm \u0026ndash Millen Solicitors. Hard work continued, and although she faced pressures of a different kind as a sole practitioner, she succeeded in achieving a balance, not only for herself, but for every member of her team.  From the outset, Julie envisaged a practice which would provide an exceptional level of service to clients, and a collegiate and stimulating environment for employees. These values continue at the core of Millen Solicitors as they approach the end of their 8th successful year.    \u0026ldquoFamily Solicitors For Generations is the business maxim, with a nod to their specialisms in all aspects of family law, as well as powers of attorney, wills and executries. Julie and her team provide an outstanding, supportive and compassionate service to families, parents, grandparents and children in times of crisis or uncertainty, at ying stages of their respective lives. Their clients agree, with the majority of work now coming in the form of referrals from satisfied clients, and professional colleagues seeking their expertise.  Julie comments: \u0026ldquoI am proud to have contributed to the cracking of the \u0026ldquoglass ceiling, and I look forward to seeing Scotland\u0026rsquos entrepreneurial women achieve its eventual demise.

The first edition of the Sunday Herald was published in February 1999 and captured a Scotland that is now unrecognisable.  Tony Blair, approaching his second anniversary as a Labour prime minister, had embarked on a radical agenda of social, economic and constitutional change. Devolution had been endorsed through a referendum and voters were three months away from voting in the first Holyrood election.  The first issue, assembled by visionary editor Andrew Jaspan and his team, carried a front-page interview with Blair by Kirsty Milne, who was the paper\u0026rsquos first political editor. The then prime minister told the fledgling paper that devolution was a \u0026ldquo21st-century symbol of a \u0026ldquomulti-layered democracy based on \u0026ldquopartnership in the UK and the European Union.  Fast-forward to today, which marks the last issue of the Sunday Herald, and few people could have predicted how the political landscape that had existed under Blair would change.  Back then, the SNP had around half a dozen parliamentarians. Now the party has more than 100 MSPs, MPs and MEPs. Labour dominated UK and Scottish politics in 1999 but has been out of power at Westminster and Holyrood for a generation. Debate still centres around the constitution, but on independence, not devolution. And Brexit looks set to extinguish our relationship with the EU.  The Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos political journey over that period reflects the switch made by large segments of Scottish voters: broadly sympathetic to Blair in the early years of his premiership, but turned off by the Iraq war. Tentatively pro-SNP in 2007 \u0026ndash more out of frustration with Labour than anything else \u0026ndash before becoming pro-independence.  However, regardless of constitutional politics, the paper\u0026rsquos political anchor never moved. Under all three editors \u0026ndash Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay \u0026ndash the Sunday Herald was centre-left, socially liberal and pro-European. Appealing to younger readers was also a key part of its ethos.  My overriding memory of the Sunday Herald is not just of a paper that adopted a distinctive position on independence, but of a publication that broke big political stories and had far-reaching consequences. In circulation terms we were bantamweight, but in our coverage we fought at a higher level.  Milne, who passed away in 2013, was in the job for barely a few months before moving on and going on to become a renowned columnist. Its first Scottish political editor, Douglas Fraser, brought intellectual heft to the Sunday Herald and was in post for five years from 1999. While anti-devolution publications tried to undermine the Scottish Parliament, his coverage was marked by fairness and balance. He was an authoritative presence who was the right political editor for the time.  Fraser was in post during one of the most shameful episodes of recent Scottish history. In 2000, when Labour\u0026rsquos former minister Wendy Alexander announced plans to repeal anti-gay legislation which banned the promotion of homosexuality in schools, forces including SNP donor Brian Souter, the Catholic Church and the Daily Record mounted an ugly campaign of opposition.  Fraser and his colleagues, to their credit, extensively reported the distortions of the Keep the Clause campaign, while the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos stance urged the Labour-led Executive to hold firm. The paper\u0026rsquos uncompromising stance in defending a vulnerable minority group helped define its political outlook more than any other issue. Opposition to the Iraq War, meanwhile, bolstered its progressive credentials.  Fraser also covered the early traumas and controversies of devolution, such as the death of Donald Dewar and the resignation of his successor as First Minister, Henry McLeish, before moving to The Herald. We also benefited from first-class Westminster coverage from Iain Watson, James Cusick and Torcuil Crichton.  I became the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos Scottish political editor in 2004 after an approach by a senior figure on the paper. Although there had been a formal process, I got the impression the job was mine unless I cried or puked at the interview. I held my nerve and was hired by Jaspan.  Without making myself sound like a sociopath, I had a different temperament to Fraser and brought my own style. He was cerebral \u0026ndash I use that as praise \u0026ndash and interested in policy, whereas I was an angry 27-year-old who wasn\u0026rsquot quite sure what he was angry about. My title should have been \u0026ldquoanti-political editor. Months after I started, Jaspan moved to Australia and Richard Walker became editor. He wanted a more robust approach to politics, which I was comfortable with, and we worked together closely for 11 years until he left the paper in 2015.  I\u0026rsquom proud of our working relationship. An investigation into Scottish Tory leader David McLetchie\u0026rsquos expenses \u0026ndash yes, I think it was legitimate no, I don\u0026rsquot believe it was petty \u0026ndash led to him quitting and Holyrood publishing the entirety of the MSP allowances system online.  Stories on Labour chief Wendy Alexander\u0026rsquos dodgy donation to her leadership campaign triggered her resignation, while coverage of crooked MP Jim Devine\u0026rsquos expenses got him jail time. During the latter investigation, I was lucky not to die after getting knocked down by a random driver on the way to doing a television interview on the Devine story. I was later told a senior Holyrood figure had said he wished the accident had been \u0026ldquomore serious.  In 2012, by which time I was writing about politics as investigations editor, our stories on abuser Bill Walker, who was an SNP MSP at the time, led to him getting a custodial sentence. We also broke, and covered endlessly, the story on Labour shenanigans in Falkirk, which had major consequences outwith one town in central Scotland.  Reporters are only as good as their editors allow them to be. If your boss spikes your work, or puts it on page 38, the article has either zero or marginal impact. All these political stories were published during Walker\u0027s editorship. We had cross words once \u0026ndash it was my fault \u0026ndash and I can recall only one occasion in 11 years when I felt a good story had been canned. Any journalist would accept that sort of ratio.  Before this sounds like a self-regarding roll-call of glory, I should offer full disclosure by admitting to a mistake or two. In 2007, I reported that a mystery Labour MP \u0026ndash \u0026ldquohe or she \u0026ndash was \u0026ldquopoised to defect to the SNP. The story, much to my embarrassment, subsequently proved to be cobblers.  So appalled was I by the prospect of winning the Tartan Bollocks \u0026ndash given to the journalist who penned the most inaccurate story of the year \u0026ndash I fled to Paris for two nights and skipped the dunce ceremony. One colleague woundingly described my loser\u0026rsquos expedition as a trip to the \u0026ldquocity of self-love.  I also over-wrote a story about something vaguely controversial former first minister Jack McConnell had said about drugs when he was a student. My awful piece, which we splashed, had all the zest of a casserole that had been decomposing in a garden for six months. Walker\u0027s last-minute \u0026ldquotweaks did not help. In the end, it read like it had been written in Bulgarian and put through Google Translate.    Image: Bill Walker\u0027s violent past    Front pages: Wendy Alexander and Jim Devine    Splash: the Labour/Falkirk fiasco and free school milk  My successor, Tom Gordon, became Scottish political editor in 2008 and stayed in the job until 2016. To paraphrase author PG Wodehouse, it was never hard to tell the difference between Tom in a grumpy mood and a ray of sunshine. If there had been an Olympics for small talk, it is unlikely he would ever have made the podium. He was also the best reporter I worked with.  He and I \u0026ndash friends as well as colleagues \u0026ndash competed with rival papers, of course, but also with each other. We would have endless \u0026ldquodiscussions about joint bylines, whose beat a particular story fell on, and who had the best angle to justify top billing. It was my favourite time on the paper.  Gordon was the paper\u0026rsquos longest-serving Scottish political editor and had a terrific scoop count. He revealed how Alex Salmond had congratulated former RBS chief executive Fred Goodwin on the botched ABN AMRO deal. He also reported how the Tory Government was planning to axe free school milk for under fives, a story that triggered a televised U-turn by the Government hours after its publication.  He also disclosed how Better Together secretly called their campaign Project Fear \u0026ndash a phrase that went viral \u0026ndash and exposed how the SNP had been auctioning Holyrood lunches at party fundraising events. One caveat: just as I cringe at my McConnell drugs \u0026ldquoscoop, I imagine Gordon does not dwell too long on his 2013 \u0026ldquoexclusive report about a predicted \u0026ldquooil boom in the North Sea. I did not seek a joint byline on that one.  Gordon\u0027s time in the job also coincided with the editor of the paper backing a Yes vote in the referendum. I offer no comment on this decision \u0026ndash it was above my pay grade \u0026ndash but some basic facts should be noted. Unlike other newspapers, whose big editorial decisions are influenced by proprietors living abroad, the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos position was not taken by its owner but its editor. It was Walker\u0027s call and he made the decision. He explained it clearly and never shied away from defending what even opponents of independence would concede was a major moment in the campaign.  It has also been said Walker was motivated by commercial opportunism. Again, wrong. His decision stemmed from his personal belief in independence. He had been moving the paper in this direction for around three years and was convinced it was the right move for Scotland.  Walker left in 2015 and was replaced by Neil Mackay, who continued with the Sunday Herald\u0026rsquos pro-independence stance and who was instinctively supportive of investigative journalism. Our last Scottish political editor was Andrew Whitaker, an impressive story-getter who was known for his persistence in pursuit of an exclusive. Whitaker\u0027s reporting led to the SNP Government announcing an inquiry into the miners\u0026rsquo strike and he revealed Nicola Sturgeon\u0026rsquos plan for a reshuffle.  Having worked for 14 years on the Sunday Herald, it is natural I feel a huge sadness at the paper\u0026rsquos demise. However, a combination of branding difficulties and low circulation made the company\u0026rsquos decision to cease publication inevitable. The creation of two new Sunday newspapers is also a positive move for the media in Scotland.  The Sunday Herald no longer has a future, but this should not detract from the impactful political coverage that its editors and reporters produced in the years since its iconic first edition nearly two decades ago."},{"url":null,"title":"vicky-allan-waving-goodbye-on-a-feminist-wave","story":"  Here, then, are my last lines for a paper that\u0026rsquos taken up around a third of my life. I keep trying to think back to what things were like in 2003 when I arrived at what I thought was an utterly cool paper. Sixteen years is long enough not to quite remember how things were and how you thought the future world might turn out. But, among the many things I probably didn\u0026rsquot imagine is the past week of Scottish news, and that we would be watching one first minister  struggling to navigate what to do about the sexual misconduct allegations against the last first minister .  That, to me, says a great deal about where Scotland and the world have come to. It speaks of the journey that has been made in women\u0026rsquos rights, and what kind of behaviours we tolerate. Power structures seem, at times, like they\u0026rsquore on the verge of being overturned.  This world, where it\u0026rsquos conceivable that a political giant like Alex Salmond could fall over such allegations, true or not, is different to the one we were writing about in 2003. It\u0026rsquos also different from the one I reflected in 2015, when I casually described an interview meeting with Salmond in which he unexpectedly greeted me with a friendly kiss on the lips. The tone has changed \u0026ndash transformed by #MeToo.  But I\u0026rsquove seen, and covered, many other changes in that time. The revolution, for instance, in gender identity. It\u0026rsquos hard to believe that back in 2014, when I wrote a piece on non-binary people in the trans community, I had barely come across the term gender fluid. There has been a profound shift, too, in how open we are about mental health. I remember when I interviewed former MSP Rosie Kane about her depression back in 2004, it seemed like she was busting some intractable taboo.  The Sunday Herald reflected that changing world and debated it. It did more than that. It told the human stories behind it. It brought to its pages tales from the unheard or powerless, and it encouraged me, and other writers \u0026ndash Judith Duffy and Karin Goodwin \u0026ndash to look at the people who were struggling in 21st century society, as well as those who were shaping it. When, for instance, the Domestic Abuse  Bill was proposed, we carried harrowing stories from women who had experienced coercion and violence.  I\u0026rsquoll always think of the Sunday Herald as the place that nurtured my feminism and social awareness, as well as my journalism. Interviews with big names were part of that. But, above all, it was my meetings with everyday people who talked of their lives, dramas, challenges, and frustrations, that shaped my world view.  I mourn already the loss of the old Sunday Herald. I felt an immense pride at being part of the team here, of being read alongside such greats at Ian Bell, Iain Macwhirter, David Pratt, Joanna Blythman and Tom Shields. The editors I worked for were inspiring. But the world shifts. The industry moves.  What doesn\u0026rsquot change is the need for stories. Hence, I look forward to bringing them to the new hope, the Herald On Sunday.  Here\u0027s to all those good times  Did I forget to mention the fun? For, at least back in the early years, the Sunday Herald felt like it was a paper that was almost up for anything. Whatever madcap idea you had, there was a chance you could give it a go. Within my first couple of years I\u0026rsquod camped in the snow-blanketed woods with the Naked Rambler, been wolf-tracking in Poland, tried out as a commis chef at Andrew Fairlie\u0026rsquos. But others were pushing the envelope further. As Peter Ross, whose features writing lit up the paper for many years put it, in a tweet: \u0026ldquo The Sunday Herald was a blast at times. It felt like you could just do stuff.  In fact, no one really describes it \u0026ndash or, for that matter, anything \u0026ndash better than Ross. \u0026ldquoIn those days, he says, \u0026ldquoit was hardly a hard-bitten news room. It was more Girl On A Motorcycle than His Girl Friday: full of louche, bohemian types talking about fonts. I remember one colleague \u0026ndash I won\u0026rsquot name him, but it was Barry Didcock \u0026ndash turned up one day in sandals with his toenails painted blue. I remember we commissioned Edwin Morgan to review The Phantom Menace. Not sure what poor Eddie did to deserve that particular assignment. I think it was Pat Kane\u0026rsquos idea. Anything seemed possible, failure most of all. Every week there seemed to be another meeting at which graphs were wheeled out to suggest that we were probably doomed but might not be.  So here we are. Doom comes knocking for the Sunday Herald. But, as they say every death is a new beginning. Here\u0026rsquos hoping, whatever happens, it\u0026rsquos a blast."},{"url":null,"title":"businessman-who-ran-companies-while-being-a-disqualified-director-convicted-after-sunday-herald-investigation","story":"  Stephen Roberts, 50, was in effective control of two health and medical technology firms \u0026ndash one of which his law officer wife was a major shareholder in \u0026ndash while he was banned.  Roberts\u0026rsquo wife Nicky Patrick, procurator fiscal for homicide and major crime, is listed at Companies House as having had the largest holding of 8,997 shares in one of the firms, Log Six Systems , in 2013. Her husband owned 7,503, giving the couple a majority of the shares.  There is no absolutely suggestion Patrick knew about the management of the business at the time. The Crown Office is now investigating her husband\u0026rsquos financial affairs and have applied for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act.  Former bankrupt Roberts, of Troon, Ayrshire, was disqualified for four years in July 2010 after failing to ensure a previous firm, Innova Business Solutions, had paid tax. Innova owed \u0026pound292,882 when it was liquidated. An appeal judge described him as \u0026ldquoevasive\" and \u0026ldquodevious in cross-examination.  In 2013, a Sunday Herald investigation revealed Roberts was involved in a healthcare start-up, LSS, that won a \u0026pound50,000 prize at a Dragons\u0027 Den-style event funded by Scottish Enterprise and the Scottish Government.  John Swinney, then finance secretary, presented the prize to Roberts and a former director but Scottish Enterprise later withheld some of the money. Despite Roberts\u0026rsquo directorship ban, which stopped him forming, promoting or managing a company, this newspaper uncovered footage of him saying on a crowdfunding site: \u0026ldquoWe kill superbugs, but we can do it 12 times faster and 100 times cheaper than existing disinfectant methods.  Log Six has the ability to save lives, time and money on a global scale with proven technology to a global problem. And with your help we can make it happen faster.  In another video, Roberts addressed an audience at Heriot-Watt University and said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a high-efficacy disinfectant chemical, which has been proven to kill every pathogen known to man.  The articles were followed by a police investigation and Roberts later denied two charges of being involved in the \u0026ldquoformation, promotion and management of LSS and another company, Nightingale Intensive Systems International, between September 2011 and July 2014.  After a lengthy trial at Kilmarnock Sheriff Court, Roberts was found guilty of both charges after Sheriff Iona McDonald ruled he had been a \u0026ldquodriving force of Nightingale and co-founder of LSS, where he referred to his \u0026ldquoinvestors.  McDonald told Roberts: \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos clear you told almost everyone you were a disqualified director.  Gary Allan QC, defence counsel, told the court: \u0026ldquoThe whole sorry saga has been a social, family and financial catastrophe.  McDonald continued the case for 10 weeks for prosecutors to produce a statement of Roberts\u0026rsquo financial affairs for a confiscation order under the Proceeds of Crime Act."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-the-birth-of-a-media-legend","story":"  IT began as Project White \u0026ndash a top secret scheme to cook up a new paper for a new century, a newspaper that would go on to define modern Scotland.  The first inklings of Project White took shape in February 1998 thanks to Gus Macdonald. Macdonald had risen from humble beginnings as an apprentice in the Govan shipyards to become one of the most significant figures in Scottish journalism. A glittering career saw him rise to director of programmes for STV by the mid-1980s and, after Tony Blair took power in 1997, he was made a life peer, taking his seat in the Lords as Baron Macdonald of Tradeston. He went on to become Minister of Transport and Cabinet Office Minister.  Macdonald, today in his mid-70s, was a powerful and influential man in the late 90s. At the end of 1997, he was appointed non-executive chairman of Scottish Media Group, then owners of both STV and The Herald. As a leftwing big beast in the media, Macdonald was a man uncomfortable with the state of the Scottish press \u0026ndash for both political and business reasons. He felt the right-wing tilt of the Scotsman skewed the national debate, and also worried that The Scotsman \u0026ndash combined with its sister paper Scotland on Sunday \u0026ndash was a threat to both The Herald\u0026rsquos circulation and advertising revenues. So he hit on an idea \u0026ndash what if The Herald had a Sunday title as well \u0026hellip  One of the other big beasts of British and Scottish journalism in the 90s was Andrew Jaspan \u0026ndash a gifted maverick and an inspirational leader who had edited The Observer, The Sunday Times Scotland, The Scotsman and Scotland on Sunday. In early February 1998, Jaspan received a phone call from Macdonald out of the blue. Macdonald asked if they could meet in the House of Lords.  \u0026ldquoBack in the 1970s, Jaspan says, \u0026ldquoGus would have wanted a blether over a pint of beer, in the 1980s it might have been a glass of wine, now he tempted me with \u0026lsquotea served in the finest House of Lords\u0026rsquo bone china\u0026rsquo.  Macdonald had a simple proposition: would Jaspan be interested in setting up a new Sunday paper? Jaspan quickly agreed and soon he and the CEO of Scottish Media Group, a reserved but affable and media-savvy former accountant called Andrew Flanagan, met in London. Flanagan asked Jaspan to come up with a feasibility study \u0026ndash how much would this paper cost, how many staff would he need, how much money could it pull in, and most importantly: what would the paper stand for. Jaspan was told to keep the entire scheme utterly under wraps. Not a word was to be breathed to anyone.  Gary Hughes, Flanagan\u0026rsquos deputy, told Jaspan it was to be called \"Project White\". Jaspan asked why \u0026ndash Hughes replied \"because we have given you a blank sheet of paper\".  What followed next was a five-month period of intense and secretive work by Jaspan in order to get the figures right, mould the editorial philosophy, and come up with the branding and marketing for a new paper for Scotland \u0026ndash one of the most crowded newspaper markets in the world. By the end of August, Jaspan delivered Flanagan his masterplan.  He wanted to create a paper that felt young and aspirational.  The world had changed drastically by the time 1998 came to a close \u0026ndash the age of deference was dead, the Cold War was over, the Good Friday Agreement had been signed bringing peace to Northern Ireland, and Scotland was soon to get her own parliament again. Facile as it may sound today, back then \"Cool Britannia\" \u0026ndash a cocktail of Britpop, the craze for young British artists like Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst, fashion designers like Alexander McQueen, a new youthful Labour government, and a growing economy \u0026ndash seemed to sum up a country brimming with hope and change.  \u0026ldquoHistory was in the making and I wanted a paper that would embrace this change, Jaspan says. When it came to the new era of devolution, he wanted the paper to \u0026ldquowelcome the opening of a new chapter for Scotland. That\u0026rsquos not to say the paper would be a cheerleader, but we would give the new constitutional arrangements a chance to succeed, and pounce on any ill-thought out policy or actions. It was, then, to be a paper both positive about Scotland \u0026ndash there would be no \"Scottish cringe\" \u0026ndash and a watchdog over those in power. But what would it be called? From the get-go, the title that became the frontrunner was the \"Sunday Herald\".  \u0026ldquoThis instantly told readers that the paper was part of The Herald family, but of course a new Sunday paper, Jaspan says. \u0026ldquoWe had messed around with other neutral names, but no others were seriously considered. The upside was that this would be an easier sell to Herald readers \u0026ndash that is, to ask them to drop Scotland on Sunday and chose a west coast Sunday, the downside was that Edinburgh readers might still shy away from a Glasgow paper.  But the Sunday Herald was never intended to be just a Glasgow paper. Capturing sales and ad revenue on the west coast of Scotland was merely the first step to securing the financial future of a new national title, a newspaper which saw itself on the world stage, not on simply the British or Scottish stage.  With the title and vision in place, Jaspan needed to give the paper \"a look\". How to design a paper that wanted to be different to every other paper on the news stands? This was a paper that wasn\u0026rsquot going to talk down to readers, or tell them how to think \u0026ndash it would take for granted that readers were intelligent and well-read, that they wanted information and entertainment, not dull instruction from above. The look of the paper had to reflect that very modern approach to news.  So, one of the most talented designers in European newspapers made a trek north to Glasgow. Simon Esterson had won plaudits internationally for his work on the redesign of \u0026rsquos G2 section. To Jaspan, when it came to designing the new paper, Esterson was the only person for the job. Perhaps the best way to explain how radical Esterson\u0026rsquos design was is to ask you to turn to the front cover of this paper and look at the masthead \u0026ndash the title is all in lower case, the colours vivid primary blue and red. It 1998, this was a radical approach to newspaper design, and a dramatic way to signal a break with the papers of old. The Sunday Herald was to be simple, elegant \u0026ndash a canvas for what would go on to be award-winning photography and journalism. As the first new paper of the 21st century, Jaspan wanted to \u0026ldquoproduce journalism to read, not flick through.  The paper was to have six elements: five printed sections \u0026ndash News, Seven Days , Sport, Business, Jobs and a magazine \u0026ndash and, crucially, one digital section, a website, marking the Sunday Herald as the only paper to embrace online at this stage. Back then, The Herald and The Scotsman still had no web presence. After the Sunday Herald launched \u0026ndash using its website as an integrated part of the paper \u0026ndash , now one of the world\u0026rsquos most popular news sites, soon followed suit.  By now, everything was in place \u0026ndash apart from people: the staff who would make this still imaginary venture take life. And it was the people that made the Sunday Herald. Anyone \u0026ndash and I mean literally anyone, apart from a few sad souls who just didn\u0026rsquot get the spirit of the paper \u0026ndash anyone who has worked on the title will say without hesitation that not only did it give them the best years of their careers, but it often made their careers, and it made them friends \u0026ndash and sometimes lovers \u0026ndash who last with them until this day.  The first two people to be brought onboard were Charles Magee \u0026ndash a consummate journalist who has mastered every art in the industry \u0026ndash and Richard Walker, one of the most talented, hardworking journalists in the UK. Both had worked with Jaspan at Scotland on Sunday. Magee was to work on a publishing system \u0026ndash a bit like building a bespoke desktop printing press from scratch \u0026ndash and Walker tirelessly fine-tuned design. The three-man team holed up in a backroom in STV that stored the props for the crime show Taggart, working in secret to keep opposition newspapers in the dark.  With the foundations now in place, Jaspan went to the board of directors of SMG in September 1998 and got final approval to launch the paper \u0026ndash the only member of the board who seemed less than enthused was David Montgomery, the notoriously dour Ulsterman who had set up the now defunct Today newspaper, and was then running Mirror Group, which had a stake in SMG. Despite the board\u0026rsquos support, there was a sting in the tale for Jaspan: the board wanted the paper launched by the end of January 1999. He had three months to get one of the most ambitious media projects of the last half-century off the ground, and an entire team \u0026ndash more than 50 staff \u0026ndash to hire.  \u0026ldquoI wanted to recruit a cadre of journalists,Jaspan says, \u0026ldquowho would relish the challenge of working on a new paper, which would be a beacon of editorial excellence in everything it did. I wanted to hire journalists who had fire in their bellies \u0026ndash those who wanted to prove themselves rather than those hacks who just wanted to play the safe game and sleep-walk to their pension. I wanted free thinkers who would give the paper a feel of being new and different, so that we would not just be another ordinary Sunday newspaper.  In the end, that thought \u0026ndash \"No Ordinary Sunday\" \u0026ndash would become the tag line for all Sunday Herald marketing and branding. But it also helped Jaspan focus his mind on the kind of people he wanted working for the new Sunday Herald.  He quickly assembled a team, pillaging the best talent from opposition titles in Scotland and London \u0026ndash what better way to get the jump on Scotland on Sunday than taking its gunslingers and have them turn their firepower on their old employer. When staff were hired they were a little taken aback to find themselves each given a beanie hat \u0026hellip emblazoned with the logo \"No Ordinary Headline\"."},{"url":null,"title":"iain-macwhirter-keeping-the-flame-of-serious-journalism-burning-bright","story":"  This summer has demonstrated just how rancid our political culture has become. Earlier this week, the former Labour spin-doctor, John McTernan, told BBC\u0026rsquos Today programme that Labour \u0026ldquois transforming itself into the nasty party. In doing so he was implicitly condemning his and Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos Labour party as worse than the Tories. This kind of hyperbolic rhetoric is becoming pretty standard.  Earlier in the week, the former Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks, a figure commanding great respect not only among Jews, compared the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to Enoch Powell, and said his recent remarks about Zionism were as racist as Powell\u0026rsquos infamous \u0026ldquoRivers of Blood speech in 1967. It\u0026rsquos as if even normally sober-minded people feel that they have to ramp up their invective to 11 just to get a hearing.  It was the same with Boris Johnson\u0026rsquos burka remarks. It was, of course, provocative to describe women wearing this attire as looking like \u0026ldquobank robbers and letter boxes. But Johnson was widely accused of being a racist and even a neo-fascist. The former Foreign Secretary is many things, but whatever you think of him he is not a fascist, neo or otherwise, and nor is the British Conservative Party a racist organisation. Indeed, to claim that Tory politicians are fascists and racists robs these terms of any meaning at a time when the real far right is undergoing a resurgence.  Similarly, the widespread allegations about Jeremy Corbyn\u0026rsquos anti-semitism \u0026ndash not least from Labour MPs like Margaret Hodge - devalues the very concept of anti-semitism. His critics may even unknowingly be giving comfort and encouragement to genuine jew-haters. Repeated claims that Labour is an anti-semitic organisation makes it look as if this despicable creed is becoming almost respectable. Look, racists can say: even the British Labour Party is now on our side.  All this has a lot to do, of course, with the rise of social media. When the Sunday Herald was born, the internet was a relatively new toy. Google was around, but it was still a fact-based search engine run by academic geeks largely for geeks. Twitter had yet to be born, and Facebook was confined to US campuses. These internet phenomena have now taken over the world \u0026ndash almost literally in Facebook\u0026rsquos case \u0026ndash and have turned journalism on its head, as well as stealing the advertising revenue that supported it.  In the past, newspaper editors acted as gatekeepers, assessing the overall quality and news value of the information that entered the public sphere. Professional journalists were paid to research stories and comment on matters of public concern. Now anything goes. Bored teenagers in Macedonia can cobble together some pro-Trump sites and sell them for clicks to gullible US consumers of fake news. There is zero quality control on Facebook. Post-truth has invaded the public consciousness like a computer virus.  People can now believe whatever they want to believe: \u0026ldquothe Pope backs Trump, \u0026ldquoClinton is a murderer and find confirmation on social media. There readers are insulated from alternative views and factual evidence. Computer algorithms create filter bubbles, pre-selecting posts that conform to people\u0026rsquos prejudices, in a form of digital brainwashing. Newspapers had editorial lines, but they at least tried to give a range of opinion, and did not, as a rule, run comment as news.  Endless rows on Twitter have debased political discourse by infecting it with abuse and anger. The laws on defamation seem to have been abolished. No matter what you think of Alex Salmond, or his crowd-funding campaign, the things that have been routinely tweeted and retweeted about his alleged sex crimes are disgraceful and would never have appeared in the Sunday Herald or any other newspaper back in the day.  Some might think this is a good thing, that powerful figures can no longer hide behind the law. But this social media free-for-all is death to responsible journalism and also to natural justice. Newspapers that still keep within the law, look as if they\u0026rsquore stuffy and behind the times. Worse, they\u0026rsquore regarded as part of that sluice of evil, the MSM, the Mainstream Media.  Of course, the press has its faults. Newspaper editors exercised power, but they didn\u0026rsquot always exercise it responsibly. Tabloid newspapers in the noughties spread hatred against immigrants and people on benefits, pandering to the worst prejudices of their readers. In 1999, some tabloid and broadsheet newspapers just couldn\u0026rsquot forgive Scots for voting in massive numbers for a Scottish parliament, one of the proximate causes for the creation of the Sunday Herald.  The early months and years of Holyrood were torrid. There were accusations of misuse of expenses, incompetent MSPs and attempts to ridicule and undermine the policies of the Labour/Lib Dem administration, such as the repeal of Clause 28, which effectively banned any positive representation of homosexuality in schools.  Abolishing Section 2A, as it was properly called in Scotland, remains the Sunday Herald campaign in which I take greatest pride. Alone of the press of the day, the Sunday Herald took, head on, the Keep the Clause campaign, led by the formidable combination of Stagecoach bus tycoon, Brian Souter, and Cardinal Thomas Winning, leader of the Catholic Church.  The editor, Andrew Jaspan, and I, received many threats, and not just of divine retribution, for arguing that Clause 28 was a homophobic abomination that should be repealed in a civilised country.  The row spread to the Scottish cabinet and became a fierce battle between liberals like then Communities Minister Wendy Alexander, and less progressive ministers of the day. The Labour First Minister, Donald Dewar, was almost torn apart by the divisions, and some believe that the stress may have contributed to the collapse of his health and his premature death.  It is a measure of how Scotland has changed since 1999 that it\u0026rsquos inconceivable anything like Section 2A could become law today. An undoubted achievement of the Scottish parliament has been to help change Scotland\u0026rsquos primitive attitudes to diversity.  And it\u0026rsquos not over till it\u0026rsquos over. The Sunday Herald is not dead, it has simply evolved. There will now be two quality newspapers on Sunday: the Herald on Sunday and the Sunday National. The one becomes two. What better way to demonstrate that, no matter what the internet says, serious journalism is not dead."},{"url":null,"title":"sunday-herald-tributes-kind-words-from-across-scottish-life-to-a-well-loved-friend-in-its-final-hours","story":"  Farewell dear friend, I\u0026rsquove loved you since you were born and over the last twenty years, my God where does time go, I have watched you grow and mature and take your rightful place in our lives.  You were a breath of fresh air, you came with integrity, you came with courage, you were unafraid of your own voice or the choices you made. You, quite simply, raised the bar and set standards others can only dream of.  My Sundays will be bereft without you, without the joy of reading you from cover to cover excited at what I might find as I turn the page. Alas, no more will you shine your light but the voices of those who made you unique are still with us and long may they be heard for they are needed more than ever.  Elaine C Smith, actor and comedian  The Sunday Herald has been a staple in our home since it started and has kept many a paper boy or girl delivering to us every Sunday. It\u0026rsquos the only newspaper that we continued to have delivered \u0026ndash the demise of the habit of buying a newspaper every day is evident, with people getting their news in so many different ways now \u0026ndash but our loyalty to the Sunday herald continued.  It continued for me because in so many ways its political commentary kept me sane. In a world of right wing Labour and Tory opinion in Scotland  the Sunday Herald was a beacon of light.  Not because it was/is pro Scottish independence  but because it tried to present an alternative view and that was like a breath of fresh air. Under the editor Richard Walker, the paper took brave steps. A country that has at least 45 per cent of its people supporting Independence having no newspaper representing or even covering that view would have been ludicrous. Columnists like Iain McWhirter stepping out at a time when all the fire was aimed at the Independence movement was a brave step and as many have found in this wee nation  when you step out from those who have run things for a long time then you are shunned, or ex communicated.  So, I feel sad that things are moving and that there is no more Sunday Herald but am pleased the National on Sunday is being printed and that will be the paper in my house from now on.  Ruth Wishart, journalist, broadcaster and commentator  When the Sunday Herald took the decision to back independence it did so against a media backdrop which was at best neutral and, more commonly, openly hostile to the concept.  It seemed to me vital that a major title should give voice to a cause supported by hundreds and thousands of Scots, and to offer support for and reportage on the Independence campaign.  It has of course mounted many other campaigns and provided space for thought provoking essays and columns.  Often these have been rather more left field than more conventional publications in the mainstream media, and all the more welcome for it. We need diversity in journalism as much as we do elsewhere.  On a more personal level I was delighted to participate in the judging for the Sunday Herald Culture Awards, which helped recognise the myriad talents flourishing throughout the country in every art form.  I will reserve judgement on the Herald on Sunday until I read it. But Sundays just won\u0026rsquot be the same without my Sunday Herald fix.  Professor Emeritus Sir Tom Devine, historian  Over nearly two decades the Sunday Herald has become an important and stimulating addition to the Scottish ?newspaper scene.  The decision taken in 2014 to lend support to the cause of independence was not only courageous but of positive benefit to Scottish democracy. Whatever one\u0027s political view, it was surely unhealthy for the press to be overwhelmingly committed to a unionist position when the nation itself was split over the central Scottish constitutional issue of our time.  This is especially so since the question of the future of the country was not finally laid to rest by the result of the referendum of 2014 and remains alive to this day.  In that sense all democrats should applaud the fact that the Sunday Herald gave some voice to a nationalist perspective without at any time becoming a propaganda sheet either for the SNP or the pro-independence movement.  The paper was also fortunate in being led successively by three first class editors in Andrew Jaspan, Richard Walker and Neil Mackay?. They were all innovative figures in their different ways who ensured that the quality of journalism was always of a high standard.  I much regret the passing of a newspaper with such a distinctive editorial line? and fresh approach as the Sunday Herald, especially in light of the current difficult times for the Scottish press more generally. We can only hope that some at least of the traditions of the paper are maintained by its successor each Sunday.  Stuart Cosgrove, writer and broadcaster  The Sunday Herald came of age at a time when I was travelling extensively. It was mostly to cities across the UK but often on research trips to America too. I remember coming across a piece of trivia that has stayed with me ever since. It was a minor bit of detail about the pioneering Motown acts who travelled the deep south of America in the days when racial segregation was still the norm. To protect their stage shoes and to keep them in touch with home, groups like The Temptations and The Supremes would roll-up pages from the Michigan Chronicle, Detroit\u0027s major black newspaper. Otis Williams of the Temptations once said that when he was bored or missing home he would unravel the crumpled paper in his shoes and read about Detroit.  For me it was the Sunday Herald. I was home to appear on radio every Saturday and the next day began my travels again. So, I would religiously buy the Sunday Herald, fold it into my bag and once or twice in an act of Motown mimicry even stuffed a section in my trainers. It was the paper that kept me in touch, reminded me of home and spoke to my hopes and dreams, it seemed effortlessly left-of-centre, supportive of an independent Scotland and connected to the exciting cultural developments that made me want to spend more time at home.  Josh Littlejohn, founder of Social Bite  The Sunday Herald has been a massive supporter of our organisation Social Bite and has always championed the need to tackle social causes. The publication has covered Social Bite\u0027s journey over the last six years which has helped us raise awareness and funds to help homeless people throughout Scotland.  The Sunday Herald also recognised our Sleep in the Park event with a special award at their Culture Awards, for which we were touched and honoured. I would like to thank everyone in the team for their legacy to us and many organisations like ours over the years.  Aamer Anwar, human rights lawyer  I first got involved with the paper back in 1999 when we began the campaign for justice for the murder victim Surjit Singh Chhokar. The Sunday Herald carried our campaign week after week, building a relationship with the family and caring little about the powerful institutions which desperately tried to silence us. The paper was a key player in helping us get justice 18 years later. For that one issue which placed victim\u0026rsquos rights at the heart of the criminal justice system you can be immensely proud.  But looking back over the years, there have been so many issues and campaigns that I have worked on with the paper on that it\u0026rsquos hard to pick the most memorable. There was articles about the death of Sheku Bayoh in police custody the corrupt Counter Corruption Unit at Police Scotland the betrayal of justice for Emma Caldwell the ticking timebomb of sexual harassment at the Scottish Parliament. You even supported me when I was placed on trial for speaking out against a miscarriage of justice or faced death threats from \u0026lsquoIslamic\u0026rsquo extremists.  On so many levels your journalists have shown immense courage and compassion but you also gave us hope in the words you wrote. What compliment can I give to so many of you who worked this paper, other than to say you really made a difference to Scotland. There are so many ordinary people without powerful friends or money to rely upon, who would have been pushed aside, silenced and crushed had you not been there with your campaigning journalism.  It makes me incredibly sad to see you go, but on a personal level I just want to say thank you so much for being there for myself, the families and campaigns in our darkest hours. We always knew if we picked up the phone you could be relied upon for your unconditional support. Good luck my friends.  Hugh MacDonald, writer and broadcaster  There was, at first, a distance between us. The Sunday Herald lived above The Herald on Albion Street, below it on Renfield Street. We then grew close. Long before the Sunday Herald moved its digs to join The Herald on the same floor, I \u0026ndash a perennial daily hack - had made the occasional contribution to its pages. These dalliances became more of a regular relationship. These pieces generally represented what I liked about the Sunday Herald.  First, they were interesting. At least in their commissioning. I did my best to knock any intrigue from them. But articles were sought from me on such as the secrets of the confessional, the curious lack of professed gay footballers, and the importance of geography in American crime writing. They were typical of how the Sunday Herald sought to investigate the corners as well as the broad floor of politics, culture or sport.  Secondly, the editing was first class. Kathleen Morgan, the best journalist in Scotland never to have edited a national newspaper, produced a stunning magazine that her successor, Jane Wright, maintained to the highest standard. Susan Flockhart was a brilliant, insightful editor of copy. Any piece emerged better from her examination. This is a tribute born of personal experience.  There was a sense of gallusness about the Sunday Herald, too, never better illustrated by a front page that may have featured Ryan Giggs. Or maybe not. It also allowed some latitude. I began to write more sports pieces  and more book reviews, commissioned by Rosemary Goring, a peerless literary editor.  The rein was so free it could have been a four. I was allowed to write a preview to the 2012 Olympics that consisted of the first verse of London Calling, with slight amendments. It was fun. At least for me.  But best of all, it was independent. It informed you without apology about what it believed was important. It told you what it thought and it oft times took extraordinary criticism for that seeming impertinence. I loved that then. I mourn it now that it is gone.  Katie Archibald, columnist and champion racing cyclist  I first wrote for the Sunday Herald in 2014, the year of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games. The sports section had a weekly column written by a rotation of six Scottish athletes, all aspiring to Commonwealth success that year. It was a logbook of the highs and lows of lives consumed by sport. The column didn\u0026rsquot retell the happenings of races, matches and galas, but instead revealed the recipes behind our victories, confessed the insecurities muddled into our losses, and gave the insider view on sports controversies.  The Commonwealth Games came and with it the end to these six stories, whether they finished as fairy tales or not. But somehow, I continued writing in the paper. For me, the Sunday Herald was a platform to talk about cycling. It was inches on a page to entertain people and to subtly convince everyone to get on a bike, and for that opportunity I am very grateful. I was one small voice in the countless that were given the chance to be heard in this paper. The Sunday Herald will be missed.  Professor Sir Anton Muscatelli, Principal and Vice Chancellor, University of Glasgow  A healthy and provocative press is essential to the wellbeing of democratic debate and one of the great strengths, and I hope enduring legacies of the Sunday Herald, was the space provided for all shades of comment and opinion. In my own case I was pleased to engage with the editorial team, sometimes to offer just a line or two to a story but more often to contribute my thoughts and my perspective on often complex and challenging issues. From the Fiscal Framework to the economic consequences of Brexit for Scotland and the wider United Kingdom, I was encouraged to provide clarity and explanation. At a time of controversy over what is real and what is fake news, and against a continuing backdrop of those who still say we should not listen to experts I believe with great conviction that it is more important than ever that different and diverse opinions are given their place in our press."},{"url":null,"title":"lana-del-ray-cancels-israel-concert","story":"  In a Twitter message Del Rey said she is delaying \"until a time when I can schedule visits for both my Israeli and Palestinian fans\".

The Deltapoll for the Best for Britain group also found a majority of voters in Northern Ireland would back unification with the south if Brexit went ahead, especially if it meant the return of a hard border with the Republic.  Best for Britain, which wants a second vote on the 2016 referendum to Leave Europe, said the findings showed leaving the EU threatened the Union on several fronts.  Scotland voted 62-38 for Remain in the EU referendum, but Brexit has so far failed to shift the polls in favour of independence.  The poll of 1022 Scots found 47 per cent of people would vote No in another independence referendum tomorrow, compared to 45% saying Yes, with 8% unsure.  If Brexit was cancelled, the numbers were 47% No, 43% Yes, and 10% unsure.  But when people were asked how they would vote if Brexit went ahead, the numbers flipped to 47% Yes and 43% No .  However the poll did not include a baseline question asking how people voted in 2014, so it is unclear if the sample was wholly representative.  Of the 1199 people polled in Northern Ireland, only 35% would back a united Ireland if Brexit was cancelled, but support jumped to 56% if there was a hard border Brexit.  Theresa May yesterday insisted there would be no second vote on Brexit and no compromises on her soft Brexit Chequers plan unless they were in the \u0026ldquonational interest.  But there were also reports that her former election guru Sir Lynton Crosby was behind a plan to install former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson in Downing Street.  It was reported Sir Lynton, who helped Mr Johnson become London mayor, had let staff at his firm CTF Partners liaise with hard Brexit group Change Britain as part of the plan.  Best for Britain chief executive Eloise Todd said: \u0026ldquoWhen people voted in 2016, they didn\u0026rsquot vote to break up the Union and risk both Scotland and Northern Ireland voting for a different future outside the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThis is compelling evidence as to why we need to stop and think again.  \u0026ldquoThe public deserve a say on the final deal, with the knowledge that if Brexit happens we could shatter the Union altogether.\"  Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler, said: \u0026ldquoThis is a devastating poll which reveals there is a clear and present danger to the future of the United Kingdom.  \u0026ldquoThe Tories must stop putting the Union at risk and give voters a say on the final Brexit deal.  Professor Sir John Curtice, of Strathclyde University, said the poll posed hypothetical questions on one issue, but people decided how to vote based on numerous factors.  He said: \u0026ldquoWhat the poll shows is that Scotland\u0026rsquos status inside the Union is problematic irrespective of whether we remain in the EU or not. According to this poll it\u0026rsquos already on a knife-edge and the [Brexit-related] movement is very small.  \u0026ldquoRemain voters become more pro-Indy [when prompted on Brexit] and Leave voters move in the opposite direction, but the net effect is very close to zero.  \u0026ldquoThe 64,000 question is what will happen if we leave the EU and people feel Brexit is a disaster - would public opinion shift enough in favour of independence?  \u0026ldquoWe know that Brexit has made the Yes movement more closely tied to the EU, but that\u0026rsquos also a problem for them, because it means they\u0026rsquore fishing in 62 per cent of the public, much of which is never going to be interested in independence in the first place.  SNP MP Stephen Gethins said: \u0026ldquoWith almost 90% of polls since the referendum showing support for an independent Scotland above 2014 levels, independence is polling at historic highs.  \u0026ldquoAs the deeply damaging consequences of a \u0026lsquoNo deal\u0026rsquo Brexit become clearer, as Scotland\u0026rsquos economy continues to outperform the UK, and as people grow increasingly concerned about the future under Westminster rule, support for Scotland\u0027s ability to take its own decisions in an independent country will only grow further.  Tory MP Colin Clark said: \u0026ldquoThe people of Scotland voted by a significant margin to remain part of the United Kingdom in 2014.

I would therefore request that this application for permission to remain in the UK be granted so that he may continue to live a useful life in UK society.    The other asylum seeker MA entered the UK illegally in October, 2015 and initially claimed asylum because he was perceived to be a homosexual and at risk if returned, the Court of Session heard.  When the matter came to the FTT the claim was made on the basis of a conversion to Christianity which was not raised before Theresa May, then Home Secretary.  FTT judge took the view that the claim of conversion to Christianity was being kept \u0026ldquoin reserve as a \u0026ldquoPlan B, to be deployed if the initial claim based on perceived homosexual orientation should fail.  And the FTT judge called his claim a \"multi-layered contrivance\" adding: \"He is not a genuine asylum seeker and should be removed from the UK on that basis.\"  The judge felt that a fabrication\u0026nbspof a story about an alleged homosexual encounter appeared to indicate that the appellant is \"someone who is prepared to contrive an account to suit his purposes\".  Four representatives from the Tron backed MA\u0027s asylum bid including Mr Taylor who again warned of persecution if returned to Iran.  But Lord Glennie said that in each case, the FTT, having formed a view on credibility adverse to the men \"appears to have paid little attention to the other evidence available to it, particularly the evidence from the witnesses from the Tron Church, accepting its honesty but giving it little or no weight.    \"It is wrong in principle to form a concluded view of the probable veracity of particular items of evidence and then, from that fixed point, to allow that view to govern the assessment of other evidence in the case. The proper approach is to adopt what is sometimes called an \u0027holistic\u0027 approach, considering all the evidence \u0027in the round\u0027 before arriving at any concluded view on the facts.  He added: \"The judge should not jump too readily to the conclusion that because the appellant has told lies about some matters then his credibility on all matters is fatally undermined.  \"Juries in a criminal trial are commonly directed that the fact that an individual may have lied about one point does not necessarily mean that he is lying about other matters, and the same words of caution should be taken to heart by tribunal judges hearing evidence in immigration and asylum appeals.  \"People have different reasons for not telling the truth, or the whole truth, about particular matters.  He said in the case of TF: \"[The FTT judge] says that he has \u0027looked at all the evidence in the round and taken into account my other findings herein before reaching my conclusions in respect of the appellant\u0026rsquos claimed conversion to Christianity\u0027. But when one looks at his reasons, he does no such thing.  \"What he ought to have done was to look at all the evidence in the case, including the evidence from the Tron Church witnesses, on its own merits before forming a concluded view as to the veracity of the appellant.  \"We cannot say what conclusion he would have reached had he done this, but it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a consideration of the evidence from the church, carried out on its merits and without any a priori assumption about the appellant\u0026rsquos lack of credibility, might have led him to form a different view of the appellant.\"  Lord Glennie said over the MA decision that the judge expressed concern about \"what appears to be a mean-spirited approach to some of the evidence\".  The FTT judge had referred to the Tron Church as an example of organisations which \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least are bona fide religious institutions or organisations.  Lord Glennie said: \"The use of the expression \u0026ldquoon the face of it at least appears to imply some doubt as to whether or not it is a bona fide religious organisation. If that is what he is saying he should say so clearly and give his reasons. If he has no good reason to doubt its bona fides then he should refrain from this insinuating reference.\"  The judgment said the men\u0027s appeals were heard together because they appeared to raise similar questions relating to the appropriate treatment of certain types of evidence in cases where the genuineness of conversion is challenged.  Lord Glennie said they also raised questions as to the status of evidence from church leaders or others holding positions of responsibility about the conduct of a person who has begun the process of admission into the church and as to the sincerity of his conversion to Christianity."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/3814483.jpg?type=article-full","title":"bbc-faces-strict-quotas-to-ensures-it-delivers-on-promises-on-scottish-content-on-new-channel","story":"  Proposed new licence conditions state that 95% of the output of the new BBC Scotland channel must consist of programmes made in Scotland and it must carry news during peak viewing times - between 6pm and 10.30pm.

Other conditions Ofcom wants to write into the Licence also include ensuring the new channels provide a \"range of genres in its programming that reflects Scotland\u0027s culture\". There is a similar condition for BBC Two Scotland which will be discontinued with the new channel launch.  It is further proposed that at least three quarters of the new channel\u0027s output must consist of \u0026lsquooriginal productions\u0026rsquo, an approach previously taken with BBC Alba and BBC Two Scotland.  BBC Two Scotland is expected to provide at least 200 hours of non-news programmes, including Gaelic language output during every financial year.  But Ofcom decided not to propose any conditions relating to Gaelic programming on the new channel, saying the BBC indicated it would not form part of the new channel.  It also ruled out imposing rules that ensure that repeats make up no more than 50% of the new channel. The BBC has already indicated that about 50% of the shows on the channel will be repeats.    But it has warned in its consultation paper: \"Should we be concerned by any aspect of the [BBC Scotland] on-going performance, including the level of repeats, we do not rule out imposing additional licence conditions on the new channel in future, if we consider it is appropriate to do so.\"  The BBC had indicated that the new channel which is expected to go live in February, next year, would have a news programme  covering \"international, UK and Scottish stories, told from a Scottish perspective\", with shorter bulletins at weekends.  It would feature shows that reflect Scottish life, including the opportunity to premiere some new comedy and drama.  The BBC has told the regulator the new channel would be broadcast from 7pm to midnight every evening. In addition, the channel would broadcast BBC Two simulcast from 12 noon to 7pm interspersed with ad hoc events such as live political daytime coverage - particularly First Minister\u0026rsquos Questions - and live sport. Daytime coverage would amount to no more than 150 hours per year.    The BBC has said that the new channel is expected to work in collaboration with other BBC television channels, particularly to enable it to premiere some drama and comedy. This would enable the channel to meet its ambition to schedule a wide range of programmes in the interests of audiences in Scotland.  It has been proposed that the new channel will take the place currently occupied by BBC Four on electronic programme guides  in Scotland. BBC Four would move down the EPG to a less prominent slot.

Solaris - a tale about scientists probing a huge sentient, oceanic planet and their subsequent contact with unsettlingly strange phenomena - is being adapted for the stage by David Greig, playwright and director of the Lyceum.  The sci-fi tale will have a notable change from the novel and films, as Dr Kris Kelvin, the protagonist, will be a woman.  In the celebrated 1972 film by Andrei Tarkovsky, Kelvin was played by Donatas Banionis, in the 2002 version, he was played by Clooney.  READ MORE: Artistic team announced for Lyceum\u0027s Local Hero  The production will be part of the Lyceum\u0027s 2019/20 season, and is a co-production with the Malthouse Theatre in Melbourne, Australia, where it will open in June 2019.  The play continues the theme of movies playing a role in the Lyceum\u0027s productions: it is also making a stage version of Bill Forsyth\u0027s Local Hero, and Touching the Void, which was also a film based on Joe Simpson\u0027s book.  The cast has yet to be fully confirmed but it will include Eamon Farren, whose recent credits include Richard Horne in Twin Peaks and Cust in The ABC Murders.  The gender reversal in the new play, which will be directed by Matthew Lutton, will mean that the dead lover or partner that haunts Kelvin on her expedition will be a young man, rather than a woman.  Matthew Lutton also directed last year\u0027s production of Picnic at Hanging Rock.  READ MORE: How Midsummer was reborn for the 2018 Festival  Greig said: \"It was Matthew that suggested it.  \"The book has one of the best premises - and the book\u0027s tone is playful, it has a lot more common with Hitchhiker\u0027s Guide to the Galaxy and Red Dwarf than you might think: the whole opening chapter is the hilarious history of scientists who have studied Solaris, it is dazzling and funny.  \"But the more I looked it, I thought: why hasn\u0027t this been a play before? It is three people in an enclosed environment [a space station], a new person arrives and they experience visitors, or ghosts, which changes the attitude to what they should do.  \"It is a play: a one room play - now of course outside the room is a giant sentient planet, but the basic premise is there.\"  He said the oceanic planet would present obvious challenges to represent on the stage, but ones surmountable with special theatrical effects and lighting.  Greig added: \"The book has this heart, that really blew me away, because at its core you are looking at this planet that is a sea, but the sea is consciousness, and they cannot work out whether it is God: Does it understand everything? Or is it a child?\"  READ MORE: Greig on \u0027Local Hero\u0027 for the stage  He said that the play, which will feature an international cast, would be primarily drawing from Lem\u0027s novel, rather than the films, for its primary inspiration.  The story, he noted, was also \"deeply about suicide\" and its impact.  Greig said: \"Tarkovky\u0026rsquos film is moving and atmospheric but discovering the novel was like uncovering a whole new layer \u0026ndash lively and witty and playful and strange.  \"But this novel, and our imagining, is also a return to the future as it was conceived in the sixties \u0026ndash science fiction on stage is so often about tin foil, sliding doors and empty space whereas this is about mahogany bookcases, smoking cigarettes and spools of tape.\"  Greig became the eighth artistic director of The Lyceum in 2016.  On the lead role of Dr Kelvin, he said: \"A brilliant thing about sci-fi is that it allows you to say: in 100 years in the future, why on earth would we not expect to see a mixture of races and men and women?  \"So we are hoping to get a multi-ethnic cast from different parts of the world: because why on a space station would it not be like that?  \"We looked at Kelvin...and I looked at the suicide of the lover: Kelvin\u0027s lover in the book is his wife who committed suicide at 20, and she really doesn\u0027t have a personality.  \"When you flip it, there are just fewer stereotypes of the older woman looking back at the younger male lover.  \"Kelvin is a psychologist and an astronaut: it is a fantastic part to play.\""},{"url":null,"title":"snp-overtake-tories-as-uks-second-biggest-party-data-suggests","story":"  Data collated by the House of Commons Library estimated the Nationalists have just under 125,500 members, compared to the Tories\u0026rsquo 124,000.

Scotland presents a unique landscape and culture for those film and TV companies as settings not only for documentaries, but for top-rated timeless dramas.”                                                                                                        In keeping with the ‘TV guide’ style, the book also has a selection of film highlights and contains special sections on Outlander, Doctor Who and famous Scottish small-screen characters, including Scrooge McDuck from DuckTales and Scotty from Star Trek.\u0027TV Set in Scotland\u0027 aims to capitalise on the growing trend of set-jetting following research showing that one in five visitors to Scotland have been inspired to visit the country after seeing locations on the big and small screen.Cabinet Secretary for Culture, Tourism and External Affairs Fiona Hyslop said: “Scotland’s scenery and built heritage, together with our diverse and rich culture have attracted countless filmmakers over the years.“I welcome this new guide which maps out the locations of some of the great television shows that have been filmed in Scotland and will encourage TV fans of all ages to come and explore our fantastic on-screen locations in real life.”                                                                                                        Jenni Steele, Film and Creative Industries Manager at VisitScotland, said: “The list of television shows and locations featured in TV Set in Scotland is not exhaustive, but this fun and informative guide, which contains firm fan favourites alongside little-known gems, serves as a starting point for visitors wishing to explore the many on-screen locations and nearby attractions.“The impact of filmmaking in Scotland goes far beyond production spend. Scotland’s appearances on TV have the potential to reach huge global audiences and, with research finding that one in five visitors are inspired to visit after seeing it on-screen, the opportunities for the tourism industry are immense.”The latest figures show that spend on film and TV in Scotland in 2017 reached £95 million – the highest level since records began – and a £26 million increase on the previous year.

The vaccine remains the best way to protect your child against flu and its complications, and helps protect those around them who may be vulnerable to flu.                                                                                                        “Primary school children cannot receive their flu vaccination if a signed consent form isn’t returned, so I’d encourage parents to look out for it. By everyone playing their part, we can stop the spread of the virus this winter.”For further information, visit www.nhsinform.scot/campaigns/get-ready-for-flu                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"programme aims to give unemployed people a fair start","story":"        Fair Start Scotland is aiming to help thousands of unemployed people find their way into work.                 Among those on the programme is Joe Boland , who has been unemployed for 24 years and has experienced several barriers on his journey to find work.                                                     Due to past alcohol misuse, coupled with a previous conviction and mobility issues, he has found it difficult to get back in to employment.                                                     Joe has been on Fair Start Scotland for six weeks.  Through his vocational profiling talks with his adviser he identified his Job Goals and opportunities for finding work.         He has a previous experience in construction and contacts in the industry, so he felt he could secure work in this sector with some support. In agreement with his adviser, Joe felt that getting a Construction Skills Certification Scheme  card and gaining skills in Portable Appliance Testing  would be the best start to his journey to find work. With this combined training behind him, he could seek work which would involve inspection for minor defects or omissions in building works coupled with testing electrical equipment. Joe has now passed his CSCS training and got his Site Operative card, completed Control of Substances Hazardous to Health  training and updated his employability skills.                                                                                                          Joe’s Fair Start Scotland advisor helped him in setting up his ‘Find A Job’ account and supported him with job searching. Going forward, Joe will continue his journey to find a job that suits his circumstances. Joe said: “So far I have found Fair Start Scotland helpful and my adviser has been encouraging and supportive. I’ve done training I didn’t know about like basic IT skills, and updated my skills in construction and health and safety.”Fair Start ScotlandFair Start Scotland is Scotland’s new devolved employment support service. It is focused on supporting unemployed people who have challenges in accessing the labour market for whom work is a realistic prospect.                                                                                                        Launched in April this year, the service will run until 2023 and aims to provide tailored, flexible and person-centred support to at least 38,000 people across Scotland who want help to find work, and stay in work.Fair Start Scotland is distinctive in that participation is voluntary. This means that people have everything to gain and nothing to lose – choosing to participate won’t affect existing benefits or be driven by fear of benefit sanctions. The service is based on partnership and joint working between the Scottish Government, and the public, third and private sectors to deliver better outcomes for people seeking employment support. Jamie Hepburn, Minister for Business, Fair Work and Skills, said: “We are dedicated to delivering a high quality employment support service that will lead to real and sustained job outcomes and help people to achieve their full potential. “As well as meeting the needs of unemployed people, Fair Start Scotland also seeks to help businesses find the skilled and committed employees they need to thrive.”                                                                                                        To find out more and check whether you are eligible, visit www.mygov.scot/fairstart                "},{"url":null,"title":"Bower author helping Norn become the norm","story":"COMMON words and phrases used by Caithnessians may be thought of by locals as slang terms \u0026ndash but, by using them, they may have been reviving a dead language.Bower author Elspeth Grace Hall is doing her bit to revive the language of Norn that was once widely spoken in Caithness.Norn was officially declared a \u0026ldquodead language by world heritage body the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization .However, Grace Hall has been bringing about a revival of the region\u0026rsquos native tongue by writing a series of children\u0026rsquos workbooks to teach kids how to read and write in Norn.If Elspeth is successful in helping to increase the numbers of Norn speakers in Caithness, UNESCO could reverse its death declaration.They had once delivered a similar verdict on Kernowek \u0026ndash the native language of south-west English county, Cornwall.But in 2010, UNESCO announced that its former classification of the language as \u0026ldquoextinct was \u0026ldquono longer accurate.Grace Hall said: \u0026ldquoIf you have ever sat \u0026lsquoO a benk\u0026rsquo, fed the \u0026lsquoscorries\u0026rsquo, told your \u0026lsquomannie\u0026rsquo off for being a \u0026lsquoloon\u0026rsquo or simply popped off \u0026lsquotill\u0026rsquo the shops you have been speaking a second language \u0026ndash one that officially doesn\u0026rsquot even exist.\u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove always been intrigued by languages and the Caithness dialect is wonderfully rich.\u0026ldquoI started to investigate the etymology of words unique to Caithness and found that they weren\u0026rsquot part of Scots, English or Gaelic, they were in fact Norn. A language that official bodies such as the UNESCO insist has been dead since the 1800\u0026rsquos.\u0026ldquoIt wouldn\u0026rsquot be the first time UNESCO has prematurely pronounced a language as dead.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:50

Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:50 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117256.jpg","title":"Norse era in Caithness was our very own Game of Thrones","story":"He has taken some of the most dramatic events from a time when the county was the southern part of the Orkney earldom and condensed them into a rollicking, fast-moving narrative in The Katanes Saga .It is based on a series of articles published in the John O\u0026rsquoGroat Journal over a decade ago, reinterpreting source material from ious sagas, and follows on from The Raven Banner, published in the mid-1990s and now out of print. Like that earlier work, The Katanes Saga is told in an unpretentious, engaging, sometimes blokey style. From the drunken arguments to the devious plots to the mutilations and killings, Cassells tells it like it is.\u0026ldquoThe Raven Banner was basically a guide to Norse Caithness with a little bit about each area and what I thought were the main things that happened in Norse times, he explains. \u0026ldquoThe Katanes Saga is far more in-depth.\u0026ldquoThey were people like you and me. They had the same faults. You could meet three Vikings in the pub any night.\u0026ldquoOne word I would use to describe the Norse is pragmatic. They were really pragmatic people. If that\u0026rsquos the way it works, that\u0026rsquos the way it works \u0026ndash if it doesn\u0026rsquot, I\u0026rsquoll do it my way.\u0026ldquoI do mention that of all the Norse earls of Orkney only a handful actually died in their beds. Most suffered violent deaths. One was killed with contact poison from his own auntie and mother on a shirt.Cassells  is a retired Royal Mail manager who previously worked as a lighthouse keeper on Muckle Flugga and Stroma. Those experiences inspired two other books, No More Paraffin-Oilers and A Light Walk.The Katanes Saga sees him returning to a theme that first sparked his interest at an early age. Born in Barrow, he moved to Thurso in late 1950s when his father came to work at the Admiralty test establishment.\u0026ldquoI always liked Greek and Roman mythology and I started reading about Norse mythology as well, he recalls. \u0026ldquoAs a young boy I lived in Sweyn Road in Thurso and I wondered who Sweyn was. A pal of mine said, \u0026lsquoAch, that\u0026rsquoll be Sweyn the pirate.\u0026rsquo So for about a year I had this happy vision of a Pugwash-type character that the street was named after. I then discovered Sweyn Asleifarson.Swyen , iously described \u0026ldquothe last of the Vikings and \u0026ldquothe greatest troublemaker in the westernlands, had an estate at Duncansby and was renowned for raiding, plundering and pillaging. One of the many who suffered at his hands was Frakokk, who had featured in the poisoned-shirt incident: she was burned to death in her farmhouse at Helmsdale, along with other members of her faction, in a revenge attack led by Swyen.It\u0026rsquos an example of the way in which many of the strands are intertwined, as Cassells points out.\u0026ldquoI read the sagas and I started taking a look at place names, he says. \u0026ldquoFor a long time I lived at Scrabster \u0026ndash Skarabolstadr, the \u0026lsquohomestead of the sea-mews\u0026rsquo.\u0026ldquoAnd the stories were interesting to read. They were intriguing.\u0026ldquoYou try and unravel it and it\u0026rsquos just more or less two families feuding all the way through it. That goes right to the very last act of the local earl being knifed in a beer cellar in Thurso.One of the most shocking events is the burning to death of Bishop Adam by a mob in Halkirk in a dispute over a butter tax.\u0026ldquoHe got a bit greedy, Cassells says. \u0026ldquoThey complained to the earl at the time who more or less said, \u0026lsquoDamn the bishop, you can burn him as you please,\u0026rsquo so they took him at his word.\u0026ldquoBishops crop up a couple of times. There was lot of enmity between the local Norse earldom and the Scottish king over bishops.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It sounds like a long time, but my experience of these things is that it catches up on you very quickly and there’s a lot of work to do between now and then.”Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, in addition to good team-working are vital attributes. However, notably, an interest in sport is not essential.The voluntary services of personnel with experience in event planning, fundraising and sponsorship, business and project management, procurement, marketing and PR, communication and strategic planning, are also being sought.Mr Deans added: “We’re looking for people with the skills, but they really need that long-term commitment and time to devote to this.”Recruitment information and an online application can be found at www.oiga.org.uk/organising-committee-recruitment-statement/For further information, and any queries, email info@oiga.org.uk.The deadline for applications is Saturday, September 29.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

There’s that fudgy sweetness that characterises the more mature Highland Park, but here it’s combined with complex aromatic spices as well as dark chocolate orange and floral peat notes.

This will briefly divert cars onto the adjacent railway track and back again at set windows during the day when trains are not passing by.But motorists who miss one of the windows could face waits of up to two-and-a-half hours for the next one.And this has prompted Highland Council to urge drivers to make sure they plan their journey and allow enough travel time so they are not caught out.A council spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoWe have worked closely with Network Rail and our contractor TRAC Engineering Ltd to keep disruption to road users to a minimum when the road\u0026ldquoBut inevitably there will be times when road users will face longer waits \u0026ndash so we urge people to plan their travel carefully and avoid the periods when the diversion is not going to be available.During the works the road will be closed overnight to all traffic between the two gates between 10pm and 7am.Traffic control measures will operate between 7am and 10pm while the road-to-rail bypass is installed. This could take up to two weeks, but may be finished sooner.Once the temporary bypass is installed, the timetable of opening slots between trains will take effect.Cards showing details of the timetable that will be operating for the road to rail diversion have been distributed among local communities.Copies are also available at the Highland Council website by searching for Stromeferry Bypass at www.highland.gov.ukThe road-to-rail bypass will be available for use between 7am and 10pm, but only by traffic weighing less than seven-and-a-half tonnes .Traffic above those limits will have to divert along the A87, A82, A832 and A890.The council believes the restrictions and roadworks will be finished by November 24, when the A890 will fully reopen.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:51 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Detailed measures will be presented next week.Leaders of the minority independent administration said every attempt would be made to minimise the impact on services but \u0026ldquosome impact on service is inevitable.Budget leader Alister Mackinnon said: \u0026ldquoOur  reserves of \u0026pound8 million are well below the minimum recommended by Audit Scotland and it\u0026rsquos vital that they\u0026rsquore not depleted further. The committee agreed stricter controls on recruitment and overtime, a review of all agency appointments and tighter controls on staff travel.The \u0026pound5.1 million figure equates to one per cent of the total budget and compares with a \u0026pound2.7 million estimate at this stage last year. The potential overspend is blamed on high cost placements for \u0026lsquolooked-after children\u0026rsquo, lower income from new parking charges and fewer savings from toilet closures because those two policies have not yet taken full effect.Council chiefs insisted no staff jobs were at risk.Finance director Derek Yule, however, warned there were \u0026ldquono more rabbits to be pulled from hats to tackle the problems.Black Isle Liberal Democrat Gordon Adam blamed Scottish Government grant cuts while SNP city councillor Richard Laird said the crisis was \u0026ldquoentirely of this council\u0026rsquos making.Council leader Margaret Davidson claimed local government services were \u0026ldquonot a priority for the Scottish Government.The budget leader angered the SNP benches, accusing group leader Maxine Smith of not fully participating in budget discussions. He said he invited her to meetings but had been turned down \u0026ldquobecause she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her diary.She was not in the chamber to respond. In a later statement she said: \u0026ldquoOn Friday, I received a request to attend a meeting on Monday to discuss the budget. I had commitments but they were pre-arranged meetings with constituents. I\u0026rsquove sent him a meeting request for tomorrow. I\u0026rsquom available any time, so hopefully he\u0026rsquoll re-arrange his diary. On the budget, our job in opposition is to scrutinise.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: \u0026ldquoHighland Council has had more this year despite UK government cuts to our budget. It will receive over \u0026pound487 million Scottish Government funding in 2018-19.n Support was voiced for a city councillor who has quit as the SNP\u0026rsquos deputy leader on Highland Council.Richard Laird  cited health reasons for his decision. He will remain a Central Ward councillor. He said: \u0026ldquoMy health isn\u0026rsquot good enough. That\u0026rsquos the reason I\u0026rsquom stepping down. For the last year or so, both my physical health and my mental health have been in decline. I\u0026rsquove been told by the doctor to reduce my workload a bit.SNP group leader Maxine Smith said: \u0026ldquoI am saddened that Richard has had to step down as depute group leader, as we have worked well together. His illness has been creeping up on him for some time and he feels he needs time to rest, so removing the huge responsibility of chairing a strategic committee is a sensible thing to do. Richard will continue to be a valued member of our group. He is a highly intelligent man, who has lots more to give.Monday 3 Sep 2018 4:51 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

The campaign was highlighted earlier this year by the Ross-shire Journal when riders revealed their concerns.After meeting campaigners near Cullicudden, Miss Forbes said: \u0026ldquoIn a rural place like the Black Isle it\u0026rsquos not surprising to see horse riders. Despite that, I was really disappointed to hear that drivers usually drive too close and too fast when passing a horse. There is evidently a lot of work to do in educating drivers about overtaking horses and the serious dangers of scaring horses.\u0026ldquoSadly, horse riders told me that they believe the roads are increasingly dangerous for horse riding, despite horse riders having equal access to the road. I support these horse riders on the Black Isle who want to raise awareness of how to overtake horses and ensure that riders don\u0026rsquot fear for their safety when riding in a rural place like the Black Isle.Since 2010, there have been almost 150 incidents on Scottish roads involving both motorists and horse riders \u0026ndash including two rider fatalities and 50 serious injuries.One local rider earlier told the Ross-shire Journal how she had taken to wearing head-mounted cameras in a bid to protect herself and others. Concern over an increasing number of near misses and alarming incidents has prompted calls to the police to intervene.Nel MacDonald-Rolfe, one of the riders, said: \u0026ldquoRural roads are to be treated with respect even by the locals who become complacent and take chances. You never know what is round the corner nor what can suddenly appear from the side of the roads.\u0026ldquoRural roads are there to be used by all, which includes cycles, walkers and horse riders. Patience and respect for all users and educating is the key. As they say, speed kills.The appeal to drivers to rein in their speed and to be aware of other road users followed near-misses on the B9169 Cullicudden straight. Police say they recognise the vulnerability of horses on roads and encourage motorists and riders to show mutual respect for each other.They say all road users should be able to travel safely and drivers should give horses as much room as possible when passing. They want road users to read the Highway Code for guidance.- Email us at newdesk@spp-groupMonday 3 Sep 2018 4:51 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

That echoes public concerns which prompted a rethink from Highland Council four years ago.Tarbat Community Council is amongst the latest groups backing Craighill, stating that the TRA site \u0026ldquoshould not feature even as a second choice. It has outlined concerns over the lack of space for future expansion, inadequate room to play and the prospect of \u0026ldquotall and ugly buildings more appropriate to terminals at a second-rate airport.It says that \u0026ldquohuge cost advantages could come from using modular building techniques.The new campus will replace Tain Royal Academy, Craighill Primary, Knockbreck and the St Duthus special school. Parent councils have consistently appealed for improved facilities with the existing Craighill building the lowest scoring in the Highlands for educational suitability and condition.Wendy Hennem, of Tain Royal Academy Parent Council, noted that the Craighill site appeared to be the preferred public choice and that the resounding response from young people is: \u0026ldquoJust get it done.Tain and Easter Ross ward councillor Fiona Robertson told the Journal: \u0026ldquoAs we haven\u0026rsquot reached the deadline yet, I am not privy to the results of the consultation. However, I believe from my work with the stakeholder group and from being amongst the communities, that the Craighill site may be the most popular option. This has always been my preferred option as I believe it is much more suitable for a development of the size of a three to 18 campus.\u0026ldquoWhatever the results, it is important that the community works with Highland Council in order to deliver much-needed new schools for Tain. The extremely poor conditions of our primary and secondary schools in Tain is well known and acknowledged by Highland Council, therefore we all need to work hard to prepare an agreed plan in order to be in a position to apply for government funding later in the year.\u0026ldquoI believe the majority of people in Tain and Easter Ross just want to ensure we get fit for purpose schools in Tain to ensure the best possible educational facilities for our children\u0026rsquos futures.Fellow ward councillor Derek Loudon said: \u0026ldquoStudies by the community council, the Highland Council and the Ross-shire Journal have shown a clear preference for Craighill. There is little public support for the TRA site as all three consultations have shown. I hope we can move on now to get a layout on the Craighill site which is along the lines of the study done by Lachie Stewart [chairman of Tain and Easter Ross Civic Trust] and the community council which takes advantage of the space available to deliver great new buildings for primary, secondary, St Duthus, Gaelic and sports and leisure.\u0026ldquoI believe significant savings on cost, quality and time can be made with new construction techniques which are proven and have worked elsewhere. Let\u0026rsquos work with the Scottish Government and the Scottish Future\u0026rsquos Trust to deliver a great result for the people of Easter Ross.The consultation can be accessed at https:www.highland.gov.uk/downloads/file/19305/proposal_paper_tain_final_240518What do you think?

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

One is the Climate Change Bill where Scottish Labour has joined the Scottish Greens in calling for net zero emissions rather than the 90 per cent cut proposed by the SNP. Of course, percentages tend to leave the public cold. So it’s worth trying to visualise the differences between a very sizeable cut in our contribution to global warming and an absolute end.            The SNP’s 90 per cent target means electric buses, trains and cars will be standard transport modes by 2050 and the planning system will reduce the demand for travel and bring employment closer to where people live. To go further and reach net zero emissions, Scotland must also tackle the difficult areas of aviation and shipping and explore ideas like electric/hydrogen ferries and electric planes, which are being built and piloted in the Nordic nations now. Flights to the sun for summer holidays will still be possible – but at 2005 levels.To make progress in agriculture, we must cut current ­levels of meat and dairy consumption and production. It was noticeable at a recent conference in Finland that the default in hotels, cafes and universities is already almond, not cow’s milk. But for Scotland to reach net zero, far more will have to change. We may need new breeds of cows and sheep, which emit less methane and a new diet for animals. Our farming and food science institutes must start that kind of experimentation now. Industry will change dramatically under either scenario. Our oil and gas dependence must end by 2050 and there can be no new oil fields developed in the North Sea except where they supply developing nations, on the grounds that existing operations cause less eco-damage than drilling elsewhere from scratch. Companies and investment funds will have divested from fossil fuels to avoid being left with “stranded assets” as oil-based products and services become ­economically unviable. Much energy and imagination will be needed to replace cement and plastics. Where that isn’t ­possible, Scotland will have to offset using carbon capture technology  and will have to get funding agreement or political ­control from Westminster.            Heating will have to be electric by default to reach the 90 per cent target so air and ground source heat pumps will have to be affordable and commonplace. That demands a big rise in insulation and some frank discussion about whether ­utilities are up to the task. Net zero emissions means more district heating, and imaginative solutions for rural areas like hydrogen generated by renewables as ­Orkney is already doing. Tree planting will escalate rapidly because a small amount of emissions can be mitigated by planting forests to store carbon. Reafforestation demands a big debate – will big landowners be allowed to evict tenants for tree-planting grants or will the opportunity be seized to effect land reform and diversify the rural economy?These changes can boost the economy if Scotland’s politicians are resolute. We can be ahead of the manufacturing curve and not just left buying foreign innovation. Cyclotricity is relocating from ­England to Glenrothes to manufacture electric bicycles and Star Renewables – whose heat pumps use fjord water to power the Norwegian town of Drammen – could do the same in every coastal Scottish town and city. But innovation and investment is needed now so we don’t import zero-emissions related-technology as we have imported most wind turbines. All these changes are essential because Scotland’s success in tackling carbon emissions  is largely in energy production  and waste  while reductions in agriculture , residential heating , and transport  have been far lower.             The low hanging fruit have almost all been picked. If the Scottish Government still wants the most ambitious climate change targets in the world, it must tackle bigger structural issues. Norway’s Conservative-led Government has just promised to reach zero emissions by 2030, Sweden’s target is 2045 and the French target is 2050.Does Scotland’s devolved government control enough budget, taxes and levers to deliver the same? Will the public support dramatic change or will the ­prospect of more warm, dry summers and the impending chaos of Brexit combine to let politicians off the hook? What will change minds – food prices rising further as a downside of the dry summer? How about predictions that more melting ice could shift the Gulf Stream, which guarantees Scotland’s mild climate? This year wild fires covered the globe an unprecedented heat wave killed dozens in Japan and thick sea ice off Greenland has broken up for the first time on record. The world is witnessing ­tipping points aplenty. Can these extreme climate events be ­written off as insignificant or mere coincidence?Matters will come to a head during October’s SNP conference when the IPCC is due to release its latest statement on what countries must do to hold warming below the 1.5C limit demanded by the Paris Agreement. Actually, UK emissions have fallen faster since 2010 than in any other G7 nation except Italy – mostly through a switch away from coal-fired electricity.In July, more than 100 MPs wrote to the Prime Minister calling for a target of net zero emissions by 2050. In short, there may just be the appetite for real political cooperation across borders and ­party lines. Sadly the imminent chaos and recrimination of Brexit may soon end that.            Of course, politicians are frightened of confronting voters with the scale of change needed to move from the oil to the renewables age. Scotland’s remaining oil has for too long been integral to the case for independence – will the SNP be able to move beyond Scotland’s Oil as a slogan and aspiration? Will Scottish Labour’s new enthusiasm for net zero emissions be shared by Jeremy Corbyn and will the ­party weaponise Scotland’s inevitable transition away from oil as a new way to attack independence? It may be unduly optimistic, but focus on climate change could yet transform Scottish society – if we are all ready to raise our game."},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4794068.1535976811!/image/image.jpg","title":"snp overtake tories to become second biggest party in uk","story":"Sorry, we\u0027re having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...

Construction began in 2016 and is expected to be completed on schedule in late summer.\nLocated at Seafield the new centre is just a short distance from the long-standing Eric Gray Centre. Once opened the centre will provide specialist assistance for adults with complex care needs and learning disabilities.\nThe building has been designed by Richard Gibson Architects and construction is being led by DITT. The drone footage was shot by Nick McCaffrey.\nThe centre does indeed look good and is on schedule well done DITT , the clients and staff are all looking forward to being in the building. It has taken many years to reach this point  and is much needed.\nI wonder what, if any, proof you have that clients and staff are looking forward to being in the building? If you do have some proof to justify your claim, are they looking forward to being in before or after completion?\nGeorge Dickson\nI have along with other parents of clients that currently use the Eric Gray Centre worked hard, and against many obstacles to finally see the realisation  of a much needed new building where all clients who are at this moment in different buildings due to there being not enough space in the old building and facilities that have run there course in time. It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building. The building will provide not only better facilities and space but will also give staff the help in coordination and equipment to do there job under one roof with less strain and expense to all.\nI also claim nothing but most people that have lived in Shetland for the last 10 years will be aware of the problems associated with the Eric Gray building, whether directly involved or not although the thinking and planning of a new building goes farther back than that.\nSome parents and staff have had a look through the new building at different stages of build, and everyone to my knowledge was impressed.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.  HG\nIs the winning artist of the Turner Prize, representing what many think of the Turner Prize and this of being a club for elitist artists where their work is highly questionable or just giving art the \u0026#8216 shock value \u0026#8216 when it comes to expressing what art is or should be?\nPersonally, I would do away with this and just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it \u0026#8216 And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230. \u0026#8216. lol\n“ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.?”.

You said “ personally , I would just put a pile of shit onto a white surface with a white background and title it “ And the winner of the Turner Prize is\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.David Spence.   I’ll lend you a trowel to apply the “paint” provided that you are prepared to produce it \u0026#8230\u0026#8230.. on stage at Mareel perhaps. After all, anything goes these days and you could bask in the glory for the rest of your days.  Plus free drinks at the bar with all the trendies.   LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 22 ","story":"After being tasked with compiling a feature to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the senior football inter-county, it was a pleasure to speak to several of those with first-hand knowledge of the history of the Milne Cup competition.\nGeordie Hunter goes the furthest back, having made his debut in the 1953 game. On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

Proposed change will bring a greater number of properties into the protected area and, therefore, under stricter planning controls.\nHowever, Andrew Puls, Highland Council\u0027s principal officer for building conservation and environment, told local councillors meeting in Grantown that from 732 local homes, and after a consultation event attended by 50 people, there were only 12 responses. Opinion was also sought online. There is potential for the amended boundary to generate more planning applications. Parts of Grantown including The Square were designated as a conservation area in 1975. This is the first formal review since that designation.\nThe proposal is to extend the designated area along South High Street and into peripheral areas of the conservation zone. Mr Puls stressed it was not the purpose of a conservation area to prevent development but \"rather to control development to ensure it is appropriately sited and designed\".\nHe said this was aptly demonstrated by a number of new developments consented in recent years. Strong views were expressed \u0026ndash for and against \u0026ndash on the inclusion of the belt of trees to the north and west of Inverallan Church.\nThe trees contribute to the setting of the conservation area, forming a backdrop to the B-listed church \"and provide a natural separation with the later development to the north west\", according to the officer\u0027s report to members.\nThose against the proposed extension cited the project to convert the church for \"community use, part funded by developing housing either side of the church\".\nThere was a sense that including the location within the conservation area would be \"a barrier to this development\".\nConversely, there was support for including the trees because they would be better protected from speculative development.\nThe draft proposals will go to the council\u0027s south planning committee for approval. If adopted, all properties within the conservation area will be notified by letter.\nMonday 3 Sep 2018 4:52 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117085.jpg","title":"Dalwhinnie makeover starts to take shape","story":"Tom Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nDALWHINNIE is on the verge of a major makeover at its southern entrance.\nFor too long dogged by a disused, overgrown compound and a rusting old water treatment works, villagers are now beginning to hope that things could change dramatically over the next few months.\nAll being well, they heard on Tuesday, a \u0026pound2.3 million upgrade by Scottish Water could get under way in the new year which would leave the village with a new treatment works by this time next year.\n\"There\u0027s a long way to go,\" said the north\u0027s corporate affairs manager Gavin Steel when the Strathy met with an SW team in the village hall, \"but we\u0027re hopeful that all the many stages will be gone through on schedule.\n\"We are having to consult with a lot of different individuals and organisations \u0026ndash not least the national park authority, the Highland Council, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and landowners \u0026ndash but this is work which will have to be done on behalf of the community.\n\"Quite simply the current system has reached its sell-by date.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Run-Rig-1977-ADJUST-e1534430676612.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

They harnessed Gaelic to the modern age and made it international.\nOn just one relatively mundane level, literally thousands of learners of the language have come from all corners of the world to Gaelic through Runrig. At the same time, literally thousands of young Gaels have heard the irresistible rhythms of folk-rock in their native tongue and sung along with joy.\nWhatever your views on their music, the earliest band members\u0026#8217 personal appeal is and always has been irresistible.\nThe wry Highland modesty of Malcolm Jones, Donnie Munro and the heart and soul of the band, Calum and Rory MacDonald, is part of their great charm and an unacknowledged secret of their success. They still look like the boys from the dance hall, even though the boys are now virtuosos.\nGaelic was woven into every moment of Friday and Saturday nights, from the Glasgow Islay choir singing with Donnie Munro to Malcolm Jones being projected onto the walls of Stirling Castle riffing MacCrimmon\u0026#8217s Lament.\nMost people might not have been there for that. Runrig and the legacy of fresh Gaelic musical talent that came in their wake are now bigger than their Highland infancy.\nBut whenever you listen to a Runrig song, there will always be an echo of that dance hall accordion, of Robert MacDonald, of Blair Douglas, of the island fan base that sent them on their way.\nIn the words of the title of their first, vinyl, album, they will always Play Gaelic.\n\u0026nbsp\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/visitor-web.jpg","title":"uig to tarbert service delayed due to medical","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\nThe 2.10 pm sailing from Uig, Skye to Tarbert, Harris on Wednesday  was delayed due to a medical emergency.\nThe announcement was posted on the CalMac Service Info Twitter account around 2.45 pm, and a further post has since stated that subsequent sailings will be delayed.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/200/2018/AP-New-top-side-logo.jpg","title":"27466  ","story":" Oisín Mac Canna\n\n“The policy of this government is failing the homeless, failing those renting and those who strive to own a home.

It is time for the Minister to go. We will table a motion of no confidence in Minster Murphy in the coming weeks. It will be decision time.  It will be decision time for the government and for Fianna Fáil” she said.\nThe Dáil is due to resume back later this month.\n\ntest\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_935986.jpg--.jpg?1534836507000\n","title":"the sky s the limit for stephens catering equipment abseiling team","story":"  \n \n  \nAN adventurous group of employees from Stephens Catering Equipment are going to great heights to raise money for Northern Ireland Chest, Heart and Stroke charity.\n  \nThe 12 strong team will be abseiling from the Europa Hotel on September 23 and what makes this even more of a challenge for the team is that most of them are afraid of heights!\n  \nClaire Adair explained: “This is the first abseil for most of us and a real challenge. \n  \n“I wanted to arrange a charity event that will really make us face our fears. \n  \n“Most of us taking part have a fear of heights so it will be a huge challenge.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

grateful family of a Ballymoney schoolboy whose life was saved by his older brother\u0027s bone marrow have spoken publicly for the first time.\nA year after seven-year-old Caden Moore received a transplant at Bristol Royal Hospital for Children from his 11-year-old brother Ben their proud mother Sabrina has agreed to share their inspiring story.\nSabrina and her husband Bryan are hoping their unforgettable experiences will encourage others to give blood and sign the Stem Cell and Bone Marrow Register.\nSpeaking exclusively to The Chronicle, teacher Sabrina said: It\u0027s been the toughest year of our lives but what a difference the past 12 months have made no words can ever express how we all felt this time last year.\n\u0026#8220To have two children going through such life-changing procedures in the same hospital, on the same day, is something we could never have imagined. Caden is improving every day and Ben has never looked back.

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie. A remote service after Friday\u0027s first two stages would work for everyone.

champions","story":"\n\nPAUL\n Munster has been appointed at the Technical Director and first team coach of Indian champions Minerva Punjab FC. \n\nThe former Linfield and Cliftonville striker joins the club after guiding Örebro SK to their maiden U19 Swedish Cup success last year. \n\nMunster had been mulling over whether or not to continue his career in Sweden. In an interview with Belfast Media Group last November, Munster hinted at remaining in European football.\nHowever, those plans are now on the back burner for the Belfast native as he prepares to take charge of the Indian champions, who will embark on their first AFC Champions League campaign this season and Munster says he is excited by the challenge. \n\n“I have always been going up and achieving more and more each time, even in the coaching courses,” said Munster. \n\n“Everything has been going well and now it’s a great time for some new experience, especially in India. \n\n“Joining a club that has been playing in the highest level, are the current champions and the fact that they are going to play in the AFC Champions League, it’s just perfect. I’m moving in the right direction.” \n\nMunster was also well travelled as a player. Having started his career with Celtic Boys in West Belfast, he played for Cliftonville youths before moving to Canada. Munster later linked up with Slavia Prague and, on his return to Belfast, he signed for Linfield and helped the Blues secure the League and Irish Cup double in 2010 and 2011. \n\nMoving to the north Indian club didn’t phase Munster in the slightest and he is relishing the prospect of helping Minerva Punjab FC secure more silverware in the near future.\n\n“I was looking into Minerva Punjab a few months back, doing research on their scores and social media to see how it is and the first thing that I noticed was Mr Ranjit Bajaj, the owner is very passionate about the club,” added Munster. \n\n“He wants the team to be the best at all levels and that is what I liked a lot.” \n\n“For me, it’s a challenge, a new experience but I am coming here to win. As a player, I’m used to winning leagues, cups, individual awards. Coming here as a coach and working at the highest level in India and also playing in the AFC Champions League, it will be a great experience.”\n\nIn a statement posted on the club’s website, Minerva Punjab FC owner Mr Ranjit Bajaj, added: “We are excited to have Paul on board. He comes in with a lot of experience both as a player and as a coach and we believe that he can contribute a lot to this club. \n\n“We believe that both of us together can achieve great things at this club.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"glider goes live","story":"\n\nTHE\n New Belfast Rapid Transit Glider system has become fully operational today. \n\nThe £90million Glider system will travel the new cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and from the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nThe new controversial 12-hour bus lanes built to accommodate the service will operate from 7am and 7pm Monday to Saturday.\n\nLast week, the Department for Infrastructure announced that a 12-month scheme allowing private hire taxis to use the lane has been put on hold.\n\nIn West Belfast some parents have expressed concerns that the bus lane that passes one local school have left them with nowhere to drop off or pick up their children.\n\nDrivers have been warned not to park in the new bus lanes, but at St Kevin’s Primary School on the Falls Road, many parents felt they had no choice but to flout the rules.\n\nSt Kevin\u0026#8217s Primary School Principal Fiona Keegan said: “I don\u0026#8217t think it\u0026#8217s an ideal situation at all. It\u0026#8217s very unfortunate that our parents are now in a position where they have nowhere safe to drop their children off in the mornings and are being forced into the local streets, which is causing congestion. \n\n“Not all of my children come from the local surrounding area and therefore can walk to school. We service families from beyond West Belfast, a lot of parents do have to travel. Also, although we are a mainstream school we have a lot of children who have additional learning needs and any change of their morning routine can be detrimental to them and we have to be very aware of that and for children particularly with any sort of autism diagnosis getting out of a car to walk across a main road is very worrying for a parent.”\n\nSchool caretaker Tony Murphy said: “Many of the parents had no choice but to park in the cemetery this morning which isn\u0026#8217t ideal for anyone, also if you look at the bus lane line, our teachers have to break it to get into the staff car park. The side streets were always busy but now they are going to be ten times worse. We put signs out about parking to stop the parents pulling up and then having to reverse out, in case they hit a child. People are getting picked up in taxis in the outside lane and cars are stopping there and the kids are getting out and crossing the road.”\n\nOne local man who did not wish to be named said: “I\u0026#8217m a taxi man but this morning I decided to get my bike out and see what it would be like in the bus lane. I\u0026#8217ve cycled from the Michael Ferguson roundabout to here, it took me 23 minutes and the Glider has yet to pass me. My intention was to stop it by cycling in front of it, I see some cars parked here in the bus lane and I don\u0026#8217t blame them. People would put up with it if it was for the greater good but it\u0026#8217s not.”\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"passengers can use glider from today","story":"\nMEMBERS of the public will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

The second suspect is described as being of slim build, was unshaven and wore a grey-coloured top.\n\nAt 11:54pm, police received a report a vehicle matching the description of the Volkswagen Bora that was hijacked had collided with two parked cars on Donegall Road, in the Shaftesbury Square end. There were no reports of injuries, however, both vehicles sustained frontal damage.\n\nThis morning, Monday 3 September, just after 12am, police received a report a silver-coloured saloon-type vehicle with front end damage was being driven dangerously in the Ballygomartin Road area, Ballymagarry.

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to

Mr Duterte later apologised.\n\nIn the following days, Mr Casey tweeted: \"Totally support Philippine President Duterte clamping down on drug dealers but he should not have apologised to Obama.\"\n\nMr Casey confirmed through a spokesperson that the @CaseyPeterJ Twitter account where the post appears is his.\n\n\"Can I say, categorically, that this is not how I feel about President Duterte or Barack Obama,\" he said.\n\n\"I have no recollection of making this tweet two years ago but I have to take responsibility for it if it\u0027s up there on my account.\n\n\"I do think that drugs are a curse in our society but, genuinely, I abhor Duterte\u0027s policy of using his police as vigilantes.\"\n\nHe said he knows \"little or nothing\" about Mr Duterte and certainly would not support the policies that have been criticised by human rights groups.\n\nMr Casey added: \"I think Barack Obama is a very good and decent man.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Gavin Duffy is favourite to scoop the first local authority nomination to contest the presidential election.\n\nMeath County Council is set to vote today on whether to support a nomination.\n\nMr Duffy, who lives in the county, is strongly tipped to get its backing through a combination of votes from Independent and Fine Gael councillors.\n\nPresident Michael D Higgins can nominate himself, but challengers must win the support of four local authorities or 20 Oireachtas members.\n\nMr Duffy was among eight potential candidates who made a pitch to Meath County Council last week.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"sinn fein credible talks needed to resurrect powersharing","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

They know what the people of the north think. They voted to remain and that should be respected.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"2018 soars to joint top spot for hottest summer","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

This data confirms it.\n\n“Unfortunately, it looks like this will be the new normal, as our rapidly changing climate renders extreme weather ever more likely.\n\n“We urgently need ambitious action to cut climate-changing pollution and to build a cleaner, greener economy.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriends of the Earth’s head of policy Mike Childs added: “It’s time for the government to take the heat of the planet by ending our fossil fuel fixation, investing in energy efficiency and developing the UK’s huge renewable power potential.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"boy who lost loved ones in grenfell visits cornwall as charity reaches milestone","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

his aunt, uncle and three of his cousins in the fire, flew to the Isles of Scilly with charity Cornwall Hugs Grenfell on Monday.\n\nThe charity was set up to offer respite breaks to survivors and the bereaved and displaced, as well as firefighters who battled the blaze that killed 71 people last summer.\n\nSo far, 25% of those that survived the disaster have been a guest with the charity, and a further 200 people are on the waiting list.\n\nAdam and his father Bilal, mother Touraya and sisters Aziza, 12, and eight-year-old Salima spent the week in Marazion and were the first guests of the charity to visit the Scilly Isles.\n\nCornwall Hugs Grenfell’s founder Esme Page said: “Adam’s dream is ‘to be a pilot with a guitar’ so this was the perfect way to celebrate our milestone and look to his future – something important for these children.”\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nAdam – who dreams of becoming a pilot – takes a flight in a Sea Otter to the Scilly Isles \n\n\n\n\nPilots Jack and Sam’s best tip for Adam to realise his ambition was: “Work hard on your maths and you’ll be OK.”\n\nThe Chaer-Yemlahi family lost their uncle Abdulaziz El Wahabi, 52, aunt Faouzia, 42, and their three children, Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 16, and Mehdi, eight, who lived on the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower.\n\nMrs Chaer-Yemlahi said: “The children miss their cousins terribly – they ask me many questions and often I don’t know how to answer them.”\n\nShe added that Aziza was now terrified of living in a tower because of the risk of fire.\n\nMr Chaer-Yemlahi said: “ helped us enjoy ourselves individually and as a family, something we find hard to do due to the constant reminders of the Grenfell fire where we live.’\n\nA spokeswoman for Isles of Scilly Travel, which organised the trip, said: “Partnering with Cornwall Hugs is a humbling and rich experience, getting to know more about the charity and seeing how these families can benefit from the Scillies environment.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nAdam is the 300th person to visit Cornwall with charity Cornwall Hugs Grenfell – he and his parents and two sisters even took a trip to the Scilly Islands during their week-long stay \n\n\n\n\nShe added: “We look forward to bringing other families to Scilly and we’d like to thank the island-based businesses for partnering on this project to enrich the lives of others.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"everyones going wild for fabio quagliarellas physicsdefying wonder goal","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n |

Glenn McGrath it wasn’t, but somehow it had the desired effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe wicket came in the final over of the match, with tail-ender Ishant caught behind. It’s fair to say it will go down as one of the more meaningless wickets in Test history in terms of the match situation.\n\n“It was a genius bit of bowling,” Cook joked afterwards. “No, it was rubbish to be honest with you, but it’s one more wicket than David Saker, our bowling coach, has got so that makes me very happy.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnless current skipper Joe Root allows Cook a ceremonial bowl against India in the final Test of the series – perhaps to have another go at Ishant – it’s likely the 33-year-old will bow out with bowling figures of one wicket for seven runs off 18 balls.\n\nThat would mean he retires with a better average than England’s all-time leading wicket taker, James Anderson.

They organised Balloons with JP’s name on them and we released them in Academy Road,” said Jenny.\n\nOn Tuesday the Coyle family presented a cheque to St. Vincent De Paul , with all the money raised on the walk and memorial night.\n\nIt was a charity that was close to JP’s heart, Jenny added.\n\n“JP was very, very kind to SVDP,” said Jenny. \n\n“He loved going to the chapel when it was quiet and lighting candles and he was always putting money into the box.\n\n“He would have helped them too lifting furniture and things.\n\n“A lot of people are facing hardship at the minute with the introduction of the Universal Credit benefits, and SVDP help people in a very discreet and quiet way.”\n\nVincent added: “SVDP do amazing work especially in these times of austerity and cuts.\n\n“Every penny does count.”\n\n\nAbove - The Coyle family pictured presenting a cheque for £5,412.58 to St. Vincent de Paul\u0027s Sally Kennedy, president of Our Lady\u0027s Longtower Conference, Dominic Burke, president St. Eugene\u0027s Conference and Sean Gallagher, St. Eithne\u0027s Conference.

These initiatives assist young people to take better control of their lives, reengage in training and avoid being drawn into criminal or sectarian activity.\n\nThe remaining funding, £810,000, has also been allocated across four projects in the Peace Impact Programme , which assists marginalised communities to resolve complex issues relating to identity and the conflict. \n\nDr Adrian Johnston, Chairman of the International Fund for Ireland, said: “We still live in a deeply fractured society and political uncertainties are adding greater pressures to communities that are working hard to move forward. The risks taken by groups we support cannot be taken for granted. \n\n\"In many difficult areas, the Fund and these groups are delivering the only interventions that are preventing the escalation of tensions and polarisation. In challenging circumstances, their ambition and vision deserve to be equally met with political action and leadership.\n\n“With the limited resources available, the Fund is making important contributions that support stability and progress, particularly among communities that had not previously recognised a peace dividend. However, the Fund alone is not equipped for the scale of challenges that may emerge during an indefinite political vacuum. \n\n\"Each generation should expect a better life than the last. That can only happen if there is political will and adequate resources to help resolve the legacy issues that continue to blight communities.”\n\nThe Chairman took the opportunity to thank the international donors to the Fund - the European Union and the Governments of the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand - for their support.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nAmong the latest funding drive are these Derry projects:\n\n£202,402 to Causeway Rural \u0026amp Urban Network  for the Building Resilience and Knowledge in Education  Project.

And so, my message to Lindsey and Sean, to these warriors to be ordained today, is to be sure to keep your ministry well-oiled with obedience, integrity and love.”\n\n“It is easy to obey,” Canon Merrick said, “when that obedience seems reasonable and pleasing to our own understanding and desires – and particularly when it’s found pleasing to those around us. But will we waver when we don’t see the results anticipated, though we still believe this is God’s will?” \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nHe shared a remark made by the former US President, John Quincy Adams, whose repeated attempts to have slavery abolished in the 1830s proved fruitless: “Duty is mine, results are God’s.” \n\n“Ministry is a call to abide in Him,” Canon Merrick said, “to serve His will and step out in obedient faith, knowing that duty is ours, results are God’s.”\n\nCanon Merrick said ministry was also a call to integrity. “We must always be careful not to use people to build His church, but to serve people as He builds His church among us. And in all these things, we must be the same person behind the pulpit as we are when we are at home with the family and when we are alone in the study. That is what characterises the woman or man of integrity.”\n\nMinistry was also a call to love, Canon Merrick said. The call to love was not always easy but it always resulted in God’s peace and that was priceless. \n\n“My prayer for you this evening,” Canon Merrick told the two ordinands, “is that your work will always be characterised by obedience, integrity and love, as a well-oiled machine continually advancing the Kingdom of God until the coming of the Kingdom.”\n\nThe choir and choristers of St Columb’s Cathedral provided music for the two-hour long Service of Ordination, after which the congregation made their way to St Augustine’s Parish Hall, on the City Walls, for refreshments and speeches. \n\nReverend Hanily said he and Reverend Farrell needed people’s prayers more than ever now, while Reverend Farrell asked family, friends and parishioners to affirm them both in their ministries. Bishop Good said Derry and Raphoe was blessed to have both new priests joining the Diocese. “We’ve got two stars,” the Bishop said.\n\n\nPictured above: Rev Lindsey Farrell  and Rev Sean Hanily with Bishop Ken Good during the Service of Ordination of Priests at St Columb\u0027s Cathedral.\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"traffic alert foyle bridge derry close tonight following three nights faciliate maintenance work","story":"\nMotorists have been advised that the Foyle Bridge in Derry will be closed overnight tonight and also tomorrow, Monday, September 3, Tuesday, September 4 and Wednesday, September 5 each evening from 7pm to 7am to faciliate maintenance.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the City Centre Initiative  urged motorists to leave extra time for journeys aand follow local diversions.\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"tributes paid former headmaster foyle college derry passes away","story":"\nTributes have been paid to the former headmaster of Foyle College in Derry, Mr Hugh Gillespie, after he passed away.\n\nMr Gillespie was headmaster of Foyle College from 1973 until 1994.\n\nThe death was announced by the Foyle College Former Pupils\u0027 Association.\n\nTributes have since flooded in from former members of the school, some of whom described Mr Gillespie as a \u0027quietly inspirational man\u0027 and a \u0027true gentleman\u0027.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nA Memorial Service will be held in Hillsborough Parish Church at 2pm on Friday, September 28. \n\nThe Foyle College Former Pupils\u0027 Association said: \"Our sincere condolences go to his wife Valerie, sons Stephen and David and the wider family circle.\n\n\"A full obituary will appear in the next Former Pupils Magazine and on the school website.\"\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"plans in full swing to bring action packed dayinsure wales rally gb to north wales","story":"\nSteve Cridge oversees the Dayinsure Wales Rally GB Rally Village\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8474894/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" height=\"\"\n                                                                                                                        \nPlans in full swing to bring action-packed Dayinsure Wales Rally GB to North Wales\n\nSteve Cridge  and his team are preparing for the world championship\u0026#39s \u0026ltspan class=truncate\u0026gt\u0026ltspan class=truncate-preview\u0026gtreturn\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\u0026lt/span\u0026gt\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8474893/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPlans in full swing to bring action-packed Dayinsure Wales Rally GB to North Wales\n\nSteve Cridge surveys the Dayinsure Wales Rally GB Rally Village\n\" data-thumb=\"/resources/images/8474895/?type=mc\u0026amphtype=0\" \n\n                                                                                                                        \nPlans in full swing to bring action-packed Dayinsure Wales Rally GB to North Wales\n\nFIA WORLD RALLY CHAMPIONSHIP 2017 -WRC Wales Rally GB  -

Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
