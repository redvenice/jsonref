The creator of the cronut launched the What-a-Melon in Tokyo last year, where it quickly became a hit with all the Instagram influencers and bloggers, who held their watermelon slices aloft in front of colourful walls and snapped endless pics.Now, finally, it’s coming to London.From 11am Friday 18 May, Dominique Ansel Bakery in Mayfair, London, will be serving up What-a-Melon soft serve for £6.50 for takeaway or £7.80 to eat in.MORE: Häagen-Dazs tubs are shrinking but the price is remaining the sameMORE: ‘Never kiss someone who’s eaten a bready dinner’: 22 things you only know if you have coeliac disease"},{"url":"https://metrouk2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/sec_12581953.jpg?quality=80\u0026amp;strip=all","title":"gareth southgate names england world cup squad","story":"Gareth Southage has named his squad for this summer’s World Cup (Picture: Getty  )Gareth Southage has named his provisional England squad ahead of this summer’s World Cup and omitted both Jack Wilshere and Joe Hart.Wilshere was included in Southgate’s previous squad ahead of March’s friendlies against Netherlands and Italy, but was forced to withdraw due to a minor ankle injury.The 26-year-old missed Arsenal’s final two matches of the Premier League season and Southgate has opted not to take a risk on a player who has not represented his country since England’s ill-fated Euro 2016 campaign.Hart, meanwhile, England’s first choice goalkeeper at the last three major tournaments, misses out on selection following a turbulent season on-loan at West Ham.The 31-year-old joined the east London club from Manchester City following a year in Serie A with Torino, but lost his place in the side midway through the campaign to Adrian.A late season burst of form failed to convince Southgate Hart’s services would be required in Russia with Jordan Pickford, Nick Pope and Jack Butland set to contest the No.1 shirt.Liverpool’s Trent Alexander-Arnold represents Southgate’s most surprising selection given the teenager is yet to earn his first senior cap.The 19-year-old has enjoyed a fantastic breakthrough season under the management of Jurgen Klopp and played a key role in the Merseyside club’s run to the Champions League final.There is disappointment, however, for his club teammate Adam Lallana, whose injury-plagued campaign has cost him a place in the 23-man squad.Lallana played a key role in England’s solid qualification campaign but has only made the standby list which also includes Jake Livermore.‘I believe this is a squad which we can be excited about,’ said Southgate.‘It is a young group, but with some really important senior players so I feel the balance of the squad is good, both in terms of its experience, its character and also the positional balance.‘We have a lot of energy and athleticism in the team, but players that are equally comfortable in possession of the ball and I think people can see the style of play we’ve been looking to develop.‘The selection process has been over months really, it’s not just been the last few weeks.

We’re claiming her for a black woman’s right to be in there like everybody else,’ Camille Newman, owner of plus size clothing business Pop-Up Plus said in an interview with The Guardian.She expressed that the Royal Wedding is a marker for black or biracial women being accepted in society and referenced a 2016 report that found that black women receive startup and investment funding at a lower rate than white-owned businesses.‘It’s her race, her color, her class and it’s her age. It’s not just an African American woman thing, or an American thing, it’s a woman thing. I think all women can be proud of her,’ she said.

Only today, she’s launched a fresh attack, spewing away about her ‘right’ to trash talk Meghan.

Meghan Markle\u0027s mother...Meghan\u0027s best friend touches down in London: Fashion queen...Share this articleAnd now we’ve had the father of the bride caught with his greedy snout in the paparazzi trough, cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.As best-selling romantic novelist Lisa Kleypas said: ‘Weddings are never about the bride and groom, weddings are public platforms for dysfunctional families.’I just never thought the day would come when a family marrying INTO the royal family would be more dysfunctional than the royal family itself.But here we are.Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle.There’s absolutely no excuse for what he did in taking money from a paparazzo to stage those photos.Not least because in doing so, he made Kensington Palace look utterly ridiculous.          The father of the bride has been caught cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.  Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle, who doubled down on his idiocyPrince Harry’s own communications director sent out stern warnings to the media ordering them to back off Thomas Markle after seeing the photos and wrongly assuming he’d been the victim of a cruel invasion of privacy.In fact, Mr Markle was invading his own privacy – for a big fat cheque.Now, you might think he’d have learned his lesson, kept his head down and tried to rescue the last remnants of his dignity – if only for the sake of his poor daughter.And you would be wrong…Instead, Mr Markle’s doubled down on his idiocy.Since the Mail on Sunday exposed his cringe-making sham, he’s been sharing his thoughts on an almost hourly basis with TMZ – a fine showbiz website, but not previously noted for their expertise on the inner workings of British royalty. First, he told them he was mortified by the embarrassment of the story.Then he claimed he’d had a heart attack last week, so wouldn’t be attending the wedding.Yesterday, Mr Markle was back with more exclusives he’d changed his mind and wanted to be at the ‘historic’ wedding.Then, last night, he told TMZ he now needed urgent heart surgery, so wouldn’t be able to go after all.TMZ, perfectly understandably, has splashed these juicy revelations across its site and generated huge clicks and attention for itself in the process.          Now Mr Markle has been sharing his thoughts with TMZ. They have understandably splashed these juicy revelations across the site and generated huge clicks and attention. Kudos to TMZ. But why is Thomas Markle continuing to collude with tabloid reporters - and what the hell is Kensington Palace playing at in letting him?As a former tabloid editor, I commend their brilliant news-breaking journalism. They’ve got the whole world waiting with bated breath for details of their next conversation with Meghan’s dad.But also as a former tabloid editor, I am utterly incredulous as to why Thomas Markle is continuing to collude with tabloid reporters?And I’m even more incredulous as to what the hell Kensington Palace is playing at in letting him?The Palace staff has completely and shamefully lost control of the narrative of this wedding.From the moment it was announced, they should have taken immediate steps to ensure Meghan’s family were protected from the inevitable massive media attention heading their way.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that when a handsome British Prince marries a beautiful American actress, global press interest is going to be off the charts.Yet Thomas Markle, currently the world’s most famous father-of-the-bride, has been left to fend for himself 8000 miles away.So he’s made his own decisions as to how to handle the media, aided and abetted by his ghastly daughter Samantha, and they have turned out disastrously.Why on earth didn’t Kensington Palace either send people to Mexico to advise him, or fly Mr Markle to London? It’s not as if Harry and Meghan can’t afford to put him up for a few weeks – they’re both rich and live in a giant palace full of spare rooms and servants.(Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that? And now won’t be able to at all before he makes the poor man’s daughter his wife.)          Why didn’t Kensington Palace send people to Mexico to advise him or fly Mr Markle to London? Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that?The result of this farcical incompetence is that Meghan’s had to spend the most stressful week of her life with a hundred times more stress than she could have ever imagined.I imagine she’s been utterly distraught at her father’s conduct.There have been reports of her tearfully begging him on the phone to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.What a terrible situation for any bride to find herself in.I also imagine that Harry’s been utterly furious.For someone who hates the paparazzi and tabloids to see his soon-to-be father-in-law in cahoots with the paparazzi and tabloids will have enraged the headstrong young Prince beyond belief.On the other hand he might reflect that if he and his big brother hadn’t been so controlling and privacy obsessed, constantly warning the press not to ‘intrude’ on Meghan’s family then Mr Markle’s collusion with said press would never have been so embarrassing. This will be his, and the Palace’s worst nightmare: a major player in the biggest day of his life going rogue.Perhaps things will sort themselves out by Saturday but I doubt it.From the sound of things, the only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum.          The only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum. She\u0027s seen here leaving for the airport, alone That fact alone would fill me with deep concern if I were the royals. Who ARE these Markles?What further mayhem are they going to wreak, especially now they’ve all been snubbed from the wedding?Hell, as we’ve already seen, hath no fury like an estranged relative scorned.I don’t think Harry and Meghan can escape some blame here.By excluding from their 600-strong guest-list all of Meghan’s family – many of whom have only said nice things about her and the wedding - and some of her oldest friends, they’re surely creating an even bigger problem down the road?Sometimes, a wedding is a good chance to settle old grievances, rather than cement them.They’re now going to have a lot more disgruntled Markles bristling with anger at being snubbed, especially when they see celebrities like the Beckhams sitting in ‘their’ seats in the church.So the Markle reality show will roll un-edifyingly on, and the Palace appears worryingly impotent and incompetent in its efforts to control the tidal wave of tacky titillation cascading from their lips.As for how all this washes up, my heart hopes Harry and Meghan will brush off the wedding chaos and live the fairy-tale happily ever after. My head, though, views with mounting concern the wildly erratic behaviour of the Markles, and I find myself murmuring: ‘There may be trouble ahead….’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/04/22/4BDC9C4500000578-5692285-Victoria_Pendleton_right_almost_died_from_altitude_sickness_as_s-a-1_1525470177470.jpg","title":"TV star Ben Fogle conquers Mount Everest","story":"    Ben Fogle has conquered Mount Everest, days after revealing he had taken on the ascent in memory of his stillborn son Willem. News of the successful climb was revealed on the Instagram page of former cyclist Victoria Pendleton, who was forced to abandon her own ascent earlier this month on medical grounds.

The 68-year-old former engineer spent a whopping $220,000 to purchase and transport a decommissioned Boeing 727 from Greece to the woods near Portland, Oregon          The bird that he bought though happened to be used to transport magnate\u0027s Aristotle Onassis’s body to Greece and was accompanied by former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis and other relatives. Pictured above is his airplane home resting on lumber and other building materials used to support it           Campbell explained to DailyMail.com why he settled on living inside of a plane rather than purchasing a traditional house. The Boeing 727 aircraft can be seen above situated among the heavily wooded area in Hillsboro which is near Portland‘I’m an engineer and I deferred purchasing a home until quite late in life primarily because I was very comfortable in my very humble situation and I was building equity,’ he said. ‘I never wanted to have a mortgage because it felt financially confining. By the time I was ready to purchase a home with cash, I had stopped thinking in provincial terms and I had thought like a free bird engineer.‘Basically I just looked at it as a materials technology and fabrications technology shopping challenge. I wanted the best technology that I could buy and I could see nothing better than aerospace technology.’So he bought his 10 acre plot of land in Hillsboro, about 20 miles outside Portland, partnered with a salvage company and had the plane brought in - a move he now regrets because it took so long and was expensive to have the it rebuilt on his property.          Campbell sleeps on half of his futon bed and pulls it to lay flat if he has company staying over.  He is pictured above watching the stock markets on his computer from his futon bed while covered in a blanket inside the plane          Campbell, who has never been married and has no children, absolutely loves living inside of plane and will never live in a traditional house. He is pictured above preparing to brush his teeth at the sink he installed inside of the jumbo jet          The plane did not come with a shower so the bachelor built one out of PVC material that he rolled into a cylinder shape as seen above. He said he did not finish building the shower, and has no plans to because he is comfortable with how it operates           The former engineer connected flexible water and sewage pipes to the plane in the same manner as is done routinely at airport aircraft gates. On his website he said, \u0027It\u0027s child\u0027s play class easy, superbly elegant, and earthquake immune.\u0027 He is pictured above brushing his teeth inside his plane Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultJoyful man dances his way down the street in heart-warming footageTennis star Karolina Pliskova strikes umpire\u0027s chair with racketSerena Williams walks herself down the isle during weddingDisgusting moment woman throws her poop at Tim Horton\u0027s workerLord Framlingham accuses lords of attempting to \u0027wreck\u0027 Brexit billTwo girls in hospital after brutal fight at Atlanta high schoolCalifornia parents face multiple neglect and torture chargesWhitney Houston doc throws shade at Paula Abdul in first trailerShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott on Windrush deportationsFor Campbell, living in a decommissioned airplane was an obvious choice but there’s little doubt that he has little regard for what others may consider to be essential creature comforts: he sleeps on half a futon – it’s only rolled out to its full width when he’s entertaining company – stockpiles two months’ worth of canned foods and goods at a time, bathes in a shower he created by rolling a sheet of PVC into a 4ft high cylinder.He’s happy to allow curious passers-by and tourists to stop by and see how he lives.‘It happens frequently, it happens almost every day now and I encourage it, it\u0027s not discouraged at all. About three quarters of my visitors schedule first, which I ask them to do on my website, and about one quarter just show up, impromptu at almost any time,’ Campbell stated.‘And so I live in a pretty transparent environment. I go about living while people are touring my aircraft and sometimes it\u0027s very intimate and at all times it\u0027s very rewarding, especially for me because I meet lots of interesting people and I learn a lot.’He’s even had people tour the plane, which is the only plane Boeing built with three engines, while he showers inside his make-shift bathing area he built out of PVC material.‘Sometimes the situation is rather intimate because I have to go about my life and people are basically streaming through my aircraft at almost any time and there have been instances people have toured while I\u0027m showering.‘That\u0027s fine, it doesn\u0027t bother me at all but it is interesting.’He loves his lifestyle and although he does say: ‘I will not marry and will not generate kids. I’m 68 so it’s too late anyway but I simply never desired to be married or have kids. I enjoy in romance and love and I indulge in it as much as civilization will allow…. but I’m not really inclined to think that all the joys of romance and human contact can be optimized or maximized. Maybe to me it’s a little like mortgage, ultimately it’s too confining.’He’s perfectly content living a modest life – but that hasn’t stopped his ambition. He currently splits his time between Oregon and Japan where he plans to buy a plot of land and a second plane to put on it so he can live the lifestyle to which he’s been accustomed in his home away from home. The jet aircraft model that Campbell owns was produced by Boeing from the 1960s up until 1984 and could seat between 149 to 180 people.           Sleeping on a futon and stocking up on food and supplies every two months, Campbell has long been used to living a modest bachelor life on the aircraft. It’s something that he does not plan on giving up – not even to pursue love. Pictured above is a desk area with numerous tools and storage items            Campbell explained that he deferred purchasing a home until quite late in life because he was building equity while working as an engineer. He is pictured above walking inside the rear section of the plane that he says provides 1,066 square feet of \u0027exhilarating aerospace quality living area\u0027          He said: \u0027I never wanted to have a mortgage because it felt financially confining. By the time I was ready to purchase a home with cash, I had stopped thinking in provincial terms and I had thought like a free bird engineer.\u0027 Campbell is pictured above sitting inside of the plane\u0027s cockpit area          In 2003, Campbell took the cash he saved and purchased the decommissioned aircraft along with the 10 acres of land where it currently rests in Hillsboro (above)          The 68-year-old partnered with a salvage company to have the plane brought to the area, but that’s a move that he now regrets due to the amount of time and expensive bills he paid to have the plane put back together on his property. Pictured above is a closer view of the landing gear and materials used to support the aircraft          But what was an easy decision that Campbell doesn’t regret is living in Oregon. He came to live in the state after accepting a job there when he graduated college in the 1970s. Campbell is pictured above inside a portion of the tail on the aircraft          He said: ‘I like the area and it\u0027s very green and Oregon is a little independent minded which appealed to me. even though it was the only job offer I got, it was the one I wanted the most so I was very lucky.’ Pictured above is a side view of the plane from the wing showing it\u0027s number, N7275H          Campbell added: ‘It’s a country setting, it’s very nice. It’s more than enough for the aircraft.’ The Boeing 727-200 is pictured above from an aerial view in the woods of Hillsboro, Oregon          Campbell splits his time between living on the plane and residing in Japan where he hopes to purchase land and another plane to live there. Campbell is pictured above standing outside in the grass area near his airplane home          Campbell bought the 10 acres of land that the Boeing 727-400 is on for around $23,000 when he was in his 20s. Pictured above is the aircraft seen from the trees in Hillsboro           He is more than well adjusted to his unique lifestyle and even allows visitors to tour the jumbo jet – no matter what he is doing. Campbell is pictured above underneath the floor of the Boeing 727-400 plane           He noted that he \u0027goes about living\u0027 while people tour around inside the plane.  \u0027...sometimes it\u0027s very intimate. and at all times it\u0027s very rewarding, especially for me because I meet lots of interesting people and I learn a lot.’ Campbell is pictured above standing on the wing of the plane after exiting from one of the emergency exit doors          He also shared that some of his visitors have even caught him in the shower while on tour and he doesn\u0027t mind. He is pictured above leaning on a tree outside of his home          Campbell feels that retired airplanes \u0027are profoundly well designed high technology aerospace quality sealed pressure canisters which can withstand 575 mph winds and seven G acceleration forces with ease, can last for centuries, are extremely fire resistant, and provide superior security,\u0027 according to his website. Pictured above is a closer view of the controls inside the cockpit of his plane          \u0027They\u0027re among the finest structures mankind has ever built,\u0027 Campbell said on his website. Pictured above is the underneath portion of the Boeing 727\u0027s tail          Campbell also believes that it\u0027s \u0027irrational to destroy\u0027 retired airplanes which he thinks are \u0027the finest home sized structures available on this planet\u0027. He is pictured above sitting inside an engine compartment of his airplane home in Hillsboro          He believes that traditional homes are built out of \u0027materials which are fundamentally little more than assemblies of sticks rendered with ancient and inferior design and fabrication methods.\u0027 Pictured above are the stairs to board the plane          Campbell thinks living in an airplane also is a \u0027great toy\u0027 that includes \u0027trick doors, trick floors\u0027. He can be seen above through an empty engine compartment atop the plane          The 68-year-old retired engineer also finds that living on the plane is \u0027a constant exploratory adventure, ever  entertaining, providing fundamental sustenance for an old technology nerd like me. Owning lots of little toys is great fun. Owning lots of little toys enclosed in a very big toy is nirvana.\u0027 His plane is pictured above from the forest in Hillsboro          Campbell said that he only has a relationship with one set of his neighbors who support the fact that he lives inside of a retired jumbo jet. He is pictured above in an aerial photo spread out on top of his airplane home          Campbell added: \u0027(They) are very good friends and they like the project and support the project significantly.\u0027 He is pictured above peering into the main cabin from the underneath floor of the jumbo jet          Campbell doesn\u0027t plan on giving up his bachelor lifestyle to pursue love anytime soon. \u0027I will not marry and will not generate kids. I’m 68 so it’s too late anyway but I simply never desired to be married or have kids,\u0027 he said. He is pictured above reading from his phone atop of the Boeing 727-400          He added:\u0027 I enjoy in romance and love and I indulge in it as much as civilization will allow. But I’m not really inclined to think that all the joys of romance and human contact can be optimized or maximized. Maybe to me it’s a little like mortgage, ultimately it’s too confining.’ The 68-year-old is pictured above descending the stairs on his plane          When his plane did fly the friendly skies, it could seat between 149 to 189 passengers. Pictured above is the inside of Campbell\u0027s aircraft showing several seat rows dismantled           The Boeing 727-400 model that Campbell owns is the only plane the company built with three engines. Campbell\u0027s slippers are pictured above as he stands inside his plane          The jet aircraft model that Campbell owns was produced by Boeing from the 1960s up until 1984.

A 43-year-old man, who cannot be named for legal reasons, said he worked everyday for five months. He paid £76 housing benefit plus £20 a week from other benefits in rent for a room in poor quality accommodation which was made available after he was released from prisonThe man said each night he was given ‘leftovers’ to eat, and a bottle of hard liquor such as whisky was handed over for a £5 charge.The man said he suffered a broken jaw in an ‘altercation’ outside the shared flat but couldn’t remember who assaulted him. He also suffered a broken rib in a separate incident.Drugs were also seen at the flat and the man said ‘Barry’ twice gave him free Diazepam tablets at the takeaway.He said the residents who worked in the takeaways feared getting on the wrong side of the landlord.          A second alleged victim, who was also homeless, was given a room in Bariana’s flat for £90 a week rent. He worked in a takeaway for three or four weeks for five days a week and about 10 hours a day without payWhen someone was ‘injured’ in an incident and police investigated the man said he told officers he had fallen down stairs.‘There was a chance it would happen to us if we didn’t,’ he said.Asked why he worked for nothing, the man replied: ‘I had to or I wouldn’t be living there.’The court heard another man who lived in the same flat and worked for Bariana was also mistreated.The man was put in a bath and his belt and shoes taken off him, forcing him to walk a mile to the chip shop with bare feet.A second alleged victim, who was also homeless, was given a room in Bariana’s flat for £90 a week rent.He worked in a takeaway for three or four weeks for five days a week and about 10 hours a day without pay.Instead of cash, the man said he was given two litres of cider, costing about £3, each day.Asked about the situation he found himself in, the man added: ‘It was a hard one as I didn’t know what to do.’Mr Knox also told the jury how one alleged victim had movements restricted by Bariana who would come to his home at night, ‘remove his clothes, in particular his trainers, so he couldn’t do off,’ before working the next day.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/15/4C51B03500000578-0-image-m-25_1526481222121.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Harrys bride family messed Windsors","story":"Thomas, Sandra, Tracy and Tyler - who wouldn\u0027t look out of place in the next series of Hicksville Big Brother - are already polishing their anecdotes about their blameless relative Meghan for anyone with a cheque book and the right amount of cash.

Meghan\u0027s father (pictured with her) may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?The cast of characters in the Markle chamber of horrors includes a cannabis farmer, a Domino\u0027s Manager, a recovering alcoholic and the spiteful half-sister she no longer appears to speak to.Not forgetting the \u0027intensely private\u0027 bankrupt dad who changes his story from day to day.The former lighting director may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?For once, the characters and their stories outperform anything soaps could dream up - this is beyond satire.Meghan has my sympathy, because every one of us has ghastly relatives, family members we\u0027ve airbrushed out of our lives, people we would never choose as friends, let alone family members.She has the misfortune to be lumbered with a whole coachload.          With ghastly relatives like hers, Meghan will find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dullWeddings always ide as many people in a family as they unite - it\u0027s a chance to settle scores (with restricted guest lists) and create a two-tiered system where some lucky people get gold passes to every part of the day, some are granted silver membership to a few drinks and a sausage roll if they\u0027re lucky, or the common plebs who have to make do with a fleeting glimpse from the roadside in dubious weather with no refreshments.The father of any bride is in a difficult position - he will be proud his gorgeous daughter is marrying someone she adores, but fearful he might mess up his pivotal role in the proceedings.At my first wedding, Dad insisted on driving me to Chelsea Register Office. We\u0027d not been speaking for nine months because I\u0027d cancelled my previous engagement.When my parents found out my new husband-to-be was posh - and I would have a double-barreled name, things improved slightly.Like Meghan\u0027s father, my dad blew hot and cold, but in the end he drove me to the ceremony.I was wearing a beautiful dress, but as I stepped out of the car, he was so nervous he slammed the door on my leg and we had a furious row in the street.At lunch in a fashionable restaurant afterwards, my mother tried to steal the flowers.The manager had to present her with them and I have a picture of her in the car park hoisting her trophies aloft. I died with embarrassment.Meghan has wisely not invited the motley crew of Markles, and why should she?I didn\u0027t invite any of my cousins and only one aunt and uncle.Meghan\u0027s lot could hardly be equipped for small talk with Princess Anne or Prince Edward - I can\u0027t imagine they know anything about equine blood lines or musical theatre, although her nephew TJ Dooley junior (married to husband Ronnie) has been photographed in drag, clutching his fake breasts.His brother Tyler (a cannabis farmer) is producing a new strain to celebrate the occasion- Markle Sparkle, retailing at over $200 an ounce.Their dad - Meghan\u0027s half brother - a glass fitter also called Thomas, has not flown to the UK, but posted offensive remarks about Meghan when he discovered he was not on the Windsor guest list.Meghan\u0027s half sister Samantha Grant has been blabbing to anyone who contacts her (for cash of course), claiming that it was her idea to set up their confused and well meaning father with a paparazzi photographer, although she couldn\u0027t be sure exactly how much he got paid.Samantha and Meghan allegedly haven\u0027t spoken for over ten years, so her insights on the new member of the Royal family will be a little sketchy.Samantha is publishing a book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister.When I appeared on I\u0027m a Celebrity, my sister flogged pictures from our family album to a gossip magazine.Someone else sold my Brownie pictures.My sister revealed I had tried to kill her when we were 8 and 10.My fourth ex-husband sold his story twice to different tabloids, claiming I was \u0027a beast in bed\u0027.That\u0027s why I have sympathy for Meghan. With ghastly relatives like these, she\u0027ll find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dull. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/02/4BDA124700000578-0-image-a-13_1525741714453.jpg","title":"PM Hilarity ask puffin whistle QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament","story":"    Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May as she speaks during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions (PMQs)Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, left the Chamber well before the end of PMQs.

Mr Corbyn had produced an effective if predictable barb at the start of his questions. He noted that the Prime Minister always spoke of her desire, with Brexit, for ‘as little friction as possible’. Did she mean as little friction as possible with her Cabinet colleagues or with the European Union? Laughter. But not from Mrs May. Hilarity does not come easily to her. Correction. It does not come to her at all.QUENTIN LETTS: I fear Mrs May has no idea how angry...QUENTIN LETTS: Gregarious ambler \u0027Bonking Bob\u0027 may be a Tory...Share this articleYou might sooner ask a puffin to whistle, or a saddhu to wear his Old Etonian tie, or Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley to complete the Mail’s quick crossword. Mrs May, in the face of a joke, stands unmoved, unblinking, uncomprehending, the Venerable Bede at the mouth of an Ibiza nightclub.We used to know an ancient Jack Russell that came round to our house in search of biscuits and would be shouted at most severely – great growling and threatened biting – by our two, daft Patterdales. The Jack Russell would stand there, motionless, looking magnificently bored, until our lunatics tired of their aggression and trotted off in search of alternative entertainment. Mrs May takes the same approach. At one point she said she wanted a ‘customs union’ with the EU but we were later told this had been a heat-of-the-moment mistake. She had meant ‘customs arrangement’.          (L-R) Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle. Sir Lindsay Hoyle was so popular as Speaker in Parliament there were shouts for him to replace John Bercow when he returned to take session on WednesdayThe only other moment of mild interest was when she said leaving the EU was ‘a matter of the integrity of politicians – we should deliver on that choice’ made by the voters at the EU referendum. Mr Corbyn makes no such assertion.But the day’s abiding characteristic was MPs’ widespread wordiness, the loquacity, the logorrhoea, the prating perissology (good grief, they’ve got me doing it now).Stephen Kinnock (Lab, Aberavon), who is one of the more intelligent of them and has a lovely voice, ruined a promising question about the EU by simply going on too long. Dullards like Maggie Throup (Con, Erewash) and Virendra Sharma (Lab, Ealing Southall) and many others asked questions that stretched like bubble gum. The more they spoke, the less anyone listened.Same with Labour’s Chief Whip, Nick Brown, who had a point of order complaining that Mr Grayling had not given his Labour shadow the customary advance warning of his rail statement. Mr Brown could have made his point in half the time, and thus made it more pointed.Amazing how inept so many of them are. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/22/4C54468B00000578-0-Theresa_May-a-8_1526505889568.jpg","title":"May Macron Merkel arrive EU summit attempt save Iran nuclear","story":"    Angela Merkel arriving at the Sofia summit European leaders have arrived at a summit in Sofia in a bid to save the Iran nuclear deal in the wake of Donald Trump\u0027s decision to re-impose sanctions on the Islamic Republic.The 28 worried EU leaders are gathering in the Bulgarian capital for discussions over dinner on how to salvage the nuclear deal and European business dealings with Iran from Trump\u0027s sanctions.They will also discuss measures for avoiding a trade war in an escalating steel tariff dispute with the United States.Theresa May, Emmanuel Macron and Angela Merkel have all expressed their desire to see the deal continue but are faced with the prospect of US sanctions affecting the European countries ability to do business with Iran.The trio will \u0027present their assessment of the situation\u0027 to their colleagues over dinner, it was reported.Sanctions are already beginning to bite with French energy giant Total preparing to pull out of a billion dollar gas project in Iran.Total was the first major Western energy company to invest in Iran after sanctions with Iran were lifted but it has been joined by German insurer Allianz and Danish tanker operator Maersk in winding down their business in Iran.

The pair met in the city not long after Meghan arrived to film SuitsShe is also credited by many as the brains behind Meghan’s transformation from television actress to polished princess in waiting. It is largely thanks to their flourishing friendship that American-born Meghan, who relocated to Canada while filming the television series Suits, found herself moving through the kind of high-powered social circles that ultimately led her to Harry’s side.Meghan and Jessica are now so close that it is sometimes hard to tell them apart. Dark-haired elegant — and extremely well-married — Jessica could indeed pass as Meghan Mark II.Not for nothing is Mulroney known as the ‘Gwyneth Paltrow of Toronto’. Born into Canada’s wealthy Browns shoes dynasty, a family empire worth a reported £50 million, the privately educated heiress is married to Ben Mulroney, son of the former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney — and firm friends with the wife of the current one.      She apparently enjoys the kind of glamorous lifestyle that could have come straight out of the pages of a glossy magazine, and is regarded as the closest thing to royalty in that country.Every facet of her enviable life is shared on the social media sharing site Instagram — from her three beautiful children, to her impressive exercise routine and elegant social life. And, of course, her friendship with Meghan.Certainly, it is hard to see how Harry’s fiancee would have made it into the Canadian A-list without this female powerhouse.They met in 2011, not long after Meghan arrived in Toronto where Suits was filmed.The Mail understands that Meghan initially employed Mulroney as a fashion stylist after she shot to fame as ambitious paralegal Rachel Zane. The pair bonded over their love of yoga, dogs, expensive red wine, healthy eating, work-outs and charity work. What began as a professional relationship swiftly turned to a deep and lasting friendship.And before long, Meghan had adopted Mulroney’s sophisticated socialite style.It was under her guidance that, after meeting Prince Harry, Meghan swiftly ditched the racier ensembles she once delighted in wearing and embraced a sophisticated, pared-down chic.Out went the leather skirts and plunging necklines. In came elegant, to-the-knee shift dresses and crisp white shirts.Before too long, it was noted, the two women were wearing their long dark tresses in the same style and were often photographed sporting very similar outfits.When Meghan moved to the UK in the run-up to her engagement to Harry, it was Mulroney who helped her put together a wardrobe of clothes fit for royalty.          Mulroney is an Instagram addict, which she uses to chronicle every facet of her enviable lifeShe was also behind the white wrap coat, green shift dress and nude heels that Meghan wore when she and Prince Harry announced their engagement in the gardens of Kensington Palace last autumn.It goes without saying, too, that the dress Meghan wears on Saturday has had the Mulroney seal of approval at every stage of its creation.She is thought to have flown to the UK from Canada at least three times in recent months to oversee key fittings. But, while Jessica is believed to have advised Meghan on everything from the dress to the flowers to the wedding lunch, her family’s invitation to Saturday’s Royal Wedding is about so much more than professional gratitude.The fact that her children, seven-year-old twins Brian and John and five-year-old daughter Ivy, will be among the ten page boys and flower girls who will follow Meghan as she walks up the aisle at St George’s Chapel in Windsor at the weekend is testament to just how close the women have become.At a time when members of her own family, especially her embarrassingly loquacious half-sister Samantha Markle, have let Meghan down over and again, it is Mulroney who has stuck faithfully by her side.Donald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Feuding palace courtiers are whispering about the Markle...Share this articleMeghan — ‘Aunty Meg’ to her friend’s three children — has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’. It was here that the earliest whispers about her burgeoning romance with Harry were shared.Here too, that the Prince and Meghan were able to spend time together away from the glare of publicity that would have undoubtedly blazed down upon them in the UK.But the two women could not have come from more different backgrounds. Meghan’s humble roots lie in Los Angeles where her father Thomas, a former lighting director, was declared bankrupt in 2016.Her mother Doria, who used to work for an airline, is now a yoga teacher and social worker. Her mother’s great-great-grandfather was a freed slave named Wisdom.Jessica, meanwhile, was privately educated at an exclusive girls’ school before going to McGill University where she studied industrial relations and economics.          Meghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney on holiday in Italy in 2016. Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getawayIn 2007, she married television presenter Benedict Mulroney, whose father Brian was Canada’s Prime Minister from 1984 to 1993.Much of Jessica and Meghan’s friendship has been played out on social media.The early days of their friendship were recorded with plentiful snaps of a holiday in Italy they shared in the summer of 2016.It was clear to anyone who saw the Instagram photographs of the women sunbathing in their bikinis on the deck of a boat, or sipping Negroni cocktails by the pool, that they were inseparable.Meghan captioned the images she posted ‘La dolce vita’ and the trip even had its own special hashtag on Instagram, ‘MJxItaly’, so fans could follow every moment of their glamorous getaway.But, crucially, it was also largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, among them 42-year-old Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, a flamboyant former TV presenter, who is now better known as the wife of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.Other friends of Mulroney’s who helped pave the road to Harry’s door include Markus Anderson, the suave party-loving business brains behind the opening of the Toronto branch of the ultra-fashionable private members club Soho House — of which Harry is also a member.If ever a sign was needed that Meghan had ‘made it’ in Canadian high society, it was surely the sight of her at the club’s pretty rooftop bar with Sophie Trudeau and Mulroney on a girls’ night out together in 2016.She and Harry are said to have been set up on a blind date by a mutual friend — whose identity they won’t reveal.Before news of the royal romance broke, Jessica and husband Ben, 41, had Meghan and Harry over for several cosy, discreet dinners where they could spend precious time together away from prying eyes. At the closing ceremony of Prince Harry’s Invictus Games last October, where he was seen kissing Meghan in public for the first time, Jessica was one of just two friends selected to join the actress in her private box.          It is largely thanks to this friendship that Meghan began to rub shoulders with Canadian society’s big movers and shakers, putting her on the road to meeting Prince Harry Once Meghan had been catapulted into the social stratosphere, Mulroney happily slipped into the role of Girl Friday, quietly advising and supporting her — but always remaining tight-lipped.The two women enjoyed a foretaste of royal bridal dress planning when Meghan turned to Mulroney for help choosing a wedding gown for her Suits character Rachel Zane — who was stood up at the altar by her on-screen fiance, Mike Ross.On that occasion, Meghan chose an Anne Barge Versailles dress from the Canadian bridal boutique which Mulroney represents as a PR.Mulroney posted a photograph of her friend wearing the dress with the the social media hashtag ‘princess goals’.Meghan, meanwhile, apparently returned the favour by name-dropping her friend during an interview about her on-screen wedding.‘I went through all the options with my dear friend Jessica Mulroney of Kleinfeld Hudson’s Bay in Canada,’ Meghan said.‘I put this one on and it just screamed “Rachel”. It is classic and fairytale and the culmination of everything she’s been waiting for.’As a bridal expert, of course, Mulroney’s closeness to Meghan and the royals will do her no professional harm.Jessica has, since 2013, done PR for the aforementioned Kleinfeld Bridal, an upmarket Toronto boutique, which as well as selling dreamy designer dresses worth thousands of pounds, also offers £200 lacy lingerie and £300 crystal-embellished headbands.In February this year, she set up an Instagram account devoted to ‘all things bridal and style’, on which she showcases her ideas for wedding day fashion, food and exotic honeymoons. She also posts photographs of grateful brides she’s rehearsed and styled for their big day.          Jessica Mulroney and her children. Meghan is ‘Aunty Meg’ to the children and has described the Mulroney’s house in Toronto as her ‘home away from home’She’s also guest editor of Wedding Vacations magazine and makes regular appearances as a bridal expert on Canadian daytime TV.Given the attention Meghan’s clothing choices already get, a friend like Mulroney is valuable indeed. She rode to Meghan’s rescue when she was agonising over what to wear to Pippa Middleton’s wedding a year ago.Palace insiders say she wore a simple black dress for the evening do, which Jessica — demonstrating a keen awareness of royal protocol — recommended only after finding out the details of Kate’s outfit, thereby avoiding a clash with her future sister-in-law.‘Jessica is smart enough to know that, as well as making sure Meghan looks her best, they also need to be mindful about what Kate is wearing,’ a source said at the time.Yesterday afternoon, Jessica was spotted hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter Ivy, doing some last-minute shopping in Marks \u0026amp Spencer close to Kensington Palace where the family are thought to be staying.So how will you spot her among the congregation on Saturday? Easy. Look out for a woman with Meghan’s shiny dark hair, dewy skin and impeccable dress sense. That’ll be her."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/00/4C4FEA2900000578-5738297-The_volcano_now_has_20_open_fissures_and_is_firing_out_lava_bomb-a-8_1526512121324.jpg","title":"Golfers appear nonplussed play round nearby erupting Kilauea volcano","story":"    A group of golfers were seen playing a round nearby Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting for 11 days, as an ash cloud forms behind them          The volcano now has 20 open fissures, and is firing out lava bombs the size of microwave ovensLord Framlingham accuses lords of attempting to \u0027wreck\u0027 Brexit billMeghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultTwo girls in hospital after brutal fight at Atlanta high schoolJoyful man dances his way down the street in heart-warming footageTennis star Karolina Pliskova strikes umpire\u0027s chair with racketSerena Williams walks herself down the isle during weddingDisgusting moment woman throws her poop at Tim Horton\u0027s workerCalifornia parents face multiple neglect and torture chargesWhitney Houston doc throws shade at Paula Abdul in first trailerShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott on Windrush deportations    Pictured: Ballistic blocks shot hundreds of yards from the Kilauea volcano and found on Wednesday morning\u0027These reflect the most energetic explosions yet observed and could reflect the onset of steam-driven explosive activity... additional such explosions are expected and could be more powerful.\u0027 On Tuesday, the USGS said a recent lowering of the lava lake at the crater had \u0027raised the potential for explosive eruptions\u0027.Beware of the lava bombs!

Nobody spoke up in the elevator, but four hours later a woman I didn\u0027t know, a professor of women\u0027s and gender studies at a small college in New England, lodged a formal complaint.Professor Simona Sharoni told the ISA\u0027s executive director that, \u0027as a survivor of sexual harassment in the academy\u0027, she was \u0027quite shaken by this incident\u0027.Women’s rights campaigner, 25, is enraged by ‘misogynist’...Mark Lawrenson is branded a \u0027dinosaur sexist\u0027 by furious...Share this articleWhen I was informed, I was incredulous. And when I read the language of the complaint, my concern deepened.The voice that asked \u0027people at the back\u0027 for floor requests was a man\u0027s. But Sharoni had claimed she made the announcement, and my response had been aimed directly at her.The complaint stated that I\u0027d said \u0027Women\u0027s lingerie\u0027, and I did it with a smirk on my face. If she can\u0027t remember the wording of my joke — I said \u0027Ladies\u0027 lingerie\u0027 not \u0027Women\u0027s\u0027 — she can\u0027t have been very offended. And as I was at the back of this packed lift and she says she was at the front, how could she have seen my face?\u0027All his buddies laughed,\u0027 she added. \u0027I am still trying to come to terms with the fact that we froze and didn\u0027t confront him.\u0027          Professor Lebow joked that he wanted to be let out of the lift at the ladies\u0027 lingerie department - a joke that would be considered tame on Are You Being Served? (pictured, a still from the show)None of my \u0027buddies\u0027 were there. But she\u0027s right about one thing: nobody complained at the time.I was concerned to think she might feel upset, however. How my comment could be thought to have sexist or sexual overtones, I could not see — but if this woman was genuinely dismayed, I wanted to reassure her.I wrote a polite and conciliatory email, assuring her \u0027I certainly had no desire to insult women or to make you feel uncomfortable\u0027.I said I worried that frivolous complaints about trivial or non-existent offences could undermine efforts to challenge real sexual abuse. \u0027Like you,\u0027 I said, \u0027I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.\u0027Sharoni complained about my email, too. Here\u0027s where the whole business goes beyond farce: the ISA\u0027s disciplinary committee declared that my joke in the lift was \u0027offensive and inappropriate\u0027, and called my reaching out to her \u0027an even more serious violation\u0027. I was told to make an \u0027unequivocal apology\u0027.I will not, because what is really being demanded is not an apology, but a confession of guilt and recognition that anyone who feels offended by anything has the right to demand redress.In fact, the ISA has a protocol for this sort of thing and I was following it by emailing Sharoni. Its code of conduct emphasises informal resolution of disputes, without immediately involving the ethics committee. But Sharoni went straight to the ISA\u0027s executive director, Mark Boyer.I am in a privileged position. I can stand up against this pressure, because of my personal and professional reputation. I\u0027m immune to whatever punishment the association levels against me the more they try to browbeat me, the more they will make people question their judgment.The ISA has two sanctions: they can prevent me from attending annual meetings and they can expel me. I am not anxious to see either of these outcomes, but I certainly will not give in to threats. That would be bowing to censorship and accepting the rule of fear.The disturbing truth is that we now live in a world where censorship is making steady inroads in many areas. In university life, students demand to be shielded in \u0027safe spaces\u0027 from comments that might offend them. Jokes like the one I made in the lift are no longer allowed in case they upset someone. Speakers who want to argue their often controversial points of view are denied platforms for fear that someone might find their opinions distasteful.          Professor Tim Hunt (above), a Nobel prize-winning biochemist, was forced to resign as a professor at University College London over one ill-advised jokeA well-publicised case in point is Nigel Biggar, professor of theology at Christ Church, Oxford, who argued society should take a more balanced view of the British Empire rather than remembering it only with shame. For expressing his view, he has been trolled and hectored on the internet.Meanwhile, lecturers on the Left who have shown support for a boycott of Israel are similarly ostracised.I don\u0027t support either position but I still defend their right to express it — even if it causes offence.There is nothing wrong with taking offence. It is how you react to being offended that is crucial.Too many in society today — and often those in positions of influence — demand censorship. And this is an infringement on free speech.I know many in my profession are more vulnerable to threats and bullying than I am — at 76 I am near the end of my career. But students and young dons will feel an even greater need to censor their thoughts in a world where people who take offence can muzzle others.And it is not only young people at risk. You might remember the case of Professor Tim Hunt, a Nobel prize-winning biochemist who made an ill-judged joke to a conference in 2015 about his problems when working with \u0027girls\u0027 in the lab — either he fell in love with them, they fell in love with him, or he made them cry.I certainly wouldn\u0027t endorse this clunky attempt at humour, but the way the academic world turned on him was frightening.He was forced to resign as a professor at University College London — a Nobel winner\u0027s reputation in tatters over one ill-advised joke.I\u0027ve spent my life speaking out for people who are bullied and oppressed. In the Sixties when I was at university, I worked in Illinois to end segregation.I was a \u0027freedom rider\u0027 — one of the volunteers, black and white, who took bus rides in the Deep South to protest against racial segregation still imposed there by law. I helped to register African-Americans to vote, and worked to change laws so children of all races could be educated together.During a teaching career ning more than 50 years, I have mentored many women and co-authored papers with female colleagues. For decades, I have been fighting to break down sexist barriers.Now, though, I am involved in a new fight — one we must win. For if we allow such people as Professor Sharoni to dictate what can and cannot be said, and to intimidate us with their cries of \u0027sexist!\u0027 and \u0027misogynist!\u0027, we will lose our cherished freedom of speech.We will be forced to muzzle ourselves and self-censorship will reign.Richard Ned Lebow is Professor of International Political Theory at King\u0027s College London and a Fellow of the British Academy."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/01/4C569AA800000578-0-image-a-2_1526515731448.jpg","title":"Vatican orders nuns spend time SOCIAL MEDIA time contemplation","story":"    Nuns are being told that tweeting too much and reading too many news stories intrudes on a life of prayer           The document warns that \u0027it is possible to empty contemplative silence when the cloister is filled with noise, news and words\u0027Australian nun and human rights activist, 71, to be deported...Former choirboy, 76, tells how a NUN raped him when he was...EXCLUSIVE: Nun says she\u0027s left with nothing after bitter...Share this articleAnd while it does not forbid social media, it states that it should be used in moderation. It warns that \u0027it is possible to empty contemplative silence when the cloister is filled with noise, news and words\u0027.Nuns should use social media with \u0027sobriety and discretion\u0027, it continues, and \u0027that they may be at the service of formation for the contemplative life and necessary communication, and do not become occasions for wasting time or escaping from the demands of fraternal life in community\u0027. It adds: \u0027Nor should they prove harmful for your vocation, or become an obstacle to your life wholly dedicated to contemplation.\u0027          It comes after a consultation with nuns in monasteries who were asked what they required to better live out their vocation.The document was presented at a press conference on Tuesday by Archbishop José Rodriguez Carballo, reports the Vatican News. Mr Carballo said he aims to \u0027clarify the provisions of the law, developing and determining the procedures for its execution.\u0027It comes after a consultation with nuns in monasteries who were asked what they required to better live out their vocation. Mr Carballo said: \u0027We copied what arrived from the nuns,\u0027 adding that the document\u0027s goal was to bring \u0027a desire for renovation with the protection and safeguarding of the pillars of contemplative life\u0027. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/01/4C516C7000000578-5738517-image-a-8_1526517009506.jpg","title":"Were super excited Nervous choir boys final rehearsals Royal Wedding","story":"    Choir boys  are preparing ahead of the nerve-wracking task of singing during the royal wedding this weekend when they will be broadcast to millions of viewers around the world          Twelve choristers will be singing in the Choir of St George\u0027s Chapel at the wedding this weekend as the eyes of the world turn to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle           The Choir of St George\u0027s Chapel was founded in 1348 and is made up of 23 choristers from St George\u0027s School, and 12 lay clerks singing alto, tenor and bass          Lay clerks - adult professional singers - live with their families in the Horseshoe Cloister, just to the west of the ChapelDonald and Melania Trump will honor Harry and Meghan with a...Spot the difference!

The father of the bride has been caught cashing in on his daughter’s wedding with staged photos that were sold around the world.  Unlike many seem to, I have little sympathy for Thomas Markle, who doubled down on his idiocyPrince Harry’s own communications director sent out stern warnings to the media ordering them to back off Thomas Markle after seeing the photos and wrongly assuming he’d been the victim of a cruel invasion of privacy.In fact, Mr Markle was invading his own privacy – for a big fat cheque.Now, you might think he’d have learned his lesson, kept his head down and tried to rescue the last remnants of his dignity – if only for the sake of his poor daughter.And you would be wrong…Instead, Mr Markle’s doubled down on his idiocy.Since the Mail on Sunday exposed his cringe-making sham, he’s been sharing his thoughts on an almost hourly basis with TMZ – a fine showbiz website, but not previously noted for their expertise on the inner workings of British royalty. First, he told them he was mortified by the embarrassment of the story.Then he claimed he’d had a heart attack last week, so wouldn’t be attending the wedding.Yesterday, Mr Markle was back with more exclusives he’d changed his mind and wanted to be at the ‘historic’ wedding.Then, last night, he told TMZ he now needed urgent heart surgery, so wouldn’t be able to go after all.TMZ, perfectly understandably, has splashed these juicy revelations across its site and generated huge clicks and attention for itself in the process.          Now Mr Markle has been sharing his thoughts with TMZ. They have understandably splashed these juicy revelations across the site and generated huge clicks and attention. Kudos to TMZ. But why is Thomas Markle continuing to collude with tabloid reporters - and what the hell is Kensington Palace playing at in letting him?As a former tabloid editor, I commend their brilliant news-breaking journalism. They’ve got the whole world waiting with bated breath for details of their next conversation with Meghan’s dad.But also as a former tabloid editor, I am utterly incredulous as to why Thomas Markle is continuing to collude with tabloid reporters?And I’m even more incredulous as to what the hell Kensington Palace is playing at in letting him?The Palace staff has completely and shamefully lost control of the narrative of this wedding.From the moment it was announced, they should have taken immediate steps to ensure Meghan’s family were protected from the inevitable massive media attention heading their way.It doesn’t take a genius to work out that when a handsome British Prince marries a beautiful American actress, global press interest is going to be off the charts.Yet Thomas Markle, currently the world’s most famous father-of-the-bride, has been left to fend for himself 8000 miles away.So he’s made his own decisions as to how to handle the media, aided and abetted by his ghastly daughter Samantha, and they have turned out disastrously.Why on earth didn’t Kensington Palace either send people to Mexico to advise him, or fly Mr Markle to London? It’s not as if Harry and Meghan can’t afford to put him up for a few weeks – they’re both rich and live in a giant palace full of spare rooms and servants.(Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that? And now won’t be able to at all before he makes the poor man’s daughter his wife.)          Why didn’t Kensington Palace send people to Mexico to advise him or fly Mr Markle to London? Harry hasn’t even bothered to meet his future-in-law – how weird is that?The result of this farcical incompetence is that Meghan’s had to spend the most stressful week of her life with a hundred times more stress than she could have ever imagined.I imagine she’s been utterly distraught at her father’s conduct.There have been reports of her tearfully begging him on the phone to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.What a terrible situation for any bride to find herself in.I also imagine that Harry’s been utterly furious.For someone who hates the paparazzi and tabloids to see his soon-to-be father-in-law in cahoots with the paparazzi and tabloids will have enraged the headstrong young Prince beyond belief.On the other hand he might reflect that if he and his big brother hadn’t been so controlling and privacy obsessed, constantly warning the press not to ‘intrude’ on Meghan’s family then Mr Markle’s collusion with said press would never have been so embarrassing. This will be his, and the Palace’s worst nightmare: a major player in the biggest day of his life going rogue.Perhaps things will sort themselves out by Saturday but I doubt it.From the sound of things, the only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum.          The only member of Meghan’s entire family who will be there is her mother, who is also the one that’s so far kept her mouth shut and behaved with decorum. She\u0027s seen here leaving for the airport, alone That fact alone would fill me with deep concern if I were the royals. Who ARE these Markles?What further mayhem are they going to wreak, especially now they’ve all been snubbed from the wedding?Hell, as we’ve already seen, hath no fury like an estranged relative scorned.I don’t think Harry and Meghan can escape some blame here.By excluding from their 600-strong guest-list all of Meghan’s family – many of whom have only said nice things about her and the wedding - and some of her oldest friends, they’re surely creating an even bigger problem down the road?Sometimes, a wedding is a good chance to settle old grievances, rather than cement them.They’re now going to have a lot more disgruntled Markles bristling with anger at being snubbed, especially when they see celebrities like the Beckhams sitting in ‘their’ seats in the church.So the Markle reality show will roll un-edifyingly on, and the Palace appears worryingly impotent and incompetent in its efforts to control the tidal wave of tacky titillation cascading from their lips.As for how all this washes up, my heart hopes Harry and Meghan will brush off the wedding chaos and live the fairy-tale happily ever after. My head, though, views with mounting concern the wildly erratic behaviour of the Markles, and I find myself murmuring: ‘There may be trouble ahead….’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/15/14/4B58342100000578-0-image-a-32_1526390724404.jpg","title":"Airplane geeks ultimate retirement home Oregon woods","story":"    Bruce Campbell is living out his retirement dreams. The 68-year-old former engineer spent a whopping $220,000 to purchase and transport a decommissioned Boeing 727 from Greece to the woods near Portland, Oregon          The bird that he bought though happened to be used to transport magnate\u0027s Aristotle Onassis’s body to Greece and was accompanied by former first lady Jackie Kennedy Onassis and other relatives. Pictured above is his airplane home resting on lumber and other building materials used to support it           Campbell explained to DailyMail.com why he settled on living inside of a plane rather than purchasing a traditional house. The Boeing 727 aircraft can be seen above situated among the heavily wooded area in Hillsboro which is near Portland‘I’m an engineer and I deferred purchasing a home until quite late in life primarily because I was very comfortable in my very humble situation and I was building equity,’ he said. ‘I never wanted to have a mortgage because it felt financially confining. By the time I was ready to purchase a home with cash, I had stopped thinking in provincial terms and I had thought like a free bird engineer.‘Basically I just looked at it as a materials technology and fabrications technology shopping challenge. I wanted the best technology that I could buy and I could see nothing better than aerospace technology.’So he bought his 10 acre plot of land in Hillsboro, about 20 miles outside Portland, partnered with a salvage company and had the plane brought in - a move he now regrets because it took so long and was expensive to have the it rebuilt on his property.          Campbell sleeps on half of his futon bed and pulls it to lay flat if he has company staying over.  He is pictured above watching the stock markets on his computer from his futon bed while covered in a blanket inside the plane          Campbell, who has never been married and has no children, absolutely loves living inside of plane and will never live in a traditional house. He is pictured above preparing to brush his teeth at the sink he installed inside of the jumbo jet          The plane did not come with a shower so the bachelor built one out of PVC material that he rolled into a cylinder shape as seen above. He said he did not finish building the shower, and has no plans to because he is comfortable with how it operates           The former engineer connected flexible water and sewage pipes to the plane in the same manner as is done routinely at airport aircraft gates. On his website he said, \u0027It\u0027s child\u0027s play class easy, superbly elegant, and earthquake immune.\u0027 He is pictured above brushing his teeth inside his plane Meghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultJoyful man dances his way down the street in heart-warming footageTennis star Karolina Pliskova strikes umpire\u0027s chair with racketSerena Williams walks herself down the isle during weddingDisgusting moment woman throws her poop at Tim Horton\u0027s workerLord Framlingham accuses lords of attempting to \u0027wreck\u0027 Brexit billTwo girls in hospital after brutal fight at Atlanta high schoolCalifornia parents face multiple neglect and torture chargesWhitney Houston doc throws shade at Paula Abdul in first trailerShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott on Windrush deportationsFor Campbell, living in a decommissioned airplane was an obvious choice but there’s little doubt that he has little regard for what others may consider to be essential creature comforts: he sleeps on half a futon – it’s only rolled out to its full width when he’s entertaining company – stockpiles two months’ worth of canned foods and goods at a time, bathes in a shower he created by rolling a sheet of PVC into a 4ft high cylinder.He’s happy to allow curious passers-by and tourists to stop by and see how he lives.‘It happens frequently, it happens almost every day now and I encourage it, it\u0027s not discouraged at all. About three quarters of my visitors schedule first, which I ask them to do on my website, and about one quarter just show up, impromptu at almost any time,’ Campbell stated.‘And so I live in a pretty transparent environment. I go about living while people are touring my aircraft and sometimes it\u0027s very intimate and at all times it\u0027s very rewarding, especially for me because I meet lots of interesting people and I learn a lot.’He’s even had people tour the plane, which is the only plane Boeing built with three engines, while he showers inside his make-shift bathing area he built out of PVC material.‘Sometimes the situation is rather intimate because I have to go about my life and people are basically streaming through my aircraft at almost any time and there have been instances people have toured while I\u0027m showering.‘That\u0027s fine, it doesn\u0027t bother me at all but it is interesting.’He loves his lifestyle and although he does say: ‘I will not marry and will not generate kids. I’m 68 so it’s too late anyway but I simply never desired to be married or have kids. I enjoy in romance and love and I indulge in it as much as civilization will allow…. but I’m not really inclined to think that all the joys of romance and human contact can be optimized or maximized. Maybe to me it’s a little like mortgage, ultimately it’s too confining.’He’s perfectly content living a modest life – but that hasn’t stopped his ambition. He currently splits his time between Oregon and Japan where he plans to buy a plot of land and a second plane to put on it so he can live the lifestyle to which he’s been accustomed in his home away from home. The jet aircraft model that Campbell owns was produced by Boeing from the 1960s up until 1984 and could seat between 149 to 180 people.           Sleeping on a futon and stocking up on food and supplies every two months, Campbell has long been used to living a modest bachelor life on the aircraft. It’s something that he does not plan on giving up – not even to pursue love. Pictured above is a desk area with numerous tools and storage items            Campbell explained that he deferred purchasing a home until quite late in life because he was building equity while working as an engineer. He is pictured above walking inside the rear section of the plane that he says provides 1,066 square feet of \u0027exhilarating aerospace quality living area\u0027          He said: \u0027I never wanted to have a mortgage because it felt financially confining. By the time I was ready to purchase a home with cash, I had stopped thinking in provincial terms and I had thought like a free bird engineer.\u0027 Campbell is pictured above sitting inside of the plane\u0027s cockpit area          In 2003, Campbell took the cash he saved and purchased the decommissioned aircraft along with the 10 acres of land where it currently rests in Hillsboro (above)          The 68-year-old partnered with a salvage company to have the plane brought to the area, but that’s a move that he now regrets due to the amount of time and expensive bills he paid to have the plane put back together on his property. Pictured above is a closer view of the landing gear and materials used to support the aircraft          But what was an easy decision that Campbell doesn’t regret is living in Oregon. He came to live in the state after accepting a job there when he graduated college in the 1970s. Campbell is pictured above inside a portion of the tail on the aircraft          He said: ‘I like the area and it\u0027s very green and Oregon is a little independent minded which appealed to me. even though it was the only job offer I got, it was the one I wanted the most so I was very lucky.’ Pictured above is a side view of the plane from the wing showing it\u0027s number, N7275H          Campbell added: ‘It’s a country setting, it’s very nice. It’s more than enough for the aircraft.’ The Boeing 727-200 is pictured above from an aerial view in the woods of Hillsboro, Oregon          Campbell splits his time between living on the plane and residing in Japan where he hopes to purchase land and another plane to live there. Campbell is pictured above standing outside in the grass area near his airplane home          Campbell bought the 10 acres of land that the Boeing 727-400 is on for around $23,000 when he was in his 20s. Pictured above is the aircraft seen from the trees in Hillsboro           He is more than well adjusted to his unique lifestyle and even allows visitors to tour the jumbo jet – no matter what he is doing. Campbell is pictured above underneath the floor of the Boeing 727-400 plane           He noted that he \u0027goes about living\u0027 while people tour around inside the plane.  \u0027...sometimes it\u0027s very intimate. and at all times it\u0027s very rewarding, especially for me because I meet lots of interesting people and I learn a lot.’ Campbell is pictured above standing on the wing of the plane after exiting from one of the emergency exit doors          He also shared that some of his visitors have even caught him in the shower while on tour and he doesn\u0027t mind. He is pictured above leaning on a tree outside of his home          Campbell feels that retired airplanes \u0027are profoundly well designed high technology aerospace quality sealed pressure canisters which can withstand 575 mph winds and seven G acceleration forces with ease, can last for centuries, are extremely fire resistant, and provide superior security,\u0027 according to his website. Pictured above is a closer view of the controls inside the cockpit of his plane          \u0027They\u0027re among the finest structures mankind has ever built,\u0027 Campbell said on his website. Pictured above is the underneath portion of the Boeing 727\u0027s tail          Campbell also believes that it\u0027s \u0027irrational to destroy\u0027 retired airplanes which he thinks are \u0027the finest home sized structures available on this planet\u0027. He is pictured above sitting inside an engine compartment of his airplane home in Hillsboro          He believes that traditional homes are built out of \u0027materials which are fundamentally little more than assemblies of sticks rendered with ancient and inferior design and fabrication methods.\u0027 Pictured above are the stairs to board the plane          Campbell thinks living in an airplane also is a \u0027great toy\u0027 that includes \u0027trick doors, trick floors\u0027. He can be seen above through an empty engine compartment atop the plane          The 68-year-old retired engineer also finds that living on the plane is \u0027a constant exploratory adventure, ever  entertaining, providing fundamental sustenance for an old technology nerd like me. Owning lots of little toys is great fun. Owning lots of little toys enclosed in a very big toy is nirvana.\u0027 His plane is pictured above from the forest in Hillsboro          Campbell said that he only has a relationship with one set of his neighbors who support the fact that he lives inside of a retired jumbo jet. He is pictured above in an aerial photo spread out on top of his airplane home          Campbell added: \u0027(They) are very good friends and they like the project and support the project significantly.\u0027 He is pictured above peering into the main cabin from the underneath floor of the jumbo jet          Campbell doesn\u0027t plan on giving up his bachelor lifestyle to pursue love anytime soon. \u0027I will not marry and will not generate kids. I’m 68 so it’s too late anyway but I simply never desired to be married or have kids,\u0027 he said. He is pictured above reading from his phone atop of the Boeing 727-400          He added:\u0027 I enjoy in romance and love and I indulge in it as much as civilization will allow. But I’m not really inclined to think that all the joys of romance and human contact can be optimized or maximized. Maybe to me it’s a little like mortgage, ultimately it’s too confining.’ The 68-year-old is pictured above descending the stairs on his plane          When his plane did fly the friendly skies, it could seat between 149 to 189 passengers. Pictured above is the inside of Campbell\u0027s aircraft showing several seat rows dismantled           The Boeing 727-400 model that Campbell owns is the only plane the company built with three engines.

A second alleged victim, who was also homeless, was given a room in Bariana’s flat for £90 a week rent. He worked in a takeaway for three or four weeks for five days a week and about 10 hours a day without payWhen someone was ‘injured’ in an incident and police investigated the man said he told officers he had fallen down stairs.‘There was a chance it would happen to us if we didn’t,’ he said.Asked why he worked for nothing, the man replied: ‘I had to or I wouldn’t be living there.’The court heard another man who lived in the same flat and worked for Bariana was also mistreated.The man was put in a bath and his belt and shoes taken off him, forcing him to walk a mile to the chip shop with bare feet.A second alleged victim, who was also homeless, was given a room in Bariana’s flat for £90 a week rent.He worked in a takeaway for three or four weeks for five days a week and about 10 hours a day without pay.Instead of cash, the man said he was given two litres of cider, costing about £3, each day.Asked about the situation he found himself in, the man added: ‘It was a hard one as I didn’t know what to do.’Mr Knox also told the jury how one alleged victim had movements restricted by Bariana who would come to his home at night, ‘remove his clothes, in particular his trainers, so he couldn’t do off,’ before working the next day.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/16/15/4C51B03500000578-0-image-m-25_1526481222121.jpg","title":"JANET STREET PORTER Harrys bride family messed Windsors","story":"Thomas, Sandra, Tracy and Tyler - who wouldn\u0027t look out of place in the next series of Hicksville Big Brother - are already polishing their anecdotes about their blameless relative Meghan for anyone with a cheque book and the right amount of cash.

Meghan\u0027s father (pictured with her) may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?The cast of characters in the Markle chamber of horrors includes a cannabis farmer, a Domino\u0027s Manager, a recovering alcoholic and the spiteful half-sister she no longer appears to speak to.Not forgetting the \u0027intensely private\u0027 bankrupt dad who changes his story from day to day.The former lighting director may be in Windsor wearing a morning suit (if someone can buy him one) on Saturday or he may be in an operating theatre having heart surgery - who knows?For once, the characters and their stories outperform anything soaps could dream up - this is beyond satire.Meghan has my sympathy, because every one of us has ghastly relatives, family members we\u0027ve airbrushed out of our lives, people we would never choose as friends, let alone family members.She has the misfortune to be lumbered with a whole coachload.          With ghastly relatives like hers, Meghan will find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dullWeddings always ide as many people in a family as they unite - it\u0027s a chance to settle scores (with restricted guest lists) and create a two-tiered system where some lucky people get gold passes to every part of the day, some are granted silver membership to a few drinks and a sausage roll if they\u0027re lucky, or the common plebs who have to make do with a fleeting glimpse from the roadside in dubious weather with no refreshments.The father of any bride is in a difficult position - he will be proud his gorgeous daughter is marrying someone she adores, but fearful he might mess up his pivotal role in the proceedings.At my first wedding, Dad insisted on driving me to Chelsea Register Office. We\u0027d not been speaking for nine months because I\u0027d cancelled my previous engagement.When my parents found out my new husband-to-be was posh - and I would have a double-barreled name, things improved slightly.Like Meghan\u0027s father, my dad blew hot and cold, but in the end he drove me to the ceremony.I was wearing a beautiful dress, but as I stepped out of the car, he was so nervous he slammed the door on my leg and we had a furious row in the street.At lunch in a fashionable restaurant afterwards, my mother tried to steal the flowers.The manager had to present her with them and I have a picture of her in the car park hoisting her trophies aloft. I died with embarrassment.Meghan has wisely not invited the motley crew of Markles, and why should she?I didn\u0027t invite any of my cousins and only one aunt and uncle.Meghan\u0027s lot could hardly be equipped for small talk with Princess Anne or Prince Edward - I can\u0027t imagine they know anything about equine blood lines or musical theatre, although her nephew TJ Dooley junior (married to husband Ronnie) has been photographed in drag, clutching his fake breasts.His brother Tyler (a cannabis farmer) is producing a new strain to celebrate the occasion- Markle Sparkle, retailing at over $200 an ounce.Their dad - Meghan\u0027s half brother - a glass fitter also called Thomas, has not flown to the UK, but posted offensive remarks about Meghan when he discovered he was not on the Windsor guest list.Meghan\u0027s half sister Samantha Grant has been blabbing to anyone who contacts her (for cash of course), claiming that it was her idea to set up their confused and well meaning father with a paparazzi photographer, although she couldn\u0027t be sure exactly how much he got paid.Samantha and Meghan allegedly haven\u0027t spoken for over ten years, so her insights on the new member of the Royal family will be a little sketchy.Samantha is publishing a book entitled The Diary of Princess Pushy\u0027s sister.When I appeared on I\u0027m a Celebrity, my sister flogged pictures from our family album to a gossip magazine.Someone else sold my Brownie pictures.My sister revealed I had tried to kill her when we were 8 and 10.My fourth ex-husband sold his story twice to different tabloids, claiming I was \u0027a beast in bed\u0027.That\u0027s why I have sympathy for Meghan. With ghastly relatives like these, she\u0027ll find life as a new member of our dysfunctional Royal family is pretty dull. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/08/02/4BDA124700000578-0-image-a-13_1525741714453.jpg","title":"PM Hilarity ask puffin whistle QUENTIN LETTS yesterday Parliament","story":"    Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May as she speaks during Prime Minister\u0027s Questions (PMQs)Philip Hammond, Chancellor of the Exchequer, left the Chamber well before the end of PMQs.

Mrs May, in the face of a joke, stands unmoved, unblinking, uncomprehending, the Venerable Bede at the mouth of an Ibiza nightclub.We used to know an ancient Jack Russell that came round to our house in search of biscuits and would be shouted at most severely – great growling and threatened biting – by our two, daft Patterdales. The Jack Russell would stand there, motionless, looking magnificently bored, until our lunatics tired of their aggression and trotted off in search of alternative entertainment. Mrs May takes the same approach. At one point she said she wanted a ‘customs union’ with the EU but we were later told this had been a heat-of-the-moment mistake. She had meant ‘customs arrangement’.          (L-R) Speaker of the House of Commons John Bercow, Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons Lindsay Hoyle. Sir Lindsay Hoyle was so popular as Speaker in Parliament there were shouts for him to replace John Bercow when he returned to take session on WednesdayThe only other moment of mild interest was when she said leaving the EU was ‘a matter of the integrity of politicians – we should deliver on that choice’ made by the voters at the EU referendum. Mr Corbyn makes no such assertion.But the day’s abiding characteristic was MPs’ widespread wordiness, the loquacity, the logorrhoea, the prating perissology (good grief, they’ve got me doing it now).Stephen Kinnock (Lab, Aberavon), who is one of the more intelligent of them and has a lovely voice, ruined a promising question about the EU by simply going on too long. Dullards like Maggie Throup (Con, Erewash) and Virendra Sharma (Lab, Ealing Southall) and many others asked questions that stretched like bubble gum. The more they spoke, the less anyone listened.Same with Labour’s Chief Whip, Nick Brown, who had a point of order complaining that Mr Grayling had not given his Labour shadow the customary advance warning of his rail statement. Mr Brown could have made his point in half the time, and thus made it more pointed.Amazing how inept so many of them are. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/05/17/00/4C4FEA2900000578-5738297-The_volcano_now_has_20_open_fissures_and_is_firing_out_lava_bomb-a-8_1526512121324.jpg","title":"Golfers appear nonplussed play round nearby erupting Kilauea volcano","story":"    A group of golfers were seen playing a round nearby Hawaii\u0027s Kilauea volcano, which has been erupting for 11 days, as an ash cloud forms behind them          The volcano now has 20 open fissures, and is firing out lava bombs the size of microwave ovensLord Framlingham accuses lords of attempting to \u0027wreck\u0027 Brexit billMeghan Markle\u0027s half-sister says: Staged photos were my faultTwo girls in hospital after brutal fight at Atlanta high schoolJoyful man dances his way down the street in heart-warming footageTennis star Karolina Pliskova strikes umpire\u0027s chair with racketSerena Williams walks herself down the isle during weddingDisgusting moment woman throws her poop at Tim Horton\u0027s workerCalifornia parents face multiple neglect and torture chargesWhitney Houston doc throws shade at Paula Abdul in first trailerShadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott on Windrush deportations    Pictured: Ballistic blocks shot hundreds of yards from the Kilauea volcano and found on Wednesday morning\u0027These reflect the most energetic explosions yet observed and could reflect the onset of steam-driven explosive activity... additional such explosions are expected and could be more powerful.\u0027 On Tuesday, the USGS said a recent lowering of the lava lake at the crater had \u0027raised the potential for explosive eruptions\u0027.Beware of the lava bombs!

Literally, I forgot entirely that they existed, which is one of the perils of a big chain … the left hand sometimes doesn’t know what the right hand is doing,” Daunt told the .“We will also need to work with them to ensure that we do not do anything predatory or anything that imperils them at all.”The U-turn was hailed as a “small victory” by Julie Danskin, the manager of Golden Hare Books, who said it was clear that the community had not responded well to the news.“We are very glad that James Daunt and Waterstones have done the decent thing. In future, though, one other thing that Waterstones can do is really dial down the discount offers on books because it does hit us in a way that does not need to happen.”Daunt said that the rollout of the unbranded stores – which began in 2014 with the opening of Southwold Books – would continue, although there would always be a clear role for its larger branches. The idea was to put “good people” in charge and encourage them to foster unbranded branches with a view to them evolving into “idiosyncratic, quirky little shops of the best sort”.“The key – and one of the things I have continued to struggle with at Waterstones – is how, within the context of a chain, you get the inidual booksellers to create a distinctive shop,” said Daunt, a former banker turned career bookseller who was brought in to rescue the chain in 2011 after a buyout by the Russian billionaire Alexander Mamut.“That is difficult and it’s about breaking a culture that has been trying for years to do something different.”The company, which was sold in April to US hedge fund Elliott Advisors, made its first profit in years last year – an achievement linked to a strategy of trying to run branches like local bookshops.Daunt, an opponent of Brexit, said that he also believed that Waterstones was very much “a force for good” in the current climate, adding: “These are times when we need bookshops, as things get spiky.”Gesturing down at the shop floor of the company’s London flagship in Piccadilly, he added that while its way of operating was different from branches in largely Brexit-voting towns such as Barrow-in-Furness, it was still important to keep outlets in such places.“We need to keep a shop there, and in Middlesbrough and Sunderland,” he added. “I am someone who finds Brexit an abomination and a betrayal of everything I stand for and I think that would be true of those who work in our shops. Booksellers have always been that way, but the importance of our shops is, ironically, often the case in places that perhaps in a wider sense appear to be more hostile environment.

The transport secretary did not look comfortable on Wednesday, informing the House of Commons that the east coast mainline would be brought under government control. He tried to present renationalisation as something other than a 180 degree reversal of previous policy. He emphasised the temporary nature of the measure and underlined his belief in the superiority of private enterprise over state control. It was still a volte-face. The line has been run as a franchise by Stagecoach and Virgin since 2015, but unprofitably. The operators promised to pay £3.3bn to run the line for eight years. Within three, they have breached the terms of their contract. It is a familiar pattern: private providers making unrealistic bids, confident that the government must play backstop if they fail, which they did last year. The challenge then facing the transport secretary was to settle on a form of intervention that was politically acceptable to rail users and ideologically palatable to himself and his party.The two requirements pulled in opposite directions. A straight bailout would look like a reward for failure, transferring taxpayers’ money to corporate bunglers who should foot the bill for their own incompetence. Mr\u0026nbspGrayling has been at pains to point out that the franchise holders are paying a price – in terms of damaged reputation and forfeited cash (around £200m). But he has been equally reluctant to accept that the line might be better off in public hands. This has been an ideological hurdle. Mr Grayling is a dogmatic free-marketeer, allergic to the idea of public sector management in anything that might also be privately run. The east coast mainline conundrum forces him to swallow something he finds intellectually discomfiting: private sector failure invites public ownership as a legitimate alternative.Having the state run things is not controversial, outside certain rarefied Conservative circles. Network Rail, the company that maintains track and associated infrastructure, is an arm’s-length body attached to Mr Grayling’s department. Opinion polls show high levels of support for renationalisation of the railways and utilities, reflecting first-hand experience of unresponsive, overpriced services. That doesn’t prove that state ownership would be better but it makes it reasonable to consider the option fairly. Some of the UK’s privatised services are already provided by state-supported companies, but the states in question are France and Germany. The taboo that preys on Mr Grayling’s mind is quite peculiar to British Conservatives.It is also unsupported by history. The most successful recent period in the operation of the east coast mainline was the phase of public ownership between 2009 and 2015. Then, too, the service had been renationalised in response to private franchise failure, in that instance in the hands of National Express. There was no pressure from customers to reprivatise, nor was there an economic case. The nationalised service earned around £1bn for the Treasury. But the Tories felt compelled to give the failed franchising model yet another try. The government plan now is for the east coast mainline to be handed over to a “public-private partnership” in 2020. Mr Grayling insisted on Wednesday that Virgin and Stagecoach would suffer no penalties in future competition for rail franchises. Yet they should pay a\u0026nbspprice for failure. National Express was banned from bidding for future rail franchises by Labour.Mr Graying is striving to resurrect something as close as possible to business as usual, and as soon as possible. That would be a missed opportunity. The\u0026nbspmore imaginative route would be to allow the east coast line to continue under public ownership on an open-ended basis, repeating the experiment of 2009-15, to see if the former success is replicated. Ministers might set aside ideology and judge different models for rail ownership on the evidence of their performance and financial sustainability. But that is not Mr Grayling’s style, nor is it a distinguishing attribute of many of his colleagues. When it comes to the politics and the economics of running a railway, sadly the Conservatives have a one-track mind."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6d9bf3b067e2aec6ac692fbe8d740d37dfd9aa3/0_380_5189_3112/master/5189.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87b86aa8e2ac9671248fec0059a96f93","title":"the guardian view on the bank of england keep the menopause out of economic theory","story":"The economy, according to a newspaper headline, is “at a menopausal moment”. The deputy governor of the Bank of England, former Goldman Sachs banker Ben Broadbent, has been quoted as comparing the current slump in productivity to a similar, and much debated, spell of stagnation in the late years of Queen Victoria’s reign. This period was identified in 1952 by the economist Henry Phelps Brown as “the climacteric of the 1890s”. Broadbent, asked to explain what was meant by a “climacteric”, said that it was a biological word meaning “menopausal, but can apply to both genders … it means you’re past your peak, you’re no longer potent”.And with that Mr Broadbent, to use another bodily metaphor, fell flat on his face. Anyone equipped with basic common sense, leave alone in possession of a prominent position in public life, ought to be ashamed of the claim that the menopause means that a woman is\u0026nbspover the hill and lacks “potency”. Such ideas are, plain\u0026nbspand simple, misogynist myths.Mr Broadbent’s botched attempt to explain an idea from economic history also sends out worrying signals about the sort of language and discourse felt to be acceptable at the Bank of England – not, it might be added, an institution especially celebrated for its nurturing and promotion of women. He apologised quickly. But his ill-chosen words act as a grim reminder of the pervasiveness of language that objectifies and belittles women, particularly older women. The association of the bodies of postmenopausal women with a lack of value is depressingly common, but there is something especially chilling about extending this tired old equivalence to economic theory.Mr Broadbent’s explanation did not even represent an accurate definition of “the climacteric”. It is true that the word can, in some medical contexts, be used as a synonym for the menopause, or, indeed, to indicate a man’s diminishing physical strength after a certain age. But it has much more generally been applied to any critical stage in human life a point when a person is especially liable to changes in health or fortune. (It derives, ultimately, from the ancient Greek word klimax, meaning ladder.) In the early modern period, these crucial moments were often regarded as coming along every seven years. In the dedicatory section at the start of his translation of Virgil, for example, John Dryden wrote, “I began this work in my Grand Clymacterique” – that is, at the age of 63, felt to be an especially significant year (and by no means denoting a collapse of productivity). In Phelps Brown’s original article, indeed, the language is scholarly and neutral there is no suggestion of the 1890s economy having been a “menopausal moment”. Instead, he soberly referred to a “check on the economic progress of the country”.Mr Broadbent, after this unedifying moment has passed, should concentrate on diagnosing the state of the economy. He can leave women’s bodies out of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a3324de1a1d5f68db4c41cb86d02cc523590cb5/0_252_7346_4409/master/7346.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0dcc5ef5c856ee57b07b251311e5efc0","title":"ian hislop picks banksy hoax for british museum dissent show","story":"Graffiti artist’s Peckham Rock placed in museum as prank will feature among objects illustrating subversionAt the time it was somewhat embarrassing but 13 years after Banksy installed a hoax exhibit at the British Museum curators are finally seeing the funny side.The museum has announced it has approached the artist to lend a piece formally known as Peckham Rock – a small “cave painting” of a stone-age hunter pushing a supermarket trolley. The artwork was left in the museum by Banksy, along with a convincing panel of text which earnestly explained it was from the “Post-Catatonic era”. It went unnoticed by staff for at least a day, possibly a lot longer.The rock will be part of an autumn exhibition for which Ian Hislop has gone through the British Museum’s vast collection to choose more than 100 objects which have stories of dissent, subversion or satire.Hislop, the editor of Private Eye and described by the British Museum’s chairman Sir Richard Lambert as “the nation’s raspberry blower-in-chief”, said it had been enormous fun.“We are very sneery about the past, we are very condescending about other cultures and other times and imagine that only we are brave enough, bright enough or sensible enough to notice there is something wrong with the way we’re governed,” he said. “The great thing about this exhibition is to show that people have always noticed.”The display of the Banksy piece “proves that the British Museum can take a joke”, said Hislop, although it was not viewed as being all that funny by everyone concerned at the time.There were questions of whether the artwork should enter the collection but tricky paperwork and the rock’s sniffily official designation as “lost property” meant it did not happen. Tom Hockenhull, the British Museum curator who is working on the show with Hislop, said: “It was the cause of considerable embarrassment for the museum at the time and when Banksy asked for it back we were only too pleased to oblige.”Hislop said it took him about 30 seconds to say yes when the former director Neil MacGregor came up with the idea for the show.One of his favourite objects in the show will be a brick from the ancient Babylonian reign of Nebuchadnezzar. All bricks had to bear the king’s name but, amazingly, the brickmaker has written his own name over the king’s before it was put in a wall. “Is he doing this to have a laugh?” asked Hislop. “Is he doing it for his friends? Or is he doing it just to say, ‘Well, I can do this’.”There will be objects that fall into the “hiding in plain sight” category, such as a the 16th-century Stonyhurst Salt, a salt cellar which, with the beads of Christ’s blood and crosses, was clearly a Catholic sacramental object. But they were banned, so it was a salt cellar.From the museum’s 12,000 or so satirical prints will be a particularly vicious one by James Gillray from 1792 of the Prince of Wales: morbidly obese, picking his teeth with a fork, and surrounded by medication for venereal disease.“I don’t think anyone has ever been as rude about anyone as they were about the Prince Regent,” said Hislop wistfully.Other objects will include an Edwardian coin with the king’s head defaced with the slogan “Votes for Women” a woven raffia cloth from the Democratic Republic of Congo which subverts the image of a leaping leopard, the symbol of Zaire’s dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and a pink knitted pussy hat worn at the January 2017 women’s march against Donald Trump.There will also be plenty of filth, Hislop promised, including a first-century oil lamp of Cleopatra having sex with a crocodile.Hislop said the exhibition would tell the stories of people risking their lives as well as people risking nothing at all. “It is an extraordinary demonstration of spirit from thousands of years ago until now.”• I Object: Ian Hislop’s search for dissent is at the British Museum, London, from 6 September to 20 January 2019"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a1504c3ab093f4a17da9162c219ebb00832ea5d6/0_196_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=960a18239c41b2575229e549b2790dee","title":"get the lowdown on ottawa a local reveals all","story":"Queen Victoria may have picked Ottawa out of obscurity to name it the capital of Canada but the city has grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that loves to embrace the outdoorsWhen Queen Victoria picked Ottawa to be the capital of Canada it was an unimposing frontier town: the city has since grown into a modern metropolis packed with award-winning restaurants, stunning architecture and a local population that’s all about the outdoors.Whatever the weather, Ottawites embrace all four seasons. On lazy, hazy summer Sundays, stretches of the Sir John A Macdonald Parkway are closed to traffic and become a pedestrian haven. Why not join the dog walkers and bicyclists, in-line skaters and joggers alongside the beaches and rapids of the Ottawa river? You can paddle the rivers that frame the city – the Ottawa, Gatineau or Rideau – or enjoy the wildlife in urban parks or the much-loved Greenbelt, around 20,000 hectares (around 49,500 acres) of farms, forests and wetlands that surrounds the capital. In May, admire the rich colours of the Canadian Tulip Festival it’s the world’s largest, with over a million orange, red and yellow flowers.In winter, locals descend en masse to skate on Ottawa’s central Rideau canal. The world’s largest naturally frozen ice-skating route is home to a hardy crowd who chow down on Beavertails (that’s a pastry, not an animal’s tail), pull on cosy clothes and toques (wool hats), and glide along for nearly 5 miles (around 7.8 km). For three weekends in February, the Winterlude festival brings ice sculptures, foodie events and a children’s Snowflake Kingdom.Thanks to it’s historical significance, Ottawa is not short of imposing buildings. Admire the vaulting neo-gothic spires of Parliament Hill, the crystal tower of the National Gallery of Canada and, just across the river in the twin city of Gatineau, the Canadian Museum of History, the design of which is inspired by Canada’s topography.The Hill is also the centre point for Canada Day, Canada’s birthday celebrations every 1 July. Expect to find a stage showcasing Canadian musicians, followed by fireworks at night. Watch from the Hill or behind the Fairmont Château Laurier, the historic “castle”, opened as a grand hotel in 1912. Parliament’s central Peace Tower is perfect for a bird’s-eye panorama of the city visit on Wednesdays at noon in summer for free yoga sessions in front of parliament on the lawn. Keep your eyes peeled: you might just see prime minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Grégoire Trudeau joining in.There’s a vibrant restaurant scene in Ottowa. Explore the eclectic cuisine of Canadian Culinary Champion Marc Lepine, the only chef to win the Gold Medal Plates competition twice, at his restaurant Atelier or the innovative Middle Eastern fare of Walid El-Tawel at Fairouz.City neighbourhoods are equally exciting and eminently walkable. ByWard Market is arguably the most vibrant, with more than 120 places to eat and drink in a four-block-by-four-block patch that’s also home to a great selection of shops. Also try Westboro and the Glebe, where you’ll find Lansdowne, a complex with a year-round farmers’ market and a new stadium where you can catch sports events downtown. Ottawa’s museum and gallery scene reflects Canadians’ past and future hopes. Gatineau’s Canadian Museum of History’s Grand Hall with its towering totem poles captures the lasting presence of indigenous cultures, while the museum’s new Canadian History Hall presents the largest and most comprehensive exhibition about Canadian history ever created. In contrast, quirky Bytown Museum reveals the history of Ottawa .

It is lovely to see. Fagner is with his family – lots of family, mostly wearing that famous yellow kit – but standing apart, listening to the names being announced, one by one, on television. If he looks nervous it is understandable bearing in mind his whole career, at the age of 28, has brought him only four caps. He has clearly not had any advance warning. And then, finally, it is his name read out and, amid the screams and the hugs, we see what it means for a footballer to be selected for this tournament.Unfortunately, nobody had a video camera on Trent Alexander‑Arnold when he discovered that he will also be in Russia this summer but it is safe to assume it was a similar kind of euphoria. Jürgen Klopp, the Liverpool manager, gave him the news after an early‑morning telephone call from Gareth Southgate. Liverpool’s players were catching a flight to Marbella for a warm-weather training camp and Klopp approached the 19-year-old defender on the bus taking the players across the runway at John Lennon airport. “What are your plans for the summer?” Klopp wanted to know, wearing a smile that revealed he knew the answer.The plane had just touched down in Málaga when the Football Association announced England’s squad and in the absence of any controversy – and let’s face it, the absence of Jack Wilshere and Jonjo Shelvey is hardly up there with Paul Gascoigne trashing Glenn Hoddle’s hotel room in 1998 – the inclusion of Alexander-Arnold should be a reminder that these are, in essence, special moments for the players who have made the cut.Alexander-Arnold, brought up just down the road from Liverpool’s training ground, has a Champions League final coming up on Saturday week. After that, he will be going to a World Cup, as the youngest player in Southgate’s squad. England have now taken a teenager to their last four major tournaments, a run featuring Marcus Rashford at Euro 2016, Raheem Sterling and Luke Shaw for the 2014 World Cup and Alex Oxlade‑Chamberlain and Jack Butland at Euro 2012.Klopp kept it relatively low-key and understandably so, perhaps, when Adam Lallana, another Liverpool player, has been left out on the back of an injury-disrupted season. Ideally, Southgate would have liked Lallana in his starting lineup but the England manager concluded it would be difficult selecting someone who has started only three games all season. Southgate was tempted but his decision-making throughout this whole process has been guided by the principle that if a player was not involved for his club side he should not expect to be selected for his country.Southgate made that very point in one of his first meetings with the England players and, barring the odd exception, he has stuck by it during his 20 months in charge. His choices will always ide opinion – this being a nation of roughly 50 million England managers in every World Cup year – but at least it makes a change from the days when someone in his position could be guaranteed to pick their favourites come what may.Of the 23 players heading to Russia, John Stones, with two Premier League starts since 20 January, can count himself slightly fortunate on that front. Equally, could anyone muster a reasonable case for the omission of the Manchester City player?Danny Rose might also consider himself lucky to get the call ahead of Ryan Bertrand after an in-out season for Spurs. Likewise, it is not so controversial that Southgate should expect an interrogation on the subject when he holds a news conference at Wembley on Thursday.As for Gary Cahill, he had been vulnerable after falling out of favour at Chelsea, meaning he was left out of England’s games against the Netherlands and Italy in March. Yet Cahill’s return to the Chelsea team has been timed well and, with 58 caps, his experience counts in his favour bearing in mind the lack of tournament knowhow among the squad as a whole. Together, the players chosen by Southgate have a total of 449 appearances, the lowest of any England squad for a World Cup since 1962, when Walter Winterbottom selected a group with 322 caps.At least Lallana has made it on to England’s standby list. Joe Hart, on the other hand, does not even have that small consolation, with Burnley’s Tom Heaton the first reserve in case any of the three goalkeepers – Jordan Pickford, Butland and Nick Pope – has to withdraw before Fifa’s cutoff point on 17 June, the day before England’s opening assignment against Tunisia at the Volgograd Arena.Wilshere is also completely out of the picture as far as Southgate is concerned, with Lewis Cook and Jake Livermore on the standby list of midfielders, and there was noticeably no mention of the Arsenal player when the FA asked England’s manager about the “tough phone calls” to the nearly men.Southgate spoke at length about Hart and Bertrand but did not extend his sympathies to Wilshere. Hart and Bertrand, he pointed out, had been prominently involved in England’s qualification programme. Wilshere, in contrast, had not played for England since Euro 2016 and Southgate, harsh as it may sound, was being generous to call him on Tuesday to explain the reasons for leaving him out. Not every manager would have felt it necessary.The downside is that England’s squad not only lacks an experienced goalkeeper, an elite centre-half and an inspirational captain but still hasn’t solved the problem of finding a natural playmaker – someone to take care of the ball, the old‑fashioned way.That, however, is a problem for English football as a whole, not just Southgate, and overall it is difficult to argue too vehemently with his choices. Southgate will just have to hope Harry Kane, Sterling and his other mandatory first-team picks can play at the point of maximum expression. Though the danger, of course, is that we are now entering what English football knows as the metatarsal zone."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3ceb959f71dd20f6c54a54751e3c3439d44a4e7b/0_0_2120_1272/master/2120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a4fae44f1bd9a98fe2de7adc36ddd581","title":"football broken dreams african teenagers sold premier league lie nepal","story":"He went to Nepal hoping it would be a stepping stone to playing for Chelsea. Instead, Aboubacar Sidibé became another victim of unscrupulous ‘agents’ who promise young men a shot at the big time only to swindle them Like thousands of football-mad teenagers in Mali, Aboubacar Sidibé dreamed of one day playing for Chelsea. So when a football manager approached him with the promise of a contract with a club in India – a launchpad, he was told, to the European clubs – he jumped at the chance.It didn’t matter that he was just 17. Or that he would have to pay the manager more than £2,700. It seemed a price worth paying to kickstart his football career. Weeks later, Sidibé was indeed playing football abroad, but he was no closer to Stamford Bridge. Instead, he found himself kicking a torn football around a dusty pitch in a country he had never heard of before: Nepal.“When I arrived it was not at all what the manager had told me … Every time I get in touch with him he says it’ll be OK. But it will not be OK. I hate him. He cheated me,” says Sidibé.Ranked 162 out of 207 nations by FIFA, Nepal is an unlikely destination for aspiring footballers. But it does have an entry policy that allows visitors from almost any country to get a visa on arrival.And so they come: a small but steady stream of young men from west Africa, hoping Nepal will be the first step on the road to football stardom. They follow an exodus of tens of thousands of African players, often teenagers like Sidibé, chasing their footballing dreams to the most remote corners of the world.In 2017, more than 100 people from Mali, Ivory Coast, Burkina Faso, Guinea, Benin and Togo entered Nepal.They were promised the chance to play in Nepal’s football league, an offer that comes with a club, contract, and work permit. On arrival, however, they learned they had been sold a lie.Football in Nepal has been almost completely on hold for the past three years first interrupted by the 2015 earthquake, when the national stadium was damaged, and then repeatedly postponed by mismanagement and a dispute between different factions of the All Nepal Football Association (Anfa).But most of the Africans in Nepal have no invitation and no club.As the months slipped by, Sidibé gave up going to football practice. Instead, he whiled away his days watching Premier League matches on his phone in a cold basement flat on the southern outskirts of Kathmandu.On a clear day he could see the towering, snow-clad Himalayas from his window. “I had never heard of Nepal before I came here. It’s a country for tourists. It’s not a place to come and earn a living,” says Sidibé, sitting on a foam mat that doubles as his bed.Without a contract and regular league games, many of the young Africans are struggling to make ends meet. Anything they do earn goes on food, rent and extending their visas. “I was earning more in Mali than I earn now … I’m trying to get out and play in another country,” says Sidibé.But that too is difficult. Like almost all the west African footballers in Nepal, Sidibé only bought a one-way plane ticket. Without the money to survive in the country, or to buy a flight home, he is trapped. “I have to pay back my debt. I’m so demoralised … We don’t have enough to eat. At night, we lie down but we don’t sleep.”Sidibé shares the flat with five other west African footballers. There is no furniture, so they sit on the concrete floor or perch on upturned buckets in the kitchen. Kande Sidibé, another young Malian who paid thousands of dollars to the same manager, seems to express everyone’s mood. “I really regret coming here … I’ve only played four or five matches in five months … We are suffering here. It’s very difficult.”The group only comes to life when they talk about football. An excited argument breaks out over who will win the World Cup. Most are putting their bets on Germany or Brazil. No one thinks England stands a chance. “Our dream is to play with big teams in Europe,” says Die Lekpahisaira from Ivory Coast. “European managers come to Asia to scout for talent, so we come here to get exposure … if they see we have talent, they will tell others.” While they wait to be spotted, the only way they can earn anything is to travel the country playing in small knockout tournaments for as little as £18 a match. It’s a gruelling routine. “You finish a match at 6pm, get on a night bus to the other side of the country, and are expected to play again at 3pm … And if you lose in the first round you are out, so we pray we win the first match,” says Leo Mballa, a footballer from Cameroon, who lives in a small room on the other side of Kathmandu.Mballa sits on blankets on an otherwise bare concrete floor. Football boots are strewn across the room. A single rice cooker and a cardboard box with a few vegetables in it serves as the kitchen. A blanket and towel make do for curtains.The only thing worse than playing in the tournaments is not playing. To get a game, the Africans typically need an introduction from a Nepali, for which they have to pay – either upfront or by handing over a cut of their earnings. Mballa says Nepali “agents” demand up to £185 to find them a place in a team. “If you don’t pay, you don’t play.” The players are victims of an informal network of recruiters and brokers, which stretches from “managers” in west Africa, to Africans who have lived in Nepal or India for years.Philip Atanda’s case is typical. The Ivorian says he paid a “huge amount” to a manager in his home country, who had lived in Nepal for a few years. “He told me there would be a league and I would have the opportunity to join a team … He said I could gets lots of money … But nothing like that has happened,” says Atanda.Everyone wants to leave, but no one wants to return home. “My family don’t know about my situation,” says Aboubacar Sidibé. “We took a big loan and I can’t return with nothing. I’d rather die than go home with nothing.”A month later, Sidibé buckled. He called his family for help, and left Nepal. But instead of returning to Mali, his flatmates say he decided to try his luck in Morocco.

That sounds a hell of a lot scarier than it actually is – I just really want this parcel to make it to its destination. And there’s a decent chance it might not, because inside all the bubble wrap are two bottles of Hal’s New York Limited Edition Coffee Seltzer.For people like us, seltzer is way more than just a beverage.I am now the sort of person who knows about things like limited-edition coffee seltzer, because I have become a member of a somewhat-secret seltzer society called “Now Fizzing”. (My entry is granted after I track down members on Twitter and share my seltzer-loving truth.) It’s a closed Facebook group that’s been around since 21 November 2014, and it’s composed of more than 3,100 members from around the world. Within the group, its members offer and ask for tips on where to find sought-after flavors and brands (the Polar seltzer’s seasonal flavors are always a huge hit – right now, everyone is on the hunt for its Blood Orange Lemonade, Starfruit Lemonade and Strawberry Lemonade Seltzer’ade flavors), share selfies and videos of themselves trying new kinds of seltzer for the first time (called “seltzies” and “fizzeos”, respectively), and discuss other aspects of their lives through the lens of the drink that has brought them all together.There’s a two-year-old “star” of Now Fizzing, the daughter of a member who is being filmed doing a March Madness–style seltzer taste test. The group even has its own lexicon: seltzer is “fizz”, unflavored varieties are “ghosts” and other clear sweetened beverages that are simply masquerading as seltzer are called “snakes”.Now Fizzing was launched about a year before seltzer became the “it” drink that it is today. There has already been much ink spilled over the beverage’s meteoric rise, but to this day, even the makers of seltzer find themselves stunned and confused by the sudden trendiness of their product. Chris Taylor, senior vice-president of Boylan Bottling Co and a member of Now Fizzing, chalks up seltzer’s trendiness to all the innovation going on within the space, paired with the drink’s positioning as a healthy alternative to juice or soda. Say what you will about the seltzer craze that has swept the nation, tweet your vitriolic La Croix memes, or lambast the millennials for their obsession with something you see as (literally) devoid of substance, people love this drink. But few people love it as much as the Fizz Fam does.I was late to the seltzer bandwagon. I really only began drinking it this past summer, a love that developed out of an unexpected appreciation for the majorly refreshing and full-flavored La Croix Pamplemousse (grapefruit). Then, the Polar winter seasonals (particularly Lime Ginger Mule) and Trader Joe’s Starfruit Seltzer clinched my identity as a seltzer enthusiast, and my love for the fizzy drink has bubbled over since I decided to stop drinking alcohol for an indeterminate period back in February. And that’s no coincidence: a significant number of Fizzers don’t drink alcohol. Sometimes Fizzers post seltzies to celebrate sobriety anniversaries.I was first introduced to Now Fizzing nearly two years ago by a former roommate, who is an active member. The first time she mentioned it, I probably scoffed pretty hard, already a little annoyed with the accumulating boxes of Polar Seltzer’ades being stored in our communal space. And I didn’t fully get it – not just the seltzer obsession, but the idea of a selzter community – until I actually joined the group years later, using a new Facebook account created explicitly for that purpose.Having abandoned most social media platforms for their negative effect on my mental health about six months prior, wading into the supportive world of Now Fizzing was more refreshing than an ice-cold glass bottle of Topo Chico with a twist of fresh lime.When Solomon first created the group, he had no idea what would eventually come of it. Like many others, his own personal journey into the world of fizz began when he decided to give up soda (a major vice of his that resulted from managing a bar as a nondrinker). After a weekend trip with friends to a dry campground, where they guzzled seltzer nonstop, Solomon decided to create the group as a play on Now Spinning, a Facebook group for vinyl enthusiasts to share what they’re listening to.Since then, “it’s grown beyond whatever I could have imagined,” Solomon tells me. At first, the group was composed of just his friends, but it grew exponentially, perhaps aided by the seltzer craze that seems to have first struck around 2015, a year after the group was created. While Now Fizzing primarily exists online, its members have met up in Brooklyn, Philadelphia and Seattle. Besides these planned events, Fizzers occasionally recognize each other offline thanks to the distinguishing seltzer-shaped pin and Now Fizzing T-shirt created by members and advertised within the group. And this past December, a bunch of Fizzers banded together to ship Solomon six boxes of Polar’s Mango Limeade to ensure he’d be hydrated during his annual 25-hour radio show.To find out what made this group so joyful, I began asking around. In addition to being an active member of Now Fizzing, Amanda Brennan is an expert on online communities and fandoms. Understanding the way these networks function and thrive is literally part of her job as the senior content insights manager at Tumblr. And she says that, without question, Now Fizzing is particularly special.“In the climate of internet where there’s a lot of bad things going on, it’s so great to have this group that feels very pure and very positive just really about this thing that we all love,” Brennan tells me.Her sentiments are shared by the 15 other members I spoke with, all of whom were exceptionally enthusiastic in their love of both “fizz” and the group. Time and time again, the same adjectives came up: fun, supportive, wholesome, safe, pure, positive, friendly and earnest.Aria, a Boston-based member of Fizz Fam, tells me a story about a time when she called her mom, who was in the grocery store, to ask her to scope out the scene for new Polar Seltzer’ade flavors. Confused, her mom repeated her request out loud in the aisle, catching the attention of a man who was looking for the same thing. Unable to find it, her mom hung up – only to call back a minute later to tell Aria that the nice man had found it in another aisle and returned to share the good news.Fizzers, it appears, are the type of strangers for whom kindness comes naturally. “I’m not sure if all seltzer drinkers are good people,” a Fizzer named Randi explained in an email she wrote me while drinking Polar Orange Vanilla, “but these members are.”While scrolling through the group for new seltzer flavors, I became so intrigued by its dynamics that I decided to reach out to my former colleague Annemarie Dooling, now the audience development manager at Vox Media. She has more than 10 years of experience moderating communities and is an expert on digital human behavior.After patiently listening to me drone on about the group, Dooling tells me that there are a few logical reasons for Now Fizzing’s success. One of these is the group’s relatively small size. Another is the coincidental timing of seltzer becoming a cultural phenomenon. But mostly, she says, it’s simply the members who set the tone with such a laser-focused passion.“People who like certain things and are kind of fanatical about them always find each other,” Dooling tells me, stressing that communities of interest (rather than those of circumstance or geography) are inherently special in nature.“It’s not always easy to find people who are interested in your interests,” Dooling says. “There is always a group of people that are your tribe, and it’s about finding out who your tribe is. Sometimes that tribe is in front of you, sometimes it’s virtual.”Ian and Tracy, a married couple living in the Pacific north-west, tell me that Now Fizzing is very much their tribe. They’re exceptionally regular posters within the group. Last year, they scheduled their annual summer trip to New York City to coincide with a Prospect Park meet-up planned by Solomon. They tried new flavors, met the people they had bonded with online, and had such a blast that they ended up making extra room in their packed itinerary to hang out with the new friends they’d just made.Over Skype, the three of us compare our favorite brands and flavors and discuss the larger seltzer culture. I find they’re exceptionally easy to talk to, with deep, genuine laughs and cool art hanging in their home. They talk excitedly about how they look forward to reconnecting with their seltzer friends IRL the next time they come out east.Tracy laughs and shakes her head at the sheer absurdity of the statement. But I can tell we both agree with what Ian just said. Positivity, compassion and enthusiasm can be powerful forces, especially on the internet, and especially in these isive and often toxic times. I realize that they’re the reason people join groups like this in the first place.At the end of the call, I ask Ian and Tracy if there’s any type of seltzer on the east coast that they can’t get where they live. After a stop at my favorite cafe, which stocks five different seltzer brands, I head to the post office.Allee Manning is a freelance journalist writing here and there.

It will be rebranded as the London and North Eastern Railway.The transport secretary, Chris Grayling, told the House of Commons that after a “finely balanced” assessment by civil servants, he had decided to appoint the “operator of last resort” – a group led by the firm Arup and under government control – to run the service, rather than allow Stagecoach and Virgin to continue under fresh terms.Grayling said: “The route continues to generate substantial returns for the government. It is not a failing railway ... However, Virgin and Stagecoach got their bids wrong.”He insisted taxpayers had not lost out, adding: “Only Vtec and its parent companies have made losses at this time ... We cannot expect companies to take on unlimited liabilities otherwise they would not bid for franchises.”Despite the firms now avoiding up to £2bn in premium payments after the failure of the franchise, Grayling said “it would not be reasonable to place conditions” on Stagecoach or Virgin bidding for further rail services. He said: “They have paid a high financial and reputational price.”Transport secretary Chris Grayling’s decision was surprising given his vehement opposition to public control of rail. But he said the move was partly to expedite the planned east coast partnership, which would see a contract re-let to a private firm in 2020. However, several train companies – such as South Western, TransPennine Express and Greater Anglia – face similar struggles to Stagecoach and Virgin after overbidding for franchises and events may yet force his hand again.\u0026nbspIt’s not the plan, but it’s possible. The pressure to avoid any further franchise collapse – or to see Stagecoach-Virgin emerge as operators again, with a diminishing market of bidders – could see the government struggle to get a new operator in place.\u0026nbspSo who will now run the trains?Control will pass in June to the “operator of last resort” – an Arup-led group contracted on the government’s behalf. The train service will be rebranded London North Eastern Railway.What will the impact be for passengers?In the short term, little or none. New British-assembled Hitachi trains are already on order, paid for by the government.\u0026nbspHow much will it cost the public?The Department for Transport assessment was that either immediate option, a fresh Virgin Trains contract or direct control, was broadly similar in cost. Analysis by rail regulators in 2013 found East Coast required less subsidy than any other line when in public hands, while it delivered more than £1bn to the Treasury. Stagecoach promised vastly more, £3.3bn by 2023, but found it impossible to pay up.However, the shadow transport secretary, Andy McDonald, said it was “absolutely ludicrous” to not place conditions on Virgin-Stagecoach’s bidding passport. He accused the government of having “cynically reprivatised” the line on the eve of the 2015 election, adding: “We’ve had bailout after bailout ... Rail companies win, passengers and taxpayers lose. Franchising remains at the heart of the alleged partnerships. No amount of tinkering can solve the failings of a broken privatised system where the public takes the risk and the companies take the profit – aided and abetted by the transport secretary.” The chair of the transport select committee, Lilian Greenwood, said the previous transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin, had told the Commons in November 2014 that the promised £3.3bn for the taxpayer was robust and had been subjected to rigorous, independent scrutiny. “If Virgin-Stagecoach got their figures wrong, so did the government,” said Greenwood. She said the committee would be examining the latest failure.Greenwood asked Grayling in the Commons: “What does this decision today mean for other franchises which we know are struggling to meet their obligations?” He replied that there was no other franchise in the same position. However, industry analysts widely believe that First Group overbid for TransPennine Express, and Abellio for Greater Anglia, while a sharp drop in passenger numbers has also left First potentially exposed to losses on its South Western franchise. Labour has also questioned the future of Arriva’s Northern Rail franchise, whose service was the subject of renewed attack by Manchester’s mayor Andy Burnham on Wednesday. Grayling announced in November that the East Coast franchise would be terminated three years early in 2020, allowing the operators to avoid up to £2bn in payments until 2023. Lower passenger numbers and revenue than forecast have seen Stagecoach losing around £200m on the franchise to date.Lord Adonis, who resigned as the chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission in protest at what he called the bailout of the train firms at taxpayers’ expense, said Wednesday’s decision was “vindication” of his criticisms, and that Grayling had now done the right thing. Stagecoach’s chief executive, Martin Griffiths, said the firm was “surprised and disappointed” by the decision. He said in the last three years, Vtec had “attracted more passengers, greatly increased investment, achieved industry-leading customer satisfaction and made significant payments to the taxpayer to reinvest in public services”.The collapse of the franchise marks the third time in a decade that a private train operator has failed to see out its contract on the east coast mainline, which was renationalised between 2009 and 2015.Rail unions urged Grayling to keep the line in state hands. The RMT’s general secretary, Mick Cash, said: “This is the second time that the government have called upon the public sector to launch a rescue operation on the east coast and instead of being a temporary arrangement Chris Grayling should listen to his staff and the public and make it permanent.” Grayling said he had chosen to bring in the operator of last resort to expedite his plans to introduce a partnership model for the east coast railway from 2020, where a single team including Network Rail and a private train operator would take decisions on both track and trains on the route."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a6f6653b0e1f47f54eeafc06bb2124a99fa0959/124_153_5052_3032/master/5052.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b5f6887086630087016f145427b01be5","title":"from royal table to empty fields asparagus farmer faces bust over brexit","story":"His veg may be served at royal wedding, but Andy Allen says he needs migrant workers An asparagus farmer whose produce looks set to be served at Saturday’s royal wedding has warned he faces going bust because of Brexit.Kensington Palace dropped a heavy hint that the 600 guests will be offered asparagus from Andy Allen’s Norfolk farm when it published pictures of his fronds being prepared by the royal kitchens. Royal protocol prevents Allen from confirming his Portwood Asparagus farm has been chosen but he said: “We are certainly in the frame and I do know there will be a story to tell on Monday.”Supplying the royal kitchens provides a huge boost to Allen’s business but he warns it will not help him plug the gap in migrant workers he needs to stay afloat after the the UK leaves the European Union.Speaking to the , he said: “This is the best PR I could ever have had to be able to supply the royal kitchens and yet will I be able to continue to supply them? It is a huge privilege to be chosen, but it doesn’t help because who is going to pick the bloody stuff?“We are completely reliant on seasonal migrant workers. If we can’t get that labour I’ll have to pack up. There is not the technology to pick asparagus with robots.”Allen’s fears highlight the plight of many fruit and vegetable growers who rely on the EU’s free movement rules to find cheap labour for seasonal jobs shunned by British workers.Allen employs almost 120 EU citizens, predominantly from Romania and Bulgaria. He said he was already struggling to recruit workers and fears the supply will dry up completely after Brexit. Relatively high employment around Allen’s farm near Attleborough means he cannot attract local people to work at the minimum wage for the three months of the asparagus season. “There’s a large poultry industry in Attleborough so that sucks up any excess labour. People want jobs all year round and we just require them for three months.”Allen has lobbied the government for a solution but he has been unimpressed so far by the response: “I have had meetings with ministers which indicate they are floundering. They don’t blinking well know what to do. And we are all hanging on by our fingernails waiting for a decision on this. We don’t care if it comes from the rest of the world or the EU, we just need a supply of labour.” He added: “I know I sound like a whingeing farmer making too much of this, but this is reality and politicians really haven’t got a handle on it.” Allen is so concerned about finding workers next year that he has restricted planting on a crop that takes three years to grow. He also regrets some of his recent planting. “If I knew we were going to vote for Brexit and the whole thing was going to into uncertainty would I have done this? No.“I’m certain that from now on there are going to be big shortages – because migrant workers are looking at Britain and thinking what’s going to happen and going to mainland Europe instead.” Allen’s workers are sourced by the migrant labour charity Concordia, which supplies about 10,000 mostly EU workers to 200 farms. Its chief executive, Stephanie Maurel, said interest in working in the UK has already “dropped off dramatically” because of the uncertainty about Brexit and the decrease in the value of the pound. One of her farm customers has already gone out of business.She proposed to pilot a seasonal workers scheme involving students from Ukraine. It was rejected earlier this month by the Home Office. “It is so sad: we have people who are keen to come farmers who are desperate to have people pick their crops, and we just can’t bridge that gap and it is going to costs thousands in livelihoods.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1a935b9e3ccfe630c722fe23aba461969cadf493/0_186_5568_3341/master/5568.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea01a17137437a0b63d2f9dcc73c9789","title":"no new cameras on irish border after brexit karen bradley says","story":"Northern Ireland secretary’s comments appear to cast doubt on ‘max fac’ customs proposalThere will be no new cameras on the border on the island of Ireland after Brexit, the Northern Ireland secretary, Karen Bradley, has said, warning that any physical checks on the border could be targets for criminal activity.However, she said physical infrastructure could be needed away from the border to implement whatever customs deal is struck in the Brexit negotiations.Bradley appeared to cast doubt over how the government could implement one of the two post-Brexit customs arrangements currently under consideration, the “max fac” model, where automated technology and trusted trader schemes would be used to police the border.“We are committed to no new physical infrastructure at the border, no new checks or controls at the border,” Bradley told MPs at the European scrutiny select committee.A customs union is an agreement by a group of countries, such as the EU, to all apply the same tariffs on imported goods from the rest of the world and, typically, eliminate them entirely for trade within the group. By doing this, they can help avoid the need for costly and time-consuming customs checks during trade between members of the union. Asian shipping containers arriving at Felixstowe or Rotterdam, for example, need only pass through customs once before their contents head to markets all over\u0026nbspEurope. Lorries passing between Dover and Calais avoid delay entirely.Customs are not the only checks that count – imports are also scrutinised for conformity with trading standards regulations and security and immigration purposes – but they do play an important role in determining how much friction there is at the border. A strict customs regime at Dover or between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland would lead to delays that will be costly for business and disruptive for travellers. Just-in-time supply chains in industries such as car making could suffer. An Irish peace process built around the principle of entirely unfettered travel between north and south could be jeopardised.However, asked if she considered it a “disgrace” to suggest there would be a return to violence because of Brexit, she explained that the border had 270 crossings, some of them unmarked roads and rural lanes.“We have to be clear why having new physical infrastructure would be a problem at the border and it is the security situation,” she told MPs.But she added that it might be elsewhere: “We have to be very careful when we look at the arrangements and the suggestions that would be in place as to how we would police it how we would manage the infrastructure needed, should infrastructure be needed at some point, at some place, in order to achieve the aims of the customs arrangements.”Bradley, a close ally of Theresa May, is known to favour the other option being considered by ministers, known as the new customs partnership, in which the UK would collect taxes on behalf of the EU.“There’s no doubt that new customs partnership, the hybrid model, makes the Northern Irish border easier. It is resolved in an easier way than maximum facilitation,” she said.However, Bradley said there were “defects” with both options. “I have an open mind and I want to drill down ... to see if it is possible to make either option work.” Bradley was repeatedly challenged by two prominent Eurosceptics on the committee, its chair, Sir Bill Cash, and the Labour MP Kate Hoey, on whether cameras could constitute infrastructure.Cash said he believed concerns about the border were “deliberately stoked up to preclude a solution” and that cameras were already present and policed effectively.Bradley said she could not speculate where any new infrastructure might be, if not at the border,o but acknowledged new technological solutions to undertake any new border checks might require additional policing.Bradley was asked by Hoey if she could rule out a situation where the government was forced to accept the backstop agreed at the December European council, as part of the withdrawal agreement.The agreement says that unless a solution is found to the border issue, the UK will “maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and customs union”. Bradley said the backstop option was “not where anybody wants to be”.Quizzed by Labour’s Darren Jones, Bradley said customs was a small part of finding a solution to issue of the Irish border, given rules on plants and animal checks, are part of the single market, not the customs union. “Let’s not see the discussion about customs, which is only a very small part of the overall relationship, out of context,” she said. “We have to recognise the unique circumstances of Northern Ireland, this will be the only land border with the EU where the remaining part of the country does not have a land border with Northern Ireland. That’s why unique solutions are needed.”Jones, a supporter of the second referendum campaign People’s Vote, who quizzed Bradley at the proposal, said the lack of detail was concerning. “It’s remarkable that the government hasn’t made a single proposal on how it will deal with any single market border checks after Brexit, including on food and animal products,” he said.“Time is quickly running out, and we will have no implementation period without resolving the Northern Ireland border question. This whole fiasco is bordering on incompetence.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aea9b65aed24f0531fa3b9b477eac5e497a6d89a/105_0_3895_2336/master/3895.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf45ff60a0bf2f880ed87802323c1333","title":"pmqs verdict corbyn is starting to make it look easy","story":"For the second week in a row, on a subject that for months he avoided, the Labour leader knocked the PM all over the placeBoth Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn began by offering congratulations to Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on their impending marriage, and thanks to the police officers – in the public gallery – who apprehended the murderer of MP Jo Cox.Corbyn turned next to Brexit, asking when the prime minister said she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?May said her policy was to leave the customs union, having as frictionless trade as possible, no hard border in Ireland and an independent trade policy. She said a shadow minister in the Lords had voted for a second referendum, and a shadow aid minister tweeted in favour of one. Would Corbyn rule it out?The Labour leader said there had been no progress in cabinet for five months. May said some people wanted the UK to forget about having an independent trade policy. And some said: don’t worry about the Irish border. Neither of those positions was a position of the government. There will be a white paper, she said.Corbyn said the PM’s own position was not supported by the cabinet, quoting Rolls-Royce, Ford and Vauxhall all warning about the future of trade. Michael Gove said this week there were question marks over the PM’s customs model. But at least he did not call it crazy, as Boris Johnson did. If May can’t persuade her cabinet, then how can she persuade the EU?May’s retort was that Corbyn said there wouldn’t be a deal before December. But there was.There are record numbers of people on zero-hour contracts, Corbyn went on, and record numbers of people in poverty. He said the Dutch have already started training new customs officers. How many HMRC extra staff have been recruited to deal with Brexit?Corbyn pointed out he asked about extra HMRC staff. The Dutch government is better prepared. The government is not ready. If the government can’t negotiate a good deal, why won’t it step aside and make way for a party that will?Corbyn is starting to make it look easy. It isn’t easy, of course (winning PMQs is about the hardest task for an opposition leader), and Corbyn isn’t a natural as a parliamentary performer, but for the second week in a row, on a subject that for months he avoided at all costs, he managed to knock May all over the place.He was also more versatile than usual, combining real humour (ie, a joke that actually made people laugh, not synthetic, parliamentary humour – the laughter after his first question went on so long they will probably have to edit it out in the radio bulletins), deadly specifics (the question about HMRC staff), good attack quotes (the ones from car manufacturers), but also questions that accurately and harshly summed up the government’s failings (primarily, the absence of a Brexit negotiating position only five months before the deal is supposed to be completed).Tories who have been withering about Corbyn’s abilities should start asking themselves what it is about the government’s record that has made a Brexit PMQs such a doddle for him. May did her best to retaliate, but attacking Labour over the EU referendum sounded irrelevant and, even though she has a point about the contradictions in Labour’s Brexit policy, it is a second order issue compared with the problems with her own position.Her claim that Labour said wrongly there would never be a deal before December is a standard bit of Downing Street spin but I’m not sure it has any basis in fact (I can’t recall anyone saying on the record there would be no December deal – only a few off-the-record comments about how it looked 5050).About the only life-raft left for May was to cling to the buoyant employment figures. But, with the growth rate looking dismal, as Corbyn pointed out, that wasn’t particularly effective either.When the prime minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted ‘as little friction as possible’, was she talking about EU trade or the next cabinet meeting?Theresa May’s response to Corbyn’s claim of unreadiness:His position was that we should have triggered article 50 immediately after the referendum, with no work having been done in preparation for the negotiations … And what would that have led to? … They’d have sold Britain out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c2f031ce40f22fe26bf5530859d87e31c4c49f26/0_161_4928_2957/master/4928.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7013b1ae24438383dc66cfaa1eb8385b","title":"readytogo rift timing indyref2 scottish independence yes movement","story":"While some Scottish independence activists warn against an early poll, others say a lengthy delay could pose an even bigger threatAs the three candidates vying to replace Angus Robertson as Scottish National party deputy leader appear at crowded hustings events across the country, one question is dominating the debate: when should the party leader and first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, call another independence referendum?It’s a question made all the more acute after the Scottish parliament set itself on a constitutional collision course with Westminster on Tuesday afternoon, when it voted decisively to reject the UK government’s EU withdrawal bill. If Theresa May imposes the bill’s post-Brexit power-sharing plans on Scotland, overturning 20 years of precedent, then Sturgeon’s calls for a second independence referendum are unarguably bolstered. But polling consistently shows a majority across the country opposed both to independence and to holding another vote in the near future.While Scotland’s constitutional ide remains entrenched, a more recent breach has emerged among independence activists over the timing of a second referendum. In recent months, there have been public skirmishes about whether Sturgeon should deploy the mandate for a new referendum that she claims from the 2016 Holyrood elections before the parliamentary term ends in 2021, or delay until an unarguable economic case for independence has been built and public opinion is more favourable.With two out of three deputy leadership candidates calling for a vote before 2021, the ballot – the results of which will be announced at the SNP conference next month – is expected to provide a clear indication of where the party’s mass membership of more than 118,000 stands on this critical question, and how willing they will be to wait if the party leadership dismisses their growing sense of urgency.This was evident this month when more than 40,000 supporters of Scottish independence thronged the streets of Glasgow, brandishing saltires, “Still Yes” placards and the occasional unicorn, in the largest public demonstration in the city since the rally against the Iraq war in 2003. The organiser of the march, All Under One Banner, was calling for a second vote to be held before 2021, which marks the end of the Brexit transition period and the next Holyrood elections.Three years and eight months after Scotland’s momentous referendum, the appetite for energetic displays of solidarity like this one is undiminished among independence supporters. All three deputy leadership candidates attended and continue to answer questions about referendum timing at local hustings. Julie Hepburn, a favourite among activists, wants a second vote “at the earliest possible opportunity” councillor Chris McEleny is hoping for another referendum within 18 months, while Keith Brown, cabinet secretary for the economy, jobs and fair work and the most senior contender, is more circumspect, stressing the importance of campaign readiness whenever another referendum called.But, in contrast to the marchers’ #readytogo hashtag, a number of senior SNP figures have cautioned against an early poll. When Pete Wishart, the SNP’s longest-serving MP, did so last month, his pragmatism was met with outrage in some quarters of the yes movement, who denounced him on social media as “an Etonian boot-licker”.“There’s no question that we are at a turning point in the yes movement,” says Robin McAlpine, the head of Scotland’s only grassroots-funded thinktank, Common Weal, and veteran independence campaigner. “The fractiousness was always coming. There’s no more dangerous move than marching your troops back down the hill again, because they are fizzing with adrenalin and have nowhere to put it.”Sturgeon’s call in March 2017 for a second independence referendum before the start of the Brexit transition resulted in an unexpectedly fierce backlash at the general election in June. With about one-third of SNP voters backing Brexit in 2016, even those in favour of independence questioned the wisdom of linking Scotland’s future so closely to the EU. “Meanwhile, the membership are getting more restless. The assumption that the SNP have a secret plan that is so brilliant they don’t want to reveal it is in decline, and the sense that the leadership are actually a bit directionless is growing.”A more complex picture emerges from local yes groups, many of which continue to organise within their communities regardless of top-tier politicking.Among the grassroots activists that the  has spoken to, the preference remains for Sturgeon to exercise her mandate in this parliamentary term.Yes Linton – based in the Westminster constituency of the Scottish secretary, David Mundell – is one of the newest groups, having formed in January. Its founding member, Ian Reid, says: “People have a real political and strategic intelligence. The next referendum is discussed, but it’s not the only show in town.”“There are those who like the marches and the demos but on the whole we believe we are still in a preparatory phase and it is hard work and intelligent planning that matter.”Activists are also united in their determination to educate themselves in the arguments necessary to win over no voters, accessing a vast network of sympathetic experts who are willing to give talks at local meetings, from pro-independence organisations that have continued post-referendum, such as Commonweal, Business for Scotland or Nordic Horizons. Another Scotland-wide organisation that has reinvented itself as a broader campaign group is Women for Independence. With 55 affiliated groups, WFI has successfully opposed the building of a women’s super-prison, founded uniform banks for families struggling to clothe their children, and conducted groundbreaking research on period poverty.Jonathan Shafi, co-founder of the left-aligned Radical Independence Campaign, expects there will be “a significant demoralisation” if there is no second referendum within the next few years.McAlpine believes the yes movement faces another threat with more long-lasting consequences than a public split over the timing of another referendum.“The bigger risk is drift: when it becomes clear that Sturgeon is not calling another referendum the small risk is a screaming fit, and then the media will eviscerate us for being split. But the bigger risk is that everyone will find new things to do. You can only heal wounds when the people are still in the room.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b9b891d65766e563bd0c47db63ad6b3ee79e741b/120_0_2380_1428/master/2380.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b54dd5c04ad1af3d73fa22a3831ec6cc","title":"vote leave beleave datasets facebook brexit campaign","story":"Revelation raises new questions in ongoing investigation into Brexit campaign groupsTwo Brexit campaign groups under investigation for potential collusion during the EU referendum used identical datasets to target potential adverts at Facebook users.Vote Leave, the lead campaigner for a Brexit vote, and BeLeave, a campaign group run by an activist named Darren Grimes, used identical data to target audiences, according to a letter from Facebook to the Electoral Commission that raises new questions about potential coordination between the two groups.Vote Leave spent millions of pounds buying targeted online advertising through AggregateIQ during the referendum campaign, pushing up against its strict £7m spending limit. However, in the closing days of the campaign, Vote Leave donated £625,000 to Grimes, who then also spent the money with AggregateIQ. At that time Grimes was regularly seen volunteering in the Vote Leave office. Both Vote Leave and Grimes have insisted that there was no coordination between the campaigns on how the money was spent, which could potentially have broken electoral law. The new letter was sent from Facebook to the Electoral Commission as part of its ongoing investigation into potential breaches of campaign finance rules and was published by the parliamentary committee investigating fake news. It reveals that Vote Leave and BeLeave appear to have used three identical datasets during the referendum campaign to locate potential recipients of targeted pro-Brexit Facebook adverts.“They were the exact same audiences,” said Facebook’s Gareth Lambe, who also revealed that $2m (£1.5m) of AggregateIQ’s entire $3.5m Facebook advertising spend over the last four years appeared to be associated with the EU referendum.In addition to Vote Leave and BeLeave, AggregateIQ ran adverts for the Democratic Unionist party’s pro-Brexit campaign, as well as another campaign group called Veterans for Britain.The letter describes three different types of dataset that advertisers can use to reach potential audiences on Facebook:“Our investigations to date have found there was one data file custom audience, one website custom audience, and one lookalike audience that were used to select targeting criteria for potential ads during this period by both the Vote Leave and BeLeave pages,” said Facebook.The first audience was called “50million_remains”, the second was a lookalike audience, and the third was a website custom audience called “Vote Leave instapage submissions”, which according to Facebook was based on visitors to Vote Leave’s website.BeLeave created 16 adverts using one or more of the three common audiences on 15 June 2016, but did not ultimately run any of the adverts. Vote Leave created 2,189 adverts based on the same common audiences, and ran about half of them.Vote Leave, Grimes and Facebook did not respond to requests for comment prior to publication. The Electoral Commission declined to comment, citing its ongoing investigations.Separately, it was reported on Tuesday that the US Department of Justice and FBI were investigating Cambridge Analytica, the data firm revealed to have obtained millions of Facebook data profiles.The New York Times said that prosecutors had sought to question former employees and banks as part of the early stages of an investigation into the firm and “associated US persons”.

Nearly 500 people with dementia volunteered to join the trial, and of those 329 were assigned to a serious physical fitness regime, while 165 had usual care. Those allocated to four months of physical exercise, which was personalised according to their fitness, did two gym sessions a week lasting 60 to 90 minutes, involving exercise such as cycling on static bikes and using dumb bells and weight belts. They were also asked to do a further hour a week at home.The study was approved and funded by the National Institute for Health Research, which tests interventions that might be of use to the NHS. But the researchers found that “this level of specialist exercise doesn’t work”, Lamb said.The results showed, in fact, that those who carried out the exercise programme had worse cognitive scores – a measurement of their thinking and rationalising abilities – than those who did not. It made them physically fitter, which was helpful in their daily life, but it did not slow down the progress of the disease.That should not stop people with dementia going for walks, swimming or doing other sorts of gentle activities, said Lamb. “We don’t want to alarm members of the public with dementia and their families. We used a very specialised exercise programme. We know that gentle exercise is good for you. We don’t want people to stop what they are doing,” she said.“But if you think of exercise as a drug, it is certainly not worth the NHS investing in that type of treatment for people.”Dr Brendon Stubbs, research physiotherapist at King’s College London, said the results are enormously important for people with dementia and the NHS. “The search for effective lifestyle interventions that can delay cognitive decline in dementia must continue,” he said. Rob Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at UCL, said the negative results were also important. “Although this was only a tiny worsening in cognitive functioning that wouldn’t have been noticeable in an inidual patient, it was statistically significantly different from the outcome seen in those who didn’t exercise. “Despite its small size, I am sure that – had this been instead an improvement in cognitive functioning with exercise – we would all have been excited about finding something positive in the, so far, depressing fight against dementia. On this basis, I don’t think we should ignore the possibility that exercise might actually be slightly harmful to people with dementia.”“Our study confirms that the risk of dementia is reduced among well-off older people compared with those who have fewer economic resources,” said Professor Andrew Steptoe, senior author of the study. “Many factors could be involved. Differences in healthy lifestyle and medical risk factors are relevant. It may also be that better off people have greater social and cultural opportunities that allow them to remain actively engaged with the world.”Neither education nor physical health accounted for the results, said Dr Sara Imarisio, Head of Research at Alzheimer’s Research UK. “Socioeconomic status is closely intertwined with many different aspects of lifestyle, so unpicking the underlying cause of the relationship highlighted by this research is extremely difficult,” she said.“The findings suggest that people from economically disadvantaged backgrounds may benefit most from advice about how to reduce dementia risk, and this is something that the health service, charities, and government agencies should consider in future public health campaigns.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9052cb942f6a272cfd0c71084fea75520dd45a21/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65797b557a1ee5e11f5397538b5dd8bd","title":"councils underpaying guardians and not offering full support","story":"Ombudsman finds local authorities not offering full help to relatives who become legal parents to children Some local authorities routinely flout the law by failing to provide appropriate levels of financial support to carers who “do the right thing” by becoming legal parents to child relatives, the local government watchdog has said.Inquiries by the Local Government and Social Care Ombudsman revealed that councils were paying special s at less than the legal rate, often incorrectly calculating allowances, then changing and cutting them without consultation.After one case investigated by the ombudsman, a local authority agreed to make backdated payments to more than 170 carers after systematically and unlawfully underpaying them over a six-year period, despite being alerted early on to their error.Campaigners, who say the chaotic and inconsistent nature of state support too often leaves carers in poverty, welcomed the report and called on ministers to take action to ensure that councils were able to ensure that special s were fairly and consistently treated.“Special s are relatives and friends who have done the right thing by children who would otherwise be in care system … Too often local authorities ride roughshod over their and the children’s needs, taking advantage of these carers’ good nature and lack of knowledge of the system,” said Cathy Ashley, chief executive of Family Rights Group.The ombudsman, Michael King, said: “It is imperative that these children and their s get the right support available to them – and without having to fight the system to get what they are entitled to.”Special ship orders are an alternative to foster care and adoption, under which children unable to be looked after by their birth parents are legally put into the care of grandparents, older siblings or friends, often known as “kinship carers”. Around 200,000 children in the UK are looked after in this way.Councils are expected to help meet the needs of special s, including providing financial support, counselling and advice. They are supposed to pay means-tested allowances to carers in line with fostering fees, and meet any extra costs relating to the special needs of the cared-for child.However, the ombudsman’s report, based on 322 detailed investigations into complaints during 2017-18, two-thirds of which were upheld, has confirmed that too often councils were not only underpaying carers, but were failing to provide promised support and giving inaccurate advice.The council subsequently tried to limit the backdated payments to 2016, but the ombudsman successfully insisted that they be backdated to November 2013, saying that it was impossible that it could not have known of the error after this date. A spokesperson for the council said: “We have fully revised the way in which we calculate allowances and are writing to all special s to explain the changes that we have made in light of the findings of the ombudsman.”Last month the government scrapped its policy of withholding benefits from kinship carers who fall foul of the two-child limit, weeks after a judge declared it to be “perverse and unlawful”.Lucy Peake, chief executive at the charity Grandparents Plus, said: “We know special s across the country face a postcode lottery when it comes to trying to get support from local authorities, as well as opaque policies and huge variation in practice.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d0d3d7cf4808b9db05212ec86aba5f62f89dfbf4/755_157_3178_1906/master/3178.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a420aa939b920978d4f37d98ff31334","title":"england captain owen farrell south africa tour saracens","story":"• ‘The key is to be ready for anything,’ says tour captain• Saracens play-off with Wasps still uppermost in Farrell’s mindOwen Farrell is relishing the prospect of England’s summer trip to South Africa. The tour captain took time out of Saracens’ preparations for Saturday’s Premiership play-off against Wasps to speak for the first time since his appointment.“South Africa is a brilliant tour, a brilliant challenge,” he said of the land that hosted his first England trip, in 2012. “This tour is one we’re going to enjoy. They are a good team that is under new coaching, so we probably don’t know what we’re going to get. The key is to be ready for anything.”Farrell has captained England before but this will be the first time he has led a camp. The appointment seems a natural one. It is not hard to imagine it becoming permanent. Nevertheless, he inherits an unfamiliar run of three consecutive defeats, while Eddie Jones muses, as he did last week, on the lack of unity he sensed developing in England’s disappointing Six Nations campaign.It falls to Farrell to lend new direction, should that be required. Jones rang to tell him of the “massive honour” but they appear not to have discussed the coach’s other concerns.“Lack of unity?” said Farrell, when asked to consider Jones’s assessment of England’s Six Nations, and he paused for a few seconds to gather his thoughts. “I’ll have to see what is being talked about. I can’t really say. I could sit here talking about England but I haven’t thought about it too much yet. I don’t want to start just blabbing. I’ve been concentrating, especially this week, on what’s in front of us.”If England are searching for a way out of the sudden slump they find themselves in, after prolonged and unparalleled success, they could do worse than study the example set by Saracens this season. Their run of seven consecutive defeats in all competitions, either side of Christmas, did not appear to trouble them. They finished the regular season having scored more points than any club since 1999, when the Premiership was a 14-team affair, and with the best points differential ever.“I thought it was a brilliant period for us. We would be a lot worse off if we hadn’t had it,” said Farrell of the seven consecutive defeats. “ It was a bit unfamiliar but we did a lot of figuring out. We have definitely come out the other side the better for it.”England will hope to apply a similar aptitude for problem solving on the tour to South Africa this summer. Farrell may not be thinking about this one just yet, but the puzzles requiring his attention are set to continue well after the end of May.Meanwhile, three men have been fined after they hurled foul-mouthed abuse at Jones the day after Scotland’s Calcutta Cup win in February.Footage released online showed the group approaching the 58-year-old for a photograph as he left Manchester Oxford Road railway station to catch a waiting car.Richie Cleeton, 22, Connor Inglis, 25, and Brett Grant, 23, from Edinburgh, all pleaded guilty to a public order offence of using threatening abusive words and behaviour, or disorderly behaviour, likely to cause harassment, alarm or distress.Sentencing the trio at Manchester magistrates’ court, chair of the bench Joe Bangudu said: “This was a short-lived but disgraceful incident. Your language, although described by your defence as industrial, we think was vile and therefore unacceptable directed to anybody. The location where you chose to display your drunken behaviour was in a public vicinity, with not just Mr Jones in that proximity.“No one should ever have to put up with such language and behaviour. We have not seen any sort of remorse by you. That is a concern.”Cleeton, of Carrick Knowe Avenue, was fined £120, Inglis, of Cornhill Terrace, received a fine of £105 and Grant, of Drum Crescent, was given a financial penalty of £140. All three were also ordered to pay court costs of £115 each.Mr Bangudu said Grant had prolonged the behaviour and language by opening the car door once Mr Jones was inside."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7a8f400a897c5f2b8ca707d1c346c597ad3085e3/0_292_3782_2268/master/3782.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ae601338e36bd04d9240e0e813f309c","title":"unexploded ordnances review barbican london","story":"Barbican, LondonThis two-hander draws the audience right into the action in a surreal yet moving look at mortalityWe all know we will die.

They sound the sirens in this jokey but often moving examination of the traces we leave, the futures we fail to make and the buried regrets that lurk like unexploded bombs.

In the movie, the president sets up a war room, but here Shaw and Weaver set up a situation room. They invite the oldest members of the audience on to the stage to share their dreams, worries and collective experiences, in the hope of avoiding disaster and imagining the future we want for ourselves and our children’s children.

Because users must now confirm their social security number and submit their US driver’s license or passport, millions of undocumented people in America are also no longer able to post political ads.“This is Facebook telling undocumented people you’re not allowed to participate in this part of the political process,” said Justino Mora, co-founder of advocacy group UndocuMedia and an undocumented immigrant currently protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program. “They are essentially banning a certain political view from being expressed … They are going to allow anti-immigrant xenophobes and racists to have more power.” The controversy over the new ad vetting system highlights the complex policy challenges facing Facebook and the potential unintended consequences of new restrictions as the company grapples with its immense power and influence in elections. The effect of the new policy, first reported by Vice News, also illustrates the ways in which undocumented people continue to be excluded from politics and democracy in the US, a problem that social media sites can amplify.Rights groups argued this week that Facebook has an obligation to allow ads from undocumented people, with some pointing to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stated support for Daca recipients. Jess Morales Rocketto, political director at the National Domestic Workers Alliance, said Facebook had been critical to educate immigrants about their rights and organize against harmful campaigns – and that many undocumented activists were buying and designing ads to support their efforts: “This will make it extremely difficult for them to do their jobs.” A Facebook spokesperson said the new authorization system was designed to increase transparency, but added in an email: “We fully understand that the process, as currently designed, presents challenges for some groups and we’re exploring solutions now to address those concerns.”Under federal regulations, undocumented people are prohibited from donating directly to candidates, but some have argued that Facebook is going a step further by blocking this population from buying ads related to “national issues of public importance”, which the company says includes immigration. “This has the markings of a decision made in a room with a handful of executives who may not have fully thought through the implications,” said Brendan Fischer, of the Campaign Legal Center. “That’s the distinction between public policy crafted by democratic institutions and policy crafted by private corporations.”Many of the Russia-backed ads targeted “issues”, often aiming to sow ision on topics like race and immigration. Still, Fischer said, Facebook could find an alternative way to verify undocumented activists and allow them to promote issues. Morales Rocketto suggested Facebook partner with a trusted organization to authorize people’s identities.Under the current rules, Mora could probably still buy ads since he has a social security number from Daca and a driver’s license in California, which allows undocumented people to get IDs. But given the uncertain future of Daca, which has consistently faced threats under Trump, some fear they could lose their protections and thus lose their ability to advocate on Facebook at a crucial moment.Millions of undocumented immigrants without Daca or who lack licenses are immediately affected by the new policy.“It’s really important to have a platform that reaches people to let them know they are not alone,” said Melody Klingenfuss, a 24-year-old undocumented activist with the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles (Chirla), a group with a large undocumented staff. “Facebook must continue to allow undocumented folks in the United States to participate in the flow of ideas. Mr Zuckerberg must understand the power of his platform.”Chirla regularly posts Facebook ads, said communications director Jorge-Mario Cabrera, adding: “I believe this may even go to court if folks feel their first amendment rights are curtailed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/be6e4ac69f6c85fc9d6009b849d32d2910676936/7_317_6329_3797/master/6329.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e4a934298b5945701819af0e7499a19","title":"oneplus 6 smartphone launch all glass design big screen notch","story":"Chinese company launches flagship smartphone complete with headphone jack, but iPhone X-style notch won’t please everyone With the new OnePlus 6 the Chinese upstart smartphone manufacturer wants to steal people away from Apple, offering an iPhone X-like smartphone complete with “notch” for less than half the price.The new smartphone has a large 6.28in screen squeezed into a body the same size as last year’s OnePlus 5, which had a smaller 5.5in screen, and bigger still than the OnePlus 5T’s 6in screen.Launched at an event in London on Wednesday, the OnePlus 6 comes equipped with the latest top-of-the-range Snapdragon 845 processor from Qualcomm, at least 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage, plus the latest version of Android 8.1 Oreo.The OnePlus 6 is the company’s first flagship phone with glass on the front and back, replacing last year’s curved aluminium with various finishes of curved glass. The phone still has a headphone jack, unlike the majority of the current premium smartphones, and is partially water resistant – although OnePlus has not gained an IP rating for the device as rivals have.The full HD+ AMOLED screen has a cut out at the top containing a speaker, sensors and a 16-megapixel selfie camera that is used for facial recognition, which OnePlus claims is one of the fastest on the market, using over 100 identifiers for security.Ben Wood, head of research at CCS Insight, said: “It looks like 2018 is most definitely the “year of the notch” when it comes to premium smartphones. Once again, Apple has emerged as the trendsetter with regards to smartphone design, but my own personal view is that its facial recognition is still the benchmark to beat despite bold claims by rivals.”A new dual camera system with optical image stabilisation hopes to keep pace with rivals, placed vertically on the back and offering better low-light shots and portrait mode. Below the camera is a rear oval-shaped fingerprint scanner.The OnePlus 6 runs the company’s modified version of Android called OxygenOS, which it says will stay as fast on day 365 as it does on day one out of the box – a common criticism of Android smartphones is that they slow down over time. The company claims the OnePlus 6 will therefore have “no lag of any kind”.The OnePlus 6 is also one of a small collection of smartphones eligible for the Android 9 P beta test, which was recently made available for Google’s Pixel devices. The hope is that OnePlus will be able deliver rapid updates, addressing another pain point for Android smartphones, which can wait up to 12 months for major software updates.The new phone supports two sim cards at once, and also has OnePlus’s Dash Charge fast charging system, which the company says will give the phone a day’s worth of battery in just 30 minutes.For Wood, OnePlus has ticked enough boxes to keep its dedicated followers happy, using the best technology available within the sub-£500 price boundary. But differentiating it against competitors will remain difficult.“The bigger challenge of making the new phone stand out from rivals is more problematic,” said Wood. “For all smartphone makers this is harder than ever before as devices look more similar than ever.”The OnePlus 6 will be available from 22 May starting at £469 ($529) with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage in a gloss “mirror” black colour, with a matt “midnight” black costing £519 with more memory and storage, and a “silk” white colour available on 5 June. The phone will be available direct from OnePlus or through O2 in the UK."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d78f6f92879f90c0ade10b9c168f44e25356606a/0_488_1890_1134/master/1890.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=49f9a66a33d8a8ff1f2ace77200e6235","title":"what makes a woman review a show that asked extraordinarily complex questions","story":"Trans activist Munroe Bergdorf engaged with focus groups and radical feminists, and while many pertinent issues were raised, they weren’t all fully engaged withA nurse wipes a patient’s tears from her face, the general anaesthetic takes effect and her face is taken off. The brow bone underneath is shaved to a\u0026nbspgentler curve and her chin chiselled likewise. The face is put back on. Has it made her more of a\u0026nbspwoman? An extraordinarily complex question for extraordinarily complex times.The nurse is at the 2pass clinic in Belgium, the patient is Munroe Bergdorf, the maker of this documentary, and her face is, for her, too much of a reminder of the sex she was assigned at birth – male – in a life in which she now identifies as female after six years of treatment. Now, even before the facial surgery, she – as the clinic might put it – “passes” and has become one of the highest-profile (if you’ll pardon the pun, and there’s no reason you should) activists for trans\u0026nbsprights.But is she a woman? Pauline, a\u0026nbspmember of a focus group convened for the purpose of Bergdorf’s film, What Makes a Woman? (Channel 4), and maybe a generation and a half older than her, isn’t sure. “You don’t look mannish at all … When I’m talking to you, I think you’re a woman. But when I know how you started out, part of me thinks you’re a man.”Parsing the differences between these three stances – Bergdorf’s, Pauline’s and the feminists’ – and asking how we approach an increase in understanding between them all could have helpfully taken up more of the film. The political and philosophical questions raised by the idea of feeling like a man or woman trapped in a wrongly sexed body are quite possibly infinite. But the few posed overtly here – primarily by Venice Allan (known as Dr Radfem on her YouTube channel and recently suspended from the Labour party for beliefs it deemed transphobic) – were not properly engaged with. What was most striking about the conversation between her and Bergdorf, in which Allan outlined her objections to proposed changes to legislation that would allow any cis\u0026nbspman (that is, man born male and identifying as such) into any female space (toilets, changing rooms etc) simply by claiming that he identifies as a woman. This, she says, is the beginning of the erasure of hard-won rights and protections for women. Bergdorf argues that trans women experience much violence (from cis men, it is implied) and are not violent towards women. But this is, surely, not the fear? The fear is that it is precisely not trans women who will cause trouble, but the cis men bent on intimidating women who will\u0026nbspuse the new law as another way\u0026nbspto do so.But instead of interrogating this – and possibly going into a wider examination of the apparent unwillingness to look beyond women\u0026nbsp(cis or trans) as the source of the problem\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbspwe moved instead to Bergdorf talking about how she was raped as she began transitioning. A\u0026nbspterrible story, but unconsciously used here in place of\u0026nbspa\u0026nbsprigorous\u0026nbspresponse.Another huge area for debate in the area of trans rights and politics, and more pertinent to the subject of what makes a woman, was touched on only lightly, at the beginning and end of the film, without any development in between. At a genderqueer fashion show, Bergdorf meets a model who says it’s “fine to be a tomgirl” even if you identify as\u0026nbspfemale. You don’t have to perform, in other words, at the extreme end of femininity to be a woman. Bergdorf tells her it took her much longer to get there. In the closing minutes of the programme, Bergdorf remarks that: “I’ve never said that I’m a cisgender woman … I identify more with the female side in a world that gives me two options.”So, does society force you into being a woman if you don’t identify as masculine? We surely need, then, a\u0026nbspsequel: what makes a man?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ab28eefb0866e0a8b2475746ac40798440fe59e/0_91_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fe05b114aee6087d966a3e68c2bc690","title":"fbi investigating 1000 suspected lone wolf militants director says","story":"Suspects radicalised online are being examined in all 50 states, bureau chief says, along with 1,000 ‘domestic terrorists’The FBI is pursuing 1,000 investigations into suspected “lone wolf” militants and another 1,000 into “domestic terrorists”, the bureau’s director has told a congressional committee.Christopher Wray said so-called “lone wolf” terrorists – whom another law enforcement official described as iniduals often radicalised over the internet or other social media – are the FBI’s “highest counterterrorism priority”.“And what makes it so hard is that there are not many dots to connect with some of these people,” he said. “They pick soft targets, they use easy-to-use weapons you know, IEDs (improvised explosive devices), cars, knives, guns.” Several mass shootings in recent years have been attributed to so-called “lone wolves” whose activities are difficult to predict, such as Orlando shooter Omar Mateen. Wray said the FBI was “trying to get better at looking for red flags” that could signal when people becoming radicalised might start to consider taking action.In addition, Wray said, the FBI was pursuing another 1,000 investigations into “domestic terrorists”.The second law enforcement official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said rightwing extremists, violent animal rights and anti-abortion extremists, and African-American or left-wing militants fell into this second category. There was an “overlap” in FBI statistics, the official said, on the number of lone wolf investigations and investigations related to the Islamic State movement.

Initial demonstrations over that unpopular move swelled into a broader nationwide revolt against Ortega’s 11-year rule after they were met with lethal repression by pro-government forces. According to human rights groups, at least 65 people, many of them student protesters, have been killed so far.In an editorial marking the start of Wednesday’s talks, the opposition broadsheet La Prensa urged Ortega’s critics to give the dialogue a chance, despite fears the “cunning and unscrupulous” politician would outwit them. It called on opposition representatives to demand an immediate suspension of government repression and a commitment that no more students would be killed.“The dialogue must focus on the two key points which are: achieving justice for those who were massacred … and agreeing to a plan and a roadmap for the process of Nicaragua’s democratization,” La Prensa said.There were angry scenes as the dialogue began at about 10am on Wednesday.“You can sleep easily. Not us. We are being persecuted,” one student leader, Lester Aleman, shouted at Ortega during the talks, which are being mediated by the Catholic church.The student added: “We’re not here to hold a dialogue. We are here to negotiate your departure.” According to one local journalist, Murillo, the focus of much of the public anger, reportedly told the students: “We all feel anger over what happened in Nicaragua but the path forwards is not war.”Protesters – many of whom are now adamant that their Sandinista president must go – said they were doubtful the dialogue would bring any lasting solution.“People now want him out,” said Xilonem Vargas, a 27-year-old protester from Masaya, a city to the south-east of Managua that suffered some of the most recent deadly violence on Saturday. “Now the main chants are: ‘Let’s get Daniel Ortega out! There is no other option. We cannot dialogue with a murderer.’“We just don’t know what is going to happen. Everyone is acting very unpredictably,” Vargas added.Istvan Sepúlveda, a 31-year-old protester from the western city of León, said he welcomed the prospect of a “ceasefire” but feared the talks would make it easier for the government to paint those who continued to take to the streets as troublemakers. Unlike many members of the student-led protests, Sepúlveda said he was not convinced the immediate exit of Ortega and Murillo, was a good idea. “If they leave there is going to be a power vacuum and that could be even worse.”However, he said Ortega needed to offer genuine concessions this week, including justice for those slain by security forces and a commitment to transparent and democratic elections in the future. “If not, I think the protests will continue and might even intensify … It’s been like a pressure cooker and now it has reached boiling point,” Sepúlveda added.

The skeleton of the Brachiosaurus brancai, the star of the city’s natural history museum, was dug up by a German paleontologist between 1909 and 1913 in Tanzania, then part of the German empire’s largest colony.When the French president, Emmanuel Macron, announced last November that he wanted to use his presidency to lay the ground for “the temporary or permanent restitution of African patrimony to Africa”, many thought the time had come for the dinosaur to head back home. But, six months later, the Berlin Brachiosaurus is not moving an inch: a sign, activists and historians say, that Merkel’s government is failing to respond to Macron’s call with a similarly bold message, and that German museums are dragging their feet.New guidelines on the restitution of objects from “colonial contexts” were unveiled by the German culture minister, Monika Grütters, on Monday. She accepted the need to re-examine the provenance of objects amassed not just in the three decades in which Germany emulated other European states empire-building on the African continent, but during a colonial period defined as stretching back to the 15th-century conquistadores and into the present day.Grütters said she wanted to continue the politics of remembrance that had had “a great share in shaping Germany’s reputation in the world”. She said: “For too long, the colonial period has been a blind spot in our remembrance culture, and reassessing it is part of our responsibility in Germany towards former colonies.”But while Germany’s first official definition of colonial contexts is surprisingly broad, critics say the bar for restitution claims has been set discouragingly high. The non-binding guidelines state that returning artefacts with a problematic history to their country of origin must not be a “compulsory solution”, and should be considered mainly for objects that violated the “legal and ethical standards” in the former colonies at the time.Eckart Köhne, the director of the German museums association, said of Macron’s appeal: “If that is an appeal that means museum collections should be packed wholesale into a lorry and shipped abroad, then we do not consider that the right way.”Activists have criticised the new document as a clear rejection of the French president’s initiative. “The guidelines are an attempt to preserve vested colonial interests that is doomed to failure”, said Tahir Della of the initiative for black people in Germany (ISD).“Every day, members of the communities of African origin in Africa and here in the diaspora have a better picture of which of their looted treasures lie in the cellars of European museums, and they won’t rest until they have got back what belongs to them.”Macron’s comments have focused public debate in Germany about the country’s “colonial blindspots” as Berlin prepares for the opening of the controversial Humboldt Forum in 2019, which will unite the city’s ethnographic and Asian art collections in a reconstruction of its Prussian-era palace.On Wednesday, Berlin’s Prussian cultural heritage foundation formally returned nine objects from the city’s collection to the Chugach Alaska Corporation, which represents indigenous peoples from south-western Alaska.A research project had revealed that the artefacts – including two broken masks, a child’s cradle, and a wooden idol – had been removed unlawfully from Alaskan native graves by the Norwegian ethnologist Johan Adrian Jacobsen in the 1880s.More prominent objects in Berlin’s collection, such as the Brachiosaurus brancai, however, are unlikely to be moved by the new restitution drive. The excavation of the colossus from Tanzania’s fossil-rich Tendaguru formation started in 1909, two years after colonial powers in German east Africa had squashed an armed uprising known as the Maji Maji rebellion, resulting in the deaths of 250,000–300,000 people from the local population.But a three-year research project into the conditions of the dig, funded by the German federal ministry for education and research to be published later this year, found that the Brachiosaurus’s bones were dug up under conditions of “fair” pay, without slave labour, said the natural history museum’s director, Johannes Vogel.Vogel told the  that the dinosaur, the tallest mounted skeleton in the world, was not a cash cow for his museum but a live research object that was expensive to maintain. Earlier this month, Tanzania’s foreign minister, Augustine Mahiga, waived demands for the restitution of plundered cultural artefacts from the colonial period. Speaking at a meeting with the German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, in Dar es Salaam, Mahiga said the dinosaur “does not belong to Germany or Tanzania” but should be considered a piece of world heritage, and praised the museum’s treatment of the remains. “The German taxpayer pays a lot of money to preserve it,” he said. The Tanzanian government is a recipient of German development aid.Instead of restituting the skeleton to Tanzania, Vogel said, the museum was proposing a programme whereby Berlin would help train up Tanzanian palaeontologists and technical workers to explore the large uncharted sections of the Tendaguru formation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/427df8903ddd5c42d15e28c85f3ec8108c52cd58/0_172_4990_2994/master/4990.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e79ec387ed86ef6ceda05c697db87b17","title":"sun terraces and lawns dutch residents transform parking spaces","story":"Project in The Hague has ided streets and revealed a deeply-held attachment to carsIt seems a straightforward offer: swap your resident’s parking permit for a bit of greenery in the freed-up space, a lawn, a sun terrace or somewhere for the children to play. However, if any further proof was needed of the west’s destructive love affair with the car, the furious reaction to a pilot project in one of the Netherlands’ biggest cities has been all too telling.Streets have been ided, angry complaints made and Walter Dresscher, the organiser of the council-backed scheme in The Hague, given what he admits was a verbal going-over during a fiery public meeting. However, Dresscher’s determination remains undimmed: “We can’t go on like this. This has been a great success already because people are thinking.”The drama was sparked by the Dutch municipality’s proposal to residents in six streets in Segbroek, a suburb in the west of the city, to voluntarily swap their parking permit for six months and replace it with something green and pleasant on their street.Their vehicles would be stored in a car park for free, and those participating could choose between themselves how to use the vacant space.Dresscher, an architect by training, said opposition from many residents in the selected areas illustrated how deeply people were attached to their cars, even in the Netherlands, which is often a pioneer in terms of green transportation. The idea of a parking space being lost from a street was too much for some to bear.“I was a bit like a boxing guy, I took everything,” he said of the public meeting attended by 200 residents. “If I was to respond, like I would in a personal conversation, the meeting would not have finished very well ... Everybody took – and this in the Netherlands is more rare than in other countries – very opposite positions. Normally, we are a country where we have a dialogue, we talk to each other.News doesn\u0027t always have to be bad – indeed, the relentless focus on confrontation, disaster, antagonism and blame risks convincing the public that the world is hopeless and there is nothing we can do.This series is an antidote, an attempt to show that there is plenty of hope, as our journalists scour the planet looking for pioneers, trailblazers, best practice, unsung heroes, ideas that work, ideas that might and innovations whose time might have come.Readers can recommend other projects, people and progress that we should report on by contacting us at theupside@the“The idea was to get people together but it didn’t. Why? If there is one that is very angry and starts mobilising the whole street then you have a problem.“But if you don’t want to participate, don’t participate. But physically a car is getting out of the street. Nobody is losing anything.”Dresscher insisted the initial hostility has abated but, as yet, only six householders have signed up to the scheme, with their cars due to be removed in June. Two residents have, however, pre-empted the scheme by putting flower-filled tow-carts in front of their homes, much to the irritation of some. Drivers have been known to shout abuse as they drive by.Dresscher, who has €60,000 of funding from the council and charities, is still confident that more people will come round to his thinking, and is glad that a debate has been started.Rembrant Frerichs, 40, and, Wolfert Brederode, 44, both pianists, and neighbours on Newtonstreet, said they believed it was an important first step in changing the nature of their road, but were yet to decide how to use the space in front of their homes.Brederode said: “I just don’t think I need the car outside my house all the time and I’m going to see if we need it at all. I don’t think there is any reason.“People have this belief that they have a right to have a car, a right to have a parking space. A car is like a second home to people but it isn’t rational.”Dresscher said the project had been inspired by the experience of being forced to push his baby’s pram on the road when living in Amsterdam because cars were blocking the pavement.“I looked at these cars and there were actually plants growing under them. They hadn’t moved for three or four weeks. I started thinking: does anyone know how many cars are used or not?”“This is a completely ridiculous situation,” he said. “I want to get rid of unused cars. The municipalities of Netherlands cannot keep going like this. One day they will come and take away that right, I am sure about that. But this is chance for people to change their behaviour themselves.”A spokesman for The Hague municipality said: “People get the opportunity to choose themselves what they want to do with the public space. They can park their cars in the street or start sharing cars and fill up the free parking spots for other purposes like green, bicycle parking or picnic tables. “We want to see the effect of this approach. Will this bottom-up approach work, where people get a direct effect of their choice to get rid of their car, or is it still necessary to make top-down policy to manage the amount of parked cars in public spaces? It’s a project that, when it succeeds, can easily be scaled up to other streets and neighbourhoods. We think that’s why this pilot is worth funding.”This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world’s most stubborn problems. What else should we cover?

The No vote is at 32 per cent, an increase of four points, while 17 per cent are undecided (a decline of three points). Seven per cent said they will not vote or refused to say.Once the undecideds and those who will not vote are excluded, the Yes side leads by 58 per cent to 42 per cent, with just over a week to go before polling day.While this shows a decline of 10 points in the Yes lead since late April, those in favour of repeal still command a 16-point lead as the campaign enters its final, decisive stage.A tightening of the race was expected by all sides as polling day approaches, and pollsters say that process is likely to continue in the days ahead. But while the Yes side lead has been cut, the No side requires a dramatic acceleration of that process if it is to secure a majority on May 25th.Dublin remains the most pro-repeal part of the country, with the Yes side leading in the capital by 68 per cent to 32 per cent, once undecideds and unlikely voters are excluded.The Yes lead is smaller but clear in the rest of Leinster and Munster, while the two sides are almost tied in Connacht-Ulster, with 51 per cent of declared likely voters saying they will vote Yes and 49 per cent backing the No side. Younger voters are much more likely to support the Yes side, though the youngest cohort of voters (18-24 year-olds) shows a sharp drop in Yes supports in the last month. Voters aged over 50 are in favour of retaining the Eighth Amendment.Women, urban voters, and those from wealthier backgrounds are more in favour of repeal, while farmers and those from the poorest households have small No majorities.The poll shows that a significant minority of declared Yes voters believe that the Government’s proposal for legalising abortion “goes too far”, while 47 per cent of all voters say the law needs to be changed, but 12 weeks is too far.However, many of those voters still intend to vote in favour of the referendum proposal. Over half of all voters (54 per cent) say that while they have reservations about the 12-weeks proposal, they believe it is a “reasonable compromise”. Just over a third of voters (35 per cent) disagree.The poll also shows that voters are becoming more certain of their choice as polling day approaches. Two-thirds of Yes voters say they will absolutely not change their minds, while a further 23 per cent say they are “extremely unlikely” to change their minds. A further 9 per cent say they will probably not change their minds.Certainty is also growing on the No side, with 85 per cent of voters absolutely or extremely unlikely to change their mind. A further 9 per cent will probably not change their minds.Among those who have yet to decide, more undecided voters are leaning towards Yes (31 per cent) than No (24 per cent), though most say they are not leaning in either direction.The poll was conducted on Monday and Tuesday of this week in face-to-face interviews among a nationally representative sample of 1,200 eligible voters.

The No side now has 32 per cent, up four points. Undecided voters are at 17 per cent (down three points) while 5 per cent say they will not vote and 2 per cent refused to answer.Strip out those who say they are undecided (obviously, you can’t vote undecided on the day) and those who won’t vote, and the lead for the Yes side among declared voters is 58 per cent to 42 per cent.Last month the lead among declared likely voters was 26 points today it is down to 16 points. That’s significant drop, for sure. But it is still a 16-point lead, barely a week from polling.A reduction in the Yes lead is what we expected the margins in the contest were always likely to contract as the campaign proceeded. That is the history of referendums in Ireland.But what that tightening means is that the outcome of the referendum is less certain than it appeared three weeks ago. It is still on course to pass: there is no other meaning you can take from these numbers. But while that is the most likely outcome, it is by no means the only possible one. A win for the Yes side is likely it is not certain.The question that will decide the fate of the referendum is whether the Yes vote is just slipping, as expected, or whether it is in freefall.One statistic that will alarm supporters of the repeal movement is the fact that the Yes side in the same-sex marriage referendum fell by eight points in the last 10 days if that was repeated in this campaign, we would be looking at a dead heat even a fall of half that magnitude would cast huge doubt on the result. And that is a possibility. But there is reason to think some of that slippage is already factored into today’s numbers.We would be wise, always, to realise what polls cannot tell us, as much as what they can. Today’s numbers cannot tell us with certainty what will happen next week the best they can do it describe the landscape as it exists now. The poll tells us that if the referendum were held tomorrow, it would pass comfortably.But it also tells us things about the solidity of each side’s vote. Both sides are firming up: their voters are coming home. Today’s numbers show that two-thirds (66 per cent) of Yes voters say they will “absolutely not change” their minds no matter what they hear or see last month that was 53 per cent. A further 23 per cent say they are “extremely unlikely” to change their minds.It is clear – and this is a point of real opportunity for the No campaign – that a significant minority (34 per cent) of professed Yes voters think the Government proposals for abortion on request up to 12 weeks goes too far. That number was similar last month. But those doubts are not causing voters to abandon the Yes side in droves it’s only a trickle.And that’s because whatever doubts soft Yes voters have about 12 weeks, they still believe that the status quo is undesirable.There is a big majority – and there has been for a long time – in favour of liberalising Ireland’s abortion laws to a greater or lesser extent. That is the biggest fact in this campaign, and it is the biggest advantage for the Yes side.For the No side to win, the Yes side has to go into freefall in the final week the No side has to double the rate at which it is winning votes.That’s unlikely, but not impossible. A fierce No effort to target Yes waverers can be anticipated, concentrating on the 12 weeks proposal, and the untrustworthiness of politicians.But so far, the Yes campaign has managed to keep most of its supporters on board with a simple message: if you don’t want the status quo, you must vote Yes.Victory is still in the hands of the Yes side if they manage the final week well, they will win.

Though it’s not to be said out loud, what is meant is the “E” word, enlargement – eventually – of the EU.It’s the first time in 15 years that the union has had such a joint summit with the WBs, a reality not unconnected with the enlargement fatigue that set in with the last economic crisis and which has not been shaken off. Croatia slipped in since then, unnoticed, but that’s it!So although Serbia and Montenegro are formally involved in accession negotiations, like those for Turkey, these are as endless as the proverbial piece of string.And the EU will almost certainly agree to open the same endless negotiations with Macedonia (sorry, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, or Fyrom, to give it its correct title) and Albania in June. As for Bosnia Herzegovina and Kosovo, well the “perspective” is very, very long.In each of the six Balkan states, moreover, the pre-accession reform programme to bring their economy and administrative systems into line with the EU has barely begun, and is hugely arduous.As a helpful journalist pointed out during a Brussels briefing this week on the summit, 15 years ago at Thessalonika the EU managed to mention the “E” word in the summit conclusions. How come, if everything is as rosy as the European Commission likes to suggest, we are only talking “perspective” this time?Yet, remarkably, they’ll all be here today, and grateful, all understanding that the “E” word will not be mentioned. We are talking instead about assistance to “connectivity” in the region – infrastructure, motorways, airports, broadband, people – things the EU does really well.Even getting here, however, hasn’t been easy. Five member states of the union don’t recognise Kosovo as a state – Spain, Greece, Slovakia, Romania and Cyprus – and such is his concern not to give the slightest comfort to secessionism at home (ie Catalans, for those of you who have not been concentrating), Spanish prime minister Mariana Rajoy is actually boycotting the gig on Thursday.Serbia has been prevailed on to attend, but only just. But its casus belli with Kosovo is far more than just recognition. The Serb minority in northern Kosovo, supported by Belgrade, is in a state of permanent insurrection against rule from Pristina.And bitterly embattled Greece and Macedonia will be meeting on the sidelines to see if they can hammer out an agreement on the latter’s name. North Macedonia? Upper Macedonia? No sign of white smoke yet. (Greece sees simple “Macedonia” as an expression of implied expansionist ambitions on its neighbour’s part, and will certainly block any further talk of its accession to the EU if the name issue is not resolved.)It’s not all loggerheads, however, as a senior EU source pointed out to us in determinedly pot-half-full mode. Recently Bulgaria and Macedonia have signed a friendship treaty to resolve longstanding fractious differences. And Kosovo and Montenegro have agreed on a process for resolving disagreements over a border demarcation deal between the two countries.But then there’s also poor Bosnia Herzegovina struggling with its unresolved ethnic isions and a powersharing-based political system that is barely surviving.Occasionally someone pipes up to say that of course no one is going to be admitted to the EU while they are actively in dispute with their neighbour or have unresolved border issues. These are not disputes that the union would contemplate importing, though it did make an exception for Cyprus.And there’s nothing to stop a member state once admitted from picking such fights and then expecting the union to side with it (Greece comes to mind).A century ago, the Ottoman empire lost the Balkans from its sphere of influence and since then they have drifted rudderless, rooted in neither East nor West, gripped by poverty and unable to shake off the poison of nationalism and the wars it has fuelled.European leaders have expressed concern over Turkey’s expanding influence in the western Balkans, particularly since Ankara has taken a more authoritarian turn. Speaking to the European Parliament last month, France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, put Ankara and Moscow in the same bracket, saying he did not want the Balkans to “turn towards Turkey or Russia”.There’s a lot at stake in Sofia – the EU’s determination to show the Balkan six that they have a future in its ambit is as much about demonstrating the effectiveness of the union as a peace project in this troubled region as with securing its own borders.

So we’re more than proud of her.”Immaculate Heart currently has 674 girls, studying inside the 112-year-old institution founded by Spanish nuns. Set beneath the Hollywood sign, at the foot of the Santa Monica mountains, the terracotta-tiled establishment is an oasis from the bustle of Sunset Boulevard, a few blocks away.Fees are currently $15,700 a year (£12,000) – putting it in the middle ranks for the area.Erica Roey, another current student, added: “I think she’s really inspiring in that she did so much selfless work. She worked for this part.”Ms Markle studied at the school from 11 to 18, leaving in 1999. Her high school yearbook featured her picture with the words “classy” – teachers remember her as someone focused and mature, who worked hard to achieve good marks.The students held a \u0026#39Here\u0026#39s to Meghan\u0026#39 celebration Her father, Thomas Markle, was an Emmy award-winning lighting director, and would help with the staging of school plays – at which Ms Markle excelled.“You’d see this little person on the stage, and she could play any character – she was really good at it,” said Christine Knudsen, her former teacher.“She was so poised. I think from being an actress from a young age she knew how to carry herself, she knew how to speak.”Ms Markle’s school life began at the Little Red School House in Hollywood, a private elementary whose parents include several A-list celebrities. She attended the school in the late 80s, leaving around 1992 to join Immaculate Heart High School.Former pupils at the Little Red include Johnny Depp\u0027s daughter, Lily-Rose, and her friend Harley, daughter of filmmaker Kevin Smith.  Al Pacino, Sam Taylor-Johnson, and his brother Aaron are  donors.The school sits in the centre of Hollywood, with a distinctive red wooden facade.Fees range from $18,800 (£14,000) for pre-Kindergarten to $22,700 (£17,000) for the final elementary year, sixth grade.Given the age of their students, there were no celebrations planned.But at the high school, they were thrilled by the forthcoming wedding.The students are very excited about the forthcoming nuptials Maria Pollia, another teacher, who served as Ms Markle’s mentor, said she was immensely proud of her former student, and would watch the ceremony live – at 4am in Los Angeles.The school is holding a viewing party for students, parents and teachers who wish to watch history be made in real time.“I will be watching every moment of the royal wedding, in real time,” she said. “It’s very important to me to, and at least this way, I have a sense that I can be with her and encourage her and pray for her in this wonderful step she is taking in her life.“And I am very happy for her – and for Prince Harry.”Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

And it seems they will waste no time getting started.The newlyweds\u0027 royal wedding schedule sees them undertake a tour of Windsor as their first trip as man and wife, to greet well-wishers who are expected to turn out from all over the world to see them.Here\u0027s everything you need to know about how to watch it and where to stand.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will undertake a carriage ride through Windsor straight after the St George’s Chapel ceremony and before their reception. The journey is designed to allow members of the public to see the newlyweds in person while they are still dressed in their finery, in what is likely to be one of the most photographed occasions of the year.Such a display of ceremonial prowess has been used by kings and queens for centuries to celebrate as much as it has been used to impress their subjects and foreign powers. Be that with gun salutes, marching guards, or golden carriages. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge during their wedding carriage procession in 2011There is no doubt that this royal wedding will pack a punch, just like Queen Victoria\u0027s marriage to Albert which featured a 21-gun salute as she embarked on her carriage procession at St Jame\u0027s Palace.  But it was not until King George VI\u0027s marriage to Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1923 that royal weddings became public affairs they were married to great fanfare in order to lift the spirits of the nation after World War One (and royal weddings have been lavish events ever since).At 1pm, immediately after the service, Prince Harry and Ms Markle will leave Windsor Castle by carriage. They will be driven along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception. The whole procession is expected to take just 25 minutes.Meanwhile, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions.To see the newlyweds up close, the best positions will be on the 2.64 mile stretch that rolls from Snow Hill to the gates of Windsor Castle. This is known as the \u0027Long Walk\u0027. The length of this section will allow thousands of spectators to catch a glimpse of Harry and Meghan in the final minutes of the procession.  There will be events on the Long Walk  throughout the day, with live screens showing footage from the ceremony.  On the hilltop above the procession route, the eagle-eyed can find a sweeping aerial view of the carriage ride. Snow Hill will offer fantastic views of the final moments and will be a popular picnic spot on the day, so get there early to reserve a spot.According to legend, King Henry VIII sat on Snow Hill to wait for news of the execution of his second wife, Queen Anne Boleyn. A precedent that has fortunately not been followed since. Prince Edward and his bride Sophie Rhys-Jones pass the crowd inside the grounds of Windsor Castle in an open carriage in 1999Royal fans can also mingle with the residents of Windsor as the carriage passes through the streets of the town centre. Although you should probably arrive at the crack of dawn if you\u0027re after a front-row High Street viewing spot - it\u0027s bound to get busy.With Windsor dressed in bunting and ceremonial decorations – and bursting with local street entertainment – the town will provide a feast for the eyes. Expect big screens showing live footage of the wedding plus an array of food stalls and general facilities will be available at both the Long Walk and Alexandra Gardens.Spectators can also line the entirety of the procession route, on Castle Hill, High Street, Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk. Disabled viewing spots will be available at the junctions of Victoria Street and Albert Road. The council has advised that visitors should not bring tents, but foldable chairs and umbrellas are fine. Also look out for the weather forecast on the day, and prepare for large crowds with plenty of food supplies, water, and sun cream. Further information will be published on the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead Council website. Of the three parking options on offer, most motorists should make use of the 6,000 designated parking spaces available at the Review Ground, Windsor Great Park, which is located to the south of Windsor Castle and the town centre.  Parking tickets must be booked in advance for a price of £30. These are being allocated on a first-come, first-serve basis. With wedding invitations being sent to more than 2,000 members of the public and many more expected to watch the ceremony on the town\u0027s live screens, it\u0027s a good idea get these sooner rather than later.This car park opens at 4am and closes at 10pm. Though it is next to the Long Walk, motorists will have to take a 25 minute stroll to the nearest spectator spots.  The second parking option is provided by Windsor Racecourse\u0027s \u0027Park and Float\u0027 service, which must also be booked in advance. There are 3,000 spots available for £30, as well as weekend parking packages, and the opportunity to journey into the heart of Windsor on a return boat trip for £10. The third car park can be found at The Windsor Boy\u0027s School, where motorists can park on a first-come-first basis on the day without pre-booking. This is expected to fill-up early in the morning. To accommodate the large number of attendees at Windsor\u0027s public events over the weekend, there will also be a series of road closures, beginning with a 9am - 2pm closure of the procession route on Thursday May 17. Then, from 10pm on Friday May 18 and until late on Saturday May 19, road closures will affect the procession route and surrounding roads. During this time Windsor residents will be able to leave the road closure area, but only emergency services vehicles can enter.Access to the car park on the Long Walk will not be affected by the road closures in place, at any time. Road closures beyond the procession route will take effect from 6am on Saturday May 19 these include Maidenhead Road, Clarence Road, Alma Road, St Leonards Road, Frances Road, Barry Avenue, and Datchet Road. Local authorities suggest that you check this live map of road closures to check what time the roads reopen from Saturday evening onwards. Rail operators will be running a bumper service on the wedding to help everyone get in and out of the celebrations at Windsor, which is expected to be one of the largest one-day events ever held on the local rail network.  Both Great Western and South Western will be increasing train frequency and capacity, with trains running up to four times an hour from London Waterloo and Slough. These services will also benefit from extra carriages to keep up with the expected demand, given that some of the 100,000 expected visitors will arrive by public transport. Windsor is served by two train stations that are within minutes of the town centre and Windsor Castle, making the railway a reliable option for getting to the Royal wedding celebrations: Windsor and Eton Central and Windsor and Eton Riverside.Queuing systems are likely to be in place at London Waterloo, Slough, Staines, and Windsor, whilst \u0027park and walk\u0027 and \u0027park and glide\u0027 bus services will help people get into town.Great Western Railway services connect Windsor and Eton station to South Wales and the West of England, as well as Reading and Oxford, via Slough. This branch-line service will be running with four carriages running every 20 minutes, from the very early hours of the morning to late on Saturday night. The journey from Reading or Oxford takes around 30 - 50 minutes and 50 - 75 minutes respectively, with a change required at Slough. Cardiff and Swansea are around two and a half hours away from Windsor, requiring changes at Reading and then Slough. London is connected to Windsor via the direct Waterloo to Windsor and Eton Riverside service, which takes one hour. Travellers have been advised not to take the London Paddington - Slough route, in order to ease rail congestion around Windsor. From the Midlands, take a Cross Country service from Birmingham New Street to Reading, and then change at Slough for the Eton Riverside station. This takes around two and a half hours.Train services from the North require changes at London terminals. Almost five hours of train travel await any royal super-fans making their way from Newcastle.  Because it is such a huge event, it is wise to make travel plans ahead of time – so make ticket bookings and travel arrangements well before the big day. Up to date advice on the best routes and how to pre-book your tickets, can be found at: for Great Western Railway here and South Western Railway here.Royal wedding: the best hotels for celebrating Prince Harry\u0027s and Meghan Markle\u0027s big dayThere will be a designated pick up and drop off point on the wedding day at King Edward VII Hospital, St Leonards Road. This will be the termination point for buses towards Windsor, as well as local routes. A full timetable of buses is available at the Royal Borough website, and more information on transport and bus alterations can be found here. Hotels, B\u0026ampBs and guesthouses will be bursting at the seams, so expect no empty hotel rooms in town for the duration of the wedding weekend. Royal fans had only a few hours to book the local accommodation offerings before rooms ran out after the announcement that Windsor would play host for the big day.Many residents and visitors will no doubt find a solution via room sharing service AirBnb, with the average price of a room around Windsor currently standing at £321 for Friday night and £286 for the Saturday night. Such prices look like a bargain, with some of the most expensive hotel rooms in Windsor going for up to £10,000. Alternative locations with more \u0027last-minute\u0027 availability include Heathrow, Bracknell and Weybridge. The council also suggests that anyone wanting help to find accommodation can contact the Royal Windsor Information Centre on 01753 743907 or by emailing: windsor.accommodation@rbwm. gov.uk.The monarchy has embarked on grand processions from coronations, marriages, funerals and other state occasions since the 15th century. Each year, a carriage procession carries the Queen to the State Opening of Parliament and the races at Ascot, although royal weddings and coronations are arguably the grandest occasions.   The last royal couple to undertake a carriage procession in Windsor was Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones – now the Earl and Countess of Wessex – after their wedding in St George\u0027s Chapel in 1999.Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones pictured in their carriage after their wedding in 1999It was the biggest occasion in the Berkshire town since since the funeral of King George VI in 1952.More recently, the newly-wed Duke and Duchess of Cambridge travelled through Westminster in a 1902 State Landau after their 2011 wedding, waving at thousands of well-wishers who had packed the streets to catch a glimpse of the happy couple. It\u0027s possible Harry and Meghan could use the same carriage. Steeped in history, the carriage was specifically built for King Edward VII in 1902 and is usually used by the Queen to meet foreign heads of state when they arrive on state visits to Britain.The Prince and Princess of Wales used it to travel back from St Paul’s Cathedral after their 1981 royal wedding, as did the Duke and Duchess of York in 1986. It was also used by the Queen during her Silver Wedding anniversary celebrations in 1972 and in her Silver and Diamond Jubilees in 1977 and 2012.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

It makes their relationship closer.“They respect what he is because as an officer who has seen active service he has done what they have.

Full royal wedding schedule and timingsHow to watch the royal wedding this SaturdayWho has designed Meghan Markle\u0027s wedding dress? Every runner and rider decodedThe hotly anticipated Royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle is now just three days away, taking place this Saturday 19 May. However a last-minute setback has called the couple\u0027s plans into confusion, as Ms Markle\u0027s father Thomas announced via US celebrity website TMZ that he is due to have an operation and will not attend the ceremony on Saturday.Yet the wheels for the wedding are still in motion, with the couple promising a wedding focused on fun, joy and a chance to celebrate with the public.So what\u0027s in store for the couple – and how are the final plans affected by this week\u0027s changes? Here are all the latest updates about 2018\u0027s wedding of the year.Thomas Markle Snr had been intending to travel from his Mexico home to the UK to meet his future son-in-law for the first time, as well as the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. He was also intending to walk Ms Markle down the aisle on Saturday, meeting her at the chapel\u0027s west door after her drive to the ceremony with her mother.But after disclosures about his alleged dealings with the paparazzi and reports he suffered a heart attack earlier this month, the 73-year-old said on Monday he would avoid the ceremony for fear of embarrassing his daughter.The Mail On Sunday newspaper reported the story at the weekend claiming the images were staged and published CCTV footage stills of the US actress\u0027 father in the internet cafe with a photographer.The pictures were published earlier this month in a number of newspapers and news websites showing Mr Markle in a series of royal wedding related activities, apparently unaware he was being snapped.Mr Markle was pictured being measured for what was thought to be his wedding suit, looking at screen pictures of Ms Markle and Harry while in an internet cafe, and reading a picture book about Britain while having a coffee.Thomas Markle Snr: How Meghan Markle\u0026#039s father set her on a path to stardomMs Markle\u0027s half-sister Samantha Markle attempted to shoulder some of the blame when she earlier tweeted it was her idea for Mr Markle to pose for what she described as positive photos in a bid to combat his bad portrayal in the press, but stated it was not done for money.A Kensington Palace said it was a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding and called for understand and respect to be extended to Mr Markle. It would not comment further.However, on Tuesday he raised hopes of attending after all by saying his daughter had been in touch to reassure him, and was prepared to fly to Britain if his medical condition allowed.Mr Markle is reported to have said: “I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But within hours he appeared to change his plans for a third time, claiming he required heart surgery after falling unwell again.On Wednesday night TMZ reported that Thomas Markle had been in touch to say his heart surgery had been completed, while Ms Grant accused Kensington Palace of abandoning him.The gossip site also claimed Ms Grant had suffered a broken ankle and fractured knee in what her boyfriend described as a paparazzi confrontation on a road in Florida.  Meanwhile, other members of Ms Markle\u0027s family have arrived in London - depsite reportedly not receiving an invite to the wedding.Tracy Dooley – who was married to Meghan Markle\u0027s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr – was pictured at Heathrow Airport with her sons, Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26 on Monday.Ms Dooley, who has admitted she has not seen Ms Markle for 20 years, has previously told ITV\u0027s Good Morning Britain she had not received an invitation to the ceremony at Windsor Castle on Saturday.Yet she is expected to cover the event for an American broadcasting network and said she will be in the front row cheering them on in Windsor.Thomas Markle Jr, who not long ago issued an open letter urging Prince Harry to call off the wedding, appeared in Windsor, declaring his estranged half sister the “perfect modern princess”.Days until the Royal WeddingThe wedding is this weekend - Saturday, May 19 - at St George’s Chapel in the grounds of Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry was christened. It is said to have become a very special place for the couple in their relationship so far. The Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office at Buckingham Palace is responsible for organising royal weddings, but the Prince and Ms Markle are leading the show. However, under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.The service will begin at 12pm. The public will have the opportunity to watch the action from their sofas with several broadcasters showing the ceremony live.Read more about how to watch the wedding here.Copy of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle: The story of their relationship, in picturesInvitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests, with a select 200 close friends invited to an after party at Frogmore House, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. The couple do not have an official list of political leaders on the guest list, which means neither Prime Minister Theresa May or US President Donald Trump will be going, and former US President Barack Obama has also missed out. Expect to see many members of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family (apart from her father, Thomas Markle Snr), famous faces from the cast of Suits, conservationists, sportsmen and women and charity heads closest to the couple’s hearts.Invitations for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u0026#39s wedding in MayThose invited include Dave Henson, the former Team GB captain at the Invictus Games, the head of a tiny overlooked Welsh charity and the Botswanan friends so discreet even they do not know which others in their set are going.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.As well a dress code, the guest list also reportedly includes \u0027critical guidance\u0027for the big day.The instructions ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture. They further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.Jessica Mulroney and Meghan Markle in 2016The invitations were produced by Barnard \u0026amp Westwood, which has held the Royal Warrant for Printing \u0026amp Bookbinding by Appointment to Her Majesty The Queen since 1985.Die-stamped in gold and then burnished, the invitation features The Three Feather Badge of The Prince of Wales. They also reveal that the dress code is Uniform, Morning Coat or Lounge Suit, or Day Dress with Hat.Read more about who is on the guest list here.The Duke of Cambridge will be Harry\u0027s best man, missing the FA Cup final to be at his brother\u0027s side.The Duke, who has always been the front-runner for the supporting role at the May wedding, is honoured to have been asked, Kensington Palace said.Prince William and Prince Harry in borrowed policemen outfitsKensington Palace has announced that Ms Markle will have no adult bridesmaids \u0027because she\u0027s unable to choose between her friends\u0027, and will instead be surrounded by children as page boys, bridesmaids and flower girls.On Wednesday, it was announced the bridesmaids are Princess Charlotte, Florence van Custem, Remi Litt, Rylan Litt, Ivy Mulroney and Zalie Warren. The pageboys are Prince George, Jasper Dyer, Brian Mulroney and John Mulroney.Royal siblings Prince George and Princess Charlotte already know the score - they performed those roles at the wedding of Pippa Middleton, the Duchess of Cambridge\u0027s younger sister, to James Matthews in May last year.  Prince Harry has paid tribute to former mentor and close friend Mark Dyer by requesting his son Jasper as a pageboy, while Ms Markle has publicly recognised one of her best friends, stylist Jessica Mulroney, by choosing her twin sons to take part in the wedding.Read more about the pageboys and bridesmaids here.Bookmakers suspended betting on the designer of Ms Markle\u0027s wedding dress in March when British couture company Ralph \u0026amp Russo pulled ahead to become 13 favourites.The label, helmed by Australians Tamara Ralph and Michael Russo (a couple in real life) have shot to prominence after a string of celebrity endorsements.In 2014, Angelina Jolie wore the label to Buckingham Palace to receive an honorary damehood, in 2016 Gwyneth Paltrow to the Oscars. Add to that list of fans Beyonce, Rihanna and, finally, Meghan Markle herself, who chose a £56,000 embellished couture gown for the official photos taken to mark her engagement to Prince Harry.Before betting was suspended, London-based designer Erdem was at 31. Ms Markle\u0027s stylist and close friend Ms Mulroney runs a bridal store in Toronto was said to have helped the bride choose her gown.Read more about Ralph and Russo here.Prince Harry will wear the ceremonial uniform of the Royal Marines,the regiment believes.The Prince will wear the uniform as a mark of respect to the regiment he took over as Captain General from his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh.Men from the regiment will line the route from St George’s Chapel, at Windsor Castle, to provide a ceremonial guard of honour.Palace officials will not confirm what the Prince is to wear for his wedding to Ms Markle, but soldiers of the Royal Marines who have volunteered to take part understand he will be wearing the same ceremonial regalia, or ‘Blues’, as them on the day.Other options include the uniform of the Household Cavalry, where Prince Harry served with the Blues and Royals, or morning dress.Read more on Prince Harry\u0027s outfit hereThe couple will be make their vows at St George\u0027s Chapel, which last hosted a royal wedding in May 2008 when Peter Phillips - son of The Princess Royal - married Autumn Kelly. The traditional ceremony will be conducted by The Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows.Pioneering American bishop, the Most Rev Bishop Michael Curry, from Chicago, Illinois, has been invited to deliver the address as the couple strive to reflect their transatlantic relationship amid the tradition of St George\u0027s Chapel.Bishop Curry, who has been praised for his infectious laughter and self-deprecating humour, is the first African-American bishop to have served as the Episcopal Church\u0027s presiding bishop, a role he has held since November 2015.The music will also have an American influence according to Christopher Warren-Green, who will conduct musicians on the day.Miss Markle, who was a UN women\u0027s advocate, is unlikely to opt to obey the prince. The couple will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did, which allows the bride to drop obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will a have a “special place” during the ceremony.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where the prince served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province will be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.Read more about St George\u0027s Chapel here.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAfter the ceremony, among the first people to congratulate the couple will be some of the 2,640 charity workers, community champions and local school children who are being invited to watch the wedding from inside the walls of Windsor Castle. Then at 1pm, the newlyweds will undertake a two mile tour of Windsor in an Ascot Landau carriage, greeting well-wishers, which is expected to take 25 minutes.It\u0027s the same carriage the prince used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton,when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.The couple will leave Windsor Castle by carriage via Castle Hill, travelling along the High Street and through Windsor Town before returning along the Long Walk for the first reception at St George\u0027s Hall.Read more about the procession here.Wedding at Windsor CastleFollowing the carriage ride, the congregation will await the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall, for the first of two receptions.The first, more formal afternoon reception for some 600 guests, will be hosted by the Queen. The 180-ft long room, traditionally used for state banquets, seats up to 162 people and was redesigned in a modern Gothic style – with walls lined with suits of armour – following the fire at the castle in 1992.Fashionable \u0027bowl food\u0027 will be served at the standing-only reception. Made with seasonal ingredients grown on the Crown Estates, the food is intended to be eaten standing up, allowing guests to mingle freely in St George’s Hall.The food is likely to be accompanied by champagne and wine from the extensive Royal cellars, and soft drinks.The second evening reception, for 200 close friends and family, will be thrown at Frogmore House by the Prince of Wales. Standing about half a mile south of Windsor Castle in Windsor Home Park, Frogmore House has been a Royal Residence since 1792. It is where Harry and Ms Markle posed for their official engagement photos in November.The location of the venue - away from the Castle - will offer the pair privacy as they celebrate with friends and family.Read more about the food here.The couple have asked Claire Ptak, an east London pastry chef, to make an organic lemon and elderflower wedding cake incorporating the bright flavours of spring, according to Kensington Palace. It will be covered with buttercream and decorated with fresh flowers.It is believed to be the first time a Royal couple have eschewed tradition by not serving a fruit cake to their wedding guests.Claire Ptak, owner of Violet Bakery in Hackney, east LondonThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge chose Fiona Cairns to make their 2011 wedding cake, a traditional multi-layered fruit cake with a floral design.Read more about the wedding cake here.The couple have chosen high society florist Philippa Craddock to design their day, using seasonal plants and flowers from the Crown Estates and Royal Parks chosen particularly for their pollinator-friendly properties.Aisles, pews, tables and halls will be lined with plants from wildflower meadows, picked to “provide a great habitat for bees and help to nurture and sustain entire ecosystems by promoting a healthy and bioerse environment”, Kensington Palace said.Ms Craddock has been named “Queen of London florists” by British Vogue and “a floral mastermind” by Tatler.On Wednesday Ms Craddock revealed the the flower arrangements will have royal roots.The London florist said that silver birch and English oak from nearby Windsor Great Park will be a part of the greenery adorning the scenery.Windsor Great Park is owned by the royal family and Prince Philip, holds the title of park ranger.William the Conqueror hunted there in the 11th century when the park was a forest. Roses, foxgloves and Ms Markle\u0027s reported favourite flowers peonies will also will be in the arrangements.There are moments where I\u0027ve focused on it being another commission, so it\u0027s like working with any one of our couples, and of course you take a step back and you just realise the enormity of it, Ms Craddock said.It\u0027s a huge occasion and we\u0027re just hugely privileged.Read more about the wedding florist here.The prince will be putting pen to paper to write his speech for their reception. But Ms Markle, who is an accomplished public speaker, is expected to break with tradition and deliver her own as well, offering “affectionate” praise of her new husband, thanks to the Queen and a few suitable jokes.The former actress, is “ready” to speak at the reception, should her father choose to avoid the limelight, the Sunday Times reported earlier this year.Mr Markle, an award-winning Hollywood writing director who now lives a quiet life in Mexico, was expected to walk Ms Markle down the aisle before changing his plans to attend.At the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, reception speeches included words from best man Prince Harry, the groom’s father the Prince of Wales and Michael Middleton, who affectionately described how he knew his daughter’s relationship was serious when her boyfriend landed a helicopter in his garden.Ms Markle will become an HRH and a senior royal after marrying Prince Harry. She is also expected to become a duchess, as Kate Middleton did when she became the Duchess of Cambridge after saying her vows in 2011.By tradition, male members of the Royal family receive a title from the monarch on their wedding day, and the vacant title Duke of Sussex is regarded as the most likely choice for the Prince, meaning Ms Markle would become HRH The Duchess of Sussex.Like Prince Harry, the previous Duke of Sussex lived at Kensington Palace, and he also married for love, rather than choosing brides who fitted the traditional royal mould.Read more about royal titles here.Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, outside Westminster Abbey on their wedding day in 2011The wedding is on a Saturday, so there will be no new bank holiday. Although the public were given a day off to celebrate the weddings of Prince Charles to Diana Spencer in 1981, Prince William to Catherine Middleton in 2011, and Princess Anne to Mark Phillips in 1973, no such national holidays were awarded for Prince Andrew or Prince Edward.However, it\u0027s not all bad news because pubs and bars will be allowed to do away with the usual curbs on opening hours on the wedding weekend. Ministers have extended licensing hours across Britain to allow venues to remain open until 1am on Friday and Saturday - which is also the day of the FA Cup final.There will also be lots of street parties planned across the UK.For information about how to host your own, click here.The royal bride and groom-to-be have approved a range of commemorative china to celebrate their nuptials. The exclusive design in white and cornflower blue has a monogram of the couple\u0027s initials at its centre, tied together with white ribbons and surmounted by the coronet of Prince Harry.  The decorative border of each piece is inspired by the ironwork of the 13th-century Gilebertus door of St George\u0027s Chapel and each is finished with 22-carat gold.The Royal Collection Trust range, which is made in Stoke-on-Trent, includes a decorative miniature coffee mug, coffee mug, pillbox, tankard and plate. The Royal wedding souvenir phenomenon dates back to Queen Victoria’s wedding to Prince Albert in 1840, linked to the rise of mass production in Victorian Britain. It remains a thriving industry today, with an estimated £222 million spent on memorabilia in the run-up to the 2011 royal wedding, according to the Centre for Retail Research.Prince Harry and Ms Markle will delay their honeymoon to go straight back to work in the week after their wedding, scheduling their first public engagement as a married couple just days later.The couple will go on honeymoon privately later this year, before a “busy” autumn including a trip to Sydney for the Invictus Games. But where will they go?Namibia has pulled ahead as the odds-on favourite. The southern African nation is best known among travellers for the enormous Sossusvlei sand dunes of the the Namib Desert, but reports suggest that the couple are looking instead at a safari trip to Hoanib Valley Camp in the country\u0027s north west.Botswana, where they holidayed in the early days of their whirlwind relationship, is also a good bet, (Ms Markle\u0027s engagement ring features diamonds from Diana\u0027s personal collection, and a stone from Botswana), but wherever they go, the newlyweds will be looking for seclusion away from the limelight as they start their married life together.Other possible destinations could include Tuscany, Hawaii, Turkey and the Philippines.Read more about the honeymoon options here.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry wedding features gridPrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarkleHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayWhat time are Prince Harry and Meghan Markle getting married?

Prince Edward also wed Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, there in June 1999 plus Prince Harry was christened there in 1984 by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.Members of the public who have been invited to watch from the grounds of Windsor Castle will  begin to arrive from 9am.Guests will arrive between 9:30am and 11am by coach. Two driving routes have been suggested, with guests required to meet at the Windsor Farm Shop – founded in 2001 after the Duke of Edinburgh had an idea to support local businesses by selling produce.Wedding at Windsor CastleThere, three miles away from the venue, guests will be put through security checks and asked to show identification they will then be ushered onto buses to travel to Windsor Castle, where they will alight at the castle\u0027s Round Tower and enter the chapel through the south door.Instructions reportedly sent to the guests ban cameras and bulky bags, adding that guests will be asked to surrender mobile telephones\u0085 and any devices used for image capture.The rules further specify that guests should not wear medals, in a list of suggestions about accessories that includes: No swords.At 11:20am, members of the Royal Family will arrive and enter the chapel through the Galilee Porch. Some will arrive in state car from the Royal Mews, including Bentleys, Rolls-Royces and Daimlers.A view of the Quire in St George\u0026#39s Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will have their wedding servicePrince Harry and his brother and best man the Duke of Cambridge are expected to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:45am. It is assumed they will enter the grounds on foot, giving Prince Harry the opportunity to walk past the crowds in the grounds. He will pass 200 representatives from charities he is associated with, who are expected to gather in the horseshoe cloister at the bottom of the steps.The Queen will be the final member of the Royal Family to arrive for the service, and is expected at 11:55am.The service will begin at 12pm, with Ms Markle due to arrive at the chapel\u0027s west steps at 11:59am.She has chosen her mother, Doria, to travel with her to the wedding, travelling from their overnight accommodation to St George’s Chapel by car. The decision breaks with UK tradition, which usually sees the bride travel with her father before he gives her away in the wedding ceremony.Instead, Ms Markle wanted to include both parents in her wedding day. When the car stops at the castle, her mother will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys. Ms Ragland will enter the chapel by the Galilee Porch.The most beautiful royal wedding dresses of all timeHowever, while it was planned that Meghan\u0027s father would meet her at the chapel\u0027s west door before walking her down the aisle, this step of the day has been thrown into confusion. On Monday it was reported the father-of-the-bride revealed he no longer intends to travel from Mexico to the UK to attend the ceremony it is still unconfirmed who will walk the bride down the aisle.The traditional ceremony will be conducted by the Dean of Windsor, The Rt Revd. David Conner while the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will officiate as the couple make their marriage vows. Under the guidance of Harry\u0027s private secretary, Edward Lane Fox, the Lord Chamberlain\u0027s Office is dealing with the ceremonial aspects of the day.It is assumed that Ms Markle is unlikely to opt to obey the prince and will probably choose the Series One (1966) Book of Common Prayer ceremony, just as the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge did. This allows the bride to drop the phrases obey him and serve him from the religious proceedings. Harry must decide whether to wear a wedding ring William does not wear one.The regiments Prince Harry served with in Afghanistan will also have a special place during the ceremony. Household Cavalry troopers will line the staircase at St George\u0027s Chapel, while streets within the precincts of the castle will be lined by members of the Windsor Castle Guard from 1st Battalion Irish Guards, and by Armed Forces personnel from the Royal Navy Small Ships and Diving, which has the Prince as Commodore-in-Chief, and the Royal Marines, where he is Captain General.The 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, where Prince Harry served as an Apache Pilot in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, will also be represented, as well as The Royal Gurkha Rifles, his comrades in Afghanistan in 2007, and RAF Honington, where he is Honorary Air Commandant.The service will end at 1pm and the newlyweds will leave the chapel at the west steps, before leaving the castle by carriage. Prince Harry and Ms Markle will be driven for two miles along Castle Hill, the High Street and into Windsor town centre before returning along the beautiful, tree-lined Long Walk for their reception.Kensington Palace has said: Prince Harry and Ms Markle are very much looking forward to this short journey which they hope will be a memorable moment for everyone who has gathered together in Windsor to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day.The procession is expected to take 25 minutes, 10 minutes longer than a similar procession taken by Edward and Sophie in 1999.The best photo opportunity will be the West Steps of St George’s Chapel, when the bride and groom and their families emerge after the service. If you are lucky enough to be in Windsor on the day, head for the grass of the Horseshoe Cloisters opposite those steps for the view.The Ascot Landau open carriage stands in the Royal Mews at Buckingham Palace in LondonThe newlyweds will make their journey through Windsor in an open-topped Ascot Landau carriage, Kensington Palace has confirmed. It is the same carriage Prince Harry used in the procession at the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton, when he was surrounded by small bridesmaids and page boys.Crown Equerry Colonel Toby Browne, who runs the royal mews where the carriage was selected, said: The fair weather option, the Ascot Landau, it was selected because it\u0027s a wonderfully bright, small, lovely carriage. Very easy for people to see, the passengers can sit up quite high - so there\u0027s lots of visibility for everybody.It was built in 1883, it\u0027s one of five that we have, most of them are down in Windsor, we always keep one in London for occasions.If it rains on the wedding day, the wet weather option is the Scottish State Coach. Built in 1830, a new top was created in 1969 with large windows and a partial glass roof, to allow spectators to see the passengers.Six horses, Windsor Greys, will be included the procession ride.A team of four, Milford Haven, Plymouth and father and son Storm and Tyrone, will pull the Landau and two others - Sir Basil and Londonderry - will be outriders.All have been involved in high profile events before, including the Spanish state visit last year, Royal Ascot, Trooping the Colour, the State Opening of Parliament and the Lord Mayor\u0027s Show. They will be waved off by members of both families and the congregation will leave the chapel to see the newlyweds leave, before going to St George\u0027s Hall for the lunchtime reception hosted by the Queen.While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are touring Windsor, guests from the congregation will wait for the happy couple in St George\u0027s Hall to celebrate the first of the day\u0027s two receptions. This will be hosted by the Queen, will take place during the afternoon and will be attended by all guests who were invited to the service.Invitations have been posted to 600 lucky guests royal sources have said the guest list has been restricted to those who have a direct relationship with the couple, both because St George’s Chapel is relatively small and because the prince is not in the direct line of succession.Some members of the public have received an invitation to wait in the grounds outside the chapel to watch the bride and groom and their wedding guests arrive and leave.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in the grounds of Frogmore HouseFrom 7pm, a select 200 close friends will attend an after party hosted by the Prince of Wales at Frogmore House, Windsor. Half a mile away from Windsor Castle, the 17th century Grade I country house is owned by the Crown Estate and is part of the Frogmore Estate on the ground of the Home Park.Prince Harry and Ms Markle\u0027s engagement photos were taken in the grounds of Frogmore House. The images were taken by photographer Alexi Lubomirski, who has also been chosen to take the photographs on the wedding day. Lubomirski, the British-born son of Peruvian-English mother and a Polish-French father, also happens to be a Prince himself: his full title is His Serene Highness Prince Alexi Lubomirski.It is expected that member of the Royal family, Ms Markle\u0027s family and intimate friends of both the newlyweds will be at the evening reception – although Princess Charlotte and Prince George will no doubt have been put to bed after their big day in the limelight.It has been announced that Prince William will be Prince Harry\u0027s best man. The decision means the Duke, who is President of the Football Association, will not attend the FA Cup final, which is happening on the same day as the wedding.Scheduled to start at 17:15, the FA Cup final will see Chelsea and Manchester United go head to head for the title. Windsor Castle is about an hour\u0027s drive from Wembley Stadium, which would have taken the Duke of Cambridge away from the proceedings for at least two hours.The Duke’s own stag do is reported to have been held on a Devon estate, Hartland Abbey, where he and close friends indulged in drinking, clay pigeon shooting, surfing and games.Prince Harry went on to tease his brother mercilessly during a none-the-less heartfelt best man’s speech at the wedding reception, allegedly wearing a fez, mimicking the lovestruck conversations between a young Kate and William, and ridiculing his bald spot.Royal Wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan MarklePrince Harry and Meghan MarkleRoyal wedding guest list: Here\u0026#39s who has received an invite from Harry and MeghanHow to watch Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s royal wedding this SaturdayRoyal wedding 2018 latest news: Full details for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s marriageDambusters 75th anniversary: How the Second World War raid unfolded, hour by hourAmsterdam to ban Airbnb and bump up tourist tax as it hits back at \u0026#39Disneyfication\u0026#39 of cityLabour plans to close immigration detention centres and scrap \u0026#39hostile environment\u0026#39 policyMeghan Markle\u0026#39s half sister reported to be in hospital after car crash Revealed: The outfit Prince Harry is expected to wear on his wedding dayRadio 1 Breakfast Show sheds hundreds of thousands of listeners since the start of the yearOne in four UK children has never swum in the British seaRural bobbies could be routinely armed as police fail to recruit enough firearms specialistsSoaring number of dementia patients ending up in hospital because care system is \u0026#39broken\u0026#39Ageism in Hollywood \u0026#39alive and well\u0026#39: Jane Fonda reveals bosses wanted younger stars to front her filmNew dawn of politically correct commercials as regulators crack down on gender stereotypesThe makings of the Markle debacle - how a simmering family feud came to a head at the royal weddingIs cutting-edge cancer therapy sexist?

The invitations have been dispatched, the cake is being iced and the final flourishes are being added to the wedding gown. For those of us not lucky enough to be on the guest list or among the members of the public invited to Windsor, the next best option is to watch live from home. As with previous royal weddings and milestone celebrations, you can expect hours of television coverage streamed live from the lawns of Windsor Castle and the heights of St George\u0027s Chapel nave. This wedding will go beyond the heights of Suits, in which Ms Markle stars, or The Crown. There will be as much tradition and pomp as any drama or history series ever needed. The schedule for the royal day means you can expect cheering crowds in any weather packing the pavements of Windsor and thousands celebrating in their local communities at street parties across the nation. To make sure you catch every second on TV - including the dizzying spectacle of the FA Cup Final which falls on the same day - read on.  Not long to go... Prince Harry and Meghan Markle on the day they announced their engagementThe Prince and Ms Markle are set to be married this weekend (Saturday, 19 May). Clear your diary.The hour-long ceremony will begin at 12:00pm sharp at St George’s Chapel in Windsor, but expect several hours of TV coverage first as the excitement and anticipation builds.The service, conducted by the Dean of Windsor, will end around 1pm when Prince Harry and Ms Markle have taken their vows - officiated by The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby.Yes, you\u0027ll be able to catch all the action from your sofa. The wedding and procession will be televised live on networks around the world. A single pool camera will capture the nuptials so many channels will be able to broadcast it. It\u0027s highly unlikely that we\u0027ll catch a glimpse of the two wedding receptions. They are private events for guests only. In the UK, the BBC, Sky News and ITV will cover the day with big-name presenters.The BBC\u0027s coverage will run from 9am until 2pm on Saturday. The broadcast will be anchored by Huw Edwards, Kirsty Young and Dermot O\u0027Leary from the grounds of Windsor Castle. Young and O\u0027Leary will cover the build-up from the castle\u0027s moat, whilst newsreader Edwards presents from the equally spectacular roof of the Windsor Guard Room.They will be supported by a team of roaming presenters including The One Show\u0027s Alex Jones and former Strictly Come Dancing champion Ore Oduba, who will capture the excitement on the ground. The BBC has announced that a television licence will not be needed to watch the wedding, allowing communities to screen the event at street parties and gatherings.  ITV\u0027s output will run from 9:25am until 3pm, presented by Phillip Schofield and Julie Etchingham, using a purpose-built studio in Windsor.Other presenters include Mary Nightingale, Nina Hossain, Charlotte Hawkins and royal editor Chris Ship who will provide updates throughout the day.Sky\u0027s coverage will also start early, running from 9am until 3pm. Kay Burley, Anna Botting, Jayne Secker, Sarah-Jane Mee, Colin Brazier and Jonathan Samuels will present the live coverage from Windsor. Prince William and his wife Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, travel to Buckingham Palace, after their wedding ceremony at Westminster Abbey in London, 2011As Harry and Meghan will enter the chapel at 12:00 B.S.T, North American viewers will have an early start if they want to catch the action live.   The first footage will be available from CBS\u0027 This Morning, which airs at 4:00 E.S.T (1:00 PT).

Never mind... there\u0027s various screenings taking place across the country, including in Belfast, Salisbury, Leeds, Swansea, Winchester and Portsmouth.Here are the main events taking place in the capital.Head down to ONE Marylebone church for its Royal Wedding Party.

If you\u0027re one of the lucky ones you\u0027ll be watching the historic event unfold on the Orangery lawn with a picnic and a glass of bubbles.You can expect the wedding to attract a large audience in the UK and abroad. About 27 million Brits and 23 million Americans watched the wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton in 2011.The BBC\u0027s coverage of William and Kate\u0027s wedding attracted 67.2 per cent of the television audience share that day, attracting 18.7 million viewers to BBC One during the ceremony. More than a million people used BBC iPlayer to watch the coverage.In 2011, the BBC had faced intense criticism for choosing Huw Edwards to anchor the presenting team rather than more seasoned royal broadcasters such as David Dimbleby. They were also criticised for using Fearne Cotton to provide coverage from outside Buckingham Palace.WATCH: How Diana, the in-laws and Prince Louis will fit into the Royal WeddingAs excitement builds before the wedding day, a host of broadcasters will deploy in-depth documentaries and extended Harry and Meghan coverage.ITV have already aired a one-off feature entitled Invitation to a Royal Wedding.

The game between Chelsea and Manchester United will kick-off at 17:15 BST on BBC One, so football-loving royalists can have their cake and eat it. However the BBC\u0027s one-off TV licence dispensation does not apply to the FA Cup final, so find a screen somewhere near to your royal wedding celebrations.    Prince William, the Duke of Cambridge, usually attends the final and presents the cup to the winning captain in his role as Football Association president.

It did not come about until after the first stars were formed, being released when they died again.As such, the oxygen discover was unexpected because it suggests that had happened even when the universe was relatively young. That discovery appears to be confirmed by a model that confirms the current brightness of the universe corresponds with it being formed when it was only 250 million years old.Scientists described the detection of such distant oxygen as a discovery that fundamentally changes our understanding of the beginnings of the universe, as well as being a major breakthrough in our technical exploration of it.Rather than saying I was happy, it would be more accurate to say I was thrilled to see the signal of the most distant oxygen, explains Takuya Hashimoto, the lead author of the research paper published in the journal Nature and a researcher at Osaka Sangyo University and the National Astronomical Observatory of Japan. I was excited enough that the signal appeared in my dreams and I had difficulty sleeping that night.The age of those stars raises questions about when the very first galaxies emerged from the complete darkness that initially made up the universe, a moment known by scientists as the Cosmic Dawn.Determining when cosmic dawn occurred is akin to the Holy Grail of cosmology and galaxy formation, said Richard Ellis, senior astronomer at UCL and co-author of the paper. With these new observations of MACS1149-JD1 we are getting closer to directly witnessing the birth of starlight! Since we are all made of processed stellar material, this is really finding our own origins.It also suggests that galaxies were forming long before we can actually see them now, making the process of star formation even more mysterious.The mature stellar population in MACS1149-JD1 implies that stars were forming back to even earlier times, beyond what we can currently see with our telescopes. This has very exciting implications for finding \u0027cosmic dawn\u0027 when the first galaxies emerged, adds Nicolas Laporte, a researcher at University College LondonUniversité de Toulouse and a member of the research team.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Whether it is incidents of hate crime, or gay couples being asked to leave supermarkets for kissing, visibility is often met with retribution.Public hand-holding, which to heterosexual couples may seem normal and mundane, is a frontier that many gay couples are still fearful to cross.A 2017 survey revealed that more than half of gay men are too scared to hold hands with another man in public.To learn more about why so many couples are still fearful of showing public affection, we spoke\u0026nbspto UK-based LGBT+ couples about their experiences of holding hands in public.For 29-year-old Danny Shocklidge and his boyfriend, whether to hold hands is a constant negotiation that depends on their surroundings.We do hold hands, but it is dependent on feeling safe. For instance, we don’t hold hands in my hometownDanny’s experiences of growing up in a rural town, where he was attacked twice growing up for being gay, contribute to this unease.You can say times change, but they don\u0027t change at the same pace in all places, so you have to adapt your behaviour appropriately.Acts of physical violence are traumatic, but verbally abusive encounters can also deter gay couples from walking hand-in-hand.This dilemma is even more immediate for couples who live permenantly in rural communities. Adam Smith and his long-term partner live in the Lake District. He admits that they never hold hands in public following an incident where two men were verbally abusive towards them.Two rugby lads walked behind us saying “batty man” when we were in a supermarket buying food. Every straight person we told about it seemed really shocked, but LGBT+ people definitely weren’t.Homophobic incidents like this are in no way isolated to the countryside. Last year, James Besanvalle and his husband had homophobic abuse shouted at them as they held hands in East London.I’d be lying if I said that incident didn’t run through my mind whenever I reach for my husband’s hand.I try so hard to live unapologetically visible as a queer man, but\u0026nbspthere’s no doubt the fear of receiving verbal or physical abuse is constantly there.Having to make these constant judgements on a daily basis can create tension and negative feelings between couples. 24 year-old Paige Cochrane says that in the past, when girlfriends haven’t wanted to hold her hand, she has become self-conscious\u0026nbspabout\u0026nbspwhether or not this is something to do with her.Even in 2018, she and her current girlfriend have an unspoken rule that they don’t hold hands in central London for fear of abuse.The hand-holding situation has always been a difficult one for us. Even now when we are both feeling brave we don\u0027t maintain touch for more than a few minutes.The only thing I would say that is positive about this reluctance to hold hands is that when we do choose to, it\u0027s ours. We get to make the decision and enjoy that physical touch.Carrie Lyell, editor of lesbian magazine DIVA, also feels on edge when holding hands in public, particularly around groups of men.We\u0027re constantly having to evaluate the risks, which is kind of a mood killer, let\u0027s be honest. What a simple thing – holding hands. But I can only imagine what it must feel like to take your partner\u0027s hand and have no worries about it at all.For gay couples who are happy and hopeful that attitudes can change, the hand-holding conundrum creates a particular type of frustration. How can people accept gay couples holding hands if they never see them in public?26 year-old Alex Francis describes the conflicting emotions that hand-holding can create.For the most part, we want people to know that we’re a queer couple and are very much proud to be so in public.But as we both have social anxiety and two men holding hands in any public space often attracts a lot of unwanted attention, it’s something that we certainly have to be cautious of in certain places to avoid the inevitable stares, comments, and generally awkward behaviour that people show upon seeing us together.In the last couple of years Alex and his long-term boyfriend Ben have experienced\u0026nbspthreatening and intimidating encounters whilst holding hands in public. Just last weekend the pair were standing at a bus stop, barely leaning on one another, when a group of men hurled abuse out of a car window at them.\u0026nbspI think we’ve both been conditioned to always use our sixth sense before showing any public displays of affection.By this I mean generally just knowing the space that you’re in, asking yourself whether it feels safe or not by scouting for other queers or looking out for groups of people that might be homophobicIf you have been affected by this article, you can contact the following organisations for support:More:\u0026nbspLGBT+ people describe the homophobic abuse they\u0027ve faced in the UK over the last year for next articleWe use cookies to enhance your visit to our site and to bring you advertisements that might interest you.

Or, you know, just google it.Jokes aside, this is actually a good question. The sun sets at marginally different times across the country – a minute later in Newcastle than in Sunderland and a whole half an hour earlier in London than Edinburgh.This is important because breaking the fast even a minute too early could render the day invalid, so it’s vital for hungry families who are counting down the minutes to know precisely when the moment comes. Fasting is not supposed to hinder your health, so anyone with a pre-existing medical condition likely to fall ill as a result of the fast is not expected to adhere to it.It is for this reason that children, those on prescription medicines, the infirm and elderly, pregnant women and those on their period are not required to participate.Not between the hours of sunrise and sunset, no sir.Yeah all day. Nothing at all. Zilch. Zero. Just that sweet oxygen. It’s common for Muslims to treat themselves to a few farewell rounds of their favourite dishes before Ramadan begins but, after that, it’s very much a matter of personal preference.Some go for soups, salad and dates while others are partial to samosas and kebabs. Those who indulge with a hearty blowout are setting themselves up for a much worse bout of hunger the next day so many prefer to eat moderately.Overdoing it with hot or salty foods, meanwhile, can leave you badly dehydrated and given that you can’t drink water the following day...That’s the idea.Absolutely not. There’s a strong expectation that all non-Muslims must refrain from eating in the company of a fasting Muslim.Doing otherwise is regarded as grossly offensive and insensitive.Oh yes. Every time a non-Muslim eats during Ramadan, a fairy dies of sadness and then bursts into flames.This is a contentious issue but some say as long as you’re not actually devouring Colgate by the tube, it’s fine.However some devout Muslims feel uneasy about the practice and prefer to brush with a finely-fibred miswak twig instead.Don’t be an idiot.In pictures: Ramadan around the worldIn pictures: Ramadan around the worldRussian Muslims pray outside the central mosque in Moscow, during celebrations of Eid al-Fitr marking the end of the fasting month of RamadanTurkish Muslims offer Eid al Fitr prayers as they mark the first day of the Eid al-Fitr at Fatih Sultan Mosque in IstanbulA Syrian Dervish dances as part of a traditional event organised by the Syrian Ministry of Tourism under the title \u0027Music and Dervishes\u0027 in the old city of DamascusA Bosnian Muslim man, wearing a traditional Bosnian outfit, fires a canon from a vantage point overlooking Sarajevo to mark the end of daily fasting on the final day of the Islamic holy month of RamadanA general view of an illuminated Mosque as Muslims pray during the 27th night of Ramadan, in PeshawarMuslim women offer prayer of the Jumat-ul-wida, the last Friday of the Islamic holy month of Ramadan at a mosque in LahoreMuslims offer prayers on the last Friday of the holy month of Ramadan in Dargah Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti The Prophet Mohammed Mosque in the holy city of Medina, during Ramadan A Malaysian swings around fireworks to celebrate the last day of the Muslims\u0027 Holy fasting month of Ramadan, in Shah Alam, outside Kuala LumpurKyrgyz Muslims pray during the Eid al-Fitr Muslim celebration marking the end of Ramadan in BishkekPeople pray during the Laylat Al Qadr prayers on the 27th day of the Islamic month of fasting, Ramadan in the front of the Aghin mosque in AbidjanSyrians shop for traditional sweets in Kafr Batna in the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta area, on the outskirts of the capital Damascus, ahead of Eid al-Fitr which marks the end of the Muslim holy month of RamadanA Palestinian woman prays on the third Friday of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on the compound known to Muslims as Noble Sanctuary and to Jews as Temple Mount in Jerusalem\u0027s Old CityIranian Shiite Muslims pray at the graves of soldiers who were killed during 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War, at the Behesht-e-Zahra cemetery, during the holy fasting month of Ramadan, just outside Tehran, IranA Palestinian man pours water on Muslim worshippers\u0027 heads to cool off in the heat, as others pray outside the Dome of the Rock at the al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem during the last Friday prayers of the Muslim holy month of RamadanAfghan women wait to receive food ration during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in HeratA Pakistani Muslim reads the holy Koran as he observes Itikaf at a Mosque, in PeshawarKashmiri Muslim women offer prayers as the head priest (not pictured) displays a holy relic believed to be hair from the beard of the Prophet Mohammed, during special prayers to observe the Martyr Day of Hazrat Ali, cousin of Prophet Mohammed, on the 21st day of Ramadan, at the Hazratbal Shrine in Srinagar, the summer capital of Indian KashmirIndian Muslims sit with bowls of porridge(Nombu kanji)as they prepare to break the fast with the Iftar meal during the Islamic month of Ramadan at The Wallajah Big Mosque in Chennai Spectators watch fireworks as a giant Fanous, or Ramadan lantern, is switched on four days before the start of Ramadan month in front of Mohamed al-Amine Mosque in downtown BeirutLebanese children perform during activities celebrating the upcoming Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in downtown BeirutPalestinian men drink tea on the promenade of Gaza beach Members of Nahdlatul Ulama, the biggest Muslim organisation in Indonesia, hold a mass prayer session to welcome in Ramadan in Jakarta Iraqis shop for food in a preparation for the Muslim holy month of Ramadan in BaghdadFoods is seen during \u0027Unggah-unggahan\u0027 ceremony to welcome in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan in Pekuncen villageIn the short term, yes, you might do, depending on how much you consume in the evenings.But given that your metabolism quickly adjusts to your calorie intake, you will quickly put the pounds back on afterwards when you return to your usual dietary regime.Looking beach-ready is not really the main goal of this solemn observance anyway.

Remember, this is a man who has intentionally tried to live on his own away from anyone he knows.”Prince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle – in picturesPrince Harry and Meghan Markle announce their engagement.Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at the Crown Liquor Saloon, Belfast during their visit to Northern Ireland.

Thomas says he doesn’t even drink beer ... he was buying it for the guards at the place where he lives.One commentator, Jane Merrick, the former political editor of The Independent on Sunday, has described this process as “attempting to tame the media”, and noted how it is often done in vain.As well as explaining himself to TMZ, Mr Markle revealed that he was in physical, as well as emotional pain. He said he had suffered a heart attack six days earlier, but had checked himself out of the hospital because, before the Mail on Sunday reported, he had been hoping to go to the wedding.The next episode was delivered later the same day.Mr Markle told TMZ he was going back to hospital because he was suffering serious chest pains.  And he knew who to blame.“He says the pains have been triggered by emotional upset,” TMZ reported.  “He specifically mentioned his oldest daughter, Samantha Grant, who has been shading Meghan in the weeks leading up to the wedding.“Thomas tells us, ‘I’ve been popping Valium for the pain, especially when I hear about my oldest daughter.’”Enter, then, Samantha Grant, mother-of-three, 53-year-old former actress and model rendered wheelchair-bound by multiple sclerosis, the half-sister of Meghan Markle.Exactly how well Samantha knows Meghan is a matter of some debate.  Samantha says she “helped raise” Meghan for 12 years when they were growing up in California other reports have claimed that however close they were in childhood, Meghan has not seen Samantha or any of her half-siblings for more than a decade.Be that as it may, Samantha felt qualified enough to announce in April 2017 that she would be writing a memoir sensitively entitled: “The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister”. Although it would, of course, be nothing like “some sort of slamming ‘tell-all’.”Instead, Samantha promised, she would “go through and recount some of the beautiful nuances of our lives, our family home.”These “beautiful nuances” were presumably nothing to with what happened in January when Samantha was quoted as responding to Meghan being photographed in a £56,000 designer dress by saying: “If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad.”Other apparent “shading” that may have upset Meghan and Samantha’s father came when the older half-sister realised she was not getting an invitation to the wedding.Last month Samantha reportedly tweeted: “Smoke and mirrors cannot hide the elephant in the room.“Out of respect and humanitarianism, the Markles should be invited if 2,000 complete strangers are.“Our uncle, brother, me, best friend of 30 years, nephews. Our issue is not a matter of closeness. Family is family.”Nor, if the gossip site TMZ can be believed, was Samantha the only one of Thomas Markle’s children to have upset him with comments about Meghan.As slowly became clear over the course of Tuesday.The morning episode had Mr Markle telling TMZ of a change of mind bought on by Meghan texting him to say she loved him and was concerned for his health.This, Mr Markle said, persuaded him that he should go to the wedding after all: “Of course I’d walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I’d like to be a part of history.”But then came the Tuesday afternoon instalment: Mr Markle wouldn’t be going to the wedding, he would be having heart surgery at 3.30pm UK time on Wednesday. TMZ reported that the doctors had discovered that the heart attack had done significant damage.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle attend the Invictus Games Reception (Getty)And then the website added a killer line: “BTW, Thomas also says he believes the open letter his son, Thomas Jr, wrote to Prince Harry discouraging him from marrying Meghan is what triggered his heart attack.”This was a reference to the letter written by Meghan’s half-brother Thomas Markle Jr, a 51-year-old glass fitter who last year hit the headlines for being arrested after an alleged drunken argument with his girlfriend.In a letter sprinkled with spelling mistakes and published by celebrity gossip magazine In Touch on May 2, Thomas Markle Jr appeared to tell Prince Harry it was not too late to cancel the wedding.Meghan, the half-brother seemingly told Harry, was a “jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you and the royal family heritage.”Somewhat improbably, Markle Jr seems to have followed up with a second letter, published by In Touch on May 11, which quoted him as suggesting to Meghan: “It’s not too late to send me an invite.”Slightly different in tone to the first message, this letter reminisced about “some great holidays together, even though we all didn’t share the same house”.As this suggests, mixing with what seemed perilously close to being the personal tragedy of Mr Markle senior, there was a strong element of farce.By Tuesday afternoon the sense of a circus had been completed by reports of bookmakers offering odds on who would walk Meghan down the aisle and by a cameo appearance from former tabloid editor Piers Morgan telling Samantha Grant she was a “media vulture”.And then more of Meghan’s extended family turned up.Tracy Dooley, the ex-wife of Thomas Markle Jr, arrived at Heathrow airport from Oregon accompanied by her sons Tyler, 25, and Thomas, 26.Meghan hadn’t invited her.  Ms Dooley, a florist who orced Thomas Markle Jr in 2001, has previously admitted she has not seen the bride-to-be for 20 years.But it was reported that the Dooleys had been recruited by ITV’s Good Morning Britain as “special correspondents” to report on the wedding from Windsor.ITV has yet to respond to The Independent’s request for comment on whether this is true, but the newspapers have reported that the Dooleys are thought be staying at a £70-a-night hotel in Waterloo, while Tyler has posted images on social media with the comment: “Just touched down in London!!! Man what a journey so far.”The Daily Mail informed its readers that Tyler works as a cannabis farmer in Oregon, where marijuana is legal, and is planning to bring out a new blend called “Markle’s Sparkle”.Meghan Markle’s extended family have been attracting headlines for all the wrong reasons (Getty)The royals may have defects of their own, but one is tempted to ask whether, with a family like hers, Meghan needs enemies.Meghan Markle’s father may have staged paparazzi photosMeghan Markle’s brother pens a second letter asking for an invite Prince Harry says paparazzi took photos of Diana dying in Paris tunnelThe sadness and farce alike are perhaps only intensified by the suspicion that despite all the column inches devoted to it – with this article as guilty as any other – this may be a soap opera served up for the amusement of a public that is only half-interested.A YouGov poll published as Tuesday’s stories unfolded suggested that 66 per cent of the British public were “not interested” in the royal wedding.Prince Harry’s precise thoughts as he prepares for what should be the unalloyed joy of his wedding can only be guessed at.  His anger at the paparazzi who hounded his mother, however, is well known.After Diana’s death, of course, there were solemn promises all round that nothing similar would ever be allowed to happen again.As he prepares for heart surgery, Thomas Markle may be entitled to wonder whether those promises have been kept.Prince Harry and Meghan Markle weddingor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The registration scheme was ridiculed last month after it emerge that iPhone users would not be able to use a scanning feature in the registration app, which would only be available for Android phones.“It was a pleasure to meet with Mr Javid today and I look forward to working with him closely in order to provide more certainty for both EU and UK citizens after Brexit. We agreed to work closely together to get this right,” Mr Verhofstadt said after the one-on-one meeting at the Parliament’s Brussels base.“I welcome Mr Javid\u0027s response to the European Parliament\u0027s concerns about the Home Office\u0027s proposed registration procedure for EU citizens in the UK and related matters, but at this time we do not believe our anxieties have yet been sufficiently addressed. We reiterate our belief that the registration process should, as a matter of principle, be cost-free. It is unacceptable that citizens who were never consulted on Brexit should have to pay to retain their existing rights.” He added: “MEPs remain concerned about the technological shortcomings of the proposed registration ‘app’ and the fact that any alternative is limited to sending passports by post only, the lack of clarity for vulnerable groups, the length of the process, the consequence of criminality checks and that families may not be able to register using one form.“The European Parliament has been resolute in pressing to further the rights of UK citizens in the EU, including in particular the right to free movement for UK citizen’s resident in the EU after Brexit.  As a Parliament, we are united in the belief that neither EU citizens in the UK or UK citizens in the EU should be punished because of Brexit.  Brexit so far: in picturesBrexit so far: in picturesBoris Johnson MP, Labour MP Gisela Stuart and UKIP MP Douglas Carswell address the people of Stafford in Market Square during the Vote Leave Brexit Battle Bus tour on 17 May 2016.

While supportive commissioners said doing away with cumbersome regulations would encourage innovation, critics warned the decision would undermine an open internet.In the months since, Democratic elected officials have pushed to invoke a law allowing Congress to reverse regulators, seizing on an issue that energises their constituents.

Sufficient care and rest during musth “will be ensured”the forests committee will meet at least twice a year – once just before festival season, when all violators should be reported “so that necessary steps are taken for ensuring the safety of the animals as well as that of the public”another meeting will be just after the season to take stock of implementation of the rules Wildlife wardens and forest chiefs discussed the problems at a meeting before issuing the new orders.Kerala has the highest number of festival elephants in India – thought to be about 500. Action for Elephants UK (AfE) has branded the state “ground zero for elephant torture”, and has called their illegal treatment “the worst case of animal cruelty in the world”. The plight of the 150 captive elephants in neighbouring Tamil Nadu is feared to be just as bad.For the six-month festival season, they are forced to walk for miles in searing temperatures on hot, stinging tar roads and ridden into noisy processions with fireworks. Some are carted from one festival to another – up to hundreds of miles – while still chained. Animal advocates say elephants are sensitive, intelligent and sociable creatures and rarely survive the “unrelenting neglect and torture” for a natural life. In the past seven years, 350 captive elephants have died. Often the water they are given falls short of the large quantities they drink in the wild, and many die of severe intestinal blockages. Campaigners staged a protest outside the Indian High Commission in London, coinciding with prime minister Narendra Modi’s visit to Britain, pleading for abuses to be policed.They said lucrative insurance claims provide incentives for owners to neglect their animals.Colourful processions can mask animal suffering (Getty)But the New Indian Express was concerned about the effect on tourism of the publicity about the elephants’ plight, saying the protest outside the High Commission in London added injury to insult.“For the Kerala Tourism Department, it seems it is a case of one step forward, two steps back, while it is trying to brand and market the state as a paradise for holidaymakers,” the Express website said.“State tourism director P Bala Kiran said this is a very serious issue and it will have long-lasting impact on the tourism sector of the state if not addressed properly.”The Kerala Tourism Department has decided to make films of elephant care and majestic festivals featuring the culture and tradition of the state to counter the bad publicity, the paper reported.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

They have been in negotiations since Thursday in a bid to fuse their differing policies into a workable joint platform to end a 10-week political stalemate.Berlusconi allowed to run again for election as Italy’s prime minister“It has been a very productive day,” 31-year-old Mr Di Maio told reporters on Sunday, following several hours of talks with his counterpart in Milan.  He said they were close to a “historic” agreement, but their choice of prime minister has not yet been announced and confusion remains over who it will be.The Five Star Movement won 32 per cent of the vote at the election and the League took 17 per cent, making them the two largest groups in parliament.The leaders both said their talks on Sunday made progress on a policy document which is likely to be tough on immigration and the EU. Mr Salvini has previous pledged illegal immigrants would be rounded up and sent home “in 15 minutes” if he and his allies take power.The two parties are said to have agreed on who would be prime minister but there has been no word on who would lead the proposed government, with neither Mr Salvini nor Mr Di Maio willing to let the other take the helm.The far-right leader argues that, although his party has far fewer votes, he represents a centre-right alliance that won the support of 37 per cent of the electorate. That alliance also includes former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi‘s party Forza Italia, which said during the election campaign it would use the police and the military to round up 600,000 undocumented migrants and deport them if it came to power.The League and Five Star Movement have been in discussions over nominating an independent figure to lead the government, without allegiance to either party.On Sunday, Mr Di Maio said the prime minister would be a “political” figure, rather than a non-partisan technocrat.A 71-year-old economist and university professor, Giulio Sapelli, said on Monday he had spoken to both leaders and would be willing to do the job as long as former centre-right economy minister Domenico Siniscalco was appointed finance minister.Mr Sapelli said another candidate for the prime minister’s job was also under consideration law professor Giuseppe Conte.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

His supporters successfully campaigned for social and political reform and against a corrupt and dysfunctional political establishment.It was the latest surprise in the career of a man who barely survived the murder of his father, the revered Shia religious leader Mohammed Sadiq al-Sadr, and his two brothers, on the orders of Saddam Hussein in 1999.Four years later, after the US invasion of Iraq, he was in danger once again of being killed, this time by American forces who twice besieged him in the holy city of Najaf in 2004.Mr Sadr will be very much the kingmaker – though he will have no official position – in the formation of a new Iraqi government.His coalition, which includes the Iraqi Communist Party, independents and secularists as well as his religious followers, appealed strongly to Iraqis who feel that, with the war won against Isis, they need to rebuild their country.The Iraqi prime minister Haider al-Abadi hoped to win the election – though no party was ever likely to win an absolute majority – by appealing to voters as the leader who recaptured Mosul from Isis last year.He followed this up with a largely bloodless reoccupation of Kirkuk, held by the Kurds since 2003, and the restoration of a large measure of government authority in Iraqi Kurdistan.The political movement formed out of the largely Shia paramilitaries, the Hashd al-Shaabi, which came second in the polls, had, like Mr Abadi, hoped to win more votes through their role in the war against Isis.Coalition led by nationalist cleric takes shock lead in Iraqi electionUS and Iran battle for influence in first post-Isis Iraq electionWomen brace for Iraq’s election after race marked by harassment What would Trump have done about Saddam Hussein? But the drop in violence to a level not seen since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein means that Iraqis are focusing on the theft by the political elite of hundreds of billions of dollars in oil revenues that should have been used to improve the supply of water, electricity, waste disposal as well medical care and education.Mr Sadr has been frequently underestimated as a political leader since he first emerged from house arrest in Najaf at the time of the US invasion.He was described by the western media as a ‘maverick’ or ‘firebrand cleric’, but his views were always more sophisticated and flexible than he was given credit for.The origin of Mr Sadr’s influence was his family’s role as religious leaders and the martyrdom of many of them, beginning with the execution of Mohammed Baqr al-Sadr in 1980.His father led a movement that appealed to the Shia poor of Baghdad and southern Iraq, combining religious revivalism with social and political radicalism. From the start, Sadrism had a strong element of Iraqi nationalism in opposition to all foreign interference in Iraq, be it American, British or Iranian.‘The near future of Iraq is dark’: Warning from Muqtada al-Sadr -In an interview with The Independent in Najaf in 2013 – the first he had given face to face to a Western journalist for 10 years – Mr Sadr spoke graphically of the ill effects of Iraq inviting in different foreign powers to try to solve its problems. He compared this to “somebody who found a mouse in his house, then he kept a cat, then he wanted to get the cat out of the house so he kept a dog, then to get the dog out of his house he bought an elephant, so he bought a mouse”,Mr Sadr created the Shia paramilitary Mehdi Army to resist the Americans. He was later to stand this down during the Sunni-Shia sectarian mass killings of 2006-7, saying that it had been infiltrated by people not under his control.He was denounced by the US as a pro-Iranian proxy, but he has made clear over the years that he opposes Iranian interference as well as that of other countries.The Sadrist success in the election this month will be unwelcome in both Washington and Tehran.The US had done everything it could to back Mr Abadi as a victorious war leader and a sort of Iraqi Winston Churchill – forgetting, perhaps, that Churchill lost the British general election in 1945.Mr Sadr’s influence over an incoming government in Baghdad puts in doubt the future of the 10,000 American troops and military contractors in Iraq, though a Sadrist spokesman said after the election that US training and the weapons procurement from the US could continue.World news in picturesWorld news in picturesPalestinians run away from tear gas shot at them by Israeli forces during a protest in Ramallah, in the occupied West BankA Palestinian demonstrator runs during a protest against the US embassy move to Jerusalem and ahead of the 70th anniversary of the Nakba at the Israel-Gaza border.A bullet hole on the window of a cafe in Paris, the day after a knifeman killed one man and wounded four other people before being shot dead by policeGermany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel looks on after receiving the \u0027Lamp of Peace, the Nobel Catholic award for her work of conciliation for the peaceful cohabitation of peoples at The Basilica Superiore of St Francis of Assisi in Italy.Police forensics investigate the death of seven people in a suspected murder-suicide in Australia.

When I interviewed him five years ago he warned against Sunni-Shia sectarianism and foreign interference. He said: “The Iraqi people will disintegrate, its government will disintegrate and it will be easy for foreign powers to control the country.” This prediction was to be fulfilled six months later when Isis took Mosul and the Iraqi army broke up.Mr Sadr said that sectarianism was spreading at street level and “if it spreads among the people, it will be difficult to fight”.Iraqi politics is still largely based on sectarian or ethnic identity – Shia, Sunni and Kurd – but the religious parties that were in the ascendant after 2003 have discredited themselves. The majority Shia community is also more confident, after its military victories last year, that it is firmly in control and is not going to be dispossessed from power.Mr Sadr said that the problem was that the Iraqi psychology had been shaped by a “constant cycle of violence: Saddam, occupation, war after war, first Gulf war, the second Gulf war, then the occupation war”.The election this month, in which so many voters gave priority to social rather than security issues, may show that, as violence ebbs, Iraqis are becoming less traumatised.or register with your social accountAlready have an account?

Rooms have been renovated, flowers planted in the design of the US flag and the seal of the US embassy has gone up.Security around the building has been upgraded, road signs installed and CCTV cameras set up in the area – all part of the renovations that President Trump says have cost a modest $400,000 (£295,000).After 14 months of rapid preparations, the consulate will be inaugurated to huge fanfare, with about 800 guests and a video address by President Trump beamed live around the world.The consulate building in Agron Road was constructed in 1868It was one of the first houses built outside Jerusalem\u0027s old city wallsThe original building had only two storeys a third was added in the early 20th centuryThe complex currently covers about 6,000 square metresPlans suggest it will be four times as big once converted, by the end of next yearRenovation work so far has cost £295,000The US government leases a second site in Jerusalem, in Nablus Road, providing visa services It will be a largely symbolic affair, however, because up to six more years of work are planned, including a 10ft perimeter wall, an opulent new chamber and several new floors – both upwards and underground – to house the 850 staff moving from Tel Aviv. Timed to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the founding of the state of Israel, the opening has been hailed as the beginning of a new quarter in Arnona, south Jerusalem, for embassies from countries around the world that will spring up there.We will soon see the true nature of Trump’s work in the Middle EastNew law allows Palestinians in Jerusalem to have residency strippedTrump says recognising Jerusalem as Israel’s capital ‘was wonderful\u0027“We might have to build dozens of embassies, and we would need new land ready for that purpose. I asked my ministry to vigorously take action as fast as possible, said construction minister Yoav Galant, The Jerusalem Post reported.Mr Galant even suggested possible names for the embassies area, the Post said. He initially called it “Embassy Town” but then decided he preferred “Trump Town” after the US president, who has deemed the city Israel’s capital. Ministers have already announced a new railway station near the Western Wall will be named after Mr Trump.The plan for the new consular facility was created and approved in little over a year thanks to the finance minister, Moshe Kahlon, exercising his authority to fast-track the process. And there will be celebrations aplenty on Monday.Many of those who know the site best, however, will not be joining in the festivities.When the rebuilding work begins in earnest, the embassy will be created in part by converting the Diplomat Hotel next door, which it also owns. The embassy will use the consulate building in the short term, but sources suggest the Diplomat is slated to house the embassy in the long run.For years, the hotel has been leased out as housing for about 450 elderly immigrants from the former Soviet Union. Now, the building is due to be demolished in two years’ time when the lease expires – and the residents have nowhere to go.Many of these men and women were doctors, musicians and academics in Russia before moving to Israel in the early 1990s, according to The Times of Israel. Some moved straight into the Diplomat and have never had any other home in the country. Most worked in minimum-wage jobs.Some of the former Soviet citizens are in their 90s and have had the anxiety of not knowing their fate hanging over them for four years, since they were warned in 2014 the hotel could close.Palestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinians clash with Israeli troops during mass demonstrationsPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers stand as Palestinian protesters gather on the Israel Gaza borderA Palestinian is carried on a stretcher after being injured during the demonstrationIsraeli soldiers take aim as they lie prone over an earth barrier along the border with the Gaza strip in the southern Israeli kibbutz of Nahal Oz as Palestinians demonstrate on the other side commemorating Land DayPalestinian paramedics evacuate an injured man on the Gaza side of the Israel-Gaza borderPalestinians demonstrate with crossed-out posters depicting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US President Donald Trump, during a tent city protest near Khan Yunis in the southern Gaza StripPalestinian protesters flee from teargas Israeli soldiers shoot tear gas grenades towards the Palestinian tent city protest commemorating Land DayPalestinian protesters take cover from Israeli troopsPalestinians chant slogans as they attend a demonstration near the Gaza Strip borderWhen Mr Trump announced in December the embassy would move, it prompted shock and concern among both allies and critics because of the city’s contested status.The Palestinians want their own state with a capital in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordanian control in 1967, and many countries have been reluctant to endorse Mr Trump’s idea.However, in a confident gesture in advance of the embassy move, officials changed its Twitter name from USEmbassyTelAviv to USEmbassyJerusalem.The complex currently covers 6,000 square metres but blueprints given to planning authorities show it eventually covering about 20,000 square metres or more – four times the size. The US State Department says the new purpose-built building will be ​​a long-term project.According to Ynet News, the website of Yedioth Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper, 20 planning companies and two New York firms were hired for the project. The US State Department usually employs selected American firms, but deviated from the norm by hiring an Israeli team, including architect Amir Mann and an Israeli contractor to carry out the work, it said.A five-storey structure was originally planned but to keep costs down the extra floors have not yet been completed, and the ambassador, David Friedman, will make only limited use of the embassy for now, using it for work but not yet moving in full-time.Both the Tel Aviv and Jerusalem consulates will provide passports and US visa services during the transition period.Neighbours have complained that the work, carried out under time pressures, could be environmentally unfriendly and risk going against planning and construction bylaws.But none is as worried as the 450 Russian residents.The job of finding a new home for them is down to Israel’s Immigrant Absorption Ministry.Ksenia Svetlova, a member of the Knesset, of the Zionist Union party, said the ministry has no set plan as to where or how the residents will be moved, and no estimate of potential costs or subsequent budget.She fears residents could be forced out before June 2020, when the lease expires.Just a few days before the historic opening of the beautiful United States Embassy in Jerusalem, Israel. So excited for the ceremony and proud of all the Embassy staff who worked so hard to make this event happen.

On Saturday at 11.59am precisely — these royal weddings really do run like Rolex watches — Thomas will meet his daughter at the West Door of St George’s Chapel, Windsor, and escort her to where her ginger Prince Charming is waiting.“Poor Pa Markle!” sighed one pundit. “A total nightmare!”I have a different prediction. This shy man with an allergy to publicity will tug on the heartstrings of the world at Meghan’s wedding to Harry.Because no matter how awkward it feels to be under the pitiless gaze of planet Earth, Thomas Markle is above and beyond all else, a proud and loving father.No matter how bashful his instincts may be, no matter how comfortable he was in obscure retirement in Rosarito, Mexico, I would bet my life that there was never a chance that he would miss his daughter’s wedding. Thomas Markle is clearly — and understandably — apprehensive about the big day.He has been seen in one of his local cafes in Mexico, head buried in a book called Images Of Britain. At an internet cafe, he stares with some bewilderment at the engagement photos of Meghan and Harry. But what father of the bride, any bride, would not feel a giddy cocktail of pride, anxiety and a touch of sadness at the prospect of walking his baby girl down the aisle?I doubt if he is enjoying the big build-up — having a wedding suit made to fit his bear-like frame, contemplating meeting the Queen, Prince Philip and the sprawling royal clan, and, horror of horrors, working out what to say when he rises to his feet to make that wedding speech.But Thomas Markle’s nerves about the big day do not make him a misfit or a freak. They make him gloriously human. Meghan Markle is loved because she brings some Hollywood flash to our staid, stoic, rather fusty Royal Family.But Meghan is also loved because she seems strangely familiar to us — a mixed-race child of divorced parents, divorced herself and a working woman who has fought hard for her success.Beyond the showbiz gloss, we have some understanding of the life of Meghan Markle. Because millions of our own lives are not so different.Because no matter how self-conscious this shy man feels taking to the global stage, his overwhelming emotions on his daughter’s wedding day will be love and pride. As any father of the bride will tell you, love and pride trump everything.IT is exciting news that Major League Baseball is coming to the capital for the first time next year, when the Boston Red Sox meet the New York Yankees at the London Stadium.  Mayor Sadiq Khan has worked hard to make this happen.WITH their fiery eyes and flashing thighs, female cadets in Vladimir Putin’s barmy Red Army look as though they are ready to invade somewhere.Possibly Stringfellows.WHAT makes Brexit inevitable is the total lack of respect shown to this country by Brussels since we decided to leave.German EU commissioner Gunther Oettinger sneers that Theresa May is “weak” and mocks Boris Johnson for having the same hair as Donald Trump.“That says everything,” sneers Herr Oettinger, 64, who once called a group of Chinese ministers “slitty-eyed” and has joked that gay marriage will become compulsory.And that says all you need to know about this buffoon. LABOUR’S Emily Thornberry has called for the Little Miss books to be renamed because they are sexist.“I don’t like this thing about being little,” says Emily. “I think that’s my problem with the Mr Men books.” Funny enough, that’s my problem with the Labour Party. The institutionalised sexism. The casual misogyny. The assumption that men should lead and the little ladies should tiptoe meekly behind.The Labour Party is at least as overtly sexist as the Little Miss books, Emily.The Tories are already on their second female Prime Minister while Labour have never even had a woman as their leader. Why not? It’s not as though the long line of miserable male mediocrities who have led Labour were much cop.It’s hard to believe that Barbara Castle or Yvette Cooper wouldn’t have done a better job of leading Labour than Foot, Kinnock, Brown, Miliband or Corbyn – who didn’t win one General Election between them.If Thornberry truly wants to prove that women can do anything that men can do, she should be demanding to know why no woman has ever led Labour in its 118-year-history.When washing down the next bacon butty, better stick to the decaffeinated coffee, Ed.SIR BOBBY ROBSON inspired the current managers of Manchester United and Manchester City, and inspired love in all who played for him from England to Barcelona, including Paul Gascoigne in his mercurial prime. Sir Bobby remains one of only two England managers to take our national team to a World Cup semi-final.The subject of a new feature film called Bobby Robson: More Than A Manager, Robson was clearly a wise and com-passionate man.In comparison, Sir Alf Ramse was a cold, distant and aloof figure with a robotic voice and a weird accent fabricated by elocution lessons. He went to school with my father – he should have talked like a Cockney, not the Duchess of Devonshire.But Sir Alf did it. He made the dream – that eternal dream of every England football fan – come true.So I have to beg to differ when Gary Lineker says that Sir Bobby Robson is the “best England manager of all time”. There is only one Sir Alf Ramsey.THE Met Gala is the most fashionable party in New York and this year the theme was Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination – inspiring a host of celebrities to bowl up in what looked like deeply religious lingerie. Rihanna was possibly a mini-skirted Pope or perhaps a cleavage-flashing cardinal. Katy Perry was an angel.Rosie Huntington-Whiteley had a golden halo and a neckline that skimmed her navel. Madonna wore a crown made of multiple crucifixes.It is true that these Big Apple fashionistas – the Met Gala is hosted by the editor of American Vogue, Anna Wintour – would not have taken the mick out of any non-Christian religion. But perhaps that is a compliment to Christianity. It can be mocked by empty-headed, attention-seeking celebrities and nobody gets a death threat. Perhaps all religions should be this tolerant.“I no longer want to continue life,” said Dr Goodall before he died. “I’m happy to have the chance to end it.”Every one of us should have that choice. Dr Goodall should never have been compelled to go to Switzerland.IN more than 50 years of going to watch football matches, I have still never had one of those mythical half-time pies. But man and boy, I have collected football programmes. What could be a more evocative memento of a match? An overpriced replica shirt? A polyester team scarf? A football programme is the next best thing to memories.But now, after more than a century of programmes being sold on match days, the English Football League will decide in June if it will continue to make it compulsory for clubs to produce them.In the age of social media, the death of football programmes makes sense, although 600,000 of them are still sold every weekend. But there will be a little less magic in the world if they are allowed to die.I still have my treasured copy of England v West Germany in the World Cup Final of 1966. Second-hand editions go for anything from £10 for a fake to £10,000 for the real thing.But to me, that programme is priceless.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Because it is supported by wooden peers.”The second chamber that acts within constitutional conventions is beneficial and helps prevent the “elected dictatorship” that our system of government can create.Asking the Government and the House of Commons to think again is both reasonable and valuable — it also has a distinguished history.As long ago as 1539, when Henry VIII was at his most powerful, the Lords amended his Act of Proclamation, which would have allowed monarchical despotism.This is the first example I know of the Upper House acting successfully as a revising chamber and preserving the nation’s liberties. The legislation was so ineffective that it was repealed eight years later.It is that act which spawned the expression “Henry VIII powers”, now used to describe the ability of ministerial action to amend the law.In the EU Withdrawal Bill, it is wholly unexceptional for the Lords to seek to reduce the number and extent of the Henry VIII powers available to the Government.These are technical issues when it is a matter of judgement as to where the balance between efficiency and process lies. It is not an attack on the democratic process or a power grab by an unelected chamber.This is not true of some of the other amendments passed against the withdrawal bill. There is a rule that the Lords does not oppose manifesto commitments.It was introduced in the 1940s to stop an inbuilt Tory majority blocking the then Labour government’s programme.It has relevance of a particular kind today when a Labour and LibDem majority could vote down any government proposal it dislikes.As was found in the 1940s, the Lords needs to observe this self-denying ordinance if it is to maintain credibility, otherwise it quickly becomes a matter of Peers against the People.In trying to insist on the UK remaining in a customs union, the Lords has overturned a specific manifesto promise by the Conservatives. Removing the date of departure — March 29, 2019 — similarly overturns an implicit guarantee in the same document.These are two of the most egregious breaches of the convention and raise the question: What is the Lords for?Tomorrow, it may be about to get worse. There is an amendment to the Data Protection Bill to require the Government to carry out Part Two of the Leveson Inquiry.This is in the name of Baroness Hollins, who has every right to feel her family was badly treated by the Press. And although I disagree with her, she deserves considerable sympathy because of what happened.Nonetheless, she is on dangerous constitutional ground.Page 80 of the Tory party manifesto says: “Given the comprehensive nature of the first stage of the Leveson Inquiry and the lengthy investigations by the police and Crown Prosecution Service into alleged wrongdoing, we will not proceed with the second stage of the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practices and ethics of the Press.”This could not be clearer, yet the Lords are contemplating legislating to force this second stage upon the nation. It is a clear and outright tearing up of conventions.Unfortunately, it is even more serious than an arrogant desire to overrule a manifesto commitment — it is a proposal for the Lords to do the opposite of what it is there to do.The Lords ought to protect the liberties of the country against attempts by the government to erode them.It used to do this when it opposed extensions to detention without trial or efforts to reduce freedom of speech.Now it is suggested it will do the reverse to make our media less free and to ignore fundamental rights of justice.In just four years, the UK has already fallen ten places — from 30th to 40th — in the global rankings for free speech.Dozens of journalists have been put on trial and mainly acquitted for the reporting of stories involving the police and other public officials.The Leveson Inquiry was used to put journalists in the public pillory and now it is proposed that this should happen all over again.People who have been acquitted of a crime have nothing further to answer for and to demand they go on oath to rehash issues settled by a jury is the type of bullying of the Press normally seen in totalitarian states.If Lady Hollins’s amendment were passed, it would be giving in to the vested interests of the rich and powerful to punish newspapers which had exposed their peccadilloes.It would deter the Press from such fearless reporting in future and would be an attack on one of our most ancient and precious freedoms, a pillar of our constitution.A free Press must not be bullied or harried by those who do not like what it reports or else self-censorship will be the rule of the day.Fundamental questions will arise about the Lords if it ignores the constitutional conventions, sets Peers against the People and, instead of being the bulwark against an over-mighty Government becomes the cheerleader for censorship.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She needs to solve the housing crisis.The number of people renting in their 30s, 40s, and 50s has nearly doubled in the past decade. Home ownership is at a 30-year low.The average home costs almost eight times average earnings, 11 in London.Brickies and nurses need six- figure deposits to get on the ladder.New Housing Secretary James Brokenshire needs to get radical to solve the issue.The Treasury should find the cash to unleash a building programme.Archaic planning laws need to be scrapped, too. The housing crisis cannot be fixed without building on some of the Green Belt.Construction firms who sit on land to keep supply low and prices high should also be fined to force them to build.The Government was right to slash stamp duty for first-time buyers, but it needs shaking up across the board. Cutting it would encourage older people to downsize and help families upsize.Most people under 40 are not socialists, just smitten by Jeremy Corbyn’s promise of freebies. They are aspirational hard-workers, who want a home to call their own. Many are the people Mrs May once called those “Just About Managing”.House reforms are vital for the future of the Tory Party.

It is enforceable.If foam-flecked ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband gets his way, we won’t be able to write it, either.We won’t be able to expose silly hypocrisy like this, let alone the misdeeds and corruption of those who abuse their power over us.We could soon be kissing goodbye to 300 years of Press freedom, the cornerstone of democracy.Red Ed’s campaign to curb newspapers might be applauded by the young voters Labour is seeking to cultivate — ­millennial “snowflakes” who cannot be in the same room as someone with a different point of view.They demand “safe spaces” to protect their sensitive souls or, better, a total ban on speakers they dislike.The attack on Press freedom by Labour — and, to their ­eternal shame, some Tories — is simply a monstrous extension of this intolerance.How can we have come within nine votes of state ­censorship?Soon we may be breaking a law if we fail to say “please” or “thanks” to ­someone who labels themselves a “victim” or a “survivor”.Survivors used to be people who escaped mortal danger.Today, they include anyone ­subjected to heavy-handed ­flirtation or mild embarrass-ment.This is one-way traffic.Self-proclaimed victims or survivors can say anything they like. They are exempt from ­criticism.Only whites can be racist.

They can sniff ­hypocrisy.So it is refreshing to see, in poll after poll, they put those evil Tory scum running this country ahead of saintly Jezza’s Labour Party.Can I say that?Tessa’s political achievements were significant, not least London’s 2012 Olympics triumph.But what set her apart was her role as good- natured peacemaker and cross-party conciliator.In the Blair-Brown years she was a smiling bridge builder for the embattled Blair government, not just with the press but with members of other ­parties who now mourn her death.This talent is now vanishingly rare.Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour could learn a lot from her example of old-fashioned give and take across the political divide.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It took only days for peers to resurrect it.Another inquiry would be an obscene waste of time and money and serves no purpose. The public do not want it. Even  opposes it.It’s not hard to see why some peers might have a vested interest in silencing the media.Some have been exposed by the Press for wrongdoing — whether it was fiddling their expenses or having extra-marital affairs.And many of the Labour peers rooting for it believe their party has been unfairly covered in the media.They want newspapers they can tame into giving them an easy ride. Well, that is not the role of the Press in a democracy.The Leveson inquiry and subsequent police probes cost taxpayers more than £48million after dozens of failed trials against journalists.Leveson’s 2012 report ran to 1,987 pages and contained over a million words. What do these peers seriously think is left to learn?They are foolish, too, to think the media landscape looks as it once did. Today, Facebook and Google dominate. Most newspapers belong to IPSO, a self-funded, independent regulator that holds the Press to account more than any regulator before.Then again, this is not really about probing the relationship between cops and the Press, or phone-hacking. That is a Trojan horse.These politicians, with their celebrity pals at Hacked Off, really just want to see newspapers neutered. This must not be allowed to happen.Traditionally, the House of Lords respects the Government’s manifesto commitments. The Tory manifesto said they would not pursue the second part of Leveson. That peers have so recklessly binned a constitutional convention is disgraceful.Britain has slumped in the global ranking for free speech. In the past four years, we have fallen from 30th to 40th. “Leveson 2” would mean we shamefully fall even further.Our free Press may not be perfect, but it noisily holds power to account. Our country is all the better for it.No one who values liberty would have it any other way.BRITISH politics has lost one of its good guys.The outpouring of tributes for Tessa Jowell highlights how widely she was admired as a politician and, more importantly, as a person.

Leaving ANY part of the EU is “Hard Brexit” now. It is laughable.Who do they imagine would tell 17.4million people their votes were to be ignored?Not Miliband, hiding in Manhattan.These Remain ultras are blind to the obvious: that the story has moved on.And that — while the nation is divided and Brexit negotiations are struggling — THEY are largely to blame, for laying siege to the referendum result itself.Their every word stokes division, helps Brussels and harms Britain.MPs must kill the second Leveson Inquiry.There is simply no case in this new, transformed media landscape — far more tightly regulated, yet dominated by UNREGULATED tech giants — for yet another public examination into alleged wrongdoing long ago.

The Kremlin, he says, is guilty of “criminal thuggery” and covers its tracks with “bare-faced” lies.This should be indisputable. But Labour is now run by the gangster state’s apologists.

Everyone cheers.He does a fist pump to his mates and she pulls down her boob tube, flashing her breasts at her girlfriends.The same guy went on to have sex with five other women that evening.By the end of the night he was rubbing cocaine on his willy to try to maintain an erection.Over one summer I saw people having sex on stage, witnessed vast quantities of alcohol downed in seconds and dodged more puke on pavements in one hour than an A\u0026ampE nurse cleans up over New Year’s Eve.It might sound depraved and debauched but the fortnight rite of passage ensured those same kids returned home as smarter and wiser adults.Over the years I have made ­countless 18-30-based documentaries around the Med.The behaviour is wilder and more X-rated than any brochure can suggest — without it being relegated to the top shelf.That’s why I am gutted that there is a question mark dangling over the experience Club 18-30 owners Thomas Cook said this week it is “exploring options” for the brand’s future, including a possible sale.Naysayers may comment “bloody good riddance” to the iconic institution that sticks two fingers up to political correctness. But I disagree.Back in the Eighties and Nineties there were no low-cost flights to Alicante or flight-comparison websites.Instead the entire package tour was laid on for you — and there were zero complaints.The hotels were laughably basic. The food was about as foreign as a Maccy D’s.The pools often had more than lilos floating in them. But none of that mattered.The “factory fortnight” annual leave was when things really kicked off in resorts such as Ibiza’s San Antonio and Corfu’s Kavos.When the night flights churned out the up-for-it guys and girls, most didn’t bother going to bed.When you arrived the reps flogged you the tours that went with the holiday — the bar crawls, booze cruises and wet T-shirt contests.In reality, the price of the add-on excursions doubled the cost of the holiday. But no one cared because to decline was to miss out on the opportunity for lots of sex.Sex underpins the 18-30 experience and the games designed by the reps encourage it.Whether it is passing a water-filled condom down a line using only your thighs, or timing who can put the condom on an oiled courgette the quickest.To be a holiday rep you need the drinking stamina of an elephant and the energy of the Duracell bunny. Many burned out or got kicked out and sent back to the UK. Holiday reps aren’t supposed to shag one another — obviously that rule goes out the window the second the plane lifts off from Britain.In every resort I have filmed at, the reps have kept score of the ­number of women they had sex with. Did the girls know this? Absolutely. Did they care? No.Is it a suspect institution rotten to the core? Nope. What I saw is that underneath the sex, the dubious games and the round-the-clock drinking was an 18-30 safety net that protected men and women on ­holiday. The bar crawls were staffed by dozens of reps ensuring everyone got safely from one pub to another.Admittedly by the end of each bar crawl it wasn’t unusual to see couples attempting to have sex against the bar, someone crashed out on the pavement in his urine-stained jeans or a girl face down in a goldfish-sized cocktail bowl of her own vomit.But the purpose of the night was to consume enough shots to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool — and make it out alive afterwards.The opportunity for sex is jumped on every minute of the day. I made the mistake of meeting the groups I was filming for a morning-after catch-up.I soon stopped using my universal door card key — because I’d often interrupt a couple in the kitchen, the loo or even on the balcony going at it hell for leather.The same women who prefer the missionary position and the lights off in the bedroom back in the UK don’t give a monkeys when they are away.It can be the only reason so many willingly enter the wet T-shirt competitions.My theory is the more that a girl says “no way” the more likely you are to see her on stage, arms in the air, egging the crowd on with her soaked top clinging to her braless boobs.Us Brits are certainly not afraid to get wet and wildInclude a contact number and any pics when emailing into features@the-sunWho are we to judge if — for some women — there is something empowering about a bloke pouring a jug of water over her nipples? No one was forced to do it, either.While filming a beach sunrise, I got used to seeing women doing the walk of shame to their hotel. Sick in their hair, one shoe missing but usually with a cheeky smile on their faces. Sloping off to do the deed in the dunes And the beaches get busier when the sun goes down. While on a pub crawl it is easier to slope off to the sandy stretches than it is to bonk in an awkward, tiny loo with pee all over the floor.We could always tells those who had done the deed in the dunes — bites on their legs and sand burns on their knees. My favourite nights to film were out with groups of girls. “We’re not here for a long time, we’re here for a good time!” was the motto of one lot I followed.Make no mistake. Every girl had already earmarked their target.Getting ready and the female camaraderie was just as important as the night out itself. And if you didn’t get laid? You always had a mate to walk back to the apartment with. Perhaps the most outrageous nights were the foam parties.When the soapy liquid was fired over the dance floor it was as though a “have sex now!” klaxon had sounded. Clothes would regularly be lost in the foam. More than once I saw women in a panic because after the foam had evaporated they had nothing to wear to go home in.It wasn’t all sex, either. During one season a couple had a holiday romance and got engaged on the dance floor. On another island I’ve seen a holiday rep have the confidence to come out. For those who went home without a tan it was to be celebrated.But in the middle of the chaos, these holidays are a rite of passage that forge friendships, teach kids about responsibility and let them make the mistakes that turn teenagers into adults — and I for one am sad to see them go.FOR decades Club 18-30 promised a debauched week of sun, sea and sex.For many it was their first ever trip abroad, delivering cheap, basic accommodation and the freedom to misbehave with impunity (and no chance of an embarrassing Facebook post alerting folks back home).Fast forward through the decades and today’s Millennial youngsters are light years ahead of their parents. They’ve been on umpteen foreign holidays with their families and got used to decent hotels and great pools.So now our sophisticated young travellers are looking further – and wanting more. The success of TV show Love Island conjoured up the paradise excess they all wanted to emulate.Add to that Instagrammers bragging about their global travels and Snapchat feeds full of celebs living it large in luxury and today’s youngsters aren’t satisfied with a dodgy 2H hotel in Malia and a pub crawl up Bar Street.Today’s youngsters with limited budgets are savvy enough to know how to book a holiday on one of the many online travel agencies.Thomas Cook is now targetting the Millennials with money who want to be seen in the right resorts with plenty of selfie-perfect settings.It’s new Cook’s Club hotels – the first of which will open in Crete this summer – will offer urban-cool, stylish rooms, decent food and chilled tunes around a signature pool.Thomas Cook wants to ditch the lower end of the market to concentrate on those aspiring Millennials prepared to dig deeper to emulate their social media idols.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

A senior female member of staff discovered “inappropriate material of a sexual nature” in their station cupboard.That is, she found a pair of novelty tea mugs which featured nude women with the crew members’ heads super-imposed on them.They had swapped them as secret Santa gifts.Four other crew members have resigned in protest at the sackings, locals have started a petition to reinstate the pair and long-term donors have threatened to withdraw funding. But the RNLI insists it has not gone overboard. A statement claims the incident was “not trivial” as the saucy mugs presented a “safeguarding breach”.“Safeguarding” in this context clearly has nothing to do with the physical safety of those at risk of drowning, ostensibly the remit of the RNLI. One of the offenders had 15 years’ experience of saving lives at sea, which he is now forbidden to make use of.Apparently, safeguarding the emotional safety of any potential offence-taker is more important. Similarly, few will be surprised to hear of a humour deficit in academia. But one incident shows that a poorly received joke is no laughing matter.At the annual meeting of the International Studies Association (ISA) in San Francisco, some scholars found themselves in a crowded hotel lift. Simona Sharoni, a professor of women’s and gender studies at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, offered to press the buttons for her colleagues.Richard Ned Lebow, a political scientist at King’s College London, jokingly asked to be let off at the “ladies’ lingerie” department. It was a fairly standard, if old-fashioned, gag. But Sharoni claims that “as a survivor of sexual harassment”, she was “quite shaken by this incident”. Later that day she lodged a formal complaint.Hearing she had done it, Lebow attempted to reach out to her, writing that: “Like you, I am strongly opposed to the exploitation, coercion or humiliation of women.”However, making such a “frivolous” complaint, he argued, risked diverting attention from “the real offences that trouble us both”. By describing the obviously frivolous complaint as frivolous, he aggravated matters further, it seems. Sharoni hit back, saying she “cannot and will not remain silent when misogyny is at play”.She was not alone in confusing a harmless attempt at humour with a hatred for womankind.Last week, the ISA upheld her complaint, ordering Lebow to write an “unequivocal apology” for his “offensive and inappropriate” joke or face disciplinary action.To his credit, he has refused to comply and denounced the ISA’s ruling as a “horrifying and chilling example of political correctness” that “encourages others to censor their remarks for fear of retribution”.No reasonable adult of sound mind, with any experience of real life, could possibly find Lebow’s joke about ladies’ lingerie offensive, let alone misogynistic. But policing of such saucy jokes is more common than you would think.Free Speech University Rankings, recently revealed by online free speech website Spiked, showed some British universities and students’ unions have bans on offensive jokes and banter — usually as part of their policies against sexual harassment.And it is not just jobsworth bosses, snow- flake students and highly strung academics taking offence at harmless banter — as saucy puns can even become a police matter. A butcher in Staffordshire was recently rapped by the police for the innuendo-laden signs outside his shop.Slogans promoting “big-breasted birds”, “big cocks” and offers to “have your rump tenderized” have adorned his boards for ten years. No member of the public felt sufficiently offended to complain to the police in that time.Nevertheless, the local police chief inspector warned the butcher to “give careful consideration” to his slogans, in case anyone takes offence in future. The joyless claims that smutty humour constitutes sexual harassment, a safe- guarding breach or any tangible harm whatsoever, are certainly worthy of ridicule.But when jokes no naughtier than Victorian postcards can see people disciplined and sacked, and innuendos no saucier than a Carry On one-liner draw the attention of the police, we need to get serious about defending smut.Fraser Myers writes for spiked-online, where this article also appears.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He had told friends that he wanted to come with the peace gesture for an appeasement before the wedding and his daughters big day, but his recent actions have crushed that.The source added: The couple were also at odds with one another because of his other children speaking out so disrespectfully about Meghan in the last year.She had asked him to have them not do so, but little changed.Their divorce was quite acrimonious, and they really lived very separate lives and would only connect when necessary.Meghans estranged family certainly havent been shy at speaking out about the US actress ahead of the royal wedding.Her half-brother Thomas Jr even wrote an open letter to Prince Harry, telling the 33-year-old royal to call off the upcoming nuptials, blasting it as a fake fairy tale.Thomas letter, published in In Touch Weekly, warned: As more time passes to your royal wedding it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal history.Half-sister Samantha Markle has also not held back in discussing Meghan and was even labelled a vulture by Piers Morgan for continually criticising the actress.After Meghan wore a £56,000 designer dress for her engagement photo, Samantha Markle, 52, said: If you can spend $75,000 on a dress, you can spend $75,000 on your dad.Some family members are also expected to cash in on the Royal Wedding, with a Channel 4 documentary giving an insight into Prince Harrys future in-laws.Her family members were also pictured arriving in London, drafted in as special correspondents for Good Morning Britain for the big day.But Meghans support system has also started to fly into the UK, with best pal Jessica Mulroney arriving at London Heathrow last night.The support couldnt come at a better time for Meghan, with the US actress having had to beg her dad to come to her wedding after TMZ revealed he would not be walking her down the aisle.The 73-year-old recluse had initially intended on being by his daughters side but pulled out after it was revealed he had staged photographs with paparazzi - later admitting they were stupid and hammy.He soon changed his mind, telling TMZ: I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle.”But he again did an about-face, revealing that he needed urgent heart surgery and would not be able to fly to the UK for the wedding - or to meet his future son-in-law and the royal family.Thomas later said that he believed Doria would be a good choice to walk Meghan down the aisle.Yoga instructor Doria, who has already met Prince Harry, is described as a free-spirited clinical therapist who has been by her daughters side for  a number of events.Ladbrokes has since put it at 4/6 odds that Meghans mum Doria will be by her side when she walks down the aisle, while Prince Charles is tipped at 2/1.The Duke of Cambridge has also been tipped to step up to the plate, with 5/1 odds of walking Meghan down the aisle, while there have been a flurry of bets predicting the US actress would walk down the aisle alone."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict0004008816471.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thomas markle jrs letter prince harry royal wedding","story":"Her half-brother went so far as to warn Prince Harry not to marry the US actress - although he has since said he wrote it in a moment of madness.In an explosive open letter, Meghans estranged relative slammed the wedding as a fake fairy tale.The man who shares a father with the Suits star addressed the 33-year-old royal with: Dear Prince Harry, Its not to late, Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you.As more time passes to your Royal Wedding, it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in Royal Wedding history.Im confused why you dont see the real Meghan that the whole world now sees.Meghans attempt to act the part of a princess like a below C average Hollywood actress is getting old.The letter was published in In Touch Weekly after Markle Jr wrote it on April 26, just weeks ahead of his half-sisters big day.After slamming her relationship he later wrote a new open letter to Meghan at the beginning of May - sharing fond childhood memories and wishing her well for the big day.The 51-year-old, from Oregon, claimed Meghan abandoned their father Thomas Markle Sr, despite him pouring money into her career when she first started out.He wrote: What kind of person starts out by using her own father until hes bankrupt, then forgets about him in Mexico leaving him broke, over mostly all her debts.And when its time to pay him back she forgets her own father like she never knew him.The lack of a wedding invite for Thomas also appeared to be a sore spot, as he added: Not to mention, to top it all off, she doesnt invite her own family and instead invites complete strangers to the wedding. Who does that?But he added: Meghan is still my sister, she is family. So whatever happens is up to her, whether she wants to forget knowing me or the rest of her family, family comes first.On May 16, Thomas Jr reportedly backtracked on the explosive letter, describing it as a moment of madness.Telling The Mirror that he penned it after reaching breaking point, he said his sister would make the perfect modern princess and wished her every happiness.He described how he had been trying to get help from Kensington Palace due to the overwhelming attention his family has received since the pair began dating - but says it fell on deaf ears.Tom said: It wasn’t designed to humiliate Meg into inviting me, but more hoping we could get the help we needed.Ever since her relationship with Harry emerged two years ago, our lives have been changed forever.He said all he hopes for now is to see his sister happy as he wished her and Harry well as he admitted being extremely proud his family was part of history.The 51-year-old added: “My sister’s going to be one of the best things ever to have happened to the royal family.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

the way he drags up his association with her in a sickly kind of perverse way, makes my skin crawl.Another pointed out: Why is Paul Burrell being interviewed all the time. If he was *that* close to the royal family he’d be invited to the wedding wouldn’t he.Another simply added: Apart from fact hes an absolute leech, he is not relevant.Burrell began his royal career as a footman for the Queen when he was 18, inspired to work for the monarchy after a childhood visit to Buckingham Palace from his coal-mining hometown Grassmore, Derbyshire.The 59-year-old became a close confidante of the princess, who once described him as her rock.He divorced his wife of 32 years, Maria, in 2016, to wed boyfriend Graham Cooper on April 3, 2017.Burrell came under fire in 2008, during an inquest into Dianas death.It had just emerged he secretly copied letters between her and other members of the royal family.He told the hearing it was for historical importance, but was accused of being a porous rock."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406638634.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"koku istambulova worlds oldest woman age russia","story":"If true, the claims would mean Koku Istambulova was already 27 when the last tsar Nicholas II abdicated.She would also have been 55 when World War 2 ended, and 102 when the Soviet Union collapsed a generation ago.But the claims are dubious as she would also have smashed the global record for the oldest person who ever lived by some six years.The claim is made by the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and is based on her internal passport which shows her date of birth as June 1, 1889.Koku and her family were deported after World War 2 along with the entire Chechen nation to Kazakhstan and Siberia by Stalin who accused them of Nazi collaboration.Asked how she lived so long, Koku, from a village in Chechnya, who claims she will be 129 next month, told an interviewer:  “It was God’s will – I did nothing to make it happen.“I see people going in for sports, eating something special, keeping themselves fit, but I have no idea how I lived until now.”And she added:  “I have not had a single happy day in my life.“I have always worked hard, digging in the garden.“I am tired.Long life is not at all God’s gift for me – but a punishment.”Relatives say five years ago she lost her only surviving daughter Tamara who lived until she was 104.She doesn’t speak about her family tragedy but she lost several children, including a son aged six.She is articulate and able to feed herself and walk, but her eyesight is failing.Koku said: “I survived through the (Russian) Civil War (after the Bolshevik revolution), the Second World War, the deportation of our nation in 1944 and through two Chechen wars.“And now I am sure that my life was not a happy one.“I remember tanks with Germans passing our house. It was scary.“But I tried not to show this, we were hiding in the house.”Officials say all her documents were lost during the Second Chechen War from 1999 to 2009.The pension fund, a state body, claims there are 37 people over 110 years of age in Russia.But all these claims, including Koku’s, are impossible to verify because of the lack of reliable birth or early childhood written records.Since the death of 117-year-old Nabi Tajima in Japan last month, the oldest documented woman in the world is regarded as Chiyo Miyako, born on 2 May 1901, also from Japan.The oldest documented human lifespan is Jeanne Calment, from France, who lived 122 years, 164 days, dying in 1997."},{"url":null,"title":"theresa may jeremy corbyn brexit pmqs","story":"The PM blasted the Labour boss in the Commons after a string of shadow ministers expressed support for a re-run of the EU vote.And she warned that Mr Corbyn would “sell Britain out” in negotiations with Brussels if he ever got into power.The pair clashed in fiery exchanges at Prime Minister’s Questions - as the Labour leader accused the PM of being unable to unite her warring ministers.Mr Corbyn said: “When the Prime Minister wrote at the weekend that she wanted as little friction as possible, was she talking about EU trade or the next Cabinet meeting?”But Mrs May pointed out that shadow ministers Lord Hunt and Preet Gill both recently expressed support for a second referendum which could overturn the will of the people on Brexit.The PM said to Mr Corbyn: “This month the Shadow Health Minister in the Lords voted for a second referendum, at the weekend the Shadow Brexit Secretary refused to rule out a second referendum, and on Monday the Shadow International Development Minister tweeted in favour of a second referendum.“So perhaps when he stands up he could put the minds of the British people and this house at rest and rule out a second referendum.”The Labour boss responded by mocking Cabinet divisions over post-Brexit customs, saying: “If the Prime Minister cannot even convince her own Cabinet of a strategy, what chance does she have of convincing 27 other EU governments?”Mrs May reminded MPs that Mr Corbyn wanted to trigger Article 50 the day after the EU referendum - which would have left just two years to complete the whole Brexit process.She added: “What would that have led to? What Labour do every time they’re in government - they’d have sold Britain out.”The PM insisted voters “simply cannot trust” anything Labour say.And she also sent out a message to all MPs who are trying to backslide on the referendum result - saying: I consider it to be a matter of integrity of politicians that having given the choice to the British people, we should then deliver for them on that choice.Mrs May is currently trying to thrash out an agreement on what customs arrangement to push for once we have quit the EU.But Labour is also divided - with backbenchers pushing Mr Corbyn to support plans to keep Britain tied to the European single market.During todays PMQs, Mrs May also announced that the Government will pick up the full £400million bill for removing dangerous cladding from tower blocks in the wake of the Grenfell disaster."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nintchdbpict000406659776.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"fly tipping rubbish kensworth country lane","story":"Callum Chase, 25, says he and brother Conor, 23, intervened after spotting the group unloading mattresses and chairs from their van.Alongside a plumber known as Frank, they used their vehicles to block the men in until police arrived on the scene in Kensworth, Beds, on May 9 to take statements.Local council chiefs are now investigating with a view to taking possible legal action.Tree surgeon Callum, from Leighton Buzzard, Beds., said: The first hour was almost a constant argument with the men, about why they couldnt be fly-tipping and not realising at all why they were doing something wrong.Wed say, No you are not allowed to do that, and theyd reply, But there is rubbish already here - there were beer bottles, bags, etc.They kept saying they didnt do it all, only the mattresses and the chair.”They then rang up their boss Duncan Tomblin who arrived on the scene.A fifth man then arrived on the scene and joined in “friendly negotiation” which concluded with the men loading the mattresses and chairs back into their van.Duncan, 44, said: When the police turned up I thought they would seize the vehicle and arrest the three guys.I got really frustrated, as the police wouldnt take their van away.

Surprisingly good shape if you’re one of those Remainer banshees who said the entire country would be worth about two bob by now — no investment, no jobs, swarms of killer bees and plagues of locusts.Not a bit of it. Take employment. We now have the highest employment levels, and the lowest unemployment, for 42 years. We have an unemployment rate of 4.2 per cent.Would you like to know how our major European partners are getting on in that regard? Well, it’s 9.2 per cent in France, 10.8 per cent in Italy, a whopping 16.4 per cent in Spain and, of course, 20.9 per cent in chicken-in-a-basket case Greece.We’re even closing in on Germany, at 3.6 per cent.So that’s not bad for starters. Average earnings are at last rising, too. Inflation is down. Business investment is up.Better still, we are experiencing the kind of export boom we haven’t seen for a long time. A massive ten per cent increase in the past year.And for those who think this will all come to a halt when we actually leave the EU — um, no.The official statistics predict the boom is going to grow and grow. By 2020 it will have increased by 22 per cent. Much, much quicker than the growth in exports in EU countries.By then, of course, we’ll have an entire world to trade with, free of restraint.Assuming the Government doesn’t bugger it up by keeping us in the EU’s customs union.So, contrary to what you are often told, the news is all rather good for the UK.And there’s another country where the economy is looking pretty good, too.Donald Trump’s USA. The stockmarket is soaring to record levels. The economy is growing at a more than decent rate.But who have been the main winners of Trump’s presidency when it comes to the economy?Horrible rich white business-men, you might guess. That’s what was said when he won the presidency — he’d look after people like himself.Nope again. Dead wrong. The main beneficiaries have been the poorest of Americans. And in particular the blacks and Hispanics. Unemployment is down, employment is up.There are more black and Hispanic people in work than at any time under Barack Obama’s hopeless administration.Under Obama, the country was paying out record amounts in welfare benefits and food stamps for its black and Hispanic citizens.And if Trump manages to strike some kind of lasting peace deal with North Korea, he’ll deserve the Nobel prize.So here’s a prediction.Despite the toddler temper tantrums among Lefties whenever the name Trump is mentioned, despite the curled lip and sneer from BBC news reporters, the shrieking protest marches from thick-as-mince unwashed millennials, despite all that,I’ll bet you now that Donald Trump gets re-elected.But don’t expect to hear much about any of this on the BBC’s News at Ten.A NEW survey has discovered what British people worry about most.What is it? Maybe the spectre of Diane Abbott being Home Secretary? Global warming? Nuclear warfare? Or the black shadow of death hanging over their heads?Nope. It’s “not being in when a parcel is delivered”.Just how crap a worry is that? And people lie awake at night.Gripped by the terror that the Amazon delivery man might call round with the spare part for the hedge-trimmer when they’re down the shops.SO, you lot – you’re all gammons, apparently.That’s the name given by Jeremy Corbyn supporters to working-class people who voted for Brexit.You are dense lumps of pig meat. Which is often served with a fried egg and some chips. And a bit of pineapple on top.They coined the phrase because some of the Brexiteers seen on Question Time have red faces. OK.Many people have called this “racist”. Sometimes I think there is nothing in this world of ours which couldn’t be called racist by someone desperate to be offended.It’s not racist. But it tells you exactly what the Labour Party thinks of working-class people, doesn’t it?HERE we go again. England fans have been warned not to take the flag of St George with them if they go to support our lads in the World Cup finals in Russia.The police have told them the flag is too “imperialistic” and “antagonistic”.So, every other nation will be waving their flag. Just not us.Mind you, I think I’d give Russia a swerve either way.If the Russki thugs don’t get you, then the police will.And you’ll have difficulty telling them apart. Or you’ll end up looking like one of those glo-sticks children wave around.Wait until the tournament is held in a civilised country.(So that’s Qatar out too then).Listen, it’s just a matter of economics.Making a dress the size of a bleedin’ aircraft hangar costs more than it does to make a nice size 12. It uses more material.So either cut out the seven stuffed-crust pizzas you eat every day for your elevenses, plus the bucket of chicken wings.Or pay the extra price.MORE good news – the Government has voted down attempts to strangle the Press.There will be no new Leveson inquiry.What’s more, it looks like Tom Watson is going to give up on his ludicrous campaign to force newspapers to pay court fees even when they win legal proceedings against them.Tom dreamed this up presumably with help from his best chum, the former fascist Max “Beat me, beat me, Brunehilde!” Mosley.Dead in the water, Watson.THINGS In This World I Don’t Care Much About (No 1): Whether Meghan’s dad Thomas, makes it to the wedding or not. Yet it’s all I’ve heard about on the news recently.I’m not being mean. I hope they all have a lovely day.But I couldn’t give a monkey’s if Meghan was led up the aisle by her dad, or Piers Morgan, or a flock of cackling greylag geese.In truth, Meghan and the royals aside, does anyone else?ISRAEL has over-reacted in trying to control the Palestinians rioting by the border fence.It’s handed a huge propaganda coup to the racist terrorists of Hamas. They’re the ones who provoked the rioters. Told them to break down the fence and kill Jews.But all that gets forgotten when there’s TV footage of Israeli soldiers shooting people. Even if they are bombarded with Molotov cocktails.It’s still the case that the biggest barrier to peace is Hamas, not Israel.LIKE you, I’m working on my hip cleavage so I’ll look dead good on the beach this summer.I’m going to have my bikini bottom glued somewhere just below my armpits, in order to look like Bella Hadid or Genie Bouchard or Alessandra Ambrosio.It all reminds me of the old joke. Young bloke complains that no girls on the beach fancy him. Won’t even look at him.So his friend advises: “Put a couple of potatoes in your trunks. Then they’ll look.”Young bloke comes back the next day and says: “It’s even worse.

At the moment it’s a no, after reports say he is going to undergo heart surgery today.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: Unclear. Megan was understood to be in regular phone contact with her father in recent weeks, although on Monday he reportedly told American gossip website TMZ that he has not spoken to her this week.What he says: Very little. When approached earlier this year by a reporter asking if he would be giving his daughter away he replied: I’d love to. Other than that he has kept his silence.What Megan says: Nothing publicly – but a 2016 Instagram message posted for Father’s Day shows the affection in which she holds him: Happy Fathers Day daddy. I’m still your buckaroo, and to this day your hugs are still the very best in the whole wide world, she wrote.Royal Approval Rating: 2/10. There may be a sliver of sympathy from the Firm, but those paparazzi shots and his decision to pull out the wedding will have seen his status plummet.Name: Doria Ragland.Age: 61Who is she? Social worker turned yoga teacherInvited? Absolutely  – and may now be walking her daughter down the aisle.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: They speak on the phone every day and Doria will be staying with her daughter at Cliveden House the night before the wedding. At the moment she is staying with Harry and Meghan in their cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace.What she says:  Nothing so far – when first approached about her daughter’s royal romance in the early days she merely chuckled and said I can’t say anything. She has maintained her silence ever since – although she was spotted early this month at the home of Oprah Winfrey, with whom it is rumoured she is considering granting a tell-all interview.What Megan says: My mum has always been a free spirit...we can just have so much fun together, and yet, Ill still find so much solace in her support.And in a 2014 post she wrote: Dreadlocks. Nose ring. Yoga instructor. Social worker. Free spirit. Lover of potato chips \u0026amp lemon tarts. And if the DJ cues Al Green’s soul classic Call Me, just forget it. She will swivel her hips into the sweetest little dance you’ve ever seen. And you will smile. You won’t be able to help it. You will look at her and you will feel joy. I’m talking about my mom.Prince Harry is impressed too -  during the couple’s first sit down interview with the BBC he said her mum’s amazing.Royal Approval Rating: 9/10. Doria hasn’t put a foot wrong since news first emerged that her daughter was dating a British Prince.Name: Samantha GrantAge: 53Who is she? Former actress and model, now wheelchair-bound following a 2008 diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.Invited? No.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: According to Samantha her last contact with Megan was on the phone at the end of November 2014.  After that her sister got busy.What she says: What hasn’t she said? Only today, she claimed Meghan was behaving way out of her league.Samantha has granted a number of interviews in which she has made a number of digs at her half-sister and is busy writing a memoir called The Diary of Princess Pushy’s Sister.In her most recent broadside following  Prince Harrys comment that the Royals were the family Megan never had Samantha posted an acerbic tweet saying: She has a large family who were there for her. No one was estranged, she was just too busy.” This week she said she wasn’t  taking it personally that she hadn’t been invited.What Megan says: NothingRoyal Approval rating: 0/10. Samantha has broken the royal golden rule – keep your mouth shut.Name: Thomas Markle JrAge: 51Who is he? A window fitterInvited? NoLast Saw or Spoke to Megan: 2011What he says: Again  - a lot. Initially gushing about his half-sister, Tom quickly changed his tune and only last month penned an open letter to Harry telling him  it wasn’t too late to pull out of the wedding. He has now written another note begging for an invite to Saturday’s festivities – although the chances look remote.What Meghan says: Nothing.Royal Approval Rating: 0/10. As with his sister, Tom has failed to learn the first lesson: what goes on in the family stays in the family. The fact that he was arrested in January last year for allegedly holding a gun to a woman’s head during a drunken argument won’t have helped his cause either.Name: Michael MarkleAge: 78Who is he? Meghans uncle - and dad Thomas older brother. A former US diplomat, Michael spent 19 years working for the government and is now retired, living in Palm Bay, Florida. He also served in the air force. When Meghan was 20, Michael used his connections to help her secure an internship at the US embassy in Buenos Aires, Argentina.Invited? Nope, and hes not pleased about it.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: Unknown.What he says:  This whole invitation thing has not been played out very well. I’m upset and surprised about not being selected but if they don’t want me there, then I don’t want to go. Thats what he told the Mail On Sunday when he didnt get his invite to the big day. He did add, however, that hes very proud of his niece.What Megan says: Nothing public.Royal Approval Rating: 3/10. He may have helped Meghan out in the past, but hes doing his niece no favours now by criticising her guest list.Name: Frederick MarkleAge: 75Who is he? Brother of Meghan’s father Thomas and a bishop  - albeit with almost no congregation. As Bishop Dismas he presides over a ramshackle chapel in Sanford, Florida.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: UnknownInvited? No.What he says: Nothing – has refused to speak to the press. He is basically a real friendly guy but he doesnt go for new ideas. He lives like a hermit, his friend Barry Sterner has said.What Meghan says: NothingRoyal Approval Rating: 9/10. The Royals will be relieved that in a sea of loose cannons Frederick is one less relative to worry about.Name: Joffrey RaglandWho is he? A freelance graphic designer from Los Angeles, he is Doria’s half brother from her father’s second marriage to retired teacher Ava Burrows.Invited? Unclear.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: Unknown, although he is close to Doria and likely to be in touch.What he says: Nothing. He has given no interviews.What Meghan says: Nothing.Royal Approval Rating: 8/10. Given he lives in the showbiz capital of the US, the Royals are likely to be impressed he hasn’t cashed in.Name: Ava BurrowsAge: 63Who is she: Retired teacher and second wife – now widow - of Alvin Ragland, Doria’s father and Meghan’s grandfather. The former antique shop owner died in 2011 aged 80.Invited? NoWhat she says: Meggie marrying a prince? Whod have thunk? she said in a doorstep interview following news of her step-granddaughter’s engagement. Im kind of expecting a visit from the men in black suits [the FBI] to check us out. I guess it’s like your Downton Abbey – and we’re the folks downstairs.Royal Approval Rating: 5/10: Lukewarm.Name: Tracy DooleyAge: 52Who is she? The first wife of Meghan’s half-brother Thomas. Works as a creative advertising and marketing specialist and is a recovering alcoholic.Invited? No – but has arrived in London anyway and is believed to be covering the event for an American broadcaster. Shes been quick to post photos on social media of London landmarks, captioned Were here! Yay!Last spoke to Meghan: By her own admission, twenty years ago.What she says: I’ll be in the front row cheering them on. She has also proclaimed Peace, love and good works to Meghan and Harry.What Meghan says: NothingRoyal Approval rating: 3/10. Previously off the radar, Kensington Palace are likely to be keeping a close eye on her now.Name: Tyler Dooley.Age:  25Who is he? Meghan’s nephew via her half-brother and a cannabis farmer in Oregon. His new strain, Markle Sparkle is said to cost £206-an-ounce. Hes rumoured to be joining forces with his mother to set up the company, Royally Grown.Invited? No, but hes here in Britain anyway.Last spoke to Meghan: Three years ago.What he says: Weve been here from the beginning, her whole life, just always rooting her on and supporting her. He has also told Mail Online: Prince Harry enjoys a good party. I’d be happy to show them around if they ever come out here and educate them on the medicinal benefits of marijuana.What Meghan says: NothingRoyal Approval Rating: As above. Likely to to now be on Kensington Palaces radar.Name: Thomas Dooley, AKA TJAge: 26Who is he? Meghan’s other nephew via her half-brother. Tom works as a Dominos Pizza manager.Invited? No. The brothers have arrived in England along with their mum – fulfilling a promise Tom made in a television interview when he said he would probably come to the UK for the wedding even if he hasn’t on the guest list.Last spoke to Meghan: Three years ago, although its thought the nephews were closer with Meghan when she was younger.What he says: I’d probably come to the UK for the wedding – even if Im not invited. I am thrilled.What Meghan says: Nothing.Royal Approval Rating: As above. Low, but at least hes not using the royal brand to flog cannabis.Name: Noel RasmussenAge: 19Who is she? Noel is Meghans niece, the daughter of Meghans hyper-critical half sister Samantha Grant. Noel, who is estranged from her mum Samantha, is an anthropology student, living with her grandmother in New Mexico.Invited? Its unclear, but doesnt look likely at this stage.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: Noel hasnt seen Meghan since her mums graduation ceremony in 2008.What she says:  Noel has defended Meghan from her mothers criticism, saying her embarrassing relatives are ripping the family apart by feuding in public. She added: It’s in Meghan’s nature to be a good person and she won’t want any bad feelings. I’ve always really looked up to her, like a big sister I never had.What Megan says: Meghan has not said anything publicly about Noel, although Noel says the two were close when she was younger.Royal Approval Rating: Relatively high. Top bods at the palace may prefer closed mouths, but theyll be pleased someone is aware of the damage the family is doing.Name: Ashleigh HaleAge: 31Who is she? Ashleigh is Meghans niece, and Noels sister. She is an accomplished lawyer - and was reportedly the inspiration for Meghans Suits character, Rachel.Invited? A source claimed to the Express that Ashleigh is likely to play a role at the wedding. Noel has also said she wouldnt be surprised if Ashleigh was invited, so theres a decent chance.Last saw or spoke to Meghan: The same source told the Express that Ashleigh and Meghan have remained close, and catch up when they can.What she says: Nothing, publicly.What Megan says: Meghan has praised Ashleigh on social media, sharing photos of the pair together and voicing support for Ashleighs legal work. She posted on Instagram: Please help victims of human trafficking! Support @thegrayhaven (my niece, Ash, does pro bono work for them!)”. An earlier post showed a bouquet of flowers with the caption: The most beautiful flowers from my niece, Ash. xoxo”.Royal Approval Rating: High. Meghans younger relatives seem to have their heads screwed on, and Ashleys silence is good for the family.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The billionaire tech tycoon is expected in Brussels as early as next week despite refusing to appear before MPs in the UK. The meeting is likely to provoke fresh fury from the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, which has threatened to issue Zuckerberg with a summons which would force him to attend the next time he lands in the UK. It comes just 24 hours after Facebook bluntly told the committee Zuckerberg has no plans to meet with them. Zuckerberg will answer EU questions - behind closed doors - about the improper use of data of 87 million Facebook users by shamed data firm Cambridge Analytica . He is set to meet party leaders and members of the civil liberties committee to discuss the use of data in polls such as the Brexit vote.  European Parliament president Antonio Tajani said the 34-year-old would come to Brussels as soon as possible. In a tweet, Mr Tajani said: Our citizens deserve a full and detailed explanation. I welcome Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s decision to appear in person before the representatives of 500 million Europeans. It is a step in the right direction towards restoring confidence. Mr Zuckerberg\u0027s meeting with European Parliament group leaders will be held behind closed doors. But members of the civil liberties committee will have an opportunity a few weeks later for in-depth questions on issues of personal data protection in a public hearing with representatives of Facebook and other companies. The Parliament\u0027s President added: Particular emphasis will be placed on the potential impact on electoral processes in Europe.  Parliament\u0027s priority is to ensure the proper functioning of the digital market, with a high level of protection for personal data, effective rules on copyright and the protection of consumer rights. Web giants must be responsible for the content they publish, including blatantly false news and illegal content. Freedom must always be accompanied by responsibility. Today the Culture committee questioned the boss of AggregateIQ, a Canadian company which has become caught up in controversy over targeted online advertising for the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. AIQ had previously worked for SCL Group - the British company linked to Cambridge Analytica - on the presidential campaign of Donald Trump as well as Ted Cruz\u0027s unsuccessful bid for the Republican nomination. It had been recruited by Christopher Wylie, who later blew the whistle on the alleged misuse of Facebook users\u0027 information. The committee heard Facebook informed the Electoral Commission that AIQ ran 1,398 adverts on behalf of Vote Leave and other Brexit-backing campaigns between February 2016 and polling day on June 23.

Scientists, medics, engineers and other vital workers from outside the EU were all denied work visas. The Campaign for Science and Engineering obtained the bombshell data from the Home Office under freedom of information rules. The revelation piled fresh pressure on the Prime Minister, who was Home Secretary before she landed the job in Downing Street. The data showed that more than 6,000 requests for Tier 2 visas - for skilled workers from outside the EU - were rejected in the four months to March. They included 1,518 for doctor roles, 1,226 for IT and technology, 392 for engineering, 361 for other health professionals and 197 for teaching.  The impact of the Tier 2 cap of 20,700 a year is also hitting other sectors of the economy with the monthly quotas short of what businesses need. CaSE executive director Dr Sarah Main said: “Businesses and public services are being blocked at the last hurdle from recruiting the people they need.” Earlier this month Mrs May overruled Cabinet ministers pleading for the rules to be relaxed. Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb said the denial of visas “sends the message the UK is not interested in welcoming...talent.” A Home Office spokeswoman said: “The Government fully recognises the contribution international professionals make to the UK. However, it is important that our immigration system works in the national interest.” Meanwhile, Labour has said it would close down two controversial immigration detention centres in an end to Mrs May\u0027s “hostile environment” policy for illegal immigrants. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said an incoming Labour government would shut Yarl’s Wood in Bedford and Brook House near Gatwick Airport, and ban private contractors from taking on future contracts to run immigration centres.

The research of 2,000 Brits revealed more than half of adults consider a plain cheese sandwich - with no condiments or salad items - to be the best. Coming in a close second was ham and cheese followed by ham salad, with a classic sausage sandwich just missing out on the top three. Other popular sandwich fillings include Ploughman’s, egg and cress and tuna mayonnaise.  But while peanut butter and jam may be a favourite for our cousins across the pond, it ended up at the bottom of the list with just nine per cent of Brits enjoying the American classic. The findings by Warburtons also found Brits will eat an average of four sandwiches a week, with 82 per cent naming it their favourite lunchtime meal.  Seven in 10 reckon crusts should be left on with three in 10 choosing to cut their sarnie diagonally. It also emerged 25 per cent of Brits will change their sandwich eating habits depending on the occasion, with a quarter anticipating a more ‘premium’ sandwich choice for their picnic to commemorate the Royal Wedding this weekend.  The most popular superior sandwich to toast Harry and Meghan will be Coronation chicken, followed by BBQ pulled pork and chicken and pesto. But more than one in 10 believe the Queen will be nibbling her way through cucumber sandwiches on the big day, while smoked salmon and cream cheese is the most popular choice for the guests. A spokesman for Warburtons said: “It has been reported that some guests to this weekend’s Royal wedding will have to bring their own picnic, so we were keen to find out just how the nation takes its sandwiches.

It\u0027s broken with the traditions of nearly every stage of a royal wedding despite being thoroughly planned weeks, if not months, in advance.  The uncertainty of whether Meghan\u0027s father Thomas Markle will walk her down the aisle has continued for days - with latest reports saying he will not attend his daughter\u0027s big day. But while the build up to the wedding has been less than conventional, so too are Harry and Meghan\u0027s choices for how the day will look. In the latest insight into how they\u0027re breaking with tradition, it\u0027s reported they have opted for a very modern stand up reception.   Follow our wedding countdown here .    Shunning the wedding tradition of a formal sit-down meal, guests are believed to expect \u0027bowl food\u0027 - allowing them to mingle more easily.  The 600 guests invited to the reception will dine on traditional British classics , with seasonal produce.  Head royal chef Mark Flanagan said: All the British vegetables are just coming into season and that\u0027s been a point of focus for us.  Mr Flanagan added Harry and Meghan have been involved in every detail of choosing their menu - a stark contrast to Kate and William\u0027s wedding in 2011.   While the Duke and Duchess had an input in their food choices, it\u0027s thought the Queen largely decided what the menu would look like. The Queen is still the official host of the reception at St George\u0027s Hall in Windsor Castle - and we\u0027re presuming she will be offered a seat at the \u0027stand-up\u0027 reception. Continuing their break with tradition, Harry and Meghan are shunning another convention when it comes to their wedding cake.  The couple have chosen an organic lemon and elderflower cake with buttercream, as opposed to a heavier fruitcake with royal icing. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had two cakes on their wedding day, one traditional fruit cake and one chocolate cake at the request of William. Their reception was attended by around 650 guests, with a more intimate reception held later in the evening for 300 close family and friends.  Meghan and Harry will have around 600 guests at their first reception, followed by 200 close friends and family in the evening. In the biggest break with wedding tradition, Meghan could possibly be walked down the aisle by her mum Doria. After Thomas Markle pulled out the wedding following revelations he had worked with photographers to set-up shots, possibly in return for a fee, and reports he suffered a heart attack - Meghan was left with a gaping hole in a crucial part of her day.

Please pass this on to all your friends particularly the elderly who are falling for this terrible scam.” In another tweet he wrote: People are asking me if the crooks advertising bitcoins using me in their advert is legit . NO it is not. Do not part with a PENNY with these crooks. I warned last month how Bitcoin-Trader was claiming to have been the biggest investment winner in Dragons\u0027 Den history.

Now the crooks are using Lord Sugar\u0027s name in online plugs. One of the latest adverts appeared on a Yahoo email page alongside a picture of Lord Sugar the text read: “Sad ending to The Apprentice” with a \u0027read more\u0027 button.  Clicking through leads to fake news site RushDailyNews and the equally fake story headlined: “Lord Sugar Abandons The Apprentice For New Software That Will Benefit Every British Citizen.” Outrageously, the story goes on to carry another picture of him with the caption: “Lord Alan Sugar explains why Bitcoin Trader is the the future of crypto currency”.  Clicking on the Bitcoin-Trader link takes you SecureOffer.net/bitcointrader The site boasts that users “typically” make $13,000 or \u0026pound9,500 profit daily – and if that doesn\u0027t get alarm bells ringing, nothing will. “Some members earned their first million within just 61 days,” it claims, without explaining how this was done.  There are also endorsements from Sir Richard Branson, Bill Gates and former Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt, which are as fake as those from Lord Sugar. Tellingly, there are no details telling you who Bitcoin-Trader are or where they are based.  If you click to set up an account you end up on yet another website, ufx. This does give some contact details: UFX Europe (Reliantco Investments Ltd) of Cyprus. It offers what it calls a one-click trading platform, but before you can start you must fund your account – in other words, send some money to these people.  The platform says it lets you trade on the movement of prices of company shares, currencies and commodities such as gold and oil. So it\u0027s all turned out to be nothing at all to do with investing in Bitcoin – the word was just clickbait. This website is just a common binary trading scam, where you can gamble on whether a price will go up or down over a given period, often just seconds or minutes.

The Drivers and Vehicles Standards Agency (DVSA) are making changes which will affect cars, vans, motorcycles and other light passenger vehicles. There are five main changes which motorists need to be aware of. The vehicles are to be put through tougher emissions tests and faults rated in three defect categories. New ‘minor’, ‘major’ and ‘dangerous’ categories that will be applied to all cars in order to meet the European Union Roadworthiness Package, with ‘major’ and ‘dangerous’ issues resulting in automatic failure. Cars with \u0027minor\u0027 defects will be allowed to pass and the faults will be recorded, but those that fall into the ‘dangerous’ category will be subject to an automatic fail.  Steering is being looked at in the DVSA\u0027s new criteria. A steering box leaking oil would get a minor fault but if the oil was dripping badly it would be pushed up to major and fail. Reverse lights will be checked and brake discs also inspected to see if they are significantly or obviously worn. Minor defects refer to those that have no significant effect on the safety of the vehicle or impact on the environment. Major defects may see the vehicle being less safe and have an impact on the environment, putting other road users at risk.  Neil Barlow, head of MOT policy for the DVSA, told Auto Express the new rules will help motorists do the right thing.  He added: We\u0027re changing the wording on the certificate. We\u0027ve done a lot of research with motorists to find out what sort of information helps.  1. Defects will be categorised differently Defects found during the MOT will be categorised as either:  dangerous major minor  The category the MOT tester gives each item will depend on the type of problem and how serious it is. MOT testers will still give advice about items you need to monitor. These are known as ‘advisories’. 2. Stricter rules for diesel car emissions There will be stricter limits for emissions from diesel cars with a diesel particulate filter (DPF). A DPF captures and stores exhaust soot to reduce emissions from diesel cars. You can check your car’s handbook if you don’t know if your car has a DPF.  Your vehicle will get a major fault if the MOT tester:  can see smoke of any colour coming from the exhaust finds evidence that the DPF has been tampered with  3. Some new things will be included in the MOT Some new items will be tested during the MOT.

Researchers who polled 2,000 adults found 79 per cent struggle to switch off at bedtime and leave the stress of work and their daily life behind them. Six in 10 even said they often wake suddenly in the night with thoughts of work and other worries – an average of four times a week or an incredible 215 times a year. The same number revealed they toss and turn in the night while 69 per cent regularly suffer nightmares – especially during times of anxiety.  Four in 10 of those said the bad dreams also have recurring themes – with ‘being chased’, falling and social embarrassment the most common. Commissioned by eve Sleep in partnership with the charity Mental Health UK to coincide with Mental Health Awareness Week, the research also found 83 per cent feel stress directly affects their ability to have a good night’s sleep.  Jas Bagniewski, co-founder and CEO of eve Sleep, who are donating \u0026pound5 of every mattress sale to Mental Health UK until May 20th, said: “We wanted to look into the link between your mental wellbeing and your sleep, and this research clearly shows that once the lights go out, not many Brits are sleeping easy. Our aim at eve is to create beautiful products that help you sleep better – but it’s important to acknowledge that even with the best mattress in the world, there’s a lot more to consider if you’re going to have a restful night.”  Frustratingly for three quarters of the nation, bedtime is usually when their fears and worries come to the fore. Family worries were found to be the problem most likely to keep us up at night, followed by financial concerns and relationship issues. Unsurprisingly, the most common knock-on effect is tiredness, however being less productive, extra-snappy and feeling more emotional are often experienced as a result.  Almost one in five have been so tired after an anxiety-ridden bad night’s kip, they have even been forced to take a day off work – although two thirds haven’t revealed the reason why to their employer. But more than half of the population said periods of stress not only affect their own sleep but that of their partner too. Amid this, one third of us said bedtime is the time they typically open up to their other half about what’s on their mind.

Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have chosen white Mayflower and Dusky Cranesbill geraniums grown in the Royal Parks super nursery in London\u0027s Hyde Park.  Nursery manager Mike Jones said he does not know where floral designer Philippa Craddock will use his flowers, so will be trying to spot them as he watches the wedding on TV. We don\u0027t know where they\u0027re going to be, so we\u0027ll be eagerly looking out ourselves to see where they are, Mr Jones said.   Follow our wedding countdown here .    Asked if he felt under pressure, the 58-year-old from Leamington Spa said: We do, because we really want it to be the best we can possibly do. It\u0027s showcasing not only our growing of plants, but the Royal Parks in general. It is thought the flowers - between 150 and 200 individual plants which are pollinator-friendly - will be incorporated into Ms Craddock\u0027s displays in and around St George\u0027s Chapel which will feature white garden roses, peonies and foxgloves.  Branches of beech, birch and hornbeam will also be used in the decorations, with the locally sourced foliage coming from the gardens and parkland of The Crown Estate and Windsor Great Park. Mr Jones said geraniums add a splash of colour, adding: They live for years so they will grow all summer, flower all summer, die down in the winter, and then come back again the following year, so very good value. The gardener said they were ideal for a relaxed look. Asked if the flowers will be getting special treatment in the coming days, he said: They\u0027ll be getting a lot of TLC. We\u0027ll be making sure they\u0027re watered well, making sure they\u0027re protected, and making sure that the flowers stay in the perfect condition for the day. It\u0027s only a few more days to go, so we want them to be absolutely pristine when they go.  Looking ahead to Saturday, Mr Jones said: I shall be watching the wedding along with half the rest of the country I would imagine. Looking out for my plants. Dr Alice Laughton, conservation manager at the Royal Parks, explained the importance of the flowers being pollinator-friendly, and what that might mean. The flowers that have been chosen are particularly pollinator-friendly flowers, which means they have a good store of nectar so they provide a lot of food for pollinators that are attracted to the flowers.   So on wedding day we might see some bees, some bumblebees, hoverflies, some butterflies, all important pollinators here in the UK, she said. The 36-year-old, from Bourn in Cambridgeshire, added: We\u0027re really excited. We work really hard to try and champion pollinators and support them because they\u0027re in decline.

Dubbed the \u0027wedding of the year,\u0027 there is a lot to think about and the day has been planned minute by minute.  Today the couple announced Princess Charlotte and Prince George would be part of their team of bridesmaids and page boys .   It has also emerged that Meghan\u0027s dad, Thomas Markle Snr, will not be attending the wedding nor walking his daughter down the aisle because he needs to undergo major heart surgery.  The rest of the day has been planned carefully though, with fans getting excited to see the day unfold. But what time will Meghan appear? When does the service begin? And when can you catch a glimpse of the procession?   Here is the schedule for the royal wedding :   9am: Members of the public watching the wedding from the Windsor Castle grounds will arrive.   9.30-11am: Chapel guests will start to arrive and enter through the South Door.   11.20am: The Royal Family begin to arrive and enter via the Galilee Porch, some on foot others by car.   11.45am: Harry and William arrive at the Chapel\u0027s West Steps, walking past golden ticket holders in the castle grounds.   11.55-11.59am: Following protocol, The Queen is the last of the royals to arrive.    11.59am: Meghan arrives at the Chapel\u0027s West Steps by car.   She will start her journey with mum Doria Ragland - but when the car stops at the castle her mum will exchange places with the bridesmaids and pageboys.  Her dad Thomas Markle was supposed to then walk her down the aisle, but now it remains unconfirmed who will. Meghan\u0027s dad is reportedly being prepped for major heart surgery and it is incredibly unlikely he will make it to Windsor Castle. Her mum Doria may be the one to take over, but it is yet to be announced.   Noon: Service starts.   1pm: Service ends and the newlyweds emerge at the West Steps.   1.05pm: Carriage procession through Windsor begins taking 25 minutes before they return to castle for afternoon reception.   The royal procession will start off at Windsor Castle, setting off at Snow Hill in Windsor Great Park.  It will then make its way through the high street and Windsor Town centre through Sheet Street, Kings Road, Albert Road and the Long Walk, returning to Windsor Castle.  It\u0027s expected to take around 25-30 minutes thousands of people are expected to descend on Windsor so it allows for plenty of time for everyone along the route to see the couple and celebrate with them. A statement on Kensington Palace\u0027s Twitter page read: They hope this short journey will provide an opportunity for more people to come together around Windsor and to enjoy the atmosphere of this special day. There will be designated spectator areas along the procession route so you’ll want to head down early if you’re hoping to get a good vantage point.

Three-year-old Florence van Cutsem\u0027s sister featured in the wedding of Kate and William six years ago. Grace Van Custem stole the show when she appeared on the balcony and covered her ears as thousands cheered outside Buckingham Palace. The palace has already announced that Ms Markle is not having a maid of honour because she did not want to choose just one person from her close-knit group of friends.

Thomas Markle Jnr, 51, flew to London ahead of the royal wedding to offer his support to his half-sister after their dad Thomas Snr said he could not attend for health reasons. The 73-year-old had surgery today after revealing medics will “go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed”. The retired lighting engineer is reported to be \u0027awake and alert\u0027 but will remain in hospital while he recovers. Thomas Jnr today visited Windsor Castle to see where Meghan will marry Prince Harry in St George’s Chapel on Saturday. He said: “My dad will be heartbroken that he cannot be with Meg in Windsor to walk her down the aisle. He would have moved heaven and earth to be there. Follow our royal wedding countdown here    “It’s the most beautiful, stunning wedding venue and it’s going to be an amazing day.” His father’s operation came days after he was accused of staging pictures of himself with a British paparazzi photographer close to his home in Rosarito, Mexico.  Speaking exclusively to the Mirror ahead of the ceremony, Tom said Kensington Palace should have offered more guidance to the American family as they were thrust into the spotlight after Suits actress Meghan, 36, started dating Harry. The glazier said of his dad: “He’ll be hugely embarrassed that he was found to have faked pictures, but what’s clear is that he’s not benefited from the best advice. “It would have been better for the palace to have guided him, as well as us for that matter, to ensure the focus is on Harry and Meg and not her family back in the States. They should have intervened and guided us when Meg and Harry’s relationship was first made public.” He said his dad’s heart problems were a wake-up call, adding: “All the drama of my dad’s health scare put everything into perspective about what’s important in life. “My sister’s going to be one of the best things ever to have happened to the royal family. “She will be the perfect modern princess. I wish Meg and Harry nothing but a happy and healthy future together.”  Tom’s support for Meghan comes after months of family infighting left a dark cloud over the ceremony. Two weeks ago, while at “breaking point”, exasperated Tom wrote an open letter calling the wedding a “fake fairy tale”. In it he said: “As more time passes to your Royal Wedding, it becomes very clear that this is the biggest mistake in Royal Wedding history.” But now Tom bitterly regrets his “moment of madness”. He said: “I didn’t mean to upset anyone. I had hoped it might jolt someone into giving us help.  “I wrote to Kensington Palace months ago asking for their aid. We’ve all been so overwhelmed by the attention and have found it difficult living under such scrutiny. “We needed guidance from the royals but didn’t get it.  “Our family was thrown into the limelight and there’s been enormous pressure on us all. It’s taken its toll on all of us. Much has been said, a lot of which I regret, but now after arriving in the UK and seeing Windsor Castle, I understand much more what this wedding means to people. “The fact Dad’s not well enough to travel makes me want more than ever to be as supportive as I can to Meg.”  Tom is “mortified” at reports that his father blamed his letter for his heart scare last week. Tom insisted: “My letter wasn’t intended to cause hurt or upset. My earlier pleas fell on deaf ears, and after exhausting everything I could think of, I’d hoped my letter might shame the palace, I guess, into getting in touch. “I was wrong. It wasn’t designed to humiliate Meg into inviting me, but more hoping we could get the help we needed. Ever since her relationship with Harry emerged two years ago, our lives have been changed forever.  “There hasn’t been a day gone by when the phone hasn’t rung or we’ve not been followed. It’s placed a massive strain on us all. Given our time again I’m sure we’d all handle it differently. I know I would.” Tonight the dad-of-two was prepared to cut short his trip the UK to be by his dad’s bedside if needed. He said: “I’ve tried calling Dad but his phone is off. Of course we’re all worried. What people must understand about my dad is that he’s an intensively private man. He doesn’t want to cause a fuss for anyone.”  For now Tom is just pleased to be able to see his sister’s new world. As well as visiting the castle where she will marry, he posed alongside a cardboard cut-out of his sister with her husband-to-be. He said: “All I want is to see Meg happy and I hope she has found that with Harry.  “It’s a historic event that I’m extremely proud my family is part of. Before I arrived in the UK I was hesitant, in fact quite nervous, about what reaction I would receive but everybody has been so lovely. “Leaving the country you were raised in to move to another is a major step for anyone. “But after meeting so many wonderful folks, I know Meg will be in great hands in Britain.” Now that Meghan’s dad is unable to attend the wedding, Tom from Grant Pass, Oregon, and Meghan’s mother, Doria Ragland , are the only two members of the bride’s immediate family in the UK for the ceremony.The actress’s half-sister, Samantha Grant, who has been highly critical of the royal couple, is staying in the US. Shockingly the 53-year-old from Florida this week claimed she was not invited to Meghan’s first wedding to Trevor Engelson in 2011 because she is in a wheelchair as she suffers from multiple sclerosis.

Gregory Boyle, 58, posed as a cardiologist and gave the woman in her 20s an \u0027intimate examination\u0027 at the Princess Royal University Hospital in Bromley, London before he was discovered by concerned nurses. Scotland Yard fears Boyle could have more victims who did not know about his sick lies and have urged anyone who recognises him to come forward. Today he was jailed for six years and four months at Croydon Crown Court for assault by penetration and sexual assault. Prior to the predatory attack on the woman in October 2015, the partner of the victim had spoken to Boyle through his work. The partner told Boyle of his concerns about the victim\u0027s health as she was having heart issues during her pregnancy.  Boyle falsely said he was a cardiologist and offered to assess the victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, as a second opinion free of charge. When the victim was admitted to hospital, her partner decided to take Boyle up on this offer. When he arrived at the Princess Royal University Hospital, Boyle introduced himself to the victim as a doctor, and, on the pretext of performing a medical examination, touched intimate parts of her body. Immediately after this a nurse walked in to find Boyle with the victim and questioned his presence on the ward. Doubting his continued claims to be a private doctor, staff checked the General Medical Council register and could not find him listed, and so called police. Boyle was arrested at the hospital and was charged with assault by penetration and sexual assault in September 2016. He pleaded guilty in March 2018.

CCTV captured the tearful newlywed trying to break up the violence while hitching up her flowing white wedding gown. But Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court heard she was unable to stop a sickening attack on her new brother-in-law Corey Roberts, 28. He had already been floored by a punch when he was violently stamped on by Daniel Morgan, 26. The court heard fighting broke-out between the wedding party and pub regulars when a woman was slapped on her bottom.  More than 20 guests were involved in the 11.40pm brawl after a day of celebrations and heavy drinking. The CCTV shows Morgan jump into the air before stamping on his victim\u0027s face - then running away. Prosecutor Gareth James said: It was a very forceful blow as Mr Roberts was lying on his back on the floor. He was unconscious for tens of minutes before an ambulance arrived to take him to hospital. He suffered a fractured cheekbone and swelling to the head and eye socket. The fight broke out at the wedding reception in the Pandy Inn at Tonypandy, Rhondda, South Wales, last June. Morgan was seen bouncing up and down on his toes like a boxer before stamping on the wedding guest. The bride was caught on video screaming after witnessing the attack on the the groom\u0027s brother. Judge Paul Thomas QC told Morgan: It\u0027s not how a bride wants to spend her wedding evening, sorting out a brawl like that.  From the CCTV I can see you were spoiling for a fight and the level of violence was shocking. You deliberately, maliciously and forcefully jumped in the air to maximise the injuries to your victim\u0027s face. You did that to a man who was already injured. Bearded Morgan sobbed in the dock as he was jailed for three years after admitting attempting to cause grievous bodily harm with intent. The court heard he had a poor record for offences of violence including a street attack just months before the wedding day head stamp. Nicholas Gedge, defending, told the court: He has shown genuine remorse for the shame he has brought upon himself and his family. He is very keen to get away from the macho culture that some view as the way to live in the area where he lives. Morgan, of Tonypandy, broke down in tears again as he was waved to his parents in the public gallery before being led to the cells.

Four Hamas military facilities were hit by missiles, according to an Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) spokesperson. A further three targets, reportedly weapons manufacturing sites, were also struck in the operation. Israel said it was responding to heavy machine-gun fire from positions in northern Gaza that reportedly hit six homes in Sderot, an Israeli town located less than half a kilometre from the Gaza border. Footage from Gaza shows one significant blast hit a densely populated residential neigbourhood.  Israel says that the numerous shooting incidents demanded a aggressive military response. They said: “Hamas is solely responsible for the events transpiring in and out of Gaza, and is accountable for all terrorist activity emanating from Gaza targeting Israeli civilians and Israeli sovereignty,” the IDF said. “The IDF is prepared to continue fulfilling its mission to ensure Israeli civilians\u0027 security and sense of security.” Israeli Defence Forces on the Israeli-Palestine border have been on high alert after massive protests claimed the lives of at least 60 people and resulted in over 2,000 injuries.

Tomasz Komenda, 42, was wrongly convicted of the brutal rape and murder of a 15-year-old girl in south-western Poland in 1997. Following a review, Poland’s Supreme Court acquitted Mr Komenda and stated that he could not have been responsible for the slaying. Justice minister Zbigniew Ziobro, who personally ordered a review of the case, said the acquittal shows that the mistakes of the justice system can be corrected.    He said: No-one can give back the years that Tomasz Komenda has lost. Still, the acquittal restores the sense of dignity of an innocent man who had been wrongly convicted.  The case has shocked Poland, which is currently governed by the right-wing Law and Justice party. Campaigners say the trial and subsequent fallout poses serious questions about the country’s dysfunctional legal system. The parents of the teen said they had developed doubts as to the guilt of the man and urged authorities to reexamine the conviction. Mr Komenda was clearly emotional as the trial judge ruled he could now walk free.

Waterfront project towards the completion of two major milestones: a new rail station entrance, and the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway has led the regeneration efforts in Dundee since 1997 when the project first began.Since then, he has developed the area’s masterplan and pushed for new investment coming into the city.As such, he leaves a diverse legacy in his wake after 21 years: the demolition of Tayside House, the relocation of the Olympia, realigned Tay Road Bridge ramps, the Waterfront plots and, of course, the V\u0026ampA Dundee.Mr Galloway was born in Aberfeldy and raised in Glasgow,

his wake.Councillor Will Dawson, planning committee convener, said: “It has been a pleasure working with Mike during my time as city development convener and even now as planning convener.‘‘It is

simon murray back to tannadice","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United are set to launch an audacious bid to bring back striker Simon Murray to Tannadice.As manager Csaba Laszlo rebuilds almost an entire squad for next term, the striker has been identified as a man who can grab the goals to get them back to the Premiership.The 26-year-old scored 25 times in a two-year spell with the Tangerines before moving to Hibs when his contract expired last summer.Despite scoring 14 times during his first six months at Easter Road, he was loaned out to Dundee for the second half of the campaign.He hit the net three times for the Dark Blues, helping them get vital points as they survived in the top flight.Murray has now returned to the Hibees and has a year left on his contract but the feeling is he will be allowed to leave this summer if another club comes in for him.Dundee could be interested in making his switch to Dens permanent but are understood to be considering other options as well, while Scottish Cup finalists Motherwell are eying a move for him. And United are definitely considering taking him back.If a deal comes off, the Dundonian will be one of more than an entire team of new faces fixed up in the coming few months.One stumbling block could be the fact Hibs, despite signing him for free a year ago, are likely to demand a fee.As United’s rebuilding process goes into overdrive, former Hamilton Accies and Partick Thistle full-back Ziggy Gordon is another name under consideration.The 25-year-old has spent the last year-and-a-bit in Poland with Jagiellonia Bialystok, but would welcome a move back to Scotland.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/04/5ae6e6a402efc-726x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united star picked for tunisia world cup squad","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee United could have a representative at this summer\u0026#8217s World Cup in Russia.Tunisia have named Bilel Mohsni in their provisional squad for the championships, which kicks off on June 14.The 30-year-old has already played for his country six times, including a qualifier for the 2017 African Cup of Nations.If selected for the full squad, the calibre of opposition will be in stark contrast to what he\u0026#8217s come up against this season in the SPFL Championship.He could be getting to grips with the likes of Harry Kane and Raheem Sterling for England, while he could also be trying to stop Eden Hazard and Kevin de Bruyne against Belgium.Panama, the final team in Group G, might provide less of a test than the other two.Soon to be out of contract Mohsni has been a standout performer for United since joining in March.Boss Csaba Laszlo said a trip to the World Cup would only benefit the defender.He said previously: “This can be a great development for him. You see how important the name Dundee United is in Europe and it is important players who come here can make the World Cups.”Mohsni has been picked for the 29-man provisional squad, which will be whittled down to 23 to be announced on June 4.Meanwhile, the other Tunisian to play in Dundee, Sofien Moussa appears to have been overlooked despite being the Dark Blues top scorer.The 30-year-old netted 12 times in the Premiership and League Cup for the Dens Park side \u0026#8211 but that was enough to earn a call up for his country.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"ross county offer new deal to michael gardyne amid dundee interest","story":"\t\t\t\t\tRoss County have moved to try to head off Dundee’s advances for Michael Gardyne by offering the midfielder a new deal.After the club’s relegation to the Championship, Gardyne is out of contract and has drawn “interest from a couple of Premiership clubs”.Ferguson said: “Michael has had interest from a couple of Premiership clubs and we’ve put an offer to him that, hopefully, convinces him to stay.“We don’t need to sell the club to him – he knows what it’s all about and he would be a big player for us in the Championship.”Leaving the Staggies is former Dundee United loanee Thomas Mikkelsen along with Tim Chow, David Ngog, Aaron McCarey, Blair Malcolm and Reghan Tumilty.The Highland side secured the capture of Iain Vigurs yesterday.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"stv2 to close after just a year with bbc blamed","story":"\t\t\t\t\tSTV has announced that STV 2 is to close, with 59 jobs to go.The broadcaster announced today that the channel will close at the end of June.It says it will shift \u0026#8220content investment\u0026#8221 to online.

leaving","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA well-known department store chain has announced it will be returning to the Wellgate.TJ Hughes left the shopping centre in 2011 after it previously occupied a site on the top floor on Victoria Road.The Liverpool-based discount store has agreed a 15-year lease to occupy the unit formerly occupied by British Home Stores following its closure in August 2016.Today’s statement comes on the back of discount gym operator, Xercise4Less, confirming its intention to open on July 31 after investing nearly £1 million in the site.The imminent arrival of the gym and the announcement of TJ Hughes coming back are being heralded as a “catalyst” to attract further investment in the centre.Despite clothing store, New Look, confirming earlier this year that it will be closing its doors at the Wellgate, centre manager Peter Aitken said he was delighted to welcome “national giant” TJ Hughes back into the fold.He said: “We are absolutely delighted to welcome TJ Hughes to Wellgate, which we believe will play a pivotal role in the centre’s ongoing development.“Not only will this national department store reinvigorate the centre but also provide a catalyst for other businesses to invest within the Wellgate.“The news is especially significant in light of the imminent opening of the Xercise4Less gym – together, these new tenants will enliven both entrances to the centre and generate a significant increase in footfall.”Savills UK retail and leisure agency team helped to secure the deal and confirmed that TJ Hughes’ arrival will “significantly” improve the profile of the centre.Stuart Moncur, head of national retail at Savills, said: “Our strategy has been to secure new anchor occupiers.‘‘With the arrival of both Xercise4Less and TJ Hughes, we certainly believe the Wellgate is on the up.“TJ Hughes will occupy the former BhS store at the front of the Wellgate and will significantly improve the profile of the centre as well as drive substantial levels

year.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/5afacbe5bfeac.jpg ","title":"travellers pitch up","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA group of Travellers has set up camp near Dundee Ice Arena.Two motorhomes and two caravans have arrived at a car park across from the venue at Camperdown Leisure Park.It comes just days after a group was seen outside the former Toys ‘R’ Us store — which closed in April — at Kingsway West Retail Park.Managers at the site started legal proceedings to evict the Travellers who have since moved on from the area.While the Toys ‘R’ Us store is shut, the unit in which the store operated and the land outside it are owned by fund management firm ARES and operated by property firm GVA.A spokesman said: “Both the owner and management team were aware of the occupiers in situ outside the store.“They did not have permission to be on site and as such were served notice that they must leave the land immediately.’’Similar to the Toys ‘R’ Us site, the area at Camperdown Leisure Park is not licensed for the purposes of camping — meaning anyone who sets up caravans there is doing so illegally.Travellers have been seen in the area surrounding the ice arena and Cineworld on several occasions in the last few years.Dundee City Council operates a licensed site for Travellers at Balmuir Wood in Tealing.Twenty pitches are available for Travelling communities, each of which features an electricity supply, utility rooms with showers and toilets and 24-hour access.According to housing charity Shelter Scotland, Travellers staying on private sites can be evicted “fairly easily” by landowners if they do not have permission to be there.The charity said: “If you park up on private land without consent, the owner or legal occupier (for example, a tenant) can take steps to evict you.“If the landowner or occupier does decide to evict you, they may apply to the court for an interdict or possession order requiring you to move off the land, ask the council to take action, ask the police to take action or move you on themselves.”A council spokeswoman said: ‘‘We are aware of their presence and are monitoring the situation.”Police Scotland was approached for comment but no response had been received by the Tele at the time of going to press.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"wighton hopes frustrating end to campaign can spur dundee to success next term","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCraig Wighton hopes the anger at the way Dundee finished their season can spur them on to better things next campaign.A long season for most may have just come to an end with the 1-0 home reverse to Partick.For Wighton, however, it feels like it has only just begun after missing the first nine months of the term with a serious knee injury.With the manager and players alike angry at how they finished off 2017/18, Dundee’s youngest-ever goalscorer has more to be annoyed about.He said: “The frustrating thing for me, personally, is I’m just starting to get into it, starting to feel fully match fit and the season’s done.“That is frustrating but I’ll go away in the summer and work hard, come back fit and, hopefully, get a full pre-season under my belt and start the next campaign well.“Maybe Tuesday night against Ross County I got a bit leggy towards the end before I came off but I felt good again against Partick.“It was difficult, it was warm which took its toll on everyone but I feel fit, I feel good and, as I say, it’s a bit frustrating that’s the season done now.“For a lot of the boys they’ll maybe be glad it’s done because it’s been a long one but, for me, I’ve just had a pre-season!“This is basically the start for me and already it’s done which is unfortunate.”Wighton admits the performance across the board at the weekend wasn’t up to scratch.“The manager wasn’t happy and the players weren’t either,” he added.“It’s alright if it’s just not your day and you get beat but the way we played, second half especially, is not acceptable.“We weren’t at it at all.“We knew Partick were fighting for their lives and they would have a go at us but I don’t think we showed any real quality in the final third.“We were slow in possession at the back and Partick deserved the win for their second half.”The defeat echoed the finale to the last campaign – a 4-0 thumping at the hands of 11th-placed Hamilton.That stung for Wighton and he’s hoping this year’s failure to perform on the last day can niggle away at the squad over the summer break enough to spark better next time out.“Obviously, we did our business early in the split but it doesn’t mean that’s it – we wanted to win every game and four out of five would have been a good return so we are disappointed.“Last year it didn’t affect us but when you come back it’s still on your mind a wee bit, it still annoys you.“I think everyone will go away and have a good summer and next season we know we have to be a lot better.”One thing he personally is looking to add is goals – something the team as a whole has lacked in the past year.“Not taking our chances this season has really cost us. We haven’t been clinical enough in front of goal and that’s the difference,” he added.“You look at Kilmarnock – Boyd scoring goals for them – but we feel we’re a better side than Kilmarnock. We are but we just haven’t had that cutting edge in the final third.“Obviously, I never got a goal this term which is frustrating but I think the main thing for me was I didn’t think I would play this season.“Just playing is a big thing for me but next season I do need to start adding goals to my game. It doesn’t matter where I play, goals and assists are where I’ll get judged on at the end of the day.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/resources/images/7486028.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"She did it  Swindon star Maisie Sly s film wins at the

But the Courier understands the \u0026pound370,000 art installation, still branded by Highland Council as the Gathering Place, will be divided into two sections positioned on either side of the river. The installation is thought to be a mix of stone and wooden construction.There is great excitement among city councillors who have seen two-dimensional design work, and there is apparent consensus that it is aesthetically pleasing and will easily blend into the local, tranquil environment.The \"pier\" project, proposed for a spot by Eden Court, was aborted two years ago due to the scale of public objections to the design.The location for the new proposal is believed to be nearby, slightly further upriver, at the most shallow point on the edge of the Ness Islands.The council\u0027 Inverness city committee delegated powers of approval to the Inverness city arts working group. Its current chairwoman, councillor Isabelle MacKenzie, said she had closely scrutinised the fresh concept adding that it was \"within budget\".Giving little away, she added: \"I can see it appealing to the local community. It\u0027 innovative and there are a variety of ways to use it.\"The artwork is believed to be static and radically different from the previous offering.Fellow city councillor Duncan Macpherson said: \"The whole thing looks good. I think people who use this walkway regularly will be impressed. It\u0027 enhancing.\"People will be happy with it because they\u0026rsquove heeded public opinion.\"They\u0026rsquove taken the key aspects of the best features of the River Ness \u0026ndash its shape, the salmon fishing, the popularity of it.

It\u0027 a natural \u0026lsquogathering place\u0026rsquo unlike the previous design which was very modern.
