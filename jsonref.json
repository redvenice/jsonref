They\u0027d moved from Palm Beach, a neighbour told me when I knocked on her door, but she remembered Virginia.\u0027She was a sad, anorexic-looking girl,\u0027 she said.I located Tony in the small town of Flowery Branch, Georgia – an eight-hour drive north of Palm Beach – and he confirmed what had seemed a totally incredible tale.Epstein had approved of him continuing his romance with Virginia, he told me when we met at a coffee shop.\u0027I moved into her apartment in Royal Palm Beach. She was working for Jeffrey. I assume the cash she got from him paid for it.\u0027I would give her rides to his house. I would hang out there – sit by the pool, talk to the chef. Jeffrey treated me like a friend. I never got any weird vibes until she told me what was going on.\u0027And then the bombshell. When Tony picked up Virginia from a trip to London on Epstein\u0027s jet, she showed him a photo of herself with Prince Andrew.\u0027She told me Jeffrey was hanging out with Andrew and she had hung out with him,\u0027 he said. \u0027It was supposedly just massages.\u0027He was sickened because he had come to understand that in Epstein\u0027s warped circles, massage was a euphemism for sex.\u0027I tried to get her to stop the trips with Jeffrey but she didn\u0027t. I think she was scared.\u0027Tony gave me the next lead to Virginia\u0027s whereabouts. Her father\u0027s name, he confided, was Sky Roberts. I left a message at his number, saying I was investigating Epstein.On February 4, 2011, an email landed that would change the course of history for Andrew.\u0027Hi Sharon,\u0027 Virginia wrote. \u0027My Father, Sky Roberts, informed me of your call and I thought I\u0027d send you my contact details so we can get in touch.\u0027When I called her Australian number, her voice was shaky but determined and the first word from her lips was \u0027Andrew\u0027.He was the Royal in her lawsuit, she told me, and, while initially reluctant to talk publicly, she eventually decided she wanted to waive her anonymity and tell her story because she was furious that he was still hanging out with Epstein after the financier\u0027s conviction for offences related to child prostitution.Just a few days before, she had seen a photo – published by the now defunct News of the World – that revealed the Prince had taken a stroll in Manhattan\u0027s Central Park with Epstein after the wealthy pervert had completed a slap- on-the-wrist jail sentence for abusing underage girls.She had also read about a dinner party that Epstein threw for Andrew during the New York visit, which was attended by celebrities including Woody Allen.Little could Andrew have known that that image of him casually chatting to his old friend in the park would end up so enraging Virginia she would agree to talk to me.\u0027I am appalled,\u0027 she told me when I arrived at her modest ranch home 60 miles north of Sydney. \u0027To me, it\u0027s saying, We are above the law.\u0027I was exhausted after 24 hours of travel from my home in New York via San Francisco to Sydney and then a 90-minute drive in a rental car on unfamiliar roads. But from the moment I set eyes on that picture, my jet-lag evaporated.For the entire journey I hadn\u0027t slept because Virginia had warned me she might not be able to find the picture.Now she had found it and, of course, I knew it was a huge scoop. But I had mixed emotions. This was a woman who was a victim of the most evil child sex ring I have heard about during my 40-year career.I was worried for Virginia and the fallout going public would have on her. I knew her life would never be the same again.She was clearly still absolutely terrified of Epstein. She told me she had seen shady characters hanging around her house who she was convinced had been sent by the billionaire to bully and intimidate her into silence.Yet here she was, bravely telling a story which would set off a cataclysmic chain of events that would change her life – and Andrew\u0027s – for ever.By the time I met Virginia, she was happily married to Robert Giuffre, an Australian martial arts expert whom she met by chance when Epstein flew her to Thailand for a massage course. They had two sons and a daughter.But she couldn\u0027t put the memories of her years in Epstein\u0027s cult-like household behind her. She wanted both him and Andrew to be brought to justice.We sat in her garden and I remember the terror in her eyes as she told her story to a journalist for the first time.She gave me a graphic description of the hours she claims to have spent with the Prince after Maxwell and Epstein left her on that London night. For reasons of taste, they can\u0027t be included here.\u0027It was disgusting,\u0027 she said, shaking her head.\u0027I\u0027ve gone from pain to hurt to anger. Coming from my background, I thought I was important, being with a big, famous man. But being a mother has changed my perspective on life.\u0027After my week-long first meetings with her, I received word that a US prosecutor, Ann Marie Villafana, was trying to reach me. She told me when I called that she had heard I was talking to Virginia.\u0027The FBI would like to fly to Sydney to interview her,\u0027 she said.Virginia wept when I passed on the message. She was still living in fear of Epstein. Would he hurt her, she wondered, if she co-operated with the FBI?And would it do any good? She had talked to some investigators just three years earlier, yet \u0027there\u0027s Jeffrey in Central Park with Andrew\u0027.She agreed to meet two FBI agents. Michael Thomas and I drove her and her husband to the US Consulate in Sydney.We weren\u0027t allowed to accompany Virginia inside, but she told us she confirmed the account she had given us and handed them her collection of snaps, including the print we had copied showing her with Maxwell and the Prince.They handed it back to her after making a scan.Since that day there has been much speculation about what happened to what has been dubbed the \u0027original\u0027 photograph.To the best of my knowledge, she still has it. I\u0027ve never heard anything about her destroying it.A redacted court document reportedly shows that she gave 20 photos to the FBI in 2011 and they were scanned front and back. But there are only 19 shown in a public record of the meeting.The FBI assigned sequential reference numbers to both the front and back of each photo. But two reference numbers – 03956 9431 and 03956 9432 – are missing from the publicly available document.Panorama was told those two numbers are for the front and back of the Andrew photo and that it was removed from the public document to protect his privacy.The lawmen refused to tell me their verdict on the picture. \u0027But if she faked it, they\u0027d have indicted her a long time ago for perjury,\u0027 I was told by a source familiar with the probe.A Californian digital photography expert, Hany Farid, told The Times he saw no \u0027obvious signs\u0027 that the photo was doctored.\u0027It can be difficult to get the body poses just right when splicing two people together,\u0027 he said.\u0027The fact that the two figures are so seamlessly and closely placed next to each other suggests that this is unlikely to be a full-body splice of Prince Andrew.\u0027The lighting and pose of the head seem consistent with the body and scene, suggesting that it is also unlikely that this is Prince Andrew\u0027s head spliced on to another person\u0027s body,\u0027 he said.Without that photograph, no one would have taken Virginia\u0027s word over that of the Queen\u0027s favourite son.If Andrew still believes it was cooked up by a \u0027gold-digger\u0027, I\u0027m happy to take his call."},{"url":null,"title":"Prince Harry renews Frogmore Cottage lease making eligible serve Queen Counsellor","story":"Share this articlePrince Harry will renew Frogmore Cottage lease to keep serving Queen"},{"url":null,"title":"Boris declare THURSDAY Covid freedom day","story":"Share this articlePowers to order national lockdowns will also end, with sources saying it would instead be up to local authorities to manage outbreaks. The PM is also expected to leave open the prospect that further Covid jabs could be given, saying he will be guided by expert vaccines body the JCVI.Responding to the Prime Minister\u0027s future blueprint for dealing with Covid, Labour said people should not be asked to pay for coronavirus tests.Armed forces minister James Heappey suggested on Thursday that Mr Johnson was likely to announce an end to free lateral flow tests as he called on the public to \u0027worry less about the need to have tested ourselves\u0027.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \u0027Boris Johnson is declaring victory before the war is over, in an attempt to distract from the police knocking at his door.\u0027Labour doesn\u0027t want to see restrictions in place any longer than they need to be.\u0027The Government should publish the evidence behind this decision, so the public can have faith that it is being made in the national interest.\u0027Now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay, when people are still being asked to behave responsibly.\u0027Meanwhile, No 10 sources stressed testing \u0027surveillance systems and contingency measures\u0027 would be retained for use if required.Downing Street said pharmaceutical interventions will \u0027continue to be our first line of defence\u0027, with the vaccine programme remaining \u0027open to anyone who has not yet come forward\u0027.With 85 per cent of the UK\u0027s population double-vaccinated, and 38million booster jabs administered, No 10 said it had concluded \u0027Government intervention in people\u0027s lives can now finally end\u0027.But it appeared to keep the door open to state-funded infection sampling remaining in place, following reports that Covid studies could be withdrawn as part of the plan.Officials said Monday\u0027s \u0027living with Covid\u0027 plan will maintain \u0027resilience against future variants with ongoing surveillance capabilities\u0027.It comes after senior statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter argued that the Office for National Statistics\u0027 Covid-19 study should remain in place in some form. The Cambridge University professor, who is a non-executive director for the ONS and chairman of the advisory board for the Covid Infection Survey, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme the results had been vital for monitoring people\u0027s behaviour.\u0027It has been absolutely so important as we have gone along,\u0027 he said on Saturday.\u0027It has been running since April 2020, and so, as I said, I do have a bias here but it is not just me -

a donor to the Prince\u0027s Foundation.It was alleged that he paid thousands of pounds to \u0027fixers\u0027 with links to the prince who said they could secure him an honour in return for donations.Clarence House has denied Charles knew anything about the allegations being investigated. And Prince Harry the monarch has also been dealing with revelations that Prince Harry tried to keep details of his legal battle to reinstate his police protection secret from the public.High Court documents show he sought a far-reaching confidentiality order on documents and witness statements surrounding his case against the Government.But the Home Office argued for transparency, saying \u0027there must be a sufficiently good reason, in the wider public interest, to justify the departure from open justice that such an order involves\u0027. The Queen\u0027s positive test comes as Boris Johnson today urged people to be \u0027more confident and get back to work\u0027 as he heralded this coming Thursday as Covid Freedom Day. The PM gave an upbeat assessment ahead of unveiling his \u0027Living with Covid Plan\u0027 tomorrow, insisting vaccines and new treatments can be relied upon to keep the public safe.All curbs - including legal self-isolation - are set to end in England within days, and Mr Johnson made clear that the taxpayer cannot keep shelling out £2billion a month on mass testing.In a compromise between the Treasury and Department of Health, he will lay out a timetable for axing free tests - but they are still likely to be available for more vulnerable and older age groups.As cases continue to tumble - down 25 per cent week-on-week - Mr Johnson insisted he did not want people to \u0027throw caution to the winds\u0027 but he wanted to remove \u0027compulsion\u0027 and let iniduals take responsibility."},{"url":null,"title":"Covid infections plummet 37 week 25 696 cases PM plans Freedom Day","story":"Share this articlePowers to order national lockdowns will also end, with sources saying it would instead be up to local authorities to manage outbreaks. The PM is also expected to leave open the prospect that further Covid jabs could be given, saying he will be guided by expert vaccines body the JCVI.Responding to the Prime Minister\u0027s future blueprint for dealing with Covid, Labour said people should not be asked to pay for coronavirus tests.Armed forces minister James Heappey suggested on Thursday that Mr Johnson was likely to announce an end to free lateral flow tests as he called on the public to \u0027worry less about the need to have tested ourselves\u0027.Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting said: \u0027Boris Johnson is declaring victory before the war is over, in an attempt to distract from the police knocking at his door.\u0027Labour doesn\u0027t want to see restrictions in place any longer than they need to be.\u0027The Government should publish the evidence behind this decision, so the public can have faith that it is being made in the national interest.\u0027Now is not the time to start charging for tests or weaken sick pay, when people are still being asked to behave responsibly.\u0027Meanwhile, No 10 sources stressed testing \u0027surveillance systems and contingency measures\u0027 would be retained for use if required.Downing Street said pharmaceutical interventions will \u0027continue to be our first line of defence\u0027, with the vaccine programme remaining \u0027open to anyone who has not yet come forward\u0027.With 85 per cent of the UK\u0027s population double-vaccinated, and 38million booster jabs administered, No 10 said it had concluded \u0027Government intervention in people\u0027s lives can now finally end\u0027.But it appeared to keep the door open to state-funded infection sampling remaining in place, following reports that Covid studies could be withdrawn as part of the plan.Officials said Monday\u0027s \u0027living with Covid\u0027 plan will maintain \u0027resilience against future variants with ongoing surveillance capabilities\u0027.It comes after senior statistician Sir David Spiegelhalter argued that the Office for National Statistics\u0027 Covid-19 study should remain in place in some form. The Cambridge University professor, who is a non-executive director for the ONS and chairman of the advisory board for the Covid Infection Survey, told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme the results had been vital for monitoring people\u0027s behaviour.\u0027It has been absolutely so important as we have gone along,\u0027 he said on Saturday.\u0027It has been running since April 2020, and so, as I said, I do have a bias here but it is not just me -

A return of tourism begins next week. Photograph: Saeed KhanAFP via Getty ImagesBeachgoers enjoy warm weather on Australia Day at Bondi Beach, Sydney,  on January 26th. Foreign tourists will be welcomed back next week for the first time since the pandemic began. Photograph:  Lisa Maree WilliamsGetty ImagesThe return of foreign visitors to Australia after a two-year absence cannot come soon enough for Craig Wachholz, who runs a surf school on Sydney’s Bondi beach.“You don’t know what you’ve got until it’s gone,” said Wachholz, known as Wacca to fellow surfers. Overseas tourists were a large proportion of the 10,000 to 20,000 people that took lessons with his company each year but that flow dried up as the borders shut.“We’ve been on Bondi beach for 27 years and up until Covid hit we were having the best year we’d ever had. But then the beaches were shut and we fell off a cliff,” he said.The strict border lockdown under the “Fortress Australia” policy had a catastrophic impact on the tourism industry of a country that welcomed nine million visitors a year before the pandemic.Shane Jolly, general manager of the five-star Langham Hotel in Sydney’s historic Rocks district, spoke of the “devastating” visitor ban. “There’s been a very heavy toll,” he said.On Bondi, businesses have had to make do, gradually picking up customers as Covid-19 restrictions eased. First, locals looking for safer outdoor activities returned to the surf, followed by domestic tourists and backpackers who entered on work visas and headed straight to Sydney’s most famous sands.Wachholz said that within days of a travel bubble to Singapore opening last year, he had wannabe surfers from the city-state on the beach looking for lessons. “We are right at the front of it,” he said of the recovery.Flight bookingsThe big wave of visitors strikes next week with the full return of tourism. When Scott Morrison, prime minister and a former Tourism Australia chief, announced last month that double-vaccinated overseas visitors would be welcomed back for the first time since early 2020, the effect was instantaneous.Flight bookings to Australia doubled the following day, with the strongest demand from the US and UK, but also South Africa, Canada and India, said Andrew David, chief executive of domestic and international operations for airline Qantas. “This shows how much people want to come to Australia,” he said.The Cruise Bar overlooking Sydney’s Opera House is one of those poised to cater for the new arrivals. Lindsay Potts, its marketing manager, said: “Like any hospitality business during this time we’ve struggled so we’re super excited to welcome back international tourists. It’s a huge market for us.”The end of a ban on dancing and singing in public in Sydney also meant the venue could resume putting on shows for its guests. “We’re definitely going to throw some sort of party,” she said.Tourism chiefs have jumped on the reopening. A new A$40 million (€25 million) advertising campaign with the “Don’t Go Small, Go Australia” tagline has launched across Europe and the US, with a sun-drenched kangaroo appearing on a billboard overlooking London’s Piccadilly Circus in recent days.International visitors were worth A$61 billion to the Australian economy before coronavirus struck, according to Tourism Australia, and the industry employs more than twice the number of people than the important mining industry.And while Sydney is the hub of the tourist industry, businesses in more remote areas of Australia are also counting on a recovery.Matt Cameron-Smith, chief executive of Voyages Indigenous Tourism Australia, which relies on foreign visitors to Uluru in the Northern Territory for half its revenues, said the reopening felt like a long time coming after so many false starts.“You go from watching the news with one eye closed to saying ‘is this real?’,” he said of next week’s reopening.Lost workersYet the industry still faces a huge battle to return to its pre-Covid pomp. The workforce withered during the pandemic, with some leaving for steadier work in retail and healthcare, and about 100,000 workers returned to their home countries.The government has sought to address the issue by refunding the cost of working visas to visiting backpackers but John Hart, executive director of Restaurant and Catering Australia, doubted this would be sufficient.“We’re not going to get them back,” he said of the lost workers, adding that a shortage of skilled staff such as chefs was a real concern.Another looming problem is political tension with China, which provided the largest number of annual international tourists, 1.4 million, before relations became strained.“Some Chinese will return but nowhere near the numbers we had. We need to target well-heeled markets,” said Hart, who wants to attract high-spending tourists from countries such as Japan and India to fill the gap.Langham Hotel’s Jolly said there had been a pick-up in international bookings since the border announcement, but he expected it to take until next summer for wealthy customers to return in high numbers because of fears that the borders could shut again.“Planes are not lining up to drop in five-star luxury guests,” he said. “Business people will travel if they have to but luxury leisure travellers can’t afford to get stuck.”Hart rued the furore last month over the deportation of the tennis star Novak Djokovic, which he said painted Australia’s border security policies in a harsh light.“It wasn’t a good look,” he said, arguing that they needed to make the visitor experience as easy as possible now to restore its image.For Wachholz, the pause in mass tourism did provide one benefit: a reminder of the “vibe” that Bondi had when he first began surfing there decades ago, something he hoped would remain after the crowds returned.“Maybe people will enjoy the beauty of Bondi beach a bit more now,” he said. – Copyright The Financial

The windows of the rest of the houses are dark: they are holiday lets or second homes and no-one is at home.Chapel Stile is a Lakeland village in the Langdale valley, where only 14 out of the 164 homes are owned and lived in full-time, according to local estimates. After decades of increasing numbers of second homes in the area, the rise of short-term lettings sites like Airbnb and two years of booming staycations, there has been an increase of 32 per cent in the number of holiday lets in South Lakeland, according to figures from Tim Farron, MP for the area and a former leader of the Liberal Democrats.This dramatic rise has resulted in rocketing housing costs for locals and dwindling footfall for local businesses, which has led Mr Farron to take up the cause in a new campaign. Last month, he raised the issue in a debate in the House of Commons, and he is soon set to discuss the matter with Michael Gove, the Secretary of State for the Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government (DHCLG).Jean Birkett is a parish councillor who has lived in Chapel Stile all her life, and she has seen how the village has changed with the encroachment of holiday homes.When she was a teenager, the village was inhabited entirely by local people, working mostly in agriculture. It was a small, close community where “everyone knew everyone”, says Mrs Birkett. The village hall had “something on every night of the week”, whether it was Women’s Institute meetings, dances, hunt balls or the drama club.That bustling community life is almost entirely gone now, reflects Mrs Birkett: “There isn’t even a bonfire now…It’s as dead as dead.“In 20 years there won’t be anyone left.”A brief search of Airbnb shows there are at least 30 properties in the village, and just outside it, that are listed for short-term lets on the site, with others listed elsewhere. It’s not hard to see why.Birkett points to a small, terraced, slate cottage that she used to live in as a teenager. Its neighbour, an identical two-bedroom house, is listed on Airbnb for £940 a week, with an advert boasting that it “was originally a Quarryman’s dwelling”.Locals will have a hard time trying to buy, too. Jobs locally tend to be in the lower-paying service and tourism industries, but homes in the village can go for over £1 million.People complain that the number of holiday rentals makes it nearly impossible to find somewhere to live, especially in a National Park that has tight planning restrictions on building new homes. Carys Grady, 31, spent years looking for a rented home for herself and her partner around the town of Ambleside, on the banks of Lake Windermere and around four miles from Chapel Stile.She started looking eight years ago, checking estate agents’ websites every day for new listings. It took two years just to find anything, with the few properties available being snapped up before they got to them.They eventually found a place, but immediately after moving in discovered it had damp and serious mould, with a patch on the ceiling that was six foot by four foot, according to Miss Grady. When the landlord stalled over fixing it, she started looking for another home, a search that this time took six years.“Because the rental properties are so few and far between they always have you by the short and curlies”, she says. “If you move out then there are 20 or 30 people who will move in.”All this might superficially sound like it’s to the benefit of tourists, who have more properties available to stay in, but Debbie Lumsden, a 52-year-old manager of a bar in Bowness, a town just south of Ambleside, argues that it is not.Last summer, the Cumbrian tourist board found that 85 per cent of hospitality businesses were struggling to find enough staff, as national labour problems caused by the pandemic and Brexit added to local issues in the Lakes.Lumsden says you couldn’t believe “the number of complaints I had from tourists saying they can’t get dinner anywhere”, last summer, and pubs had to “shut on some of the busiest days of the year because they simply didn’t have enough staff.”“We can’t get people into the village because there is nowhere to live”, she says. “A friend in Windermere doesn’t have any neighbours, and she lives on a street with 10 houses…They are all Airbnbs.”Ms Lumsden had her own difficulties trying to find a home last year after her landlord asked her to leave so he could turn her house into a holiday let. After a frantic and fruitless search with estate agents, she considered resigning from her job and leaving the Lake District to move back in with her mum.Luckily, a friend was moving out of Bowness, and she was able to move straight into her flat before it was advertised.Mr Farron has suggested a seven-point plan to deal with the issue, starting with changing law so that property owners would have to apply for planning permission to turn a property into a second home or holiday let.Another proposal is closing tax loopholes, which currently allow second home owners to dodge paying council tax. At present, many second home owners are instead paying the lower business rates whether or not they have actually rented out their properties – all they need to do is declare an intention to do it.It appears the government has taken notice, and last month it announced that this would only be available on genuine holiday lets, which are occupied by holidaymakers for at least 70 nights a year, and that owners would otherwise have to pay council tax. Farron wants this to go further, giving councils the power to increase council tax by up to 100 per cent on second homes and holiday lets in the most affected areas.A spokesman for Airbnb said: “Across the UK, the majority of Hosts share space in their own home and nearly a third of UK Hosts say that the additional income is an economic lifeline.“We take housing concerns seriously and have already put forward proposals to the government for a national registration system for hosts, following talks with communities and leaders across the UK. The UK government has committed to taking forward a registration system and we look forward to supporting the upcoming consultation.”A spokesman for DHCLG said: “We’re taking decisive action to combat the adverse impact that second homes and holiday lets can have on local communities – particularly in areas such as the Lake District.“We have introduced a higher rate of stamp duty for second homes, increased councils’ powers to charge second homeowners the full council tax rate and tightened up tax rules for second home owners.“We’re also delivering more affordable housing, including 4,100 affordable homes in Cumbria since 2010, and our new First Homes scheme will help to ensure that local people are prioritised in the sale of affordable housing.”More from NewsFrance and Russia to hold talks in last-ditch effort to secure ceasefire in UkraineAngela Rayner\u0026#39s call for police to \u0026#39shoot terrorists and ask questions second\u0026#39 is correct, says Wes StreetingDispatch: Ukrainians evacuated to far-flung parts of Russia in \u0026#39false-flag\u0026#39 operationPrince Andrew and Prince Charles \u0026#39need\u0026#39 a war in Ukraine, says Russian state TVToothless President Biden is failing the WestThe key Covid measures are falling – now is as good a time as any to end restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"russell group universities accused profiting students misery","story":"The pandemic has led to a £2.2 billion cash boom for the UK’s top universities amid accusations that they are “profiting from students’ misery”.Spiralling grade inflation after exams were axed and teachers’ predictions were used instead meant that Russell Group institutions have undergone their biggest expansion of student numbers in over a decade.The country’s most prestigious universities have collectively amassed a surplus of over £2.2 billion, according to analysis of their latest annual accounts by The .Information obtained under freedom of information requests by The  also reveals that the 24 members of the Russell Group were collectively handed over £115 million from the Government in furlough money.Vice-chancellors are facing fresh calls to give students a refund, with parents pointing out that youngsters have “only been getting a fraction” of the normal university experience.Robert Halfon, the Tory chair of the education select committee, said: “What better use for these surplus could there be than to give students their money back who haven\u0027t had proper face to face teaching?”He added that the higher education regulator should work with universities to ensure “students get the money back they deserve”.Molly Kingsley, co-founder of the parent campaign group UsForThem, said it is “outrageous” that students have paid the same tuition fees for the past two years.She said: “The first thing to do is to offer the students and then the taxpayer a refund. Why are universities profiting from students\u0027 misery?”It comes as thousands of students faced further disruption this week after lecturers from 68 universities around the country went on strike amid a row over pensions and working conditions.Not all universities accepted money through the furlough scheme, with Queen Mary University London stating that given the healthy state of its finances it took the principled decision not to access it.Analysis by The  found that all but two of the Russell Group members ran a surplus during 2020-21. Nine of them ran an even larger surplus than they did the previous year, their annual accounts showed.Nick Hillman, director of the Higher Education Policy Institute, said: “These surpluses are what you would expect of an institution in normal times - but it is extraordinary relative to the predictions of the sector at the start of the crisis.”“There was a fear early in the crisis that the Russell Group universities would be the worst affected because of international students not coming and they are the ones that pay the really high fees.“But in reality the international students have kept coming and because of grade inflation home students have flocked to Russell Group universities too.”The National Union of Students said the surplus figures are “truly appalling” adding: “It’s completely unfathomable that so many universities have profited throughout the pandemic.“Whilst students were accessing food banks, being threatened with evictions and visa withdrawals, universities continued to put students last.”In 2020-21, the number of first year undergraduates at the country’s top universities increased by 11.9 per cent, official data shows, which includes nine per cent growth in the number of overseas students. This is the largest year-on-year increase in over 10 years and is three times the growth of the rest of the sector during the pandemic.Nicola Dandridge, chief executive of the Office for Students, said that universities have generally weathered the storm of the pandemic effectively and are well placed to deal with future economic ruptures.She added that students have endured an “exceptionally difficult time through the pandemic”, which has been brought into “sharp focus” this week as a fresh round of lecturer strikes got underway.A Russell Group spokesperson said that their members have “worked hard to prioritise students and provide the best possible experience” during the pandemic, including “investing significantly in digital learning and increasing wider support services”.They pointed out that in-person teaching continued for essential courses throughout the pandemic and since September has been in place for the “vast majority” of courses.The spokesman said that members “worked tirelessly” to accommodate “as many students as possible” when using teachers’ predicted grades meant that far more than expected received top grades.Cuts in the value of tuition fees due to rising inflation mean that courses for British students are run at a deficit of up to £2,400 per medical student and £1,000 for those studying classroom-based subjects.More from NewsYour inner Moaning Myrtle could be holding you backFrance and Russia to hold talks in last-ditch effort to secure ceasefire in UkraineAngela Rayner\u0026#39s call for police to \u0026#39shoot terrorists and ask questions second\u0026#39 is correct, says Wes StreetingDispatch: Ukrainians evacuated to far-flung parts of Russia in \u0026#39false-flag\u0026#39 operationPrince Andrew and Prince Charles \u0026#39need\u0026#39 a war in Ukraine, says Russian state TVToothless President Biden is failing the WestMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"water companies should ensure one stretch river area safe swim","story":"The Government and water companies must ensure that more stretches of rivers are regularly tested to ensure they are safe enough to swim in, MPs have said.More than 80 per cent of people expect to be able to safely swim in a local river, new polling for the  has found, despite Government officials insisting they are not intended for human use.Swimmers are falling ill in water they assume to be clean, making it “critically important” to monitor popular areas for human safety, Philip Dunne, the Conservative chair of Parliament’s Environmental Audit Committee, told the .His views are backed by 76 per cent of people in England polled for the  by Opinium as part of its Clean Rivers Campaign, who said they would expect the Government to issue warnings about rivers if they were deemed unsafe to swim in.The EAC has called on the Government to support monitoring on at least one stretch of river in each water company area by 2025.By designating a stretch of a river as “bathing water”, the environment ministry will commit to monitoring it throughout the summer months for dangerous levels of bacteria, which can be caused by sewage or agricultural runoff.A recent report from the committee said England’s rivers are contaminated with a “chemical cocktail” of sewage, slurry and plastic.Fewer than one in five people believe England’s rivers are safe to swim in, but 83 per cent of respondents say at least some should be clean enough. Nearly one-third say all rivers in England should be fit for people to swim in.More than one-third also say they have seen visible pollution, such as plastic or chemicals, in England’s rivers, and around a quarter have noticed a reduction in fish and wildlife.Only one inland site in England has bathing water status, at the River Wharfe in Ilkley, which was rated poor in the first tests on the site earlier this year. That compares to 32 in Germany, 76 in Poland and 420 in France.The Environment Agency has insisted that rivers are not intended for people to swim in, but water minister Rebecca Pow told the  this week that people should “absolutely” be able to.Around a dozen sites are now hoping to gain the status in coming months, including an application by Port Meadow on the River Thames at Oxford which is now being considered by the environment ministry.Some want the Government to go even further, with the Wildlife and Countryside Link saying they should consider designating a minimum of two inland bathing waters every year.The push reflects a rise in the popularity of outdoor swimming in recent years, with Outdoor Swimmer reporting as much as a threefold rise in participation between 2019 and 2021.That has coincided with growing concern over the frequent dumping of sewage into England’s rivers by water companies, which has left outdoor swimmers at risk of illness.Agricultural runoff can also cause explosions in the growth of algae, which can be toxic to dogs, as well as harmful to people.MPs heard evidence from the Rivers Trust that the designation of stretches of rivers as bathing waters “could drive action to clean up pollution from all sources, including water company assets, private sewerage, agriculture, road run-off and minewater”.Citizen scientists who have been testing the water at popular bathing spots have found levels of bacteria that were far higher than acceptable limits for human contact.The Oxford Rivers Project found bacteria levels were on average twice the recommended safety threshold during the wet summer months of May and June, which put swimmers at risk of illness, at sites it tested near Port Meadow. It found the source of the bacteria was treated and untreated sewage entering the river.“We hear of too many instances where river users have fallen ill after swimming in rivers they assumed were safe,” said Philip Dunne.“Having more rivers in England of bathing quality status can help this: it requires robust monitoring of bacterial levels and as a result, data is made available for river users to make an informed and timely judgement on whether they wish to go in the water.”“Making rivers safe for recreational enjoyment, and improving the health of river ecosystems, is critically important.”“I am encouraged that water companies themselves are starting to identify stretches of rivers where they would like to declare bathing water status, such as Severn Trent on the River Leam and River Teme, and Thames Water on the River Thames in Oxford.”Ms Pow told the  she expected to see a lot more rivers gaining bathing water status in coming months.“I\u0027ve made a real proviso in encouraging it, in terms of highlighting to local authorities that they can apply,” she said. “A lot of citizen groups are latching on to this now because they know it is a way they can get a special focus on their stretch of rivers to get it cleaned up.”More from NewsYour inner Moaning Myrtle could be holding you backFrance and Russia to hold talks in last-ditch effort to secure ceasefire in UkraineAngela Rayner\u0026#39s call for police to \u0026#39shoot terrorists and ask questions second\u0026#39 is correct, says Wes StreetingDispatch: Ukrainians evacuated to far-flung parts of Russia in \u0026#39false-flag\u0026#39 operationPrince Andrew and Prince Charles \u0026#39need\u0026#39 a war in Ukraine, says Russian state TVToothless President Biden is failing the WestMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"absurd claim women arent taken seriously","story":"Spending a few days in Cambridge is as good a way as any to be reminded of the punchy confidence of some male intellectuals. But it’s a very good way to see women in action, too: either at the top of the professorial ladder, or young and clever – speaking up not as frequently or tenaciously as their male peers, perhaps, but taken every bit as seriously when they do so.It’s certainly not the case that sexism has been eradicated. But Suzannah Lipscomb’s call last week, in which the popular history broadcaster and professor emerita argued for a women-only non-fiction prize, is painfully off-base. Professor Lipscomb argues that there is an “authority gap”, whereby female academics are not accorded as much respect as their male peers. She says this gap is evident in the emphasis on full titles for male professors. In one news report, Professor Sir Richard Evans, the Cambridge historian of Nazism and expert witness at the David Irving trial, was given his full honorifics, while the equally expert Mary Beard, the Cambridge classicist, was referred to just by her name.The numbers do suggest a gap – among the 100 best-selling history books of 2021, only 19 were written by women. But this gap is not necessarily caused by what Prof Lipscomb is suggesting. The majority of amateur history readers are men, and it may well be that they are more interested in books on subjects that are also more likely to be written by men – such as military history. This is not because women are naturally predisposed to fuzzy things and men to tanks, but we are still at a point in time when things shake out like this.The real problem, however, is that in demanding special treatment for women, Prof Lipscomb surely commits the very crime she is accusing the world of: taking women less seriously. If I was trying to win a history prize, I’d feel condescended to if I was encouraged not to compete with the boys – and then, were I to win, shortchanged because the playing field had been artificially flattened.Women do lag behind in important areas, and this should be fixed. But demanding more sex segregation isn’t the way to do so.More from NewsFrance and Russia to hold talks in last-ditch effort to secure ceasefire in UkraineAngela Rayner\u0026#39s call for police to \u0026#39shoot terrorists and ask questions second\u0026#39 is correct, says Wes StreetingDispatch: Ukrainians evacuated to far-flung parts of Russia in \u0026#39false-flag\u0026#39 operationPrince Andrew and Prince Charles \u0026#39need\u0026#39 a war in Ukraine, says Russian state TVToothless President Biden is failing the WestThe key Covid measures are falling – now is as good a time as any to end restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"nadine dorries government must save bbc","story":"The Government must “save the BBC from itself” because the corporation is a “polar bear on a shrinking ice cap”, Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, has claimed.The minister, who recently announced the licence fee would be frozen for the next two years, has said the broadcaster in its current form “will not exist in the future”.Ms Dorries has suggested the BBC will struggle as fewer people pay the licence fee – non-payment of which may be decriminalised in future – and stated that funding reform is needed to save the national broadcaster.The Culture Secretary said: “Our responsibility is to save the BBC from itself, because it is that polar bear on a shrinking ice cap. It’s a global British brand, which must be protected.”She added: “I’m afraid the BBC in its present format, in its present funding model, will not exist into the future.“Whether I’m here or not, it will hit the buffers as more people refuse to pay the licence fee. You have to open your eyes and see what’s coming.”Speaking to The Times, Ms Dorries suggested that the BBC’s problems are not only financial, but cultural, and has accused the broadcaster of having a distorted perception of the nation it serves.She said: “There is a problem with groupthink within the BBC, and I don’t think those people think they are left or they are right.“I think they just believe they are absolutely right about everything. And they have a worldview and a view of the UK, which is, I think, sometimes very wrong.”The BBC is facing cuts after Ms Dorries announced the licence fee would be frozen at £159 per year until 2024, before it rises in line with inflation until 2027.The current licence fee model will be guaranteed by Royal Charter until that time, but there has been speculation about its future after that date, with Ms Dorries herself suggesting that the funding method could be abolished.In January, she stated on Twitter:More from NewsFrance and Russia to hold talks in last-ditch effort to secure ceasefire in UkraineAngela Rayner\u0026#39s call for police to \u0026#39shoot terrorists and ask questions second\u0026#39 is correct, says Wes StreetingDispatch: Ukrainians evacuated to far-flung parts of Russia in \u0026#39false-flag\u0026#39 operationPrince Andrew and Prince Charles \u0026#39need\u0026#39 a war in Ukraine, says Russian state TVToothless President Biden is failing the WestThe key Covid measures are falling – now is as good a time as any to end restrictionsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsBroadband and Mobile DealsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"costly parliament repairs paused another","story":"Exclusive: Costly Parliament repairs paused for another six months - and could be axed completelySources fear the crumbling Palace of Westminster could become another Notre Damedecisions are not taken soonParliaments costly refurbishment has been plagued by issues Image: PAByMikey SmithWhitehall Correspondent:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |commentsEssential refurbishment of the crumbling Houses of Parliament has been “paused” for at least another six months - and could be cancelled entirely, the Mirror has learned. The costly, long-running project was effectively left at a standstill after its strategic team was unexpectedly scrapped by a Commons body last week. Plans to bring a ‘business case’ for the work for MPs to vote on have been pushed from next Summer well into . And some sources believe the “Restoration and Renewal”project could end up being dissolved entirely, and replaced with a “patch and mend” process to fix the most serious problems with the building piecemeal over the course of  years. Sources close to the ‘Restoration and Renewal’project fear the crumbling Palace of Westminster could become another Notre Damedecisions are not taken soon.Parliament’s maze of lt shafts and corridors, run through with an ageing electrical system, means a fire could spread rapidly through the building in the same way as the -year-old Paris Cathedral.“There’s no sense of urgency,” one insider said. “It’s mad.”  And there’s concern the public might think proper restoration had already been underway for years while the Elizabeth Tower - which houses Big Ben - was under scaffolding. “That’s just maintenance really,” a source working on the RR project said. “They’ve done a lovely job on it, but the work that needs to be done to make the building safe is on another scale.”Traditionalist Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg has been accused of being a ‘road block’ to any plans to have MPs move out of the building during works - something he denies.It emerged this week that dozens of people had been warned they had been exposed to asbestos during maintenance work in the building. Over the last three years, authorities recorded  separate incidents of falling masonry on the estate - and there were  reported fires between  and . And in  the Commons Public Accounts Committee estimated the cost to the taxpayer of maintaining the crumbling building rose by £ million for every week the project has been delayed. In , MPs voted in favour of moving out of the building while work was underway, and the Sponsor Body was given the job of coming up with firm plans. But cost estimates spiralled to between £bn and £bn - with MPs set to be ejected from the building for more than a decade. The Commons Commission last yeardelayed the project, asking the Sponsor Body to ‘review’ it and come up with a way to keep a “sustained presence” of MPs during the refurb.  The review found even partial occupation of the Palace while work was underway would take “decades” longer, cost far more and involve an “extraordinary level of risk” to workers and people remaining on the premises.The review alone is reported to have cost between £m and £m to undertake. But rather than take the advice of the body, the Commission decided to scrap it and form a new body. Sources told the Mirror Jacob Rees-Mogg had been a ‘road block’ to plans to move out of the building while work is underway - and had “pushed back” on any option involving a ‘decant’. But a spokesperson for Mr Rees-Mogg denied this, saying it was not “fair or accurate.” The spokesperson said: “He was opposed to a scheme costing over £ billion and lasting  years with a  year decant, which is what has been proposed by the sponsor body. “Members originally voted for a decant of six years in . During his time as leader the house signicantly increased the pace of restoration.” He added: “Itaposs also inaccurate to describe him as a roadblock on the commission considering the fact the Government does not have a majority on there and he was far from the only person sceptical of an expansive [Restoration and Renewal programme] with a long decant.” Tory MP Mark Spencer, who replaced Mr Rees-Mogg as Commons Leader last month, has indicated he too has reservations about ‘decanting’ MPs and peers.Speaking to the BBC last week, he compared the idea to “moving out into a caravan in the garden and letting the builders loose.”The Commons Commission, made up of the Speaker, Commons leader and a handful of MPs and officials, decided to scrap the ‘arms-’ Sponsor Body last week - to be replaced by an as yet undecided body reporting directly to them and their counterparts in the House of Lords. Both the Commons and Lords Commissions are set to meet in the coming weeks to hammer out the next steps.

The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday. He is also likely to confirm the date free lateral flow and PCR tests will be axed - although is not expected to actually happen this week. The £ self-isolation payment for low-income workers and legal powers for councils both face being scrapped. And the Mirror understands he was weighing up whether to axe sick pay from day one of Covid isolation, despite fury from unions and Labour. Scroll down for the full guide to the changes - or join the debate in the commentsFor holidaymakers, Passenger Locator Forms could be simplied further, or even scrapped completelyTransport Secretary Grant Shapps gets his way.Travel testing, however, is likely to stay for unvaccinated people entering the UK for the foreseeable future. Mr Johnson is likely to give a statement to Parliament at around .pm on Monday. He could also give a press conference. Facing pressure from Tory MPs over his leadership, the PM has decided Britain has had all the restrictions it can tolerate. Ahead of outlining the plan, Mr Johnson said: Covid will not suddenly disappear, and we need to learn to live with this virus and continue to protect ourselves without restricting our freedoms. Weaposve built up strong protections against this virus over the past two years through the vaccine rollouts, tests, new treatments, and the best scientic understanding of what this virus can do. Thanks to our successful vaccination programme and the sheer magnitude of people who have come forward to be jabbed, we are now in a position to set out our plan for living with Covid this week.It comes after ministers confirmed all children over five will be able to get the Covid vaccine from April. But charities worry millions of vulnerable or immunocompromised Brits will be thrown to the wolves with little support.And the governmentaposs own scientic advisors have warned ending testing and isolation could trigger a rapid rise in cases. Here’s everything we know about what is likely to be announced.Self-isolation laws scrappedLegal Covid self-isolation is due to be scrapped - evenyou currently have the virus - from as soon as Thursday  February. The decision will end almost exactly two years of legally-enforced isolation for people who test positive. But it raises ethical dilemmas about whether to go to work and put others at risk, especiallyyou can no longer claim a £ isolation payment or sick pay from day one . Despite scrapping legal isolation, No said: “We’re not saying isolation is pointless. We’d expect anyone with an infectious disease to take steps not to spread that disease further - a colleague at work with flu, for example. Currently people who test positive must go into self-isolation for at least five full days in England, a period that has been repeatedly cut from  days and seven days. Fears Statutory Sick Pay will be stripped back Boris Johnson has been weighing up whether to scrap sick pay from day one of Covid illness, the Mirror understands.£.-a-week Statutory Sick Payis usually only available from the fourth day of any illness, after three ‘waiting days’ are complete. This was cut to the first day in  for people isolating due to Covid. Ministers said the move was “vital” to ensure people get help and follow the rules.But the power is contained in the Coronavirus Act, which is currently due to expire on March .That means it could be removed, even though No has advised people who are sick with the virus to stay away from work. TUC General Secretary Frances O’Grady said: “It’s vital that sick pay remains a day one right and is made available to all. Workers who are laid low by Covid must be able to make ends meet – not pushed into financial hardship.”A date for scrapping free lateral flow testsBoris Johnson’s plan is expected to set a timetable for the end of free lateral flow tests, with people having to pay instead.The government warned last summer it would eventually stop paying for these rapid tests due to the huge cost of the NHS.Sources told the Mirror that claims the tests themselves will end this week are wide of the mark. However, the Living with Covid plan could set a date in the future for when they are cut off. It’s not known how much lateral flow tests will cost, but estimates have put it at £ for a pack of seven. A date for scrapping free PCR tests and Test and TraceIt’s thought the plan may contain a date for ending free ‘gold standard’ PCR tests as England’s Covid infrastructure is wound down. Whitehall sources told thethe Treasury is trying to cut the £bn-a-year cost, which will mean having to phase out free testing and all but ending the contact-tracing system. Scientists have raised the alarm about ending these free tests, with reports suggesting they could cost £ each privately. According to reports, only health and social care workers and .million vulnerable people will continue to get free PCRs. Prof Lawrence Young of Warwick University said: “Living with Covid doesn’t mean letting our guard down”. Covid travel Passenger Locator Form could be simplied or axed Fully-vaccinated people entering the UK do not need to take any Covid tests, under changes that happened on February . But they still need to fill in a Passenger Locator Form - albeit a ‘simplied’ one - and further changes to this are possible in this week’s Covid plan. It’s understood the Department for Transport was pressing to further simply the Passenger Locator Form - or get rid of it completely. It is thought there was only a slim chance of the form being axed altogether, as health officials were still worried about needing to track new iants coming in to the UK. Meanwhile, unvaccinated people still need to take one pre-departure test and one post-arrival test before entering the UK. It’s understood this rule will stay for the foreseeable future and no changes to it are due this week. £ self-isolation payment could be scrappedThe £ self-isolation payment for poor workers with Covid could end as the legal requirement to quarantine is scrapped. The Test and Trace Support Payment was introduced in September  to help low-wage workers afford to self-isolate for up to  days. No final decisions have been announced yet over the future of the £ payment, and its status was being considered by the government last week.  Legal powers for councils will goLegal changes will end remaining powers councils had under the  Coronavirus Act in England to close some venues. However, these powers were barely ever used, because powers for lockdowns flow from a separate law passed in . And the vast majority of Coronavirus Act powers - including on detention, events, gatherings, shops and restaurants and schools - already expired in September . Only a few of the more draconian powers - including the power to suspend port operations - remained in the Act. Vaccines for all children over five All children over five will be able to get vaccinated against Covid- from April. The “non-urgent offer” to the parents of nearly six million - year olds was confirmed by the Government moments after advice issued by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation . Two smaller doses of the Pfizer jab,  weeks apart, will be available to this age group to help control future Covid waves after Covid curbs have been lted. It is understood there are no plans for a major publicity drive to encourage this age group to be vaccinated and it will be left very much up to parents to decide. Itaposs understood a rollout for over-s will be less urgent than previous vaccine drives, due to the very low risk Covid poses to younger kids. The idea is that ordinary NHS care shouldn’t be interrupted to give kids the jab, like it was for adults. All children over  have been able to get the Pfizer Covid jab since September last year. Currently, only the most vulnerable kids aged  to  are eligible. They are offered two jabs but at a lower dose than for adults -  micrograms instead of .

The sector is battling sky-high electricity prices, % US tarfs on its products and demands to cut pollution. There are also renewed fears for the future of British plants owned by steel tycoon Sanjeev Gupta after they were hit with winding up orders.

UK Steel director-general Gareth Stace said: “The whole UK steel sector is united in its desire to work with Kwasi Kwarteng, Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson to deliver a decarbonised steel sector that is at the heart of the decarbonisation of our economy and accelerates the levelling-up of communities across the country. “While we face challenges from high electricity prices and global steel overcapacity - in addition to Britain’s entry as an independent trading nation and the need to establish our own trade defence mechanisms - we are looking forward to productive and positive discussions, in particular on decarbonisation. “The Government has committed multiple times to decarbonising our economy and led the world at COP.  “As a sector, we stand ready to work with Kwasi Kwarteng to deliver a modern near-zero steel industry and to allow the UK to be a world leader in this. “Just as steel built our past, it is a vital part of our future.” Britain’s steel sector belched out about  million tonnes of carbon dioxide - including indirect emissions from power production - in .

Its p spaghetti is, like the proleration of food banks in the UK, a treatment of the symptom of poverty.We need to address the cause. The responsibility for the welfare and wellbeing of our most vulnerable citizens should not rest on the shoulders of charities, nor supermarkets. It’s easy to paint the large ­corporations as the villains, but questions need to be asked as to why people need p spaghetti and p pasta to survive in one of the richest economies in the world.  And the answers lie squarely at the well-heeled feet of those who have held the purse strings and policies of the country for the last  long and dismal years. Those years of austerity cuts to social care and health services mean the safety net of a decent and supportive society is less than threadbare. The triple threat of rocketing food prices, unmanageable energy bills, and an underfunded National Health Service is going to cause long-term damage to families, communities, and ­iniduals in almost every ­neighbourhood in the country. Every area now has at least one foodbank we live in a society where people need the ad-hoc macro philanthropy of neighbours and strangers to not starve to death.  Over the last two years of the pandemic, the Chancellor has proven time and again that he can magic up a whole orchard of flourishing and evergreen money trees when it comes to propping up his pet projects. Writing off £.billion of furlough fraud, £.billion “lost” down the back of the Downing Street couch, supposedly spent on PPE nobody has any record of, not even the company that received the payment. That money alone could have paid for TWO YEARS of the continuation of the £ uplt to Universal Credit. Somehow there is always money for crony contracts, Parliamentary p*ss-ups, weaponry and warfare, and DWP cover-ups, because it comes at the expense of social care, school dinners, and starving pensioners. So while I welcome the ­reappearance of budget groceries on the supermarket shelves as an ­immediate-term relief for millions of people struggling to make ends meet, and while I will continue to write recipes for p a head and publish them for free on my website, I’m determined that we work towards building a world where neither of those things are essential any more.

The Prime Minister will set out his blueprint for living with the virus on Monday, where he is expected to axe remaining Covid regulations in England. Self isolation requirements for positive cases are expected to be repealed within days, and the PM is also tipped to set a date when free Covid tests will stop. But the scope of the plan to end mass free tests to save cash is reportedly subject to a dispute among top Tories. Around  million people take regular Covid tests according to the latest UKHSA data, including those who visit or care for vulnerable friends and relatives. Analysis by the Liberal Democrats suggest people who take two tests a week face a hit of £ a year, based on the average cost of lateral flow tests in countries like Belgium, France, Spain and the US.Liberal Democrat Leader Ed Davey said: Charging people for the tests they need to safely see vulnerable loved ones is a tax on caring, that risks leaving millions of people in lockdown by stealth. It means vulnerable people will see fewer loved ones and will be able to enjoy less of their lives. It is unfair and unjust. Ministers need to scrap these plans to stop a cost of living with Covid crisis. Mr Johnson said it was time to move away from strict Covid curbs and to allow people to take their own decisions.We have reached a stage where we think you can sht the balance away from state mandation, away from banning certain courses of action, and compelling certain courses of action, in favour of encouraging personal responsibility, he told the BBC.Mr Johnson said testing would be at a much lower level and that we donapost need to keep spending at a rate of £ billion a month.  Askedthe move could mean the possibility of losing early warning signals, he said: I want to make sure that we have capability to spot stuff and to snap back up as fast as we need to. The PM added: We need resilience but we donapost need to keep, for instance on testing, we donapost need to keep spending at a rate of £ billion a month, which is what we were doing in January. Asked how Covid will be spottedthere is no testing, Mr Johnson: We will be testing at a much lower level. Iaposm afraid what we canapost do is continue with the - as the number of cases diminishes and certainly the number of patients in hospital is thankfully coming down now, the number of cases in ICU is certainly way, way down, weaposre in a dferent world. I think it is important that people should feel confident again and that people should feel able to go back to work in the normal way. I do want to see our country really getting back on its feet.

If today, you were constructing the best model for a European trade organisation, would it resemble the bloated, bureaucratic, monolith run by unelected, mediocre, pro-German civil servants called the EU  And more than half the country, predominantly older people staunchly proud of Britain’s history and its ­constitutional monarchy, thought not. Well, I’d like to ask them,they were constructing a model British state today, would they have a Windsor at the head of it  Park this year’s fairy-tale narrative about the past seven decades being one long, glorious reign, and focus on the past few days. The heir to the throne faces a police investigation over claims his advisers fixed a CBE for a Saudi tycoon who had given a fortune to one of his charities. Charles denies any knowledge of a deal but can’t deny secretly meeting the tycoon in Saudi Arabia, welcoming him to Clarence House, and giving him the CBE at Buckingham Palace.  The Queen’s second oldest son has just agreed a reported £million payoff to a woman who claimed he raped her when she was , as a minor under US law, which he denies. In fact he denies ever meeting her. So we’re expected to believe he’s just given £million to a complete stranger. And the royals won’t denysome of his hush money comes from the Queen’s Duchy of Lancaster tax-deductible fund. Which would effectively mean taxpayers crowdfunding the Duke of York’s escape route from a child sex scandal. He still retains that title, despite York MP Rachael Maskell demanding it be removed after a poll claimed % of York citizens don’t want him shaming their city. He will also remain a Queen’s ­Counsellor of State. I can’t wait to hear how he counsels her on legislation about sex trafficking. The views of York’s citizens are deemed irrelevantbecause in our monarchical system, subjects cannot question royals. I would love to hear MPs debate the issues around Charles and Andrew, and how much, and for how long, the Queen knew of her son’s connections to his convicted paedophile friend. And the morality behind Buckingham Palace finally ordering Andrew to settle the allegations against him to save the precious Platinum Jubilee. But our elected representatives cannot mention such issues in the Commons, just as we can’t see how much royals leave in their wills, because as Parliamentary bible Erskine May states: “No question can be put which brings the name of the Sovereign or the ­influence of the Crown directly before Parliament, or which casts reflections upon the ­Sovereign or the Royal Family.” Hence why MPs are forced to take an oath of allegiance to the monarch and all their heirs. What a ludicrous, humiliating stitch-up. All to keep these accidents of birth ruling over us. And to think, most Brits believe the EU is an anti-democratic gravy train which keeps charlatans in clover, while our “democracy” is the envy of the world. I’d love to think this week will convince royalists that this family they idolise is not only not better than theirs, some of its members are far worse. And we should bin the whole feudal farce once the Queen dies. But I’d be kidding myself.

But the little lad fell in love with the sea creature and convinced his family to travel five hours andit to the sea, BirminghamLive reports.The crustacean was found by -year-old Arthur Moon in the public loo at Birmingham Market. His mum Melanie says he quickly named the crab Gary, who they believe probably escaped from a live food stall, and was determined tohim to the ocean. So they took the cunning crab back to their Coventry home, kept him alive and plotted their trip to the beach.Despite being told by a stall owner that the crab would be dead in hours they didnapost give up hope and had a great day out. She cleared out a salad draw and made him a little habitat with sand and salt water - and the little critter went from strength to strength. The -year-old mum said: Arthur is autistic and doesnapost like crowds so we had been working on getting him out a bit more. He needed the toilet and went into the baby changing area by mistake. He came out and Iaposve never seen him so excitable! He grabbed my arm and made me go and have a look. There was a little crab legging it around the room and then he tried to hide in the corner.I thought, what should we do  He was smaller than my hand - and we decided to take him home. We went to a seafood stall and asked a woman for a pot but she said there was no point and he would die in hours. I thought better to die in our home then in a toilet at the market. I popped him in a pot then in my bag and went around the Think Tank. After taking him home, Melanie made Gary the crab his very own habitat in a salad drawer. I thought, aposI know, Iaposll get the salad drawer out of the fridgeapos, she said. I got sand from a bag in the garden in the bottom and then salted some water. After some googling I found out they will eat anything so I gave him some fruit. I found that his favourite things were tomatoes and strawberries. We think he was a shore crab which meant that he would have been caught in the wild rather than farmed.Melanie told BlackCountryLive: A few days later he was still alive and well and would watch me when I talked to him, he got quite used to me.He most definitely wasnapost dying - he had a real will to survive. He had clearly escaped from the live food stall and had it about him enough to leg it off.

If you sell goods to the EU, or buy goods from the EU and bring them into the UK, you need to be able to prove that they meet the new rules of origin requirements to access preferential tarfs. It’s vital you understand the new rules to keep your business moving. To benefit from the preferential tarfs, you must have proof that any goods you import from the EU originate there, or any goods you export to the EU originate in the UK. Proof of origin can either be a statement of origin completed by the exporter, or evidence of the importer’s knowledge of where products originate. If you cannot prove the origin, you or your EU customer may be liable to pay the full rate of customs duty and could face penalties. Andrew Macleod, founder of London-based restaurant brand Emilia’s Crafted Pasta, explains that imports from the EU are vital to his brand: “We import ingredients directly from Italy, including special cured meats, cheeses, drinks and alcohol. Each of our suppliers is hand-picked.”  Has he had to make any changes to his business now that there are new import rules in place  “Yes – of course we already knew the origin of all the goods we import as we source everything carefully. But we’ve trained two of our managers on the rules around importing, so we know that we have staff in house who are well versed in the process.”  And having successfully navigated the changes, what advice would Andrew offer other businesses that import  “We found using a customs agent really helps the process run smoothly, but it’s equally important that you understand the rules yourself,” he says. “It’s not too late, and the gov.uk site has lots of valuable information.”  You must be able to prove the origin of any product you import You can choose to work with a freight forwarder or courier To benefit from preferential tarfs, you must be able to prove that any goods you import originated in the EU Note:you’re moving goods between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, rules of origin work dferently.

But this was never confirmed by Ryanair on the day - and no-one could get hold of anyone from the airline until Saturday. It is understood it was using drop-in agency staff for flights from Helsinki Airport. Fellow passenger Lucy Miles, from Haringey, North London, said it was left to a rep from Finnair in departures to hand out a sheet detailing customers’ rights following a cancellation.  The -year-old and her partner Jake Loft, , were among dozens who eventually opted to sleep on sofas in the departure lounge. She said she was initially under the impression everyone would be offered a hotel room but things became confused as Ryanair “wasn’t present” and it didn’t appear there was enough accommodation. “We were then told you can come back in the morning to sort it out once Ryanair phone lines were open, so half of the people stayed in the airport overnight, slept there and the other half got a hotel,” she explained.Paul and his family, meanwhile, were lucky enough to get a hotel room, after tracking down agency staff and being given a slip for a free hotel stay - eventually arriving at am. But the following morning trying to get hold of Ryanair was “torturous”, he said, having waited in a two-hour queue of  people on its online chat portal. “I just wanted some clarication, would they put us on a plane today or tomorrow, andnot shall we just go ahead and book another flight ourselves ”He was eventually offered a direct flight on Thursday , but needed to be home sooner. Paul is self-employed, Louise is a teacher and their children are back at school on Monday. “My we has epilepsy too and she brought enough tablets to see her comfortably through the five days we were away,” he explained. “Going through to when they were suggesting she would have been without them for  hours.  “On top of that, it’s not asthey were offering to put us up in a hotel for the next four days.” In a chat conversation seen by the Mirror, the Ryanair spokesperson said all passengers had been told via message that the flight was cancelled on Friday. However, Paul said he didn’t receive anything and neither did any of the other passengers he knew of, including Lucy and Jake.  He said there has just been “no clarity” throughout the whole ordeal, with the initial cancellation announcement supposedly only being read out in Finnish, with a local couple having to translate. “Then the poor people on the desk couldn’t get anyone to pick up the phone. That’s not communicating what the situation is,” he continued. “I don’t want to sound morbid but what happensa plane falls out of the sky at nine o’clock at night  Is there nobody there to pick up the phone for Ryanair  It’s ridiculous. “There’s a horrible parallel with our government, who are determined to give us no information at all and just gaslight us as much as they can, and that’s how I feel I’ve been treated by Ryanair.” Paul was able to book a new flight to Gatwick for Sunday morning, which includes an eight-hour layover in Berlin, Germany, and cost £ - though his car is parked at Stansted. Lucy and Jake, meanwhile, paid for a new flight costing around £ to fly back via Stockholm, in Sweden, on Saturday night. Lucy said after contacting Ryanair yesterday morning, she was told the airline would only reimburse them for direct flights - contrary to what it says on its website - and the next one to Stansted isn’t until Wednesday. The Mirror has contacted Ryanair for comment.

So itaposs no wonder people want to know exactly how they did it for less than a grand. Samantha told money-saving Facebook group DIY On A Budget UK : We knew we wanted a dark kitchen as we got a dog last year and the mud and mess he brings back from walks would ruin a light coloured kitchen.“We came across a black kitchen in IKEA with aposwooden effectapos worktops and we fell in love with it.“On Facebook, I saw a lot of people were painting kitchen cupboards so I looked up the nearest store that sells the paint and had a chat with the woman in the store. “She told me what I needed and how to prepare the cupboards.  To prep the cupboards I just cleaned thoroughly with a sugar soap solution then lightly sanded them down before applying the first coat. I did about five coats per door, leaving them to dry in between. I then put the Frenchic finishing coat on top. The worktops I just cleaned down before applying the vinyl.“The vinyl I used was DC Fix which I ordered online from createyourworld as I couldnapost buy five-metre long rolls in-store, only online and I didnapost want a big join in the middle of the worktop. Samantha revealed the wall was created from two bits of wood costing £ each. She said: “For the black and white wall, I used two pieces of wood from BQ, which were £ each. I stuck them to the wall using No More Nails glue to get a perfectly straight line but also give a d effect which I like. I’m thinking of sticking another piece on the top to create a shelf effect and the wall is painted with Dulux in Rich Black at £. I did paint the skirtings in Frenchic Blackjack but as I hoover daily it did scratch so I have since gone over this in black gloss from Home Bargains for £ which so far hasnapost scratched.  Despite all this work, the couple still has more changes to make.Samantha added: “We arenapost finished yet! I still plan to change the blinds, add some more shelves, get some pictures for the frames and make it more personal and homely with some decorative items.With the leftover Blackjack paint, I did end up painting the radiator, the extractor fan and the wooden legs on the white unit which I think finished the kitchen off perfectly.The basket with the dogaposs toys in was originally blue but I got some spray paint from the pound shop to spray the inside of the radiator black that I couldnapost reach with a brush.  “Using the leftover spray paint I sprayed the dogaposs toy basket black. “The sugar soap solution by Frenchic cost £., then I used three tins of Frenchic Al Fresco in Blackjack at £. a tin. For the tiles, I used one tin of Frenchic Al Fresco in Dazzle Me for £. then I used Frenchicaposs finishing coat for £.. I used the Frenchic brushes to apply the paint. I bought a square one and the rounded one, which cost £. and £.. I personally preferred the rounded one. For the worktops, I used DC Fix vinyl in Santana Oak Lime which cost £. “The flooring was the only thing we didnapost do ourselves. “We got some laminate effect lino which was put down on top of the laminate that was already down. From universal credit to furlough, employment rights, travel updates and emergency financial aid - weaposve got all of the big financial stories you need to know about right now.  to our Mirror Money newsletter here.  Overall, the couple says they are proud to have knocked thousands off the cost of their refurbished kitchen. Samantha said: “A local carpet shop did that for us for £ but this goes through the hallway too.

As for tips, I would definitely recommend watching videos and doing research on everything beforehand. I didnapost research much with the vinyl and since fitting the vinyl I have seen videos of people doing it online and I could have made it so much easier had I have seen these beforehand. Use Pinterest for ideas, and Facebook groups are amazing for ideas, advice and help too. I didnapost do it on my own, it was a joint effort with me and my partner. “I wouldn’t want people getting the wrong idea and thinking I did it all on my own! Iaposm not that good. Itaposs taken us weeks to do it together in between working so on my own it would have taken forever. Iaposm over the moon with how itaposs turned out, it looks like a completely dferent kitchen and it was definitely worth the hard work! We feel really proud that we actually did it all ourselves.

Dr Kelly Fearnley, , has suffered violent shaking fits lasting up to  hours and terrying hallucinations after first contracting the virus on a Covid ward in November . At one point, the symptoms had taken such a toll on her physical and mental health that she considered suicide, she told Sky News.After  months of living with the long-term effects of the virus, Dr Fearnley believes Boris Johnsonaposs plan to peel back Covid measures is both dangerous and irresponsible. As part of the Living with Covid plan being unveiled tomorrow, Brits will no longer have to self-isolate after testing positive, and lateral flow tests will no longer be free.  Dr Fearnley, from Leeds, told Sky News she feels angry and let down about the plan, which she branded a strategy of denial, driven by the need to cut costs. Months after her initial infection, Dr Fearnley started experiencing violent shakes lasting up to  hours at a time. She also suffered from disturbing auditory hallucinations, chilling night terrors about death and debilitating attacks of pins and needles. After contracting the virus during the second wave, Dr Fearnley took four weeks off work to recover. But when she ed she immediately became dizzy and breathless and needed to go home, which was when she started experiencing the Long Covid symptoms.  The symptoms had an acute effect on her mental state, and she started experiencing auditory hallucinations, which included a man shouting at her in the kitchen and a dog barking beside her. She took herself to AE, where doctors said she was suffering from anxiety and sent her home. Dr Fearnley then started experiencing sleep apnea where she would suddenly stop breathing at night, accompanied by a sense of impending doom. By January , the doctor thought her symptoms were easing, but she was wrong. Every night for three months she suffered from more distressing hallucinations.  She was bombarded by imagined noises like a muffled TV, a radio, music, and heavy metal bands playing. During one upsetting night terror she recalled watching a group of men being lined up and executed.Dr Fearnleyaposs comments come before Boris Johnson announces a long-term plan to aposlive with Covidapos in England - despite hundreds of deaths a day.The Prime Minister is expected to scrap all self-isolation, even for people who have the virus, from around Thursday.

After Bumbleaposs disappearance, Annie put out a missing dog appeal fearing her pooch might have climbed out when she was not there. But then suddenly Bumble popped her head up like a whac-a-mole on Tuesday, and she clambered to safety.The six-year-old dog had been missing in Rowde, Wilts since February . Heartwarmingly, Annie Davidson was then reunited with her pet. She said: Weaposre so delighted to have Bumble back home. The experience was traumatic for her. Bumble popped up and out of the badger sett. Very thin and dehydrated but fine otherwise.She earlier announced the dogaposs disappearance, saying: Border Terrier - Bumble - suspected to be lost down a badger sett. Dearly missed by all her family and especially her three young human brothers and sister. Lost pet group Search and Scan welcomed the news, saying: Welcome home Bumble. A spokesman added: Bumble was out on a routine walk when in a matter of seconds she just disappeared. Her owner could only assume she had disappeared down a hole in a badgeraposs sett that they were passing as she was nowhere to be seen. This was a very tricky case as by law badger setts are protected, so we were limited as to what we could do. Small dogs, particularly terrier type breeds are extremely inquisitive of mammal holes and will find themselves slipping easily through sett entrances and down badger tunnels whilst out walking off the lead. Watching your beloved pet disappearing into a badger sett can be very traumatic, not knowing whether the sett is occupied or whether your pet is stuck or worse! Badgers and their setts - tunnels and chambers where they live - are protected by law.

Evie, now eight, spoke to parent Chantelle who advised her on the next steps. She made sure he didnapost swallow his tongue until paramedics arrived at his home in Netherton, Merseyside.Without the instinctive actions of the little girl, Chantelle doesnapost think he would still be alive. The -year-old mum-of-three said she couldnapost believe how Evie reacted last February - and thinks it would have been a very dferent story had she not been there. Chantelle said: My dad was such an active man. He used to do everything for me and my kids, and I mean everything. One night Evie was staying with him and she called me about pm saying apossomethingaposs happened to grandad he canapost moveapos.Then I heard him in the background making a horrible noise and she said aposmummy, Iaposm going to phone an ambulanceapos. Then she put the phone down. When I got there she was on the phone to the ambulance, she was only seven. When I got in he was in a state I canapost describe, it was almost like he was melting into the floor. How she even looked at him and held it together is unbelievable.

She not only did that, she had him on his side in the recovery position and she was pulling his tongue out of his mouth so he wouldnapost choke. I couldnapost believe it. When the paramedics got there they even said without Evie being there he wouldnapost be alive. They said normally, in situations like that, little children panic and donapost know what to do but with Evie, I donapost know what it was but it all kicked in and she just did everything she could. One year on from the stroke, the -year-old grandad now needs Chantelle to care for him and her children in a full-time capacity.

Solid paved driveways do not allow water to soak into the ground and rely on drains instead.But this excess water can have a knock on effect on sewage systems, causing them to overflow and lead to drainage issues for the area and its surroundings.Minister for water Rebecca Pow told thethat driveways should be able to stop this from happening.We need to have semi-permeable membranes on our driveways rather than Tarmac so that rainwater doesnapost rush away but soaks in, she said. The Tory minister explained that developers might have to prove they had sustainable drainage systems before they were permitted to connect to sewage networks to avoid pumping rivers with waste. It comes under the Clean Rivers campaign in her Somerset constituency of Taunton Deane. Ministers are still looking at buildersapos right to connect and whether or not they only offer this to those with sustainable drainage.  Major housing developments might also have to invest in new sewage infrastructure to avoid overwhelming the existing system, reports suggest. Parliament is also considering whether to create ponds where water can soak into the ground rather than running into drains which can cause sewage systems to overflow. Ms Pow said that Britain needs to be more sustainably conscious and look at the really big picture in order to have the best possible housing. But her initiative may put a spanner in the works for the housing ministry which aims to build , new homes each year.  Semipermeable driveways are another alternative for Brits wanting to help tackle river pollution. The material soaks up water and retains it rather than allowing it to rush towards drains. Pollution from raw sewage being offloaded into rivers has recently risen up the political agenda. Ms Pow said water companies have started to monitor their storm overflows in the last five years and that the government is acting fast on what used to be a hidden problem. “We’ve literally prioritised this more than it’s ever been prioritised, she added.The minister also hoped Michael Gove might be sympathetic towards her objective to make sustainable housing developments, as a former member Defra member.Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON SomersetConservative PartyMichael GovePoliticsHousingSewagePollutionproperty newsHousing and Urban Development\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\" to FREE email alerts from our Property Market newsletterSubscribeInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

But eventually, she decided to tackle her huge debt head-on – which led to le-changing results for her and her familyKatie Agbebi paid off her debts of £, Image: INSTAGRAMByKate Graham:,  Feb Updated:,  Feb |comments Staring down at the huge number in front of me – an eye-watering £, – it felt unreal. How was it possible to owe so much  How could I have let it get this bad  Then I thought about the deliveries of clothes I’d hidden behind the sofa, the £, bed we’d bought on a payment plan, all the holidays we’d booked without a thought about how to pay for them…For a minute I felt completely overwhelmed. Then fight mode kicked in.“I’m going to face this head on,” I thought, determination flooding through me. Whatever we have to do, however long it takes, we’ll pay off this debt – and never get into it again.”I was  when I walked into my local bank in Liverpool and left with my first credit card. I hadn’t read the details and had no idea about the repayments. All I knew was that I could start shopping with “my” £ – result! I started my office administration job a few months later and my credit limit immediately jumped to £,. “It’s brilliant,” I said to my boyfriend, Marseilles, now , who I’d been with for a year. I was earning £, and still living at home with my parents. They covered all my utility bills so I could really splash out. Each month when the credit card bill came, I made the minimum repayment and then thought nothing of it. Marseilles and I never planned a baby so soon, but in  our son Marcus was born. I was besotted, but at  I felt the pressure as a young mum. I wanted to show everyone that I was doing well. Looking at Marcus in his pricey buggy and new clothes, I felt proud. “So whatit’s on credit ” I shrugged.  Spiralling out of controlLiving with my parents made the spending easy – ordering things from catalogues, I paid the minimum, just as I did with the credit cards. Then, in , the three of us moved intoa place of our own. “Look at these bills,” I’d think as they hit the mat. Rent, council tax, electricity – it never stopped.We decided I’d be in charge of family finances and I tried – but when it came to spending, I didn’t hold back. Why bother when I could just use credit  For years that’s what we did. When we bought a house in , family lent us the deposit, we used finance for the furniture and credit for the home improvements we needed. I lost track of what we owed. So long as I made the minimum repayments it felt fine. Our daughter Reyes was born in January  and we borrowed £, to get married in November that year. Yet the extra debt wasn’t a worry. The same year, Marseilles, who was a taxi driver, decided he wanted to study business at university. There was only one way to pay the £, fees. “Look, the loan has been approved,” I grinned, delighted. In January , I happened to see a YouTube video about setting financial goals, instead of New Year’s resolutions.“We must plan our next family holiday,” I thought. “I’m earning £, now and Marseilles is still doing taxi work. I wonderwe’ve any savings to go towards it ” I sat down and for the first time, calculated our monthly expenses. “This can’t be right,” I thought, fear creeping in. “The minimum repayment on our monthly debts is the same as my salary.” My dream of not ing to work after my maternity leave with Reyes vanished. But the upset I felt was nothing compared to the next shock. When I worked out we owed £, I was horried. “That’s impossible,” cried Marseilles when I told him. But as I showed him each of our debts, he knew it was real. We’d argued about money in the past. When our cable TV was cut off because the cash wasn’t there to pay for it, he’d been baffled and cross. I’d hide purchases from him to avoid fights. But in the face of this enormous debt, we united. The only way out of this mess was to be a team. There were only two ways to pay off the debt – increase our income and reduce spending. We focused on the latter. So, for the first time, I drew up a proper family budget. We went through months of bank statements with highlighter pens, looking at everything we were spending on. “We’re spending £ a month on food,” I spluttered. Out went my daily work lunch at the café and online food shopping. In came going to the supermarket in person with cash and a calculator and proper meal planning. Every penny counted. It would take time to get straight so we needed a realistic budget we could stick to. We decided to keep £ a month for takeaways.  Salon trips were over – I did my own hair and nails. Looking and feeling good was important, I just needed to do it cheaply. We swapped pricey theme parks for a National Trust membership. With the Lake District and North Wales nearby, taking a picnic and playing outside was just as much fun. We stopped buying any clothes that we didn’t need. Emptying my wardrobe looking for things to sell, I couldn’t believe how much I’d wasted over the years. For things we did need, like walking boots for Marcus, I hunted for bargains, thinking, “Can I get them from the ‘treat’ money this month ”We explained to Marcus, then , what was happening and he was amazing. He loved the visual debt trackers I’d made and stuck in the kitchen cupboards. Every time I made a cuppa, I saw the progress, which kept me motivated. I knew that I needed to be accountable, to keep me on track, so I created an Instagram account all about my debt and the steps I was taking to deal with it. Connecting with other people with similar experiences gave me a sense of community. But it was hard for real-le friends to understand why I wouldn’t have dinner and drinks out or why we were only buying Christmas gts for our own children and not theirs. People I connected with online understood because they advocated minimalism and “slow living”, too. The more unnecessary stuff we sold from the house, the lighter I felt. I started writing down all the things that made me feel good and realised my happiness came from family time, not buying things. So much of my previous spending was to look good and to “keep up”. I was discovering that I didn’t need that any more. For the things in my le that I didn’t like – such as our garden – I tried a “contentment challenge”. By really taking care of it, my feelings about it shted. Before, I’d have been shopping to change it, but I’d learnt that I didn’t need to spend to appreciate something. It wasn’t easy. While I celebrated the debt slowly decreasing, I was impatient. It was hard to be constantly reminded that it was my past mistakes that had led me here.  On the right track We thought hard about having a third child. Would it be madness when we were trying so hard to deal with the debt  But by  we knew that having another child didn’t have to be expensive. Saoirse arrived in January . There were no fancy clothes or hi-tech baby equipment – and it didn’t matter one bit. In October ,  months after we faced our debt head-on, I made our final payment.“We’ve done it,” I said to Marseilles, grinning. There was no lavish party to celebrate, justa cake from my mum and a big balloon that said, “We are debt free.”Through hard work and laser focus, I felt I’d achieved the impossible in  months. The experience has really changed me and my financial habits forever. But it’s about so much more than keeping to a budget. I’m pregnant again and this baby will be born into a debt-free family – one who knows that true happiness comes from each other and isn’t something you can buy.Follow Katie Agbebi on Instagram @how_to_eat_an_elephantRead MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON The National TrustNew YearBabiesBanksPregnancyCouncil taxCredit cardsFamily holidaysTheme parksMaternity rightsChristmas dinnerChristmas shoppingChristmas partyDebt\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Prince Charles is rarely seen touching his we Camilla, and the Cambridges have strict aposon-dutyapos behaviour. But when Prince William tried a rare PDA during the coupleaposs appearance on Mary Berryaposs A Berry Royal Christmas back in  - it was well and truly shot down. In fact, some viewers described the moment as extremely awkward and said Kate recoiled from her husbandaposs touch - however others praised her for trying to keep things professional and trying to avoid stealing the show.The moment occurred as the couple sat down to speak to charity volunteers at a Christmas party, which was being catered by former Great British Bake Off judge Mary. Twitter users picked up on Kateaposs reaction to Williamaposs touch.One wrote: Awkward! Too awkward!! They should have cut it out. Another said Kate aposmoved with a quicknessapos after her husband reached out for her. A third person commented: Kate shaking off Williamaposs hand on her shoulder during #ABerryRoyalChristmas. One royal watcher said she reacts the same way when her mum touches her shoulder because it makes her feel uncomfortable. However, others insisted people had misinterpreted the behaviour. One fan tweeted: LOOK WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED. Kate is beautully content as William’s hand rests on her shoulder. FIRST William STARTS to remove his hand, AFTER Kate simply shts. Another person commented: I like the way they interact, it’s professional. I don’t want to see excessive hand holding and back rubbing. It’s awkward, like you’re intruding on a private moment. Another said: I think he tickled her back or shoulder. She did move but there were no dirty looks or even a facial reaction. Over the years Kate and William have shared some PDAs, which always delight fans. Their engagement and th anniversary official photos show them cuddling tightly together and looking lovingly into each others eyes.Behind-the-scenes photos from Williamaposs Earthshot Prize Ceremony show Kate placing her hand on her husbandaposs back, and she had her hand on his knee in their  Christmas card.When Meghan Markle joined the family, Prince Harry raised some eyebrows by taking a much less formal approach to joint engagements. They loved-up couple held hands throughout their outings and couldnapost keep their hands off each other.But the majority of people loved the intimacy of it, describing it as a refreshing approach to royal le and sharing their happiness.

Prince Charles and Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz have become joint subjects in a politan Police investigation after the Mahfouz donated £.million to the heiraposs charities, before receiving a CBE honour.The force announced last week that it was launching the probe to investigate whether the honour was awarded infor the cash. But the Prince of Wales youngest son had already distanced himself from Mahfouz amid cash for access concerns in , years before Charles accepted his generous donations. This weekend detectives were examining a letter sent to Mahfouz’s representatives by Michael Fawcett, Charles’s longest-standing confidant and the former head of the Prince’s Foundation, in which Fawcett said he would be “very happy” to back the Saudi’s nomination for an honour, The Times reports.Officers could also call in Clive Alderton, Charlesapos private secretary to understand whether the prince or Clarence House knew of these dealings between Fawcett and Mahfouz. The Duke of Sussex was  when he expressed major concerns about Mahfouz and distanced himself just two years before his father awarded the tycoon with a CBE at a private ceremony in Buckingham Palace. Charles, , had written to thank Mahfouz for his donations and visited him several times in both Britain and Saudi Arabia. But the future king says he has “no knowledge” of any trade-off between donations and honours and that Harry’s apparent concerns were never shared with him. Mahfouz has also denied any wrong-doing, while Fawcett, , Charles’s former valet, has been forced to quit his role at the Prince’s Foundation over the disclosures. Charity watchdogs in England and Scotland have launched a joint investigation. Scotland Yard began to look into the Prince of Walesapos relationship with Mahfouz after a piece in the Sunday Times last year raised concerns about their dealings.But the latest documents to be uncovered date back to  when Prince Harry was seeking donations to Sentebale, a charity which helps children with HIV in Lethoso, southern Africa.As charity co-founder, Harry had agreed to meet Mahfouz who was dangling a £ million donation offer. The donation was even drawn up in the draft charity accounts until Mahfouz suddenly announced a new apospreconditionapos of the offer. Mahfouz’s representative told Mark Dyer, a Sentebale trustee and former royal equerry known as Harry’s “second dad”, that he wanted Harry to fly to the Saudiaposs home and meet his family before the funds were transferred.  On May , , Dyer, , sent the representative an email expressing his concern: “Are we really saying thatPH [Prince Harry] commits to a trip to Saudi, Sentebale will receive the donation  “If that is the case I need to now brief the board as the accounts have all been revised and signed off on the back of receiving £m donation. “I am seeing PH today at Windsor I will brief him on the situation and seehe now wants to commit to a trip, but this certainly was not our understanding . . . it is starting to bring into question ‘cash-for-access’.” The same day, Mahfouz’s representative responded by insisting that the proposed Saudi visit had originally been mooted by Charles at the “CH meeting”, a gathering at Clarence House weeks earlier. On that occasion, Charles was said by the Saudiaposs representative to have encouraged the idea of Harry visiting the Arab kingdom. Harry appeared willing to do business with Mahfouz at the time and is even alleged to have joked: “Has father beaten me to it and got the money ” On June , , Dyer wrote back to Mahfouz’s fixer to say that he had spoken to the prince and had a “long chat” with his private secretary. Dyer said: “There is a concern and we have to be very careful going forward. At no stage have we committed to a visit, we discussed maybe in the future meeting privately for a weekend on a boat. “The POW [Prince of Wales] obviously mentioned it in passing conversation that does not mean PH comes next week. He is keen for his son to see that part of the world, but not next week. “What has now happened is a promise of a £m donation but it now comes with a commitment to a visit ... that was not my understanding.  “I then discussed with PH and quite rightly he has a major concern that we are losing [sic] touch with what all this is about ... it’s not about M [Mahfouz] meeting PH and introducing him to his friends and [Mahfouz’s adviser] having as many photos as possible of PH on his desk... itaposs [sic] about the children of Lesotho and Sentebale making a dference to their lives.” Dyer, who is a godfather to Harry’s son, Archie, continued: “There is a possibility of a visit to Saudi andthis happens PH will visit M, but to be held over a barrel, I think is wrong. “It would be a real shamethis falls through and I think we need to start again and remember the first meeting with PH. What is now on the table is very dferent.” Mahfouz continued to engage with Harry and gave at least £, to Sentebale. But neither the £million donation nor the visit to Saudi Arabia became a reality. Mahfouz instead increased his donations to charities connected to Charles after his aides made clear they would entertain the businessman’s desire for access. In October , Charles hosted Mahfouz for a weekend at Dumfries House, the royal residence in Ayrshire. In , they met at the British embassy in Riyadh and in  Charles gave Mahfouz his CBE at Buckingham Palace. The letter from Fawcett, now police evidence, shows that the donor was initially in line to receive an honorary OBE — but that the award was later upgraded. Following a discussion on July , , about potential donations worth up to £million, Fawcett wrote to Mahfouz’s representative: “With regard to supporting a nomination for an honorary OBE for His Excellency [Mahfouz], we would be very happy to send any such letter in due course outlining his philanthropy and ongoing generosity to the UK in heritage-led regeneration. “I will come back to you when I have discovered more about the necessary process that needs to be followed.” Fawcett is later alleged to have offered Mahfouz his backing to secure a knighthood and British citizenship, although these never transpired, The Times reports. Prince Charles has already spoken of his willingness to cooperate with the police. A Clarence House spokesman said: “The Prince of Wales had no knowledge of the alleged offer of honours on the basis of donation to his charities.” Palace sources said Charles did not encourage Harry to visit Saudi Arabia. A spokeswoman for Harry declined to comment. Mahfouz has previously denied seeking any favours infor his donations. The Prince’s Foundation said: “It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing investigation.

Both men are believed to be in their early s.In a heartbreaking message online, Jack’s girlfriend Courtney Emmett wrote: “Please God bring my love back to me. I love you Jack.” She added: “It’s all still so very raw.” One of his pals, Bradley Hall paid a touching tribute: “Jack was loved by everyone who’s met him and was always down for a chat. He was a proud father and a loving partner to his girlfriend. “He was his mum’s precious lad and will never be forgotten about.”  Council worker Billy Kinsella, , another dad of one, also died after being hit by a falling tree while clearing debris from a road near his home in Co Wexford. Sinn Fein councillor Fionntán Ó Súilleabháin said: “People in the area are devastated. It is such a tragedy for his we Rita and their only child Conor. “Billy died in the line of duty while out doing council work and attending the scene of a fallen tree. He died in a manner that makes it most tragic.” A woman in her s was killed after a tree fell on a car in Haringey, north London, and a man in his s died in Netherton, Merseyside, after debris struck the vehicle he was travelling in. High winds and snow yesterday continued to cause chaos and bring misery to millions. And the Met Office warned “very strong winds” are set to continue today in parts of Northern Ireland, Scotland, some Irish sea coasts, with heavy rain in parts of north-west England.Yellow rain and wind warnings remained in place for the entire south coast and south-west Wales.

Football matches were yesterday called off and travel chaos continued with airports and ferry companies battling to catch up on cancelled services. The M Severn Bridge remained closed in both directions “due to forecasts of further high winds”. Flood warnings remained in West Sussex and Shropshire. Many train services were cancelled as National Rail reported “major damage” across the network. Parts of Lancashire saw snow and ice, with thrill-seekers evacuated from the Big Dipper rollercoaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach after it ground to a halt. The O Arena remained closed while engineers examined damage to its tent fabric roof. And an incoming flight from Italy to Stansted Airport was forced to ert over  miles to Oslo, Norway, because of high winds. Amid the stories of tragedy, there were also some miracle escapes.  A train managed to stop just  yards before hitting a tree after braking sharply on the Kent coast to Victoria line outside Longfield, near Dartford. A horse had an astonishing escape after ten firefighters spent seven hours freeing him after he was left trapped under three -foot-tall trees that crashed next to him in a field in Ludgershall, Wiltshire. Dad-of-two Dominic Good, , and his family were “very lucky” to remain unscathed after a -year-old oak tree crashed through the roof of their home in Essex. His son also had his Mazda MX car “completely crushed” by the branches of the toppled oak.Match of the Day pundit Ian Wright walked away unscatched after the car he was travelling in suffered a crash while travelling to the BBC show’s studio. Posting a photo of himself standing near the smashed up car on the M, he wrote: “Not a straightforward trip up for @BBCMOTD!

The Hell’s Kitchen star’s south west London home luckily stayed safe after it was almost hit by a massive mature tree, which crashed into a brick wall in between two neighbouring properties.  Malcolm Tarling of the Association of British Insurers said: “Every storm is dferent. “But it’s obviously a severe one and is going to affect large parts of the county and built up areas so there will be signicant properly damage.” A Network Rail spokesperson said: “We have got thousands of workers out clearing trees and other debris off the railway.

Speaking from the Canary Islands, where he now lives with his partner Jupp, John told Wales Online: The psychiatrist was the first person I told I was gay. And the response was, aposOh we can cure that. We donapost have to treat the depression, we will just cure the homosexuality and then you wonapost be depressed anymore.apos  John likened the therapy to Ivan Pavlovaposs famous dog experiment. By repeatedly being given food while a bell rang, the dogs had been conditioned to salivate at the sound. The thinking at the hospital was that Johnaposs sexual attraction to men would endhe was repeatedly put through pain while watching gay pornography. I was wired up to a wristband that was attached to an electricity source, he says. I was shown homosexual pornography and when my penis responded, I was given electric shocks to the wristband. The procedure was administered by a doctor and two nurses. John was naked from the waist down as they monitored his response to the pornography. He felt like some kind of laboratory rat. John recalls being jolted about  to  times in each of the sessions, which lasted an hour to  minutes. He went through the excruciating therapy every day for about five weeks. He adds: It wasnapost changing my sexual orientation. It was actually closing my sexuality down. And although I didnapost know it at the time, for years I would have flashbacks to the electric shocks whenever I became sexually interested in anybody. Every few days I was asked whether I thought I might be more interested in women. And as a reward after the first few weeks of these electric shocks, I was shown pornography including women and not given an electric shock. Hundreds of patients were staying in the hospital, which John remembers as a huge Victorian palace of an asylum. The Grade II-listed site, which closed in , is now being redeveloped for housing. John recalls it being run like a village, with patients put to work on its farm. The patients did not talk to each other about their problems. Instead they discussed their occupational therapy, in which they made Basil Brush puppets from furry materials. We were all very drugged up with tranquillisers and antidepressants, says John. He recalls the language used by doctors at the hospital being very schoolboy. One doctor suggested John could go home for a weekend and find a woman to f***. This sparked an idea. He adds: I thought I could go away for the weekend, come back and say it had all worked and everything was fine. So thataposs what I did. They took me at my word and I was discharged.  Within days of being discharged I seriously tried to take my own le, because I realised that the treatment hadnapost worked. It felt like I was going to live le in the shadows. I wasnapost prepared to live like that. Thataposs when I told my family I was gay. And my motheraposs response was, aposWell, better a gay son than a dead son.apos And my fatheraposs response was to say nothing. John says neither of those reactions had much impact on how he felt. I was still living with my own self-hatred, he adds. You reach a point where you hate yourself so much, thereaposs nothing anybody can do to bring you back from that. He ed to the hospital for another month, this time with no aversion therapy. John recalls being left very quietly under lots of drugs. What I remember about that time is the goo at the side of my mouth that was created by the drugs I was taking, he adds. It seemed to thicken the saliva. I remember having long sessions with a psychologist who seemed very preoccupied with trying to discover whether any adults had sexually interfered with me. And I have never, ever had that experience. Much of the common mythology about what made people gay in those days was that you were groomed. For confidential support the Samaritans can be contacted for free around the clock  days a year on  .

The Duke of York agreed to shell out the monumental sum to avoid a court date after Virginia Giuffre claimed he trafficked and raped her while she was underage. The disgraced royal, who turned  yesterday, denies any wrongdoing and claims he has never met his accuser - who says they became acquainted through the Dukeaposs late paedo pal Jeffrey Epstein.Palace aides are said to have put a new spin on The Grand Old Duke of York, which references his denials at ever having met Ms Giuffre, reports the Sunday Times. They have been singing: The grand old Duke of York, he had  million quid.  He gave it to someone he’d never met, for something he never did. During his car crash interview with BBCaposs Emily Maitlis on Newsnight in , Andrew said he had no recollection of meeting the trafficking victim. This is despite a photo - believed to have been taken in London in  - in which he is seen with his arm around a then--year-old Ms Giuffre, as convicted trafficker Ghislaine Maxwell stands in the background.  The Duke has previously suggested the photo is a fake. Ms Gufre alleged Andrew had sex with her three times while she was a teen and underage in the eyes of US law. The royal told Ms Maitlis he didnapost regret his friendship with Epstein, and received a major backlash in light of the charges against the late financier.  But sources close to him have now told the Sunday Times there is genuine regret he was ever involved with Epstein. They added: He is remorseful, particularly about the impact it has had on his mother and his family. The same sources say the £million settlement figure is out by millions. It comes after claims Andrew has been making secret visits to the Queen at Windsor Castle every night by cover of darkness. He is understood to have been discussing the settlement as well as his future role within the Firm, having already been stripped of his titles and military affiliations amid the scandal.It is also reported Andrew has apologised to his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie, as well as the Queen herself. Future king Prince Charles is said to have ordered his younger brother to avoid being photographed in public and could be ousted from Royal Lodge once he takes the throne.However, it is reported Andrew will make a public appearance at a thanksgiving service for his late dad Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey next month.It has not yet been decidedhe can attend the Queenaposs jubilee service at St Paulaposs Cathedral in June, as the monarch mulls over Andrewaposs future.

A source reportedly said the Duke has been very careful and is trying to keep out of sight, with his Royal Lodge home around five miles from the castle. They told the Sun : He knows he is meant to be keeping his head down and it’s a short trip, but he is extremely contrite and apologised to the Queen for all the trouble he has caused her.He realises how serious this whole issue has been and the damage it has done to the monarchy. They added that the last thing he would want is to cause anguish to his mum, , in her Platinum Jubilee year.  The source said itaposs certainly true HM has a soft spot for him and regards him as her favourite son. Andrew previously fled to the royal estate in Balmoral, Scotland, last summer to be with his mum during her annual break as Ms Giuffreaposs legal team tried to serve him legal papers. The Duke is understood to have held discussions with Ms Giuffreaposs lawyer David Boies for  hours before he opted to settle out of court.  Mr Boies was due to quiz him under oath in a deposition on March . Future kings Prince Charles and Prince William are said to have been keen for Andrew to settle the case quickly. But the disgraced Duke may have found more support with Williamaposs own brother Harry. It is claimed Andrew reached out to the Duke of Sussex - who stepped down as a senior royal in  - as he explores the possibility of le outside the Firm.Majesty magazine editor Ingrid Seward said: “I have heard from a very good source that Andrew did think he could reinvent himself like Prince Harry has.”Charles is said to have ordered his younger brother to avoid being photographed in public and could be ousted from Royal Lodge once he becomes king.However, it is reported Andrew will make a public appearance at a thanksgiving service for his late dad Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey next month.It has not yet been decidedhe can attend the Queenaposs jubilee service at St Paulaposs Cathedral in June, as the monarch mulls over Andrewaposs future.

Itaposs the year sheaposll mark an incredible  years as monarch and celebrate her Platinum Jubilee.Plans had long been in place to host a spectacular celebration of her long reign during a bumper four-day bank holiday weekend in June. However,  has so far failed to live up to its promise of being a year of celebration for the Queen. In the past six weeks, Her Majestyaposs family have seemingly lurched from one crisis to the next - giving her a rotten start to the new year... Prince Andrew saga The scandal surrounding the Queenaposs son Prince Andrew has dominated the headlines for much of the first part of .Last year, Virginia Giuffre began the process of suing Andrew in a civil case in New York for allegedly sexually assaulting her when she was a teenager. The prince has always denied the allegations and said he has “no recollection” of ever meeting her.As the case began to move towards a trial, last month the Queen decided to strip her second son of his prestigious honorary military titles and royal patronages. A source close to Andrew described the move at the time as leaving him “shell-shocked”.

However, earlier this week, that he had reached an out of court settlement, said to be worth £million, with his accuser Ms Giuffre, which means he will no longer face a civil jury trial over allegations.Last night, it was reported that the Queen agreed to help Andrew settle his civil sex case by personally making a £million donation to Ms Giuffre’s charity. Under the terms of the £m deal arranged by the Queen’s most senior advisors and the Duke of York’s legal team, the Queen agreed to help Andrew as long as she was not connected to any personal payment to Ms Giuffre, it is understood. A royal source said: “She could not be seen to be making a payment to a victim of sexual assault, who accused her son of being an abuser. “But a deal was structured in such a way to arrange a sizeable financial contribution to the settlement by way of a charitable donation instead. Covid scare Meanwhile, amid her son Andrewaposs legal woes, the Queen also faced a Covid- scare just last week.Last week, it was revealed that her oldest son Prince Charles had tested positive for Covid for a second time.It later emerged that just two days before his positive test, he had close contact with the Queen - sparking fears for her health. At the time, Buckingham Palace said Her Majesty had not been displaying any symptoms of Covid - but refused to sayshe had tested positive or negative for the virus. However, given the Queen carried out an in-person audience at Windsor Castle yesterday, it has been suggested that she may have escaped the virus. Prince Harry security row Another row that the Queen has had to contend with in recent weeks is her grandson Prince Harryaposs demands over security when he is in the UK. Last month, Harry released a statement saying he is unable to bring we Meghan Markle and their two children Archie and Lilibet to the UK due to a lack of security.He is said to be keen to bring Archie and Lilibet to visit his homeland but claims he is unable to do so as Harry and Meghan lost their taxpayer-funded police protection when they stood down as working royals. Megan and Archie have not ed to the UK since the couple walked away from royal le in , while Lilibet has yet to set foot in the country where her dad was born - meaning she has never met the Queen.Lawyers acting for the Duke of Sussex say they will seek a judicial reviewcontinued security, which he has offered to pay for, is not provided when he and his family visit. A source said at the time that the battle between the Queenaposs grandson and the government was the last thing she wants to get drawn into. Cash-for-honours Meanwhile, another blow for the Queen came on Wednesday, when it was announced that Scotland Yard had launched an investigation into the cash-for-honours scandal after Prince Charles’ aide was accused of promising to secure a knighthood for a Saudi donor.Last year a letter was published from , in which Michael Fawcett reportedly said he was willing to make an application to change Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouzaposs honorary CBE to a KBE. At the time he stood down as chief executive of The Princeaposs Foundation, while the charity investigated his actions.

Mobility issues  Last year, the Queen was pictured using a walking stick while attending a service at Westminster Abbey. And even though sheaposs only been seen a few times in public in , she has also used the stick.One of these occasions was on Wednesday during an in-person audience with military officials, where she talked about how she was having trouble moving. In footage of her audience, the monarch can be heard remarking loudly: “Oh. I’m here! I thought you might have just stayed in there for ages. Good morning.” Asked how she is, the smiling Queen, wearing a floral dress and holding a walking stick, points to her left leg or foot and responds: “Well as you can see I can’t move.” She is understood to have been feeling slightly stf, rather than having injured herself or being unwell. Sad deathAlso compounding the Queenaposs sad start to the year was the death of one of her close friends. In early January, it was confirmed that Ivor Herbert, a racing journalist and trainer, as well as a long-time friend of Her Majesty, has passed away aged .News of his death came just days after it was revealed that another of the Queenaposs closest friends, Lady Diana Farnham had died at the age of  just before the new year.Lady Farnham was the monarchaposs lady-in-waiting, acting as her Lady of the Bedchamber since .

This comes days after Andrew settled a civil sexual assault case brought against him by Virginia Giuffre. The Duke of York denies all allegations made against him - claiming to have never met her. He paid her settlement worth a reported £million. She claimed that she was forced to have sex with Andrew on three occasions by Epstein, claims he continues to deny even after paying the settlement.  It is believed Andrew marked his nd birthday at Royal Lodge, his home in Windsor. Since , when he stepped back from Royal duties, Andrew has not had the honour of having flags flown to mark his birthdays. Andrew has been given  days to settle the payment to Giuffre, but The Mail on Sunday has reported that the sale of his Swiss ski chalet is not yet available. They reported that he might require a short-term loan to settle his debt.  On top of this, there are questions about whether he can afford to pay the upkeep of Grade II listed Royal Lodge and meet the annual £, ‘peppercorn rent’. A source told The Sunday Mail said: “Parts of Royal Lodge really need updating and he obviously doesn’t have the money to make the repairs, so there are questions over whether he ought to be allowed to stay therehe can’t look after the place.” Prince Andrew is expected to attend a memorial service for his father, the Duke of Edinburgh, next month, but will not take any role in the Platinum Jubilee celebrations in June.

After red weather warnings which saw record mph winds and tragically five Brits die as a result, Franklin is set to be less disruptive than the previous two storms. The latest storm will affect the UK from midday Sunday into early afternoon Monday. Environment agencies have also issued hundreds of alerts for flooding across the UK, including two severe warnings where rainfall could cause a danger to le for communities along the River Mersey in Greater Manchester. Storm Dudley also hit parts of the UK last week and meteorologist Becky Mitchell said three named storms in such quick succession is a first since the system was introduced seven years ago.  She told the PA news agency: This is the first time we have had three named storms within a week, and we started the storm naming system in . At the moment weaposve got a really active jet stream, which is why weaposre seeing so many storms track right towards the UK. We had Dudley on Wednesday, Eunice on Friday and Franklin today. Ms Mitchell said there will definitely be some impact from Storm Franklin but it is not expected to be as severe as Eunice because the strongest winds will be confined to the coast. On Sunday, all of Wales, Northern Ireland and much of the UK from Manchester southwards is covered by a yellow wind weather warning. The Met Office has said this could damage properties and cause power cuts as well as disrupt travel plans.The same parts of the country including the North West, East Midlands, West Midlands, South West, South East, and London will all see the same wind warning remain in place from midday Sunday to early afternoon Monday. Only the northeast will escape the effects of Storm Franklin, and winds of up to mph in coastal areas and mph inland in England and Wales. Then on Monday, an amber wind warning will be in place for northern areas of Northern Ireland. This means winds in excess of mph could be felt in coastal areas, with gusts up to mph inland. FORECASTED TIMINGS FOR STORM FRANKLINAccording to BBC Weather, the strongest gales will impact the following towns and cities beginning at these times: Derby - pm Leicester - pm Nottingham - pm Cambridge - pm Luton - pm Hertfordshire - pm Suffolk - pm Peterborough - London - pm Buckinghamshire - pm Brighton - pmSouthampton - pm Reading - pm Manchester - am Blackpool - pm Warrington - pm Bristol - pm Cornwall - pm Swindon - pm Plymouth - pm The worst of the weather will be felt late into Sunday night and early on Monday morning. Storm Franklin will move eastwards from north Scotland from early Monday morning but is expected to reach the North Sea and clear land before midday. The worst of the wind will be felt on the storm’s southern flank, but the high winds will continue to be felt for most of Monday. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Andy Page said: “Following the signicant impacts of Storm Eunice on Friday, Storm Franklin will bring further high winds for many late on Sunday and into Monday, although not on the same scale as Eunice.  “Coastal areas of Northern Ireland, especially on that north coast, will get the strongest wind gusts, which could be around mph in a few places. “Amber and yellow wind warnings have been issued, and people should remain cautious ahead of the system that will bring -mph wind gusts for much of the UK from late on Sunday and through Monday.” Snow is also a possibility in parts of Scotland and north England late Sunday into Monday, particularly on high ground.  RAC Breakdown Spokesman Rod Dennis said: “Drivers will be glad to see the back of Storm Eunice but it looks like conditions on the roads will remain challenging right through the weekend. With winds still strong and gusty, it’s important drivers don’t take any chances, so we urge them to slow down and leave plenty of space between themselves and the vehicle in front. “It’s not just strong winds that they’ll need to contend with – on Sunday intense rainfall becomes a feature making driving arduous. If conditions get particularly bad again, people should consider postponing their journeys, and for those who have to drive, it’s vital they keep their wits about them at all times.” People are advised to check their local resilience authorities for ongoing safety advice around travel and preparations.

This is down % on last Sunday and continues February’s marked declines in Covid cases.The  confirmed deaths are up  on last Sunday’s . This comes as cases continue their steady decline this month as the country is set to scrap all legal requirements to isolate. From February , Brits who have Covid will no longer be required to legally self-isolate, meaning someone with it could go to the gym, on a walk, and to a restaurant. This was brought forward a month from its original date in March in the Prime Minister’s final speech in the House of Commons before recess.

Amidst the rule changes and relaxation as the country begins to learn to live with the virus is a rollback of free testing.  It is thought the free PCR tests will be stopped, and replaced for lateral flows for symptomatic people. And that lateral flows will no longer be as freely available to the public. Justying the decision, the PM said that testing would still take place but not on the same scale as the £billion spent on testing in January.

A deep low-pressure system stretching across the UK from Greenland on an Atlantic “conveyor belt” will unleash mph gusts on Monday.The Met Office has also today named Storm Franklin, which comes with an amber weather warning issued for strong winds and heavy rain.The storm could bring brief tornadoes this afternoon as well as two inchesapos of snow in the North on Monday morning. Massive ft waves off north-west coasts have been shown on a weather map today.  Itaposs the first time since the naming system was introduced that several storms have come in such quick succession - with Dudley hitting on Wednesday and Eunice arriving on Friday. A second stormy system arrives while three further torments, each with mph gusts, are due on Wednesday, Saturday and Sunday. The North will be worst-hit, with the South buffeted as well. Three more storms are expected to be named in coming weeks – with a mad March of gales ahead. The Met Office warned of “severe gales possible almost anywhere” into March. The trio of torments would be named Gladys, Herman and Imani. The Met Office will name Storm Gladys when an Atlantic weather system has potential for amber warnings for wind, with rain or snow impacts also considered.  In recent daysapos battering from storms Dudley, Eunice and Franklin is the first time three storms have been named by the Met Office in five days since forecasters began naming storms in . Government meteorologists are once again warning people in affected regions to take care, in the face of deadly winds. A Met Office forecaster said: “Monday has early snow crossing northern areas and gales. Tuesday to Thursday will be often windy, with a mix of rain, sleet and snow showers on Thursday. Gales or severe gales will be possible almost anywhere through the period to March , and especially in the North. “The first half of March is likely to be a continuation of changeable conditions, with winds remaining strong across the North and southern areas less windy.” The warnings come in the wake ofStorm Eunicewhich on Friday left a trail of destruction in the worst assault for decades.Sadly the storm saw four people lose their lives amid the turbulent impact of the gales. The cyclonic low, compared by experts to the Great Storm of , whipped up winds greater than mph as it tore through the nation. Storms this week threaten further damage to buildings, trees and structures weakened by Eunice. Jim Dale, meteorologist for British Weather Services, said: We are seeing a conveyor belt of lows coming in from the Atlantic. This was to be expected after the exceptionally calm January as the weather will always strive to bring a balance. Winds will be widespread on Monday when an Atlantic low from the weekend moves down the country.  A cold front on Tuesday will be associated with a low-pressure system to the north and this will bring some blustery conditions, and there is another on Thursday which will be one to watch. This week will be a case of ‘watch this space’ as further low-pressure systems are forecast to bring more wind and rain. Foul weather is being driven by a freakishly strong jet stream wedged over the UK and raging at mph. The core of the jet, the so-called jet streak, is propelling the band of air which circles the polar region, firing up storm systems as they pass over Britain.  Mr Dale said: These weather systems are being driven by the jet stream as will be the changes in temperature as it moves further north or dips south. Referring to Dudley, Eunice and Franklin, meteorologist Becky Mitchell said this is the first time the national forecaster has recorded three major storms in such quick succession since the naming system was introduced seven years ago. She told the PA: This is the first time we have had three named storms within a week, and we started the storm naming system in . At the moment weaposve got a really active jet stream, which is why weaposre seeing so many storms track right towards the UK. We had Dudley on Wednesday, Eunice on Friday and Franklin today. The Environment Agency has issued  flood warnings where flooding is likely for locations mainly in the north and west of England, and  alerts where flooding is possible for the north-western half of the UK, London and the south coast, at the time of writing. Some  flood warnings and seven alerts have also been issued across the Scottish Borders, Ayrshire, Orkney and the Western Isles by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. Natural Resources Wales has issued six flood warnings for areas just east of Shrewsbury, and  alerts covering much of the country.

In , we reported that a village in Nottinghamshire was “under siege” after two absolutely mad raccoon dogs had escaped from an enclosure. Police said at the time that the dogs were “potentially dangerous” after villagers spent two hours chasing off the snarling and hissing creatures after they were woken by a blood curdling scream. Have you ever had a wild encounter  Join the discussion in the comment section Now WalesOnline reports that people in a rural part of Wales are being urged not to approach a raccoon dog which has now been on the loose for almost a month. The creature, a member of the canine family despite having a face more similar to that of a raccoon, was first reported missing by Natural Resources Wales on Monday who said it had escaped from its home. In fact, it had already been in the wild for several weeks. The only confirmed sighting of the animal thus far happened on Friday, January .  There have been no further sightings of the raccoon dog, but officials believe it could have travelled as far as eight miles by itself in the Welsh countryside, and warned people of its unpredictable nature. Leaflets have been distributed to locals in the area in and around Colebren in Powys, where the animal was seen almost a month ago. According to NRW: Raccoon dogs will naturally range further in the wild and so could be seen more than eight miles away. They are small, nocturnal fox-sized animals, originally from East Asia that look like raccoons. Their diet includes fruit, insects, rodents, frogs, birds and eggs so they can have a negative impact on native wildle.  If you think you might have spotted one , or know where it might have escaped from please report this as soon as possible. As with any wild animal, their behaviour may be unpredictable and are not to be approached. Rural people are alarmed at warnings not to approach the wild raccoon dogs which have mysteriously appeared in Wales and previously terrorised locals and attacked animals in Nottinghamshire. In July , one of the wild, fox-like creatures was captured and humanely destroyed in Carmarthenshire, something which caused anger among some, who said the animal should have been rehomed. This was only the second such sighting of a raccoon dog in Wales.  It is not illegal to keep a raccoon dog as a pet, but the RSPCA strongly discourages people from doing so, and since February, , it is actually illegal to sell the animal because they pose a risk to native species in Europe. It is also illegal to breed them. The raccoon dog is closely related to the fox and is a member of the canine species despite having a face similar to that of a raccoon. It is the size of a medium-sized dog. They could bitethey feel threatened by approaching humans.The animal is regarded as an “invasive species” that is native to the forests of China, Japan, Korea, Siberia and Vietnam. It is particularly distinctive due to being “extremely smelly”. Authorities fear people have been keeping them as pets which has led to them roaming the countryside. According to the RSPCA, the dog - also known as a ‘tanuki’ - is “not suited to le as a pet in a domestic environment”. A spokesman for the charity said: “Raccoon dogs are not domesticated pets. They need a great deal of space and their needs simply cannot be met in a typical household. They’re also extremely smelly, as they use scent to communicate with one another.” Raccoon dogs are omnivores and therefore feed on insects, rodents, amphibians, birds, fish, molluscs and carrion, as well as fruits, nuts and berries.  The RSPCA has said that it has taken in ‘pet’ raccoon dogs in the past after the animals were no longer wanted by their owners, most probably the result of the raccoon dog “becoming unmanageable”. If anyone does spot the raccoon dog, they are asked to contact NRW immediately on   .

The neighbour said: We repeatedly called the housing association because it was weird - her letter box full and I could see from the letters she hadnapost been paying rent. I called them up again and said I hadnapost seen this lady in months. The police came but they said lots of people had moved out of London during the pandemic and she could be abroad.

Liesl Wilhardt, , founder and director of Lovable Dog Rescue, has shared a glimpse into the unbreakable friendship of two dogs, Picasso, and Newt.Both pooches have severe facial deformities, but still lead happy lives on  acres of land at their home in Oregon, US.Liesl adopted Picasso in  after his brother suddenly died and later adopted Newt in , and before long the two became inseparable.Picasso, five, was born with a twisted snout, while one-year-old Newt suffered an injury from his mother biting him that left him with no upper jaw.Despite daily challenges as a result of their deformities and Newt’s medical issues, the pair now lead very happy lives. We get to see their friendship in a series of clips from their day to day activities, including feeding, playing together, walks and picking for berries. Liesl said: “It was a miracle that Picasso survived being a baby, because it would have been very hard for him to even nurse from his mom.  “Newt has had many more challenges, surprisingly the bigger challenges not being caused by his lack of upper jaw. “Both Picasso and Newt adore people, so in public they are very outgoing and seek attention and love to greet people. “Most people do immediate double takes and then stare at the dogs for a while, trying to make sense of what they are seeing.“They are not in any pain they have adapted to their physical challenges and do almost everything they want to do. “Picasso loved Newt from the beginning because Newt loves to play and wrestle and is so good natured. This friendship has deepened as Newt matured. “I absolutely love Picasso and Newt with all my heart, they are both incredibly loving, happy, intelligent, and funny dogs.” Read MoreRead More Most Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON LoveAdoptionAnimalsDogs\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Calling all dog lovers!to TeamDogs for your weekly dose of dog news, pictures and stories.Invalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Her ex-husband wants nothing to do with the kids since she had cheated on him for years with many men and they arenapost his, she wrote on Redditaposs AITA forum. However, the woman has decided she wonapost take on her sisteraposs kids as she and her husband agreed not to have children when they got married. It would be unfair to ask my husband to make this kind of sacrice. We both agreed to no kids when we got married - to change something like that generally means a orce, she explained. Not only that, she and her husband are atheist, while her sister wants her children to be raised in church, which obviously wouldnapost fit in with their lestyle.

After she moved out at  we havenapost talked once besides at my parents funeral. I donapost even know her, let alone her kids, the woman added. She cried and called me awful but itaposs my le, and ultimately I get to be selfish with it. A child isnapost an  year commitment it’s lelong, and one I have decided not to take. She cheated with multiple dferent men and lost her husband - I don’t think it’s my job to swoop in and save her from consequences of her own actions. I don’t feel like I owe her anything. Despite her pretty clear reasoning, the woman has had a number of people reaching out and telling her sheaposs making the wrong decision and needs to step up as a sister. I just feel like sheaposs trying to use me as her ticket out to dying and not feeling guilty, she wrote, before asking other Reddit users whether she was in the wrong for declining her sisteraposs requests. You arenapost obligated to take on parenting children for any reason - the rest of the vitriol in this post was pretty unnecessary. That said, regardless of how you feel about your sister, she is a dying mother who is trying to deal with all that that entails and also making sure her children will be cared for, one Reddit user comment. I don’t think that has anything to do with guilt and everything to do with doing what any mother would do in this situation. Another added: If you don’t know these children at all, I don’t see why your sister would want you to be their . How could they possibly be comfortable with you after the loss of their mother  These so-called friends of hers would be better suitedthey have an established relationship with the children.Do you have a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

But one mum has come up with the perfect solution to the problem of kids not respecting the nighttime routine - by making sure they never know when their bedtime actually is. Ashley Molina shared a video on TikTok in which she explained her daughteraposs bedtime is  pm, but the mum has never told her daughter what time sheaposs supposed to go to bed.So instead of waiting until  pm to tell her daughter that itaposs time for bed, Ashley asks her at : pmsheaposd like to stay up late or go to bed, andthe tot asks to stay up late, then she goes to bed at  pm - her actual bedtime.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. The mum said in her video: Lie to them. They donapost need to know what time bedtime is. My daughteraposs bedtime is  oaposclock, but she doesnapost know that. Iaposve never told her aposItaposs  oaposclock, youaposve got to go to bedapos. At around : I ask hershe wants to stay up late or go to bed, and the majority of the time she wants to stay up late. I then set an alarm for :, and I tell her that when the alarm goes off itaposs time for bed.Ashley, who posts on TikTok under the username @_ashley..m, has even thought about how to tackle her daughteraposs sudden need for a glass of water that delays bedtime further. She added: I do : because you know when itaposs bedtime, all of a sudden they need to use the bathroom, theyaposre thirsty, they want to say goodnight  times, you know the deal. That extra  minutes gives her the time for all that nonsense, and before you know it, itaposs  oaposclock and sheaposs sleeping. Right on time. This is how you save all the drama at bedtime. Most of the time. Ashleyaposs video has been viewed , times - and people have praised the mum as genius. One person said: Iaposm not a parent who lies to her kids, but this is not lying. This is genius tactics. While another added: This is the smartest thing ever. And a third said: Oh my god you have saved so many mums everywhere. Ashley even said the trick works once children have learned to tell the time themselves, as the key to the hack is to not tell your kids what time their bedtime really is. She wrote in the comments: My daughter is five and can also tell time. But since she doesn’t know bedtime is at  pm, she can’t say anything.

She wrote: We moved into our flat as tenants about - weeks ago. We have a young guy and girl above us but havenapost met them yet, they are also tenants.

We heard it in the day this week so went up to ask what it is andthey could keep the noise to daytime hours but they wouldnapost answer the door!

She added: Iaposm aware with the energy costs it might be more economical for them to run it through the night but Iaposm really struggling to get back to sleep once woken up at  am so can I ask them not to do this  Commenters on the Mumsnet post were split - with many saying they also put their washing machine on during the night so that their clothes are ready to be hung out to dry in the morning. One person said: I put my washing machine on a timer for  am so it’s freshly washed at  and I can put it on the airer before work. Could it be a similar situation  While another added: It’s tricky - I set my machine to be finished when I wake up. Means I can hang the washing out during the day and it’s dry when I get home. I’d be loathed to change that I’m afraid. And a third said: Itaposs probably on a timer so they are not awake when it goes on. I think itaposs really reasonable to go and speak to them in the day or evening. But others agreed that the noise would annoy them, and told the mum to speak to her landlordher neighbours were being unreasonable.

Armed forces experts said it mimicked UK and US tactics in the First Gulf War when forces sent to free Kuwait marked military vehicles with an upturned chevron.A military source in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv told The Sun : “It would suggest final preparations are complete.“It’s vital that any attacking force can be distinguished, particularly from the air where Russian forces will have complete control.  “The Ukrainians have very similar tanks and vehicles and will want to reduce the risk of friendly fire.” Video footage from near the Ukrainian border displayed markings on tanks, fuel trucks and supply vehicles. The military vehicle procession marked “Z” was estimated to be six and  miles from Ukraine as more than , troops ringed the country.Diplomatic sources in Kyiv told The Sun it was “widely understood” Vladamir Putin had decided to launch an invasion. Reports on social media yesterday showed video footage of the “Z” markings on vehicles. The vehicles were on the move as Russia broke a promise to withdraw its forces from northern neighbour Belarus after military exercises. Chief of Belarusian General Staff Alexander Volfovich denied such a pledge had been made and insisted the “exercise” had been extended until Monday. There are signs that plans to invade Ukraine had already begun as explosions were reported in Donetsk on Saturday night.Russia and Ukraine have been fragile since Kyiv began to grow closer to the West prompting Russia to annexe Crimea in . Firing has been reported across the region as Ukraine - while Russia and the separatists blame each other for the clashes. Artillery shells are said to have fallen within Russiaaposs borders, resulting in the death two of Ukrainian soldiers while explosions were reportedly heard throughout the Donbas. Mass evacuations of separatist groups happened on Friday as Ukraine was accused of planning an attack and alleging Kyiv plotted to blow up a chemical plant. Both countries have now, The Sun claims, shown the full mobilisation of their military forces.  Rising chaos in the Donbas, it is feared will be used as a pretext to move in Putinaposs troops. In a new stunt the pro-Moscow rebel authority in Donetsk claimed to have held a Ukrainian spy who confessed to plans to overrun the Donbas. Anton Matsanyuk “confirmed that Kyiv intends to use all its strike power in the forcible seizure of the Donbas, said a report. He confirmed a Ukrainian plan to invade Donetsk and Luhansk.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, meanwhile, warned Russia is planning the biggest war in Europe since  as Putin intends to invade and encircle Kyiv. Jens Stoltenberg, NATO chief said: Every indication indicates that Russia is planning a full-fledged attack against Ukraine. We all agree that the risk of an attack is very high. Johnson also told world leaders an invasion of Ukraine was looking increasingly likely and later said the attack appears to already be in motion. If Ukraine is invaded, the shock will echo around the world, said the PM in a chilling warning during his speech at the Munich Security Conference.  Askedthe Russian leader had made up his mind to attack the capital city Kyiv, he told broadcasters: I think certainly things are in motion. But the question is whether it can all be pulled back and whether the President of Russia is still able to call this operation off. He added: Imagine the invasion of Ukraine, a country of  million people, the second biggest country in Europe geographically apart from Russia itself - an absolutely colossal place.  You canapost hold it down. There will be a protracted, violent, bloody insurgency with the loss of le for young Russians, as well as for Ukrainians.

Unless on a round of Corbetts # there are five here that make a fine challenge # it is easier to approach the Corbett via its gentler slopes from Tyndrum. This also gives the opportunity to explore the adit # access tunnel # and old lead mine on its higher slopes where the mineral vein continuation from Sron nan Colan is exposed. The Beinn Odhar lead mining venture appears to have been a short one but the views once the summit is reached are tremendous.Leaving the car park, cross the A and head left passing the Tyndrum Inn, the Green Welly Stop and cross the bridge.Turn right immediately after crossing the bridge to join the West Highland Waynorthwards, passing the KeyStore.You will need to stay on the WHW for the next .km as it slowly climbs out of Tyndrum with the A on your left and the Crom Allton your right until you reach the bridges over the burn and railway.Cross the bridges and go through the gate at the north end. You will be heading up on to the open hillside to your right.You now have a choice. Either head straight up in a north easterly direction picking your own route on the grassy slopes or veer slightly right back to the Crom Allt to pick up a faint path.

The adit and mine are higher to your left, northwest, on the crest of the ridgeline, whereas the faint path runs just under this soyou want to explore them it is worth scrabbling up the rocks to have a look. The bottom of the adit starts at around ms.Heading up from the adit and mine # or path # the route flattens out, passing a lochan and the county boundary to your left.

In addition there may also be a possibility of linking into the generation of tidal energy being taken forward by the private sector.#Executive director Kirsty Flanagan said in the report: #[The] key issue for the buses will be meeting revenue implications and there will be a need to match fund this capital bid with  per cent of the capital costs.#It should be noted that Transport Scotland, through its infrastructure partner CMAL, is taking forward a series of transport connectivity projects on the island, most notably the expansion of Port Ellen Ferry Terminal. There is potential to work with this project to add impact to our proposal.#[A] replacement Jura ferry [is planned] to create an increased capacity and resilience. [We are] working with CMAL on small vessel replacement.#[We are] looking to have a common style of vessel, -m long, to provide resilience across the west coast network and reduce upfront costs with a single model. Low to zero emission is a key priority.#[In relation to] strategic connectivity linking Port Askaig, Port Ellen and the airport…[a] route has been identied with improvements to accommodate increasing capacity readily deliverable.#There are two roads connecting Ports Ellen and Askaig which run broadly parallel # the A which runs past the entrance of the airport and the B which runs to the rearof the airport.#By virtue of the A road status and its slightly better standard the A should be the preferred route for all traffic and the B road promoted more for cycle and walking.Ms Flanagan also said: #The council has determined to submit two bids to the next round of the Levelling Up Fund to be announced by the UK Government.#One bid will be for an area regeneration town centre project, maximum £m, and the other a transport bid up to £m.#The latest information from the UK Government is that it is likely to be an Easter deadline, and the criteria will be largely the same as the first round subject to some refinement.

On Tuesday Gala demolished league leaders Bonnyrigg Rose with a comprehensive - victory in the East of Scotland Qualying Cup whilst Celtic B beat Vale of Leithen - at the Penny Cars Stadium last weekend.Celtic are able to field talented youngsters like the highly-rated Karamoko Dembele and Bosun Lawal who signed from Watford for an estimated £, and last-week’s hat trick hero Ben Summers.Assistant manager Steve Craig is under no illusion about the size of the task ahead but is confident that Gala are more than capable of matching the full-timers.Craig told us: Me and Jimmywill address the game exactly like we prepared for Bonnyrigg Rose on Tuesday. We want to win. We know how they will play and we will set out our stall. The last time we played them Jimmy can remember the tactics that hm and Neil Hastings put forward and we will do something similar. We just want to go and win the game and the game on Tuesday night just proves that we are more than capable of matching anybody in this league.“I think the fact that Celtic and Rangers are in the Lowland League is a great coup. They will bring supporters to the game and at this level the revenue is massive. I heard a rumour that Hearts might be putting a team in next year as well. So the case for having three Premier League teams gives our boys the chance to play against the likes of Dembele and players like that.After their - victory over Vale of Leithen Celtic boss Tommy McIntyre told Celtic TV: “Gala gave us a good game the last time we played them. I thought they looked to play a little bit of football. For us we always want to finish and score more goals and we want to do that so we will have to work hard in the final third. But some of our goalswere outstanding.”"},{"url":null,"title":"craig-scott-recall-famous-victory-celtic-hampden","story":"CELTIC visit the Borders this weekendto play Gala Fairydean Rovers in a Lowland League fixture.And this is likely to bring back some happy memories for the Gala management team of Martin Scott and Steve Craig who not only took part in took part in a game considered to be one of the biggest Scottish Cup upsets of all time, but scored the goals for Ross County that knocked out the Glasgow giants.No-one apart from Derek Adams and his players gave the Staggies any hope of progressing to the  final when they were drawn to play Celtic at Hampden.Caretaker boss Neil Lennon’s team kicked off as huge favourites but early in the second-half the Victoria Park side took a stunning lead as Craig cut in from the right and produced a scything run through the Celtic defence and kept his composure to lash the ball past Lukasz Zaluska.It was a goal worthy of winning any game, but more was to come.County had to survive an onslaught as Celtic fought desperately to save their season, but they held firm.Then in the dying minutes the tireless Scott sealed their fate after starting the move then getting on the end of an Andy Barrowman cross to net County’s second, sparking a mass exodus from the Celtic fans and wild celebrations among the Dingwall sides , fans - more than the population of the town that houses the club who moved up from the Highland League to the Scottish Football League in .Earlier this week Craig told the Border : “It was a magical day. Me and Jimmyran the show. \"Derek Adams was manager at the time and he had us so well drilled. Our game plan worked a treat.\"It was Neil Lennon’s first game in charge. Georgios Samaras and Aiden McGeady kept switching wings so we knew they were struggling. Robbie Keane was up front. I’ve watched the game two or three times right through.\"It was a bit of a stalemate then we scored after about - minutes then we kind of huffed and puffed a wee bit, but they never really asked any questions. Mickdidn’t really have to make any saves..remove“The break away in the th minute. We go down the right and Barradid brilliant to find Jimmy. It’s just great memories. You always want people to recognise the performance rather than just the result sometimes and our performance that day merited the win.“To score in the last five minutes and to beat the champions at the time - was a fantastic day. It was one of those days where everything clicked for us. My dadwas at the game and had a connection with Celtic and I just remember after the game looking up at the stand and I saw him and he was just standing with his hands in the air.”Scott added: “Stevie’s goal was unbelievable.

However, nothing will reverse the damage done to these vulnerable children and their families.“What we need now is full clarity on how this was allowed to happen to provide answers to those affected and to hold those responsible for preventing concerns being progressed to account.

greeting those spectators who arrived to support the team.Refreshingly, though, a group of youngsters were amongst the entourage travelling with the north Glasgow visitors, and they soon felt at home, happily mixing with the Pupils# own young supporters and joining in song.First, an attempted Pupils clearance found its way to Finnart#s number , who kept his composure to slot home a close-range finish and make it two goals in two games against the Pupils.Then, a header from a swirling cross from Finnart#s left-hand side couldn#t be kept out, despite the efforts of Alasdair Ferguson in goal.The Pupils# Rhys Casci did go close with a one-on-one effort in the first half after being freed by a low pass from midfield, but the Tarbert-based player opted to shoot early and the keeper got his body in front of the effort and gathered at the second attempt.After the interval, the McFadyens-sponsored Pupils hoped to use the westerly tailwind to put pressure on the visitors# goal, but it was a quieter half than the hosts would have liked.Finnart battled to repel the Pupils, limiting them to two dangerous efforts from outside the box, first from Casci who forced a save from the away keeper to tip his low shot round the post for a corner, and then from Scott Souden whose deflected effort forced the keeper into a save.The Feathers Inn-sponsored Pupils made some changes late on with youngster Andrew Renton and right-back Michael McKinlay making afrom injury, but it wasn’t enough to turn the tide of the game and the visitors took all three points, to leave themselves two points behind leaders Kilsyth Athletic with two games in hand.Conversely, the Pupils are three points adrt at the foot of the ision, but importantly have two games in hand themselves.In the aftermath of the

He was protected well by right back Conner Brown, left back Burns and central defensive pairing Ross Souden and captain Keith Mitchell.With less than  minutes remaining, McCallum – who had shted into central midfield with the introduction of second sub and debutant Cameron Wylie at right midfield – intercepted a ball from a Glenvale player, his tackle putting Lang one on one with the hosts# keeper.Lang showed excellent composure for his tender years to slot the ball low into the net with his right foot, just inside the box, his teammates joining him in celebration.After seeing out the final five minutes of regulation time, four nervy minutes of added time were played as Glenvale pushed for an equaliser.In the st minute, Ferguson was called upon to make the save of the day, stopping a powerful Glenvale drive from  yards out, before a Pupils defender cleared the danger.The final whistle sounded soon after and the Pupils# squad and management could cheer a hard-earned, much-needed win, especially impressive considering the inexperience of much of the squad, who are still learning at this level, but judging by this showing, are certainly contributing.Tomorrow , the Pupils host high-flying Harmony Row from Govan, at Kintyre Park.Kick-off pm.

Avoid plantingthe ground is frozen or extremely waterlogged.Your planting hole should be no deeper than the roots, but at least three times the diameter of the root ball.It#s a good idea to soak bare-rooted trees for about  minutes before planting.Place the tree in the planting hole so the first flare of roots on the stem are level with the soil surface. If you plant the tree too deep, it can result in rot and disease.You may need to insert a stake for top heavy or larger trees. Refill the planting hole, firm gently and water in.Drought stress is common in newly-planted trees so make sure you keep watering throughout the growing season.

McCartney.The news came just as band members prepared to leave for Manchester to compete in the Boosey and Hawks National Youth Bass Band Championships.Paul McCartney, former member of the Beatles, was recently slated in the national press for refusing to sign the #Save Our Bands# petition.But this week he went a step further by writing stinging letters to both Dick Walsh, leader of Argyll and Bute Council, and Michael Forsyth MP, Secretary of State for Scotland.The future of the band is in jeopardy because Argyll and Bute Council has a shortfall of funding this year of more than £ million.As part of an enormous package of cuts aimed at saving money, the council plans to axe music tuition in all schools which would mean the end of the school band.In a support letter, Sir Paul describes the proposals to axe music tuition as #catastrophic# and urged the council to re-consider.He wrote: #I feel it would be disastrous for the area to lose this essential musical training, not only to the local people whose lives are enriched by music, but also for the tourism on which so much of the local economy depends.#Campbeltown and the surrounding district is famed throughout the world for its traditional music and it would be very unwise even to consider implementing measures which would effectively bring this reputation to an end.#He added: #I am lending my strongest support to the local people who are fighting to protect the teaching of music in their schools and I will urge the council to reconsider any plans they may have to implement these catastrophic and far reaching measures.#FIFTY YEARS AGOCampbeltown#s coal situation is worsening and now merchants have only one week#s supply left.The local firm of D McNair and Son announced earlier this week that it

Why There have been many attempts by faithful people to explain unbearable tragedies with faith in a loving God. Few are convincing – at least at the time.For me, the love that people give to one another is God reflected in human goodness.Living by faith is not easy. Sometimes it means being assailed by doubts and I believe we must be honest about our questions.After all, did not Jesus say: #The truth will set you free.# When those most bitter and painful tragedies strike us down, faith can be a consolation – sometimes the only consolation – even as at the time it is tested to breaking point."},{"url":null,"title":"council considers cremation price rise","story":"Argyll and Bute already charges above the Scottish average for exclusive right of burial and coffin internment, but below the average for a cremation.

This isn’t a natural climate disaster but one largely of political making.“Action should be taken by both the UK and Scottish Governments to protect the poorest and mitigate hardship for all. Windfall taxes, VAT reduction and direct payments to the poorest and most threatened households are required. It confirms why Scotland must be in charge of its own energy policy and the natural wealth of its shores.”  Frazer Scott, CEO of Energy Action Scotland, said of the rise: “The energy price rises announced this month are absolutely devastating for households across Scotland.“It impacts most on those households in the lowest incomes, who spend a signicantly higher proportion of their incomes to heat and power their homes – or indeed simply cannot heat and power their homes to the comfort levels that maintain health and wellbeing.“These households will be unable to afford an adequate level of thermal comfort to maintain their health and wellbeing, and people will be forced to choose between heating and eating.“There are important short and long term priorities.“We are absolutely in a crisis and there needs to be a crisis response.“As it stands, the quantum of support provided by UK Government to Scottish Government is simply inadequate.“This payment appears to be better targeted to the households most in need compared to England but in Scotland this will provide little comfort to the , Scottish households in extreme fuel poverty, facing declining health and wellbeing, and excess deaths attributable to fuel poverty.”  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: “The East Lothian Poverty Plan adopted by the council in October  highlighted fuel poverty as a major and growing concern. It identied measures to be put in place to continue the work to combat fuel poverty and support people facing rising fuel costs.“The council has already increased its Scottish Welfare Fund budget by £, to increase support provided in crisis grants and a new Fuel Poverty Fund to help people in financial dficulty and facing hardship due to rising fuel costs.“We are aware that the predicted rise in fuel costs is a serious concern for East Lothian residents, so we will continue to monitor the situation and promote the financial advice and support available from the council and other agencies, including Changeworks, as well as working together with partners on any possible further interventions to support our residents.“This includes continuing our work to ensure that council homes are as

about moving into the venue.He said: “I cannot thank Paul Huish from East Lothian Council and his team enough – they were brilliant working with us.“Covid has been here and you are under so many restrictions with that.“The gym has really been finished before East Lothian Council started getting involved and backing us.“There were so many dferent restrictions and we have been training on the odd night on the grass at Port Seton but conditions with wind and rain were bad so it was hard.“It is impossible having a boxing club without a ring.“We could have got venues but could not put a ring up and that was always the problem.”Previously, members of the Bronx Boxing Gym represented the club at national and international events.The move to the Church Street venue will see a ring and boxing training equipment, including punchbags, set up permanently.Mr McCallum had been overwhelmed by the support from members of the community since it was announced that the club had found premises.Messages had poured in through Facebook, with many looking to find out how children could sign up.He was hoping the success of Prestonpans’ Josh Taylor – unied and undisputed light-welterweight champion of the world – would inspire people to step into the ring.Already, the group plans to have training sessions on a Monday and Wednesday, with three dferent classes – seven to -year-olds,  to -year-olds, and a senior class.: Bronx Boxing Gym make appeal to find premisesMr McCallum stressed that the competitive aspect of the sport was not for everyone but felt boxing was still a valuable resource.He said: “Take the boxing out of it, not everybody gets it or wants to compete.“Boxing is about changing lives.“We take kids white water rafting, we take them all over the world – the USA, Canada, all over the world.“Most of these kids have no chance of getting out of Tranent and that is why it is a big part of my le and my whole family’s le.“To get shut down and nowhere for these kids to go, it was soul destroying. That is why we are so happy to be back in the community.”A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said they were happy to help out.They said: “The council’s connected communitiesand sports development teams have been working with the Bronx Gym to provide access to Tranent Town Hall.“We are pleased that the use of the hall will allow the club to deliver boxing sessions and ersionary work to support the wellbeing of young people across the local community by increasing opportunities to take part in activity.”"},{"url":null,"title":"author-nicole-mcmahon-celebrates-highland-dancing-book","story":"Nicole McMahon, , was keen to share her experiences of “not winning” competitions to help youngsters understand that they don’t have to win to be dancers.She said: “I was inspired into writing this book as I realised there are a lot more dancers that are not champions than those that are and we can feel like we are not as good, and not able to make it as far as others – I disagree.”Called Affliction of the Half Point, it is a self-published book with the help of Amazon KDP Publishing, and is available in paperback or as a Kindle version.Nicole, who lives at the new Taylor Wimpey development at Almond Park, said: “The book explores my le of Highland dancing and, more importantly, my experiences of not winning.“Little things such as sixths or dancing my best were great accomplishments to me.”Nicole McMahon signs a copy of her new book which explores her le of Highland dancing She explained: “I have always loved writing and the English language – I mixed my two loves with an additional challenge of helping young dancers understand that there are more important things than winning.”Her successful book launch was held at the Muss Bar  Kitchen, attracting family and friends and judges from the world of dance.She paid tribute to Mark Stirling, her boyfriend of four-and-a-half years, who has supported her with her writing and publishing.Nicole, who is originally from Penicuik, started dancing when she was three, following in the footsteps of her mum June, who danced for the Queen, sister Charlene, a champion Highland dancer, and their aunts.Nicole joined a dance school in Edinburgh and remains good friends with her teachers.She said: “My weeks consisted of a two-hour dance class on a Monday and two hours on a Wednesday.“I competed every single weekend – either a Saturday or Sunday, or both.”Affliction of the Half Point is Nicole McMahons first writing venture She added: “I felt I was missing out on a normal le but, at the same time, I was living this magical dream of a le where I travelled, danced and explored a world nobody  knew.”Nicole stopped dancing in her late teens but stressed: “I still involve myself with dance as often as I can and love the atmosphere – the people and most of all the bagpipes.”Over the years she competed as far afield as Canada and was part of military tattoos and shows with the Dutch Pipes and Drums and a Highland dance company.Nicole said: “As you can imagine, fundraising was a huge part of this.

You wouldnt think a top chef would dare serve a Michelin inspector instant custard power - but thats exactly what Phil Vickery did.\"I did a steamed sponge pudding, and I served it with Birds Custard - and I got a [Michelin] star for that meal. OK, I adapted it - I put a few vanilla seeds in it and bits and pieces - but essentially, it was a thickened starch-based custard - and he loved it!\" says Vickery, .Not only that, but in the same meal in , he served something out of the freezer, too. \"I had a frozen baby cockerel, because I couldnt afford to throw them away - I froze and defrosted them - and the head of Michelin had that cockerel as well.\"The chef, whos been a mainstay on ITVs This Morning for  years, first started using canned and frozen ingredients in the early Nineties when he took over as head chef of a hotel in financial dficulty. \"That hotel owed a huge amount of money to the bank, all the staff had gone, it was the recession and the bank were going to shut the doors in six months, so I just couldnt afford to buy expensive ingredients,\" he says. So, he delved into the store cupboard and used what was there instead. \"I never cooked halibut, I couldnt afford it, I never cooked turbot.\"Even when a famous chef came to lunch with a renowned food critic, Vickery served them soup made from water, stock cubes, tinned butterbeans, onions and garlic, with a sprinkle of thyme and olive oil on top.\"That food critic said, Oh my goodness, thats the nicest butterbean soup Ive ever had - can I have another bowl  So I thought, Hang on a minute,its good enough for him, its good enough for my customers.\"What was originally conceived out of financial necessity made him \"view things in a dferent way\", and hes been cooking this way for years at home. His new book, The Canny Cook, celebrates all things canned and frozen, and the cheap, sustainable, easy meals you can make from them.On This Morning, Holly Willoughby, Dermot OLeary and co. give rave reviews of Vickerys dishes using store cupboard ingredients . You might have seen him rustle up rhubarb crumble with strawberry jam and instant custard, or corned beef hash, on the show - \"As long as you explain it, its fine,\" he says, but hes been criticised by fellow chefs for deskilling the industry.\"I dont give a toss,\" he says. \"Ive been called some awful things on Twitter... Some people say to me, Youre the s***test chef on This Morning. I just laugh at it.\"Purists may well sneer but, even today, he believes high-end restaurants use far more canned produce than diners realise. \"Chefs are quite dishonest as well, [ you asked] What are you storing this stuff for  Theyd never tell you,\" he says.Early stages of the pandemic saw the public panicking to refill their cupboards with tinned ingredients - and even now were over the worst of it, \"People are squeezed, budgets are squeezed, and its just a perfect way of utilising whats around\", Vickery says. \"And you can make very good dishes - simple stuff, without having to spend too much money. [So] dont turn your nose up at some things you can buy canned or frozen.\"While some preserved ingredients can simply be thrown into whatever youre cooking to save time and money , others need a bit more love.\"I hated frozen caullower,\" he admits, \"but I bought some in Iceland, a bag, a kilo, I roasted it in the oven - to get rid of the moisture - and I put salsa verde and chopped anchovies on it out of a can, and it was amazing! And that was a pound.\"He continues: \"I bought  grams of inidually frozen yellowfin tuna steaksfrom Aldi, wanting to hate them. Oh my goodness, I made ceviche, I made a poke - it was fabulous.\"There are a few things he doesnt recommend buying frozen - scallops or monkfish, for example, but cod, haddock, salmon and tuna all freeze perfectly well, he says. His recipes include canned crab meat and lobster, and although \"you can definitely taste the dference - it doesnt taste as good as fresh lobster - it gets pretty close to it for a fraction of the price\".Waitrose, he says, does canned squid in black squid ink sauce- \"That can will flavour two portions of rice, and that black ink sauce, honestly its fabulous,\" he says. \"And squid can be as tough as old boots, but in a can  Fantastic. So the canning process can actually soften things, like pears and tinned peaches, too.\"While we all probably have tins of beans, tomatoes and sweetcorn languishing in our cupboards, Vickery suggests trying canned potatoes, asparagus, pumpkin and peppers, and even canned or vacuum-packed hotdogs.Children of the Seventies and Eighties might want to recreate school dinners with Vickerys Spam fritters recipe, inspired by his childhood. \"As a kid growing up, my mother refused to cook on a Sunday evening, because she cooked all week, and Spam was a treat.\" And you probably wouldnt expect to see a recipe for fish fingers and wafflesfrom a Michelin-starred chef.Still, Vickerys everyman charm is what This Morning fans love, and hes no stranger to cooking disasters on live telly. \"I drop stuff, burn myself, the ovens not on, Ive tipped stuff or forgotten to put stuff in, but people love it - tea towels catching fire is quite normal,\" he laughs.Vickery turned  last year, and while he does consider what he eats, he definitely isnt about to give up his favourite chilli-flavoured Doritos, and enjoys a pint of beer every single night, saying: \"Les too short - youve got to have some sort of enjoyment!\"The Canny Cook by Phil Vickery is published by Kyle Books, priced £..

Leaving aside the repugnant practice of abuse, do those who engage in it believe it is possible to convert someone by shouting “traitor” and much worse at them  Perhaps we can start on a new path of civilised dialogue by acknowledging that, while we think dferently on the constitution, adherence to the Union is a legitimate position, which is not surprising considering the  years of its existence.The present toxicity in our body politic requires the leadership of the independence movement to lead us away from it, because of its potential malignant effect upon the character of the future Scotland we hope to win. Getting a majority is vital for that objective, butthat independent Scotland is to progress and flourish, all of its people, including those who lost the argument, have to be willing to trust, cooperate and work together. Success will not comea signicant minority feel aggrieved at being singled out as “treasonous” and “scum”.Robust and biting debate is inevitable on such a momentous issue of Scotland in or out of the Union. Butan independent Scotland is to be successful, it will need a high level of harmony and agreement among its people and for that we need to recognise red lines that should never be crossed. Disrespect for the views of others, dressed in bile and hatred, is corrosive of democratic le, and will be a malignant legacy in the Scotland we want. It is time for some to look beyond the present and contemplate the future, and realise that they must now desist from their present practices.Jim Sillars, Edinburgh.* IT says much about the state of our politics that the allegations of abuse brought into focus by the BBCs Sarah Smith have been instantly weaponised by unionist politicians from the Scottish Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats to condemn \"nationalism\".Its abundant from many a newspaper headline and the Twitter accounts of opposition MSPs and their parties that the bile, hatred and misogyny called out by Sarah Smith is also meted out on a daily basis to Nicola Sturgeon and Kate Forbes, who thankfully appear to have a much thicker skin than journalists.In a healthier political climate, opposition politicians would make this balanced observation for the greater good, but their party lines and allegiances clearly negate this option.Alistair McBay, Perth.SORRY COMMENT ON THE NATIONSARAH Smith reveals that she is relieved to be out of Scotland and in the US after the abuse she received while BBC Scotland Editor. She named no names, but did mention being \"demonised quite heavily… amongst certain parts of the population\". This is a very sorry comment on the state that Scotland has developed into, especially since .Ms Smith was in the news during the pandemic for saying that Nicola Sturgeon was \"enjoying\" the extras powers she could exercise. Ms Sturgeon tweeted that she was not enjoying the pandemic at all, and her hurt tones were taken as a signal by her nationalist followers to retaliate. They bombard Ms Smith with aggressive and insulting messages on social media. The better-educated among us know that \"enjoy\" has ious meanings, including \"possess\". That was lost on the social media warriors, and, apparently, on Ms Sturgeon herself.Ms Smith says that that was not a one-off, that she received \"vitriolic attention most of the time\". What kind of country has Scotland become that that it is now acceptable \"amongst certain parts of the population\"  The answer is: a nationalist one.Jill Stephenson, Edinburgh.PLAYING THE SOCIAL MEDIA GAMERESEARCH I conducted in a Clydeside engineering plantfor my doctoral thesis  years ago included asking respondents what newspapers, television news and current affairs programmes they read watched and whether they perceived any political slant in those read watched. With newspapers a political line was often observed, but television was identied as neutral. I wonderI would get the same answers today Of course, in the late s, consumption of media reports was largely passive, opportunities for the reader viewer to respond being limited to such as Points of View and Letters to the Editor. This though is no longer the case, with social media s such as Facebook and Twitter, as well as the legion of bloggers, making passive consumption something media commentators can only look back on.For instance, Sarah Smith claims in a tweet to have tried “to be fair and impartial”, which she may well have considered herself to be, but part of her audience didn’t. And sometimes they had good reason, such as when she reported the annual figure for patients waiting four hours in AEas a weekly figure. Of course, mistakes get made, but how likely is that almost two per cent of the Scottish population were even in AE in a particular week, never mind having to wait more than four hours Of course, as in “the old days” a “correction” was made, though damage had been done at the time. Another instance is, though, more concerning, her claim that Nicola Sturgeon was “enjoying” the Covid pandemic. This was explained by Ms Smith on Twitter, that she meant to say “she [Ms Sturgeon] has embraced the opportunity to make a policy unique to Scotland. I said enjoyed by mistake”. Perhaps, given that her error had started the whole process, an apology, prior to withdrawal, might have been more in order  But no, the political point just had to be made.Lastly, might I point out that Ms Smith, like many other journalists, some of whom make similar complaints, plays the social media “game”. As an experienced \"player\" did she really imagine that Thursday night’s tweet “Sharing this will no doubt invite all my *fans* on Twitter to take another shot” was going to be welcomed positively and warmly  Or did it get the reaction she wanted Alasdair Galloway, Dumbarton.WATCH OUT FOR AMERICAI FOUND your report on Sarah Smith regarding bile, hatred and misogyny in Scottish politics an interesting read, but I do hope that she is not naive enough to believe that by relocating in America as the BBCs correspondent that she is entering a country that is bereft of the self-same problems she is leaving in Scotland.Our politics are not perfect by a long way. I wonder how long she will tolerate the ballyhoo and razzamatazz of America, before she s to our shores as a less naive person.Neil Stewart, Balfron.LACK OF BALANCE ON DEBATE NIGHTIT is disingenuous for any politician to echo the term “isive referendum” when the reason for holding a referendum is when opinion is clearly split on a signicant issue, such as Scotland’s constitutional future. What is more “isive” is when our self-proclaimed impartial public broadcaster fails to provide balance in its news and political programmes.With the resumption of BBC Scotland’s Debate Night the BBC has an opportunity to improve upon,not fully recty, the mistakes of the past, but instead on Wednesday night the public was subjected to the views of another predominantly anti-independence and another seemingly contrived pro-Union audience with a host in Stephen Jardine who still insists on interrupting SNP politicians while content to facilitate more propaganda from anti-independence advocates. Anas Sarwar of the Labour Party was repeatedly given free rein to voice his shallow sound-bites without being held to account by our intrepid host. When Pete Wishart of the SNP attempted toMr Sarwar to fundamental realities by stating the facts that only the UK Government could introduce a windfall tax and that this was not going to happen any time soon under the Tories, Mr Wishart’s contribution was abruptly curtailed by Mr Jardine.Perhapsthe BBC were to host serious and balanced debates on Scotland’s constitutional future any sense of “isiveness” might disappear as the Scottish public becomes convinced of the merits of self-determination, but perhaps this is why the BBC and anti-independence politicians will continue to deny the people of Scotland a truly impartial public broadcasting service and why a referendum, or constitutional change vote in the next General Election, is now a democratic necessity.Stan Grodynski, Longniddry.REMEMBER CHERNOBYLDOUG Maughansays he has \"never understood the safety concerns about nuclear power\", to which I would reply succinctly: Chernobyl.I could expand by adding the fact that more than , people were forced to leave their homes in the immediate aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster and  years later, many districts of Norway were still having to test animals for radiation.More generally, there is no case for nuclear energy in Scotland – we are already creating so much energy from other, cheaper, renewable sources that it is simply unnecessary.David Patrick, Edinburgh.WINDS OF CHANGEI SEEM to recall a UK minister telling the people of the Highland that they did not deserve an enhanced cold weather  winter payment, because “they were used to the cold”. Now we have the BBC asserting mph winds are more serious in the south than in the north, because “Scotland has these high winds every winter”. That’ll be a relief to those in the north-east of Scotland and England who were without power for a week. I suspect any power outages in the south will be remedied long before a week is out – probably led by Boris Johnson with hard hat, and glib, exculpatoryexcuses.GR Weir, Ochiltree.EVERYTHING WITH CHIPSON the basis of a little of what you fancy does you good, I have no quibble with washing down my top gastronomic delight, fish and chips, with an infusion of camellia sinensis, , but I admit surprise at the omission of enhancing CHCOOH, .And good luck also to Embra devotees of their special brown “chippy sauce”.Live and let live.R Russell Smith, Largs.Read more: Why many in Scotland hold Nicola Sturgeon in contempt"},{"url":null,"title":"rory-darge-hopeful-return-six-nations-winning-ways-scotland-france","story":"The most signicant and encouraging aspect of their victory over England was precisely the fact it was achieved despite Scotland’s not being at the top of their game. They had the maturity and self-confidence to find a way to win even though they were not in absolutely optimal form.The most disheartening aspect of the loss to Wales which followed the Calcutta Cup triumph was the fact that it might so easily have been another victory. Again below their best other than during a first-half purple passage in which they went from - down to - up, Scotland still only lost by three points to a team that was totally fired up on home soil.The most concerning thing about the impending game against France  Surely the fact that France’s firepower is considerably greater than England’s or Wales’s.That means Scotland will not get away with playing well in parts, or with the lapses in discipline which cost them against the Welsh. Or, as Rory Darge put it, they will need to make every minor incident countthe big picture is going to end up in their favour.“It was massively disappointing that we lost to Wales,” said the Glasgow openside, who made his long-awaited debut off the bench in Cardf. “But we’ve still got three huge games left.“If you try and put it in perspective, we’ve won a really big game against England, then lost another game by a really small margin where we were disappointed with the performance and the result.“At this level, it’s about small moments and what impact that can have - the margins that it comes down to. We know what France will bring. Every moment is going to be massively important against them.”While this will be Darge’s first Test against the Championship favourites, he has seen some of the French side at first hand this season in Glasgow’s two Champions Cup games against La Rochelle. The Warriors took some time to cope with the physicality of their opponents in their first, away fixture, but ended up securing a losing bonus point. They then lost at home by eight points in a similar type of game, and Darge knows well that Scotland will have to ensure they do some of the things that the Warriors could not quite manage. “In terms of what we expect, it’ll be similar to what French teams bring as a whole,” he said as he looked ahead to what,he is selected, will be his first cap at BT Murrayfield. “La Rochelle have got a few players in their team who you would imagine will be playing for France - big men who run hard and try and get offloads away.”And will he be selected  One of the most commonly asked questions about Darge has been can he play in the same team as another out-and-out openside, his former Edinburgh team-mate Hamish Watson  Gregor Townsend answered that question in Cardf, bringing the Warriors player off the bench with Watson still on the pitch.If the head coach opts for a - split among his substitutes, that should make a second cap for the -year-old a stronger possibility. There is always a temptation to go for the greatest bulk against a side such as France, but such a strategy, by focusing on the negation of your opponents’ virtues, can be implemented at the expense of some of your own strengths. So, while Watson will almost certainly start at , giving Darge a place among the substitutes could ensure more competitiveness at the breakdown later in the game.And although at ft in Darge is far from the tallest forward in the Scotland squad, he believes there is greater iety to his game than his role as a specialist  may suggest. “I see myself as an openside, but I don’t shy away from doing stuff in the lineoutrequired,” he added. “I think it depends on what the coaches feel is necessary for Saturday. And whatever they feel, I’m happy to go ahead with.”We will learn what they feel on Thursday, when Townsend announces his squad."},{"url":null,"title":"compulsory-covid-self-isolation-set-end-england","story":"In an interview on the BBC Sunday Morning Show, Boris Johnson said that while Covid was still dangerous for the unvaccinated and the vulnerable, \"now is the moment for everybody to get their confidence back\".It comes as the UK Government prepares to confirm controversial plans tomorrow to scrap compulsory self-isolation in England - making it the first country in the world to do so.Testing provision is already set to be scaled back.: Its a gamble - Should Scotland follow Englands lead and scrap mandatory self-isolation The Scottish Government is due to publish its new Strategic Framework for managing the virus longer term, but currently has no plans to drop self-isolation rules and ministers have voiced concern about the potential reduction in funding for community testing and free lateral flow devices, which are supplied on a UK-wide basis.Mr Johnson said: \"I dont want people to get completely the wrong idea, Im not saying you can totally throw caution to the winds - Covid remains dangerousyoure vulnerable andyoure not vaccinated, but we need people to be much more confident and get back to work.\"The legal requirement to self-isolate is set to be dropped from next week, as part of a \"living with Covid\" plan.Currently, infected iniduals must isolate at home for up to  days.Mr Johnson said he wants to address the pandemic with a \"vaccine-led approach\", shting the balance away from \"banning certain courses of action\".Labour accused the Prime Minister of \"declaring victory before the war is over\", while some scientists and charities have also questioned the rationale for lting all remaining restrictions in England while Covid infections are high.About one in  people in England had Covid in the week ending  February, compared to one in  in Scotland, according to household surveillance by the Office for National Statistics.The ONS survey, which is based on randomly testing thousands of households across the UK each week and considered the gold standard for gauging prevalence of the virus, is also expected to be slimmed down.: The challenge of finally ending self-isolation A member of Sages modelling subgroup has said he is concerned it is too early for the scrapping of self-isolation rules and free Covid- testing expected this week.Dr Mike Tildesley, from the University of Warwick and a member of the Scientic Pandemic Influenza Modelling group , told Times Radio that at some point the restrictions would have to be eased but that \"the concern now is that we still have relatively high cases\".\"The concern, of course, is with removing testing, removing self-isolation, that may cause quite a big change in behaviour.\"Mr Tildesley said one of his biggest concerns was support for people in low-income jobs to isolate and that there was a \"real concern\" that getting rid of the rules would lead to more infections in workplaces.\"If we lose free testing then a lot of people wont test any more and without that data that will put us in a much weaker position,\" he added.He said that \"in the longer term\" we would have to move to a post-Covid phase, but \"in the short term were not out of the woods yet\".The Government should only end self-isolation when case rates are falling, the chair of the Council of the British Medical Association has said.Dr Chaand Nagpaul told BBC News: \"I think the right time is when the first leap of faith is supported.\"You have at the moment more people dying, more people in the hospital, than you had before plan B was introduced.\"It seems a rather odd decision to make. Secondly, we need to see case rates fall down even more remembering that people arent being restricted at the moment in any severe way at all - people are living normally.\"The second thing is we do need therefore to continue having surveillance because you wont know whether youve reached that point where the infection rates have come down enough until youve had that surveillance.\": The truth about claims vaccines driving massive infections in vaccinated Scots Labour Shadow health secretary Wes Streeting has criticised the Government for plans to end free lateral flow tests.Speaking to Sky on Trevor Phillips on Sunday, he said: \"Im particularly concerned about the end of free testing. I mean, its a bit like being to one up with  minutes left to play and subbing your best defender.\"We are not out of the woods yet on Covid. Its important that when the Government publishes its plan for living with Covid tomorrow that is a robust plan that enables everyone to live well with Covid.\"There are a number of sensible steps that can and should be taken to ensure that we can live well with Covid without impacting on peoples lives, livelihoods and liberties.\"Access to free testing right now, given the prevalence of the virus, given the fact were still asking people to isolate at homethey have the virustheyre infectious, is a really critical tool.

This falls in with ‘Candlemas’ on nd February as a Christian festival and a traditional end of the Christmas season. Candlemas commemorates the presentation of the infant Jesus at the Temple in Jerusalem as described in St Luke’s Gospel and when some denominations bring candles to their church. Candlemas is also one of the so-called ‘Quarter-days’ marking the changing seasons of winter, spring, summer and autumn. It is followed by Whitsun, Lammas Day and Martinmas as the term-days with their administrative and legal implications for the payment of rents and flittings. Saint Bride or Saint Bridget has been one of the most popular of the saints of the celtic church. Of course, there were many ‘Bridgets’, but the one whose festival date is on st February was ‘Bridget of Kildare’ in Leinster whose death was dated to AD . Bridget was one of the patron saints of Ireland and is remembered in the tradition of plaiting rush crosses around st February to set over doors and windows to protect the home from fire and other danger.   or the endearing ‘Bride’s little fosterling’.’ . ‘Bride’s Day, the birthday of spring’. century, traditions of Saint Bride were collected by Alexander Carmichael among his prayers, hymns, blessings and charms from the Hebrides. He suggests that accounts of Saint Bride were not easily recovered and summarised the tradition: ‘The serpent is supposed to emerge from its hollow among the hills on St Bride’s Day, and a propitiatory hymn was sung to it. Only one verse of this hymn has been obtained, apparently the first. It dfers in dferent localities: [Early on Bride’s mornThe serpent shall come from the hole, I shall not molest the serpent, Nor will the serpent molest me.’ The snake is a powerful element in mythology and religion and a creature to be respected as the ‘hymn’ makes clear. Familiar in the snake coiled round the rod, it is a symbol of medicine and healing, and the appearance of the adder or snake on Saint Bride’s Day offers a feeling of hope and transformation, and of turning the corner with the ening of the days. . century. .!... !"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Donnie-Munro-picture-scaled.jpg","title":"special donnie munro concert to bring skye live back with a","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineThe island#s premier music festival is set toin style on Thursday th May # following a two-year break due to the pandemic # with an opening night extravaganza # ‘Coming Home: An Evening with Donnie Munro and friends’ and featuring special guests in the form of multi-award-winning Gaelic supergroup Mànran.The show will be Donnie’s first in his hometown since  and will see him perform with a full eight-piece band line-up on the spectacular Skye Live Festival site at Am Meall in Portree. The singer said: #This offers me a fantastic opportunity to bring this amazing line-up, featuring some of Scotland’s top musicians together, for an exclusive performance to open this year’s Skye Live Festival.He added: #It has been fantastic to watch the festival grow in strength, year on year, in what must be one of the most special and unique festival locations anywhere in the world, and to see it become internationally recognised as, ‘one of the best boutique festivals in the country’, is just fantastic for the island, and it is such a great honour for me to be invited to be a part of it all and to be bringing the music back home here to where it all began.#Joining Donnie Munro on the night will be Mànran, internationally recognised as one of the most iconic and respected Scottish bands on the road today.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?1645089617000\n","title":"wwwballymenaguardiancouknews20220217news1 700 people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland.

I was her son and I was also her friend, companion and chauffer.“We had meals out together or we would have taken trips to places like Portrush and Portballintrae.“She would say to me ‘I liked that wee place you took me to today, but it wasn’t as good as the last one’.”Hannah enjoyed seven years of good health after Robert’s passing, but Mervyn began to notice that she was getting confused from time to time. However, it wasn’t until she didn’t recognise her own home that he knew something was wrong.“That night sticks out a mile,” he said. “When mummy wanted to say something quietly she had this habit of giving you a nudge in the ribs. And as we approached the house she gave me a wee nudge and said ‘do these people know we are visiting ’.”After a fall at home she was taken into hospital and was later diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.Hannah had always said she wanted to be cared for at home and Mervyn was determined to honour her wishes. He juggled caring for her with his full-time job, assisted by a home help and carers who visited daily.It took an emotional toll on him, and he found himself getting exasperated by his mum losing or forgetting things, but after accepting she had a ‘disease of the mind’ things became easier.“People would say to me you’re doing a great thing looking after your mother, but to me it was duty that I was happy to do. But I did wish I had another sibling to share it with. I did have an older brother, Robert Samuel Strahan Currie, but he died in infancy.“At the start, caring for my mother was very, very hard. But I had to come to terms with the fact she had a disease of the mind.“It’s like a net curtain comes down and you see you loved one, but you can’t really talk to them.“People have said it’s like looking after the living dead because it can feel like they’re not getting any benefit of all the things you do for them.“But when she died it was still very dficult. I thought because she had Alzheimer’s that I wouldn’t miss her so much, but the loss was still very big as we had drawn so close.“If someone said to me ‘you can have her back but she’ll still have Alzheimer’s’ I’d still want her back.“Despite all the trials that a single carer experiences I count that particular role in my le as being the most rewarding of all. It was a privilege and honour and to have God’s blessing and strength.”Mervyn, who volunteered to help at two vaccination centres during the pandemic, decided to volunteer as a steward for this year’s Alzheimer’s Society Belfast GLOW Walk to help other people who are caring for a loved one with dementia.He will join people of all ages and walking abilities for a colourful around walk from The Titanic Quarter along the River Lagan and past many historical locations.Participants are encouraged to dress in neon, bring glow sticks and sport their brightest outfits to raise funds and awareness for the , people living with dementia in Northern Ireland.There’s never been a more important time for Belfast residents to glow the distance and come together to raise vital funds for le-changing dementia support. Alzheimer’s Society’s services, including the Dementia Connect support line, have been used over six million times since the start of the pandemic but too many people are still facing dementia alone.Bernadine McCrory, Alzheimer’s Society Northern Ireland Country Director said: “We would like to thank Mervyn and all of our amazing volunteers who helping us with the GLOW event this March.“Belfast GLOW is a fabulous opportunity to make memories with family and friends, all while raising money and awareness for the , living with dementia across Northern Ireland who continue to be disproportionally hit by the pandemic.“Nobody should have to face dementia alone without adequate support. That’s why we’re urging the people of Belfast to shine a light on dementia alongside your family and friends this March and help make a dference in the fight against dementia.“Every pound raised will help Alzheimer’s Society provide vital information and support, improve care, fund research and create lasting change for people affected by the condition.” Help create a brighter future for people affected by dementia alongside family and friends at Alzheimer’s Glow Belfast at the Titanic Quarter on  March.at alzheimers.org.uk glow "},{"url":null,"title":"a decent and dedicated public servant northern irelands political parties pay tribute to christopher stalford","story":"Politicians across Northern Ireland united today as they paid tribute to DUP MLA Christopher Stalford, following his tragic and sudden death.Mr Stalford , who had represented South Belfast in the Assembly since , passed away over the weekend.

He was someone I liked, respected and who worked tirelessly for his community and country.“I know he will be greatly missed not just by his colleagues in his own party but right across the political spectrum. On behalf of the Ulster Unionist Party I would like to extend my deepest and most sincere sympathies to Christopher’s family and many friends and colleagues.”Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up Sinn Fein#s Michelle O#Neill said also told of her and her party’s “sincere sadness” at the news.“His we Laura and their four children are foremost in our thoughts and prayers this morning as they grieve the heartbreaking loss of a husband and father,” she said.“We have worked with Christopher over many years since he entered political le first as a city councillor, and then Assembly member for South Belfast.“His friends and colleagues throughout the world of politics will miss his political contribution, and his constituents his local efforts and leadership across South Belfast.”SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he knew Mr Stalford for more than  years and was shocked by the news.He paid tribute to “a decent and dedicated public servant”.“I don’t think there was a single political issue that Christopher and I agreed on but one of my defining memories will be his great ability to disagree well. You could have a storming argument in the Assembly with terse words and raised voices but as soon as you left, he would always have a wry smile and a laugh, he said.“This will be a dficult day for everyone who knew Christopher, particularly his colleagues and the wider DUP family.Mr Eastwood said the SDLP Spring Conference had been postponed. He added: “Today is a day for political parties to set aside enmity and terse words and to remember that we are all people working hard and doing our best to serve the interests of the people we represent. Christopher Stalford was someone who did just that.Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said, her politics being radically dferent from Mr Stalford’s, she had a “warm personal friendship” with him.“Christopher was High Sherf at Belfast City Council while I was Lord Mayor, and we carried that close relationship throughout the rest of our political careers. Just this week, we discussed his eldest child’s school transfer and it is dficult to put into words my shock, sadness and devastation just days later we are discussing his passing,” she said.“He was a genuine and funny person, who was dedicated to public service. Christopher revelled in the role of Principal Deputy Speaker of the Assembly, carrying out his duties in an even-handed and fair manner, no matter the situation.“My thoughts, prayers and deepest sympathies are with Christopher’s we Laura, his four children, the wider family circle and his party colleagues.”TUV leader Jim Allister said: “Words are not adequate to express the shock and deep sadness I feel at the death of Christopher Stalford. To his beloved we Laura and four young children I express sincere Christian sympathy.“Having known Christopher well since his days working for me, when I served as an MEP, I retained friendship and respect for him and his undoubted ability - ability which Unionism can ill afford to lose.“I also express sympathy to his party which he served with loyalty and distinction. His colleagues in the Assembly and where will feel an aching void, though it is his family who above all require the prayers and support of us all.”Junior Ministers Gary Middleton and Declan Kearney also paid tribute,.Gary Middleton, a DUP MLA for Foyle, said he was “profoundly saddened”. Christopher was a dedicated public representative who worked tirelessly to better the lives of others. But first and foremost, he was a family man who was immensely proud of his wonderful children,” he added.“It is dficult to come to terms with the loss of a young man who had so much to offer our community. And today our community shares in grief at his passing. We are all the poorer for his loss.“I send my heartfelt condolences to Christopher’s we, Laura, his young children, the Stalford family circle and his many friends.”Declan Kearney, the Sinn Fein MLA for South Antrim, added: “This heart-breaking news has touched everyone who worked alongside Christopher from across the political spectrum. He made a signicant contribution to our regional Assembly as Principal Deputy Speaker, and as a member of the TEO scrutiny committee. Today we all stand together in sympathy with everyone who knew and loved him.“My thoughts are with Christopher’s family, especially his we and young children. I extend my sincere condolences to them, and all his friends and DUP colleagues.”Taoiseach Micheal Martin said he was ”deeply saddened to hear of the passing” of Mr Stalford.“He served the people of South Belfast diligently and with integrity, working tirelessly to improve housing and education,” he said.“I conveyed my sympathies to his party leader Jeffrey Donaldson earlier today, and my sincere condolences go to his we Laura, children, family, friends and colleagues in the DUP.”Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Brandon Lewis said: My sincere condolences to Christopher Stalford#s family and friends on this very sad news.As MLA and principal deputy speaker, Christopher was passionate about crucial issues that affected people across Northern Ireland and was dedicated to building a better Northern Ireland for everyone.Alex Maskey, the Speaker of the Assembly, said: “Christopher had been active politically since his youth and he and I first got to know each other as councillors for Laganbank on Belfast City Council.“He was intelligent, articulate and witty and that came across in the regular meetings the Deputy Speakers and I had with him to prepare for the sittings of the Assembly every week.“He was passionate about his constituency and the Assembly. He undoubtedly had strong convictions and relished debating in the Assembly Chamber. However, he was also meticulous about being fair to all sides when he was in the Speaker’s Chair and had good relationships across the Assembly.“I am most mindful today of the commitment he had to his family and my thoughts and sympathies are with his we Laura and his four children.“I will be engaging with the party whips this afternoon to make arrangements for tributes to be paid at the Assembly tomorrow.”Related topicsChristopher StalfordSinn FéinTraditional Unionist VoiceSDLPUlster Unionist PartyMost ReadPolitical rivals united in tribute as DUP MLA Christopher Stalforddies suddenlyUK’s most ‘prolic catfish’ is Newry student accused of killing American girl Dick and Angel Strawbridge: Underneath the ‘overnight success’ of Escape to the Chateau is decades of hard workEamonn Holmes: Belfast film had to use ethnic minorities for fundingSuzanne BreenOpinionHow ironic the party of Paisley is haemorrhaging hardliners as DUP MP is booed at anti-protocol rallyTop VideosPlayDUP leader pays tribute to Christopher StalfordPlayDUP MLA Christopher Stalford dies suddenly aged PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson: DUP left devastated by death of MLA Christopher Stalford‘Passionate about education and equality for all’ – Braniel Primary School pays tribute to Christopher StalfordPoliticians pay tribute to ‘dedicated’ MLA Christopher StalfordChristopher Stalford: The MLA who advocated unionism from young ageChristopher Stalford in his own wordsLatestBruno Lage hopeful Wolves ‘can do something special’ this seasonBelfast Giants produce latest of late shows as they claim improbable shoot-out win over Nottingham PanthersTributes pour in for revered rugby and football coach Steve BlackWolves beat out-of-form Leicester to maintain Champions League challengeFormer England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere signs for Danish club Aarhus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Im an Arlene ultraThe most personal and probing interviews: Christopher Stalford, South Belfast MLA, on dealing with vile online abuse... and why he can#t walk past charity shops.Q. You#re  and married to former dental nurse Laura , how did you meet A. We went to Sunday School together and started going out when we were . On our first date, I took her to a cafe and sprayed a sachet of tomato sauce all over her, but she forgave me.Q. Can you tell me a little bit about your parents A. Karenis a former shop assistant who gave that up to look after us when my daddy, Clford, died at  from a bleed on his brain. I was seven and, for a time, it was just me, mummy and Angela. Mummy married again and had two more children, but it was a rough time. I remember very little about my father, but I remember his funeral. My step-father, Eric , a painter and decorator, is a very good person and a hard worker who looked after us.Q. And what about your siblings Daily Headlines  EveningNewsletterReceive today#s headlines directly to your inbox every morning and evening, with our free daily newsletter.Enter email addressThis field is requiredSign Up A. Angelaworks in the Credit Union, Ericaworks in a day nursery looking after children and Glenis an accountant at PWC.Q. What was your childhood like A. I was born in Annadale Flats and, with the exception of losing my father, I had a happy childhood. I remember family holidays caravanning in Newcastle. When you#ve four children in a house, they#re going to fight, but we all roped along well.Angela still gives me grief about the time we were at the pitch and putt in Donaghadee. She was standing behind me and I didn#t see her. My putting iron connected with her nose and there was blood gushing from it. I told her I#d give her a poundshe didn#t tell mummy.That#s the worst thing I#ve ever done.Otherwise, my le when growing up revolved very much around the church, Boys Brigade and choir.Q. You attended Ulidia Primary School , Nettlefield Primary School, Wellington College and Queen#s. What did you study A. Politics and history. I remember Wellington College with fondness. It was a brilliant school - you were challenged to think for yourself. My politics teacher, Mr Smilie, would debate and argue things. One time he wrote the comments on an essay of mine in orange ink, saying he hoped I appreciated the colour, and I responded by writing the next essay in green. I don#t think direct rule ministers understand the concept of a working-class grammar school.Q. Is integrated education the way forward here A. Parents should have the right to chose how their children are educated. I think we should have an entirely integrated system of education - a single school in which people can pursue whatever faith they want to.It#s absurd that we have a Catholic school and a Protestant school. If that was suggested about universities, you#d be laughed out of town. We should have a single schooling system that allows for dference and can accommodate dference through separate arrangements for assembly and things. People should be able to opt out of assembly as well.Q. Can you give us a brief resume of your career A. After graduation, I worked in Jim Allister#s European office three days a week, and Peter Weir#s Bangor office the other two. I then moved to the DUP press office for six years and then onto the policy unit. In , I was elected to Belfast City Council aged , the youngest person on the council.I ran for the Assembly in  but didn#t get in. I was re-elected to the council in  and again in . I was elected to Stormont for the first time in  and re-elected this year.Q. What made you go into politics A. I have always been interested. I looked around at some of the public representatives that we had and thought that I could do the job.Q. Some see you as a future DUP leader. Do you A. No. I#m an Arlene ultra. I think she#s doing a fantastic job. She is the foremost communicator in politics and she#s able to connect with people. I hope Arlene Foster is still leader of the DUP in  years# time.Q. What was it like working for Jim Allister, and were you disappointed when he left the DUP A. He#s a gentleman. I wasn#t entirely surprised when he left, but I was disappointed. He left in  and that#s the primary reason why we went our separate ways.Q. Apart from your father, have you lost anyone close to you A. I remember when my granny, Isobel, died from a heart attack in . She was about . All of a sudden, she was just gone. It was a Sunday evening and I remember coming home from church and my mother telling me. My granny never got over daddy dying - you#d just have to mention his name.I was very close to her. When she died, I was devastated. She was an Orange Lily and would#ve had a Union Jack apron and a flag in either hand on the Twelfth. She lived in Tigers Bay and was a big supporter of Nigel Dodds. I regret that she never got to see me elected and never met her great-grandchildren. Her death, when I was , probably hit me harder than the death of my father because when you#re seven you don#t really take these things in.Q. And what about death  Does it frighten you A. No, because, as a Christian, I believe that when we die,we have faith in Christ, then we go to Heaven. But that doesn#t mean I would embrace it willingly.Q. Do you believe in God  Do you have a strong faith A. I believe in God and I#m a practising Christian. It#s a very important part of my le. I don#t think that people of faith should be required to hide that - it should be celebrated and encouraged.Q. Who is your best Catholic friend A. David McCann, who writes for Slugger O#Toole. He comes at things from a very dferent perspective to me, but it#s useful to have that and understand better where people are coming from. Plus, he#s good at raking me.Q. How do you relax outside politics A. About four years ago, I bought a record player at a jumble sale, so I#ve been spending time going round charity shops pulling together old records. On a Sunday afternoon, I sit and listen to them. Sunday is precious for spending time as a family. We have Sunday dinner sitting round the table in each other#s company because it#s important. I wouldn#t want my children to say I put politics in front of them.Q. What#s the biggest mistake you#ve ever made A. Not continuing my education. I#d have liked to have qualied as a politics or history teacher. When you come from a background like mine, where you don#t have inherited wealth, the key to advancement is education.Q. And how do you feel about social media A. I wouldn#t want my children to read abuse about me. People say it comes with the job, but I#ve seen some of the utter filth that has been said about Arlene Foster on Twitter, and I know her daughter can see people saying the most awful things about her mummy. It#s an ideal forum for cowards because they can say awful things and effectively get away with it. I wouldn#t want my children reading some of the stuff I#ve seen about Arlene.Q. If you were in trouble, who#s the person you would you turn to A. Always my we, Laura.Q. Tell us about the best day of your le so far.A. When our first child, Trinity, came along, she was born sleeping. I rushed to the other side of the room to check that everything was okay. She opened her eyes, curled her tongue, closed them again and went back to sleep. Your whole world changes when you become a parent.Q. And what about the worst day of your le A. The death of my granny, Isobel.Q. Your Sandy Row office allegedly has links to the UDA. Does that make you uncomfortable A. It doesn#t have links to the UDA. Belfast South Community Resources is my landlord, and at no point has anyone claimed that it#s anything other than a legitimate community group.I was criticised for paying my rent to a community group. I#d rather make a contribution to the community than to a private landlord. The people who criticised me attacked a perfectly good community organisation that#s committed to positive change in the Sandy Row area.Q. You#ve also taken stick for refusing to acknowledge that the Eleventh Night bonfire at Sandy Row was built too close to apartments. Can you see a time when bonfires will not be a contentious issue A. As a child, I used to collect material for the bonfire. It is part of where I come from. I want us to get to the point where every single person, whether unionist or nationalist, enjoys the Eleventh Night, or at least has no objection to it.That will be achieved through conversations in communities, not by every twist and turn being played out in the media. The way in which positive change will come is by engaging the community in Sandy Row, not by looking down on them.Q Do you wish you#d handled the bonfire situation dferently  Will you ask them to build it further away next year A. I do hope the issues will be resolved, but the way it#ll be done is not by middle-class nationalist and Alliance politicians talking down to working-class loyalists about how dreadful their culture is and how awful they#ve behaved. That just makes securing a positive outcome much more dficult.Q. What#s the most important piece of advice someone has ever given you A. Never get ahead of yourself, stay rooted on the ground and always treat people with respect because you could be up one day but down the next.Q. Do you have any bad habits you#d like to share A. Charity shops. I can#t walk past one without going in and I#ll almost definitely come out with something whether it#s a book, record, tie, a suit… something.Q. Do you have or have you ever had a nickname A. Granny Isobel called me #Snowy# because I had very light hair when I was a wee boy.Q What#s your favourite place in Northern Ireland A. The monastic ruins at Nendrum on Mahee Island.Q. What is your greatest achievement A. The hundreds of people I have helped as an elected representative. There#s nothing more rewarding in this job than getting a result for someone.Q. What will you dothere#s no Assembly A. I enjoy representative politics, soStormont doesn#t get back up and running, there#s a council election in two years and I might go back to City Hall.Related topicsChristopher StalfordMore On Christopher Stalford‘Passionate about education and equality for all’ – Braniel Primary School pays tribute to Christopher Stalford‘A decent and dedicated public servant’ – Northern Ireland’s political parties pay tribute to Christopher StalfordChristopher Stalford: DUP MLA a key player in the party who will be sorely missed by colleaguesPolitical rivals united in tribute as DUP MLA Christopher Stalforddies suddenly PremiumThe Weekly Political Spin: From delayed apologies and Poots# preference for steak, to Thatcher and CromwellMost ReadPolitical rivals united in tribute as DUP MLA Christopher Stalforddies suddenlyUK’s most ‘prolic catfish’ is Newry student accused of killing American girl Dick and Angel Strawbridge: Underneath the ‘overnight success’ of Escape to the Chateau is decades of hard workEamonn Holmes: Belfast film had to use ethnic minorities for fundingSuzanne BreenOpinionHow ironic the party of Paisley is haemorrhaging hardliners as DUP MP is booed at anti-protocol rallyTop VideosPlayDUP leader pays tribute to Christopher StalfordPlayDUP MLA Christopher Stalford dies suddenly aged PlayVideo: Two-year-old Belfast girl shouts at her mum for laughing as she tries to sing a song from FrozenLatest Northern IrelandDonaldson: DUP left devastated by death of MLA Christopher Stalford‘Passionate about education and equality for all’ – Braniel Primary School pays tribute to Christopher StalfordPoliticians pay tribute to ‘dedicated’ MLA Christopher Stalford‘A decent and dedicated public servant’ – Northern Ireland’s political parties pay tribute to Christopher StalfordChristopher Stalford: The MLA who advocated unionism from young ageLatestBruno Lage hopeful Wolves ‘can do something special’ this seasonBelfast Giants produce latest of late shows as they claim improbable shoot-out win over Nottingham PanthersTributes pour in for revered rugby and football coach Steve BlackWolves beat out-of-form Leicester to maintain Champions League challengeFormer England and Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere signs for Danish club Aarhus,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessUlster GrocerTop SportOlympicsFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsColumnistsLeRestaurant ReviewsFeaturesFashion  BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse  HomeFood and DrinkWeekendBooksPuzzlesMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightlePuzzlesWeekendCompetitionsSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEntertainmentEventsElectric Ireland Game ChangerUlster Grocer Marketing AwardsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

When it was announced that the new curator would be serving both Newry and Downpatrick this caused great consternation.ldquoWe can understand that frustration and since our local councils were brought together seven years ago where parity should have existed between Newry, Mourne and Down, it has felt that the legacy Down area has been left behind somewhat.ldquoWe have to be straightforward about the facts and Downpatrick is the county town. This carries major signicance. The historical and ecclesiastical heritage of Downpatrick is equally signicant, as is our links to St Patrick. The museum in Downpatrick is the Down County Museum and must be treated as such.The SDLP politicians say while they appreciate the local authorityrsquos need for a curator that serves both Downpatrick and Newry, they are firmly on the view that the curator must be based in Downpatrick.Cllr Enright confirmed that he and Cllr Brown have also been meeting with the Friends of the Museum over the past few weeks and will be calling for a special motion on the restructuring plan to be debated publicly at next monthrsquos full council meeting.ldquoThe council proposal makes no sense whatsoever at all to promote the relatively insignicant Bagelrsquos Castle in Newry over the Down County Museum which is one of the premier professional conservancy and historical centres in Northern Ireland, added Cllr Enright.Cllr Brownrsquos motion calls for a full-time curator to be based at and responsible for the Down County Museum and that the existing curatorial posts of keeper and assistant keeper of collections are permanently filled and not downgraded, with the vital and highly skilled role of the museumrsquos technician photographer also retained and not downgraded.ldquoI am calling for council officers to develop, in consultation with relevant stakeholders, a new, long-term strategic plan for how the council can most effectively invest in museums across the district, he confirmed.ldquoCouncillors are highly concerned by the plans to downgrade staff provision at the Down County Museum and to base the only full-time museum curator in Newry.

Arrested in Belfast in September , he was a prisoner in Dublin when the Rising raged in  and was despatched along with other State prisoners to Fort George in Scotland the following year.Liberated in , Russell threw himself back into revolutionary politics in support of Robert Emmetrsquos ill-fated coup by attempting to raise once again the standard of rebellion in Co Down. After an anticlimactic call to arms in Loughinisland in July , Russell escaped the county only to be arrested in Dublin and ed to Downpatrick for trial and execution.One of the earliest collections acquired four decades ago by the fledgling Down County Museum was a small parcel of documents relating to the trial of Thomas Russell.The documents include the order from the viceroy, Lord Hardwicke, to initiate proceedings against Russell and the list of jurors who would decide his fate, not that it was ever in doubt. Also contained within the collection is a series of fascinating depositions sworn before local gentry which condemned not only Russell, but two Co Down men, James Corry and James Drake, to execution.The improbability of success for the  Rising is revealed in the deposition of Patrick Doran from Annadorn, who said that ldquonone but fools andmadmen would endorse a Rising so soon after the sobering experience of . Doranrsquos deposition goes on to describe Russellrsquos green Generalrsquos coat, decorated with gold lace and rich epaulettes.Another deposition, from Hugh Magennis, of Ballydugan, provides us with the vivid impression of Russellrsquos ldquomilitary step and appearance, while William Cosby of Saintfield described the mysterious stranger of Wilsonrsquos ballad as a ldquolarge handsome looking man.Such witness statements helped to deliver a guilty verdict and Russell was executed outside the County Gaol, now Down County Museum, on Friday, October , . He was buried in the parish churchyard his gravestone arranged and paid for by the indomitable Mary Ann McCracken of Belfast.These documents held in Down County Museum shed considerable light on an episode of local history that had profound national signicance. Scholars of th century Ireland have visited the museum to consult its rich archive and conferences staged there to discuss the sitersquos deep imprint on Irish history and memory.The size and quality of its collections and the historical importance of its buildings underpin the importance of the internationally-recognised Down County Museum.The ongoing depletion of its highly-qualied and committed staff, which under Newry, Mourne and Down Council proposals now appears to include only a part-time curator, the replacement of the keeper of collections and an assistant with two new positions at a signicantly lower grade, and the removal of the important position of a photographer technician, reflects a disregard for the heritage industry in the county and represents an insult to the hundreds of donors who presented valued family possessions to Down County Museum in the good faith that the Council would preserve, celebrate and cherish them.The fear of many is that the downgrading of the Museum mdash for that is what this is mdash will lead to a reluctance among the public to donate artefacts to the collection and undermine applications for the funding of future projects.The public knows exactly what kind of jewel we have in Down County Museum.

With five minutes to go in the half they kicked a penalty to the corner and executed an effective catch and drive line-out to bring the deficit to one point at -.The home support were glad to see the conversion attempt bounce back off the uprights.Down maintained their slender lead into the break when they would turnaround to play with the wind in the second period.Throughout the second half, Down half-backs, Benjamin Hart and Brian Mitchell, managed the wind advantage very effectively to maintain territorial pressure on the County Tyrone school.However, it was the green forwards who capitalised on this pressure scoring all the points that would see the local school comfortably through to the semi-finals.In the th minute second-row, Reuben McKibbin touched down, in the th minute hooker, Fionn Carey got over the line and Ryan Connolly got Downrsquos fth and final try of the day seven minutes from time with Phillips converting two of these tries.With a minute to go in the fixture, Omagh did manage to score a consolatory, unconverted try, although Down Highrsquos controlled attack and physical defence were too strong for a repeat of the early season outcome between the two sides.In other Down High fixtures last week, a hybrid U- U- team came from behind to defeat Clounagh U-s -, while the U-s added to their impressive record this season with four victories over Methodist College, Belfast.The Medallion B XV also defeated Omagh Academyrsquos Medallion team - on Saturday morning in a pre-cursor to the first XV game.

Nineteen other councillors, from the SDLP, Ulster Unionists, DUP and Alliance voted in favour.A lively debate was sparked by the SDLPrsquos Mr John Doris and involved  other councillors.Mr Doris said while he was keen to support the charity which will benefit from the drag hunt the council has money invested in Delamont and he felt it was ldquoinappropriate for the horses and hounds to go across the council track of land.He said the Delamont country park is taking shape very well and it would be ldquovery unwise to allow it to be used in this way.Mr Doris told councillors it would be ldquofoolish even to allow a drag hunt on an experimental basis.He said there is no guarantee that the hunt will stay on the periphery of Delamont.Party colleague, Mr Cathal O Baoill, argued in favour of permitting the hunt.

There is no need to retain a facility which is  miles away from the main hospital in Armagh, the spokesman added.CROSSGAR ndash SDLP MP, Mr Eddie McGrady, has reported success in his campaign to have the mains water system in the Crossgar Killyleagh area improved.The South Down MP pointed out that after serious supply problems just before Christmas  he took the meter up with the Minister, Mr Richard Needham.ldquoI am now pleased that the Department having considered a study is designing a scheme to lay a waterman from Raleigh to New Line, Crossgar, which will increase the reliability of the supply to the Killyleagh and Shirley areas. This work should commence later this year, said Mr McGrady.ldquoThis study also identied the need to replace two watermains in Killyleagh. One of these on the Downpatrick Roa has already been replaced and work to replace the other at Kerry Drive should be completed by the end of this month.ldquoThis is indeed welcome news and hopefully the new waterman will enhance the standard of supply in these areas, added Mr McGrady.SAINTFIELD ndash A lamb processing plant providing up to  jobs is being planned for Mid Down.A facility handling , lamb carcasses a year could be up and running within twelve months, it was announced this week.A number of green-field sites in the Saintfield, Crossgar and Ballygowan areas are being considered, with construction work could begin in August.The main behind the scheme is Mr Alex Waugh, a director of the Newtownards-based company, Milltown Livestock and Meats.A separate company led by Mr Waugh is currently involved in discussions with the Industrial Development Board, the Department of Agriculture, the Planning Service and other government agencies.ldquoThere are a lot of hurdles to cross, but I am confident the factory will be built. Initially, we would hope to employ  people, rising to around  with two years, Mr Waugh said.ldquoThis will be an ultra-modern processing plant in the provincersquos main sheep producing area. I have spoken to many farmers and I am encouraged by their remarks, he continued.ldquoWe do not have a sheep processing plant in Northern Ireland and only three abbatoirs have slaughtering facilities for sheep. At present, less than half of our lambs are processed in the province.Mr Waugh said the plant will provide an opportunity for the sheep industry to gain a larger shore of the important British and European markets.Mr Waugh added: ldquoWe are progressing as quickly as possible and hope to get started by August or September. If that happens, there is no reason why we cannot be in production by next April..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Kilcoo.jpg","title":"Kilcoo win All Ireland  ","story":"KILCOOrsquos triumphant senior footballers ed home to jubilant scenes on Saturday night after their dramatic extra-time win over the much-fancied Kilmacaud Crokes in a pulsating All-Ireland Club final at Croke Park.Hundreds of supporters gathered outside the clubhouse at Paacuteirc Eoghan Rua as the Andy Merrigan Cup was proudly laid on the village pitch for the first time ever.Indeed it was the first time that the coveted All-Ireland title was back in Down since the all-conquering Burren side brought it home in .After one of the most dramatic finals in recent history last weekend, Kilcoo players finally got their hands on the trophy, confirming the sidersquos place as the best in Ireland.After going so close in  when the Galway-based Corofin snatched the cup from the locals in extra time, there was no heartache last weekend with Kilcoorsquos late late show securing victory.Amid wild celebrations at the final whistle, assistant manager Conleth Gilligan spoke of an ldquoenormous sense of relief.He continued: ldquoWe are delighted to get over the line, for so many reasons. We didnrsquot want the disappointment again. We were actually down in Croke Park last Sunday for a kick-about and we did a presentation with the lads.ldquoWe happened to do it in the media room and when I walked into it I immediately got that feeling of walking in after the  final loss and having to answer all the questions about where it all went wrong.Conleth continued: ldquoI remember thinking to myself that I never want to have to do that again.For Magpies manager, Mickey Moran, it was a case of creating your own destiny.The Kilcoo boss has suffered All-Ireland heartache on three separate occasions ndash with Slaughtneil, Mayo and Kilcoo ndash and at half-time on Saturday he was on the verge of another when his side trailed by six points.ldquoMickey really gave it good. Every now and again, does give really cross speeches, said Gilligan.ldquoHe hadnrsquot done one of those at all this year he hadnrsquot even raised his voice but this was one where he basically asked the boys to stand up and be counted or get their bags and go out on to the bus now.His words hit home with the players leaving nothing on the pitch as they overcame the Dublin kingpins in a breathtaking finale graced by scintillating football.With just added time of extra time left to play, Jerome Johnston fired the winning goal home to cue scenes of pandemonium that would last well beyond the final whistle.As the players, management and travelling support arrived back up north to their native-village as All-Ireland heroes, Moran prepared a heartfelt speech alongside goalkeeper Niall Kane, who also highlighted the magnitude of their achievement.The celebrations lasted long overnight and into the weekend, with those involved with the club finally relaxing after a strenuous season in which they were forced to never stop working until it was over..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Dance.jpg","title":"Matthew puts in stirring dance in honour of his late friend%2C Ryan  ","story":"A MOVING dance tribute to his late friend who died in an accident earned Matthew MacNabb the top score of the night in Sundayrsquos Dancing With The Stars Ireland.The contemporary dance from the Downpatrick man and his partner Laura Nolan also got the top combined score of the night between judgesrsquo scores and viewersrsquo votes, which means they are immune for being sent home next weekend.The  year-old, who gained popularity from his appearance in ITVrsquos Love Island over the summer, met his friend Ryan Freeman while he was travelling in the United States.Ryan died in an accident in Phoenix, Arizona, at the age of  while Matthew was quarantining before he went on to Love Island.Matthew chose to honour his friend in the lsquodedicated dancersquo night week as each celebrity paid tribute to someone special in their lives.He told the Recorder: ldquoIt was an incredible moment.

They say residents have been looking for a modern leisure complex for over two decades.Council chairwoman, Cathy Mason, was one of a number of local politicians provided with a progress report on the Newcastle project last week by senior council directors.She described confirmation of plans for new leisure facilities in Newcastle as really welcome news.She continued: ldquoThese new local amenities will be of great benefit to local residents, their families and tourists alike and I am delighted that the plans are in the final stages. The plans will include a new leisure pool and state of the art gym facilities.Cllr Mason also reaffirmed the view that the rear of the Newcastle Centre is no longer fit for purpose and, as a result, will be demolished in the near future.She continued: ldquoFor too long, the people of Newcastle have had to put up with substandard facilities. I hope to see the finalised plans for the new leisure complex and site approval in the coming months so that contractors can start working on the project as soon as possible.The council chairwoman said it is essential that the local authority ldquomoves in a timely manner to ensure the leisure centre project comes to fruition so that Newcastle residents can access the new facilities as soon as possible.Cllr Mason said Sinn Feacutein will continue to do all it can to ensure the new leisure facilities are delivered, insisting that she will continue to stand up for rural families across South Down to provide essential services in the heart of their respective communities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2021-GoDigital.jpg","title":"Roads officials urged to address pedestrian safety in Darragh Cross  ","story":"ROADS officials have been asked to consider providing a new pedestrian crossing in Darragh Cross as part of a series of measures to make the village safer.The appeal was made by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown when he met with a local roads official in the village last week to discuss increasing concern about pedestrian safety as a result of the speed of vehicles.The Department for Infrastructure has said while there will not be a mph zone implemented in Darragh Cross due to current legislation, it has been asked to extend the current mph in force outside the villagersquos primary school and the nearby Barnamaghery Road.Cllr Brown has also asked the districtrsquos Policing and Community Safety Partnership to locate one of its electronic speed indicator signs in the village.He said the devices have helped reduce speed in other areas and believes that one in Darragh Cross would be effective with a decision on his request expected next month.ldquoA speed indicator device will help address speeding concerns in an area where children are particularly vulnerable and I would like the sign in place as soon as possible, he continued.ldquoI have also discussed with roads officials the potential opportunity for a pedestrian crossing near the main shop which would be funded by the government departmentrsquos active travel department, which would be another welcome measure for pedestrians in Darragh Cross.Cllr Brown said that as a result of his recent meeting which he described as ldquoconstructive, roads officials gave a commitment to assess safety railings in place a Manse Road.ldquoThis particular issue was raised with me last month as damage to part of the railings is adding to residentsrsquo safety concerns. The assessment will happen after the new local authority-funded play park has been built at the GAA site, he said.Cllr Brown confirmed that he is also pushing for the safety railings to be extended from the Oaks Restaurant to the GAA ground to ldquomaximise the safety of residents, in particular, families with young children who will be making frequent use of the site.He added: ldquoI share residentsrsquo concerns about road safety in Darragh Cross and believe that enacting these measures over the coming months should be a departmental priority.ldquoHowever, I hope that collectively, these steps will begin to alleviate many of the villagersquos safety concerns for the future..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Traders.jpg","title":"Traders invited to get  involved in town future  ","story":"TRADERS in Downpatrick are being urged to have their say on the future development of the town with a primary focus on what can be done to revive its economic fortunes.The appeal comes after Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that it is to organise a workshop event to gauge the business communityrsquos key priorities, particularly in a post-Covid environment.Details of the workshop event comes as the debate continues about appointing a dedicated town centre manager who would act as a link between the business community and wide range of statutory agencies and funders to help drive new initiatives and opportunities.Council officers have already spoken with a number of businesses on the issue, but it was confirmed at Monday nightrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee that a more co-ordinated plan now needs to be developed.Officials argue this is necessary in order to agree priorities on the way forward to manage expectations through the development of strategy focused on the needs of the town.Plans for a workshop to discuss the issue are being drawn up with appeals to everyone in business in Downpatrick to take part to provide as wide ofview of the potential way forward as possible.The workshop will focus on the main priorities to help develop a new strategy with calls for an independent person to head up the exercise which, it is hoped, will outline recommendations on the way forward.A proposal to appoint a Downpatrick town centre manager to help plan the townrsquos economic revival and long-term future was tabled last year and referred to the council committee for discussion.A number of councillors believe such an appointment is a ldquocritical component of the drive to support the business community, increase footfall and, crucially, help attract new investment to the county town.It has been suggested a town centre manager could work closely with the business community to develop fresh ideas and initiatives, but nothingwill happen before the outcome of the proposed workshop is known.Downpatrick councillors Dermot Curran and Oonagh Hanlon have welcomed confirmation of the workshop and are fully supportive of the development of a strategic plan being mapped out for the town.Cllr Curran believes that appointing town centre manager deserves close attention and is keen to hear what the business community and other stakeholders have already said about the way forward.ldquoI see great merit in having a dedicated town centre manager, he continued.ldquoThe proposed workshop that is to be held is crucially important and I would appeal to everyone in business to get involved and have their say. This is a crucially important exercise and it must happen as soon as possible.Cllr Curran believes one area that requires particular focus is developing Downpatrickrsquos night-time economy which he is confident would help breathe new le into the town centre.He is also keen for Downpatrick to have an umbrella body representing all business groups and interests, pointing to the success of Chambers of Commerce which he believes play important roles.ldquoAgreeing the way forward for Downpatrick is crucial and a new strategy can help kick-start the townrsquos economic revival, especially at a time when ambitious plans are being advanced for the regeneration of the former Irish Street police base and a number of empty adjacent buildings, Cllr Curran added.Welcoming plans for the workshop, Cllr Hanlon said it has been identied that a strategic plan needs to be considered to focus on the needs of the town.She also confirmed that she as met with a number of stakeholders who believe that Downpatrick needs a strategic plan.ldquoThere is so much effort and productive work from local groups such as the Town Committee and Community Collective alongside local businesses, Cllr Hanlon continued. ldquoEngagement from a iety of stakeholders via theworkshop will ensure that we have a bold and progressive plan for the future of Downpatrick.She added: ldquoCouncil assistance to facilitate this is will be imperative as we continue to build our local economy, arts and events offerings..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/16February2022_Minister.jpg","title":"Tributes and presentations to Downpatrick clergyman  ","story":"ANOTHER chapter in the distinguished history of Downpatrick Non-Subscribing Presbyterian Church closed last Sunday when the Rev Dr David Speers preached his final service after  yearsrsquo service.Dr Steers, who was also in charge of Ballee and Clough Non-Subscribing Presbyterian churches, is leaving the district to take up a new post in Dunmurry.He introduced his final service with the history of the replica High Cross which stands at the entrance to the Down Cathedral, explaining how its engravings depict Jesus Christ and the prophets St Anthony and Paul and how the illustrations guided the early Christians over a thousand years agoDr Steers said the Non-Subscribing congregation in Downpatrick worships in a building erected over  years ago, encouraging them to keep this faith going.He continued this theme with readings from Psalm  and the first letter to John, explaining the dference in the perception of God from the Old to the New Testament, with the departing ministerrsquos sermon reminding the congregation that despite their comfortable lives, to continue to do Godrsquos work in the community.Laura Patterson accompanied the hymns lsquoHoly, holy, holyrsquo, lsquoJust as I amrsquo, The Lordrsquos my shepherdrsquo and lsquoGod sent his Sonrsquo.At the conclusion of the service, church treasurer, Carol Nixon, spoke of Dr Steers leadership, pastoral care and how he led by example, fully participating in all the church worship and witness as well as many fundraising events.In addition, she reminded those in attendance of his leadership, both within the church group and in the community where he is well known and respected by all denominations, and wishing him the congregationrsquos blessing in his new charge.The Downpatrick churchrsquos senior elder, Mr Freddie Straney, made a presentation to Dr Steers and thanked him for his loyalty and  yearsrsquo service.Eileen Neill, on behalf of the younger members, presented Dr. Steers with a delightful and talented illustration of the Downpatrick church which she had created, with Ms Nixon presenting the ministerrsquos we Sue, with a flower arrangement, thanking her for the many ways she had supported her husband both in and outside the pulpit.Also during Sundayrsquos service, the congregation took the opportunity of presenting Mary Stewart with a gold brooch, church illustration by Eileen Neill, flowers and rose plants to mark her  years as church secretary.Dr Steers responded to his gts with moving words which touched everyonersquos spirit.He recalled how he became associated with the church in  and was in charge in  before being fully appointed in the group, also thanking Mary for all her work.The ious speeches were dficult and emotional, but very sincere and from the heart.

PA archive“And yet people’s understanding about plants, except in a very kind of narrow way, has not kept up with that. I think this will bring it home.”It’s a concept that the show’s executive producer Mike Gunton concurs with.“I wanted to do a Planet Earth for plants – because obviously your first thought with plants is, ‘It’s going to be like Gardeners’ World, it’s going to be dull’,” the Bafta-winning producer says, glancing over at Sir David as the broadcaster rehearses his lines.“Planet Earth, I think, gives you a sense that there’s going to be some drama and some scale. It is constructed by habitat, so I wanted to replicate that. There’s tropical worlds, desert worlds, water worlds, seasonal worlds, and human worlds.”Sir David Attenborough address the COP conference in Glasgow on November , As the first ever Creative Director of the BBC’s Natural History Unit, Gunton has played a pivotal role in the production of hit BBC documentaries including Planet Earth II, Dynasties and Africa.It’s a proven track record that sees him ideally placed to take on the mammoth challenge posed by The Green Planet. Reuniting with Dynasties series producer Rupert Barrington, the series – which premiered on the eve of November’s COP summit in Glasgow – saw Sir Davidto screens as series narrator.Sir David hopes people, after watching the series, will begin to understand the primordial importance plants play in human le.The veteran naturalist describes the world of plants as “a parallel world on which we depend, and which up to now we have largely ignored,I speak on behalf of urbanised man.”“Over half the population of the world according to the UN are urbanised, live in cities, only see cultivated plants and never see a wild community of plants. “But that wild community is there, outside urban circumstances normally, and we depend upon it. And we better jolly well care for it,” he warns.Recalling how the series proposal was met with the words “we’re ploughing a new furrow” from Sir David, Gunton says he knew the project needed to be an immersive viewing experience in order to capture the minds of viewers.“The green ecosystems are an incredibly strong web which underpins all le – and because it’s so complex and so strong, it’s an unchallengeable Jenga tower,” says Gunton. “What’s been happening is that we’ve been pulling the bricks out, but because we’re plant-blind, we haven’t really cared or noticed that we’ve pulled these bricks out.“As we know, with a Jenga tower,you just pull that last brick out, the whole thing collapses. “What we’re trying to say is, be more aware of those Jenga blocks, becauseyou knock down that tower, it’s curtains.”Noting the ever-present challenge of bringing the natural world to le, Gunton explains how the unit developed never-before-seen technology, resulting in a new approach to filmmaking.Based upon a widely-used technique known as time-lapse photography – a process by which a moving object is photographed consistently over a period of time and when played back, appears as a fast-forwarded video – the concept emerged after producer Paul Williams chanced upon a YouTube video uploaded by American visual engineer, Chris Field.Already a fan of botanical photography, Field had tinkered with existing electronics to create a customised camera capable of capturing the movement of plant le. Together with the BBC’s in-house team, they set about developing the technology in order to not only capture a simple time-lapse, but allow viewers to travel along the rainforest floor alongside plants and insects. It’s a project that also saw the Natural History Unit embrace drone technology – a more eco-friendly and immersive alternative to helicopters. Harnessing the skills of two competitive first-person-view drone pilots, the drones were able to weave through the rainforest canopy at high speed, capturing footage unlike anything previously seen.Recounting how the five year production saw the team – including Sir David, travel the world in search of exotic plant le, it’s clear that age is but a number to the veteran naturalist.“David is in his s, so we had to be quite careful about the number of locations and the amount of time away, but we managed to [go] to all the habitats,” says Gunton, listing off a swathe of trips across South America and Europe. “We’ve been to rainforests, deserts, water worlds, and the Arctic – we actually even went to the Arctic Circle.”The team also travelled to Costa Rica, visiting La Selva Biological Station – and what they saw there should bring hope, as the research centre has become famous for giving vast swathes of their land back to the natural rainforest.“Plants will rewire land for you, and that’s what David is saying,” says Gunton. “The planet heals itself, we just need to give it the chance to do it.”‘I’M SWANNING AROUND THE WORLD LOOKING AT THE MOST FABULOUSLY INTERESTING THINGS’: A POTTED BIO OF SIR DAVIDSir David Attenborough was born on May ,  in Isleworth, Middlesex, and grew up in College House on the campus of the University College, Leicester, where his father, Frederick, was principal.He is the middle of three sons his elder brother, Richard , became an actor and director, and his younger brother, John , was an executive at Italian car manufacturer Alfa Romeo.Attenborough spent his childhood collecting fossils, stones, and natural specimens. He spent much time in the grounds of the university. Aged around , he heard that the zoology department needed a large supply of newts, which he offered through his father to supply for d each. The source was a pond right next to the department. In , Sir David and his brother Richard attended a lecture by Grey Owlat De Montfort Hall, Leicester, and were influenced by his advocacy of conservation. According to Richard, David was: “Bowled over by the man’s determination to save the beaver, by his profound knowledge of the flora and fauna of the Canadian wilderness and by his warnings of ecological disaster should the delicate balance between them be destroyed. “The idea that mankind was endangering nature by recklessly despoiling and plundering its riches was unheard of at the time, but it is one that has remained part of Dave’s own credo to this day.”Sir David was educated at Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys in Leicester and won a scholarship to Clare College, Cambridge in  to study geology and zoology.In , he was called up for national service in the Royal Navy and spent two years stationed in North Wales and the Firth of Forth. In , Attenborough married Jane Elizabeth Ebsworth Oriel. The couple had two children, Robert and Susan. Jane died in . Robert is a senior lecturer in bioanthropology at a university in Canberra and his daughter Susan is a former primary school headmistress.Sir David had a pacemaker fitted in June , as well as a double knee replacement in . But the ebullient naturalist and broadcaster’s passion for what he does remains undimmed despite his formidable age.He is quoted as commenting in September : “If I was earning my money by hewing coal I would be very glad indeed to stop. But I’m not. “I’m swanning round the world looking at the most fabulously interesting things. “Such good fortune!”‘SURELY WORKING TOGETHER WE ARE POWERFUL ENOUGH TO SAVE THIS PLANET’ SIR DAVID TOLD COP CONFERENCEAt the COP summit in Glasgow on November  last year, Sir David Attenborough called on world leaders and climate change activists to be “motivated by hope rather than fear” to avoid climate catastrophe.Speaking in front of an audience that included the US president, Joe Biden, at the conference’s opening ceremony, the broadcaster and naturalist said humanity was “already in trouble”.He also appealed to the political leaders and heads of state gathered for the two-week summit to commit to holding global temperature rises to .C above pre-industrial levels, the lower of two limits set out in the  Paris climate agreement.Sir David said: “Everything we have achieved in the last , years has been enabled because of the [climate] stability during this time.“The global temperature has not wavered over this period by more than either plus or minus one degree Celsius – until now. We are already in trouble. The stability we all depend on is breaking.“This story is one of inequality as well as instability. Today, those who have done the least to cause this problem are among those to be hardest hit. Ultimately, all of us will feel the impact, some of which is unavoidable.“Is this how our story is due to end “A tale of the smartest species doomed by that all too human characteristic of failing to see the bigger picture in pursuit of short-term goals ”He added his voice to increasingly growing calls for world leaders to thrash out a commitment to the .C temperature limit and called on young people to “rewrite our story”.“Perhaps the fact that the people most affected by climate change are no longer some imagined future generation but young people alive today, perhaps that will give us the impetus we need to rewrite our story.“To turn this tragedy into a triumph – we are after all the greatest problem solvers to have ever existed on Earth. We now understand this problem, we know how to stop the number rising and put it in reverse.“We must recapture billions of tonnes of carbon from the air.”Attenborough also highlighted that “no nation has completed its development because no advanced nation is yet sustainable”, and demanded “all nations have a good standard of living and a modest [carbon] footprint”.He concluded: “The people alive now and the generation to come will look at this conference and consider one thing – did the number stop rising and start to drop as a result of commitments made here  “There’s every reason to believe that the answer can be yes. “If working apart we are forces powerful enough to destabilise our planet, surely working together we are powerful enough to save it.”The Green Planet is available to watch on the BBC iPlayer.A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.This mindset was evident in the first phase of the pandemic, until it became clear that few western nations had handled Covid strikingly well. The UK did get much of its early response badly wrong but then became a global leader in terms of vaccine development and rollout.Yet when there was a flow of articles in Ireland, or penned by Irish authors in UK papers, attacking London’s handling of the pandemic, there was no reaction in Britain.You might say this is a reflection of British arrogance, and that is partly true . But it is noticed in informed circles, where the lack of response is rooted in an intuitive understanding that Ireland can attack Britain but by goodness Britain can’t attack Ireland.ImagineIreland was perceived to be wrong on a major matter of public policy, and British commentators said so publicly and repeatedly in media on either side of the Irish Sea. I have never seen that happen, and do not expect to see it.Thus the truth is almost the opposite of the caricature: far from the UK believing in its greatness, it is full of self criticism, while it is Ireland that can act superior. Its president, Michael D Higgins, illustrates this double standard. It is often said that he has done much for reconciliation, which is true in that he has attended a range of ceremonies that show respect for all traditions, including the British and unionist ones. But he talks ashe has an entrenched belief in the historical moral goodness of Ireland and the wrongness of Britain. From time to time he wants to scold us about it.Observers this week, such as the artist Brian John Spencer, have pointed out how inappropriate it is that the head of state of a country which has a school system dominated by the Catholic church should lecture us in Northern Ireland on integrated education.If he was going to attack separate education in NI, why did he not single out the Catholic church for criticism  People talk about Catholic and Protestant schools but as far back as the s, when I was in class, many so-called Protestant schools were schools with a distant church origin that had long since become largely secular and mixed.Schools with a religiously mixed intake were somewhat atypical in that they tended to be grammar schools with many middle class pupils. Even so, it was a trend that has become marked with time. Some such ‘Protestant’ schools in greater Belfast have a : pupil mix.To this day few Catholic schools have that level of integration.Aside from the odd grumble, unionists or British people say little in response to the judgemental speeches from President Higgins.It is hard to imagine a British royal uttering any historical criticism of Ireland. Or even a UK cabinet minister doing so, let alone repeatedly making such speeches.Patience with President Higgins did briefly snap over the Armagh centenary service. An event that was made so neutral that it barely mentioned Northern Ireland, and certainly did not dare to celebrate it, was nonetheless too much of a recognition of NI for him.Yet his criticism over the years has kept coming: he turned down an invite to an RIC memorial he instructed unionists to be generous over  he said Britain must face up to its history of reprisals he accused Britain of feigned amnesia over imperialism of not treating the Irish as equals over the famine for its handling of an Indian mutiny.Here is a suggestion to President Higgins. If he is going to impart his views so freely, andhe is keen on reconciliation, then surprise us. Talk about Troubles statistics, and acknowledge the unionist wound, particularly in border areas, at the fact that republicans killed twice as many people as anyone , and often fled to a Republic that would not extradite them.If that is too stark a topic, then speak of the good things, such as the lingering British cultural and physical infrastructure in the Republic — the architecture or the system of laws and parliamentary democracy.• Ben Lowryis News Letter editor• Ben Lowry: Northern Ireland again escapes extreme weather as Storm Eunice passesOther opinion articles here:• Henry McDonald: Fans on both sides of ide agree that football stadiums are a disgrace• Lord Empey: It is right and proper that the victims of Bloody Friday terror are commemorated• Anna Faro: Big surge in empty pews just another problem for churches that were already struggling pre-pandemic• Ben Habib: This is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea border• Ruth Dudley Edwards: Doug Beattie’s engagement policy gets a boost from Alliance• Letter: The RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bomb"},{"url":null,"title":"henry mcdonald fans on both sides agree football stadiums are a disgrace ","story":"Unionists should join forces with Bloody Sunday families   Storm Franklin : Heres what the next storm is called after Storm Eunice - and when it could hit the UKNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionHenry McDonald: Fans on both sides of ide agree that football stadiums are a disgraceThe Irish League may have scored an important victory over the Sinn Fein Communities Minister when it emerged on Thursday night that Deirdre Hargey may write to fellow ministers to unlock £. million to refurbish grounds.By Henry McDonaldSaturday, th February , : amUpdated Saturday, th February , : am  \"       \"  Children play at a dilapidated Solitude stadium where Henry McDonald is a lelong Cltonville fan. There was better value football matches there some days than from highly paid stars at Goodison ParkBefore that announcement it appeared that Irish football clubs were going to lose the multi-million scheme that could have redeveloped local stadia.The minister’s initial decision to halt the funding while at the same approving of millions to redevelop the GAA’s Casement Park in west Belfast came under fierce criticism within the local football community.However, some of that criticism clouded the real issue and indeed the cause of the Irish League by suggesting her original determination was motivated by sectarianism. Because it clunkily characterised the policy as one of pitting the allegedly Catholic-Nationalist GAA against an allegedly Protestant-Nationalist Irish Football community. Which to those who follow and love the Irish League is an objectionable, inaccurate stereotyping of the local sport.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.An interest declaration at this stage: I am a lelong Cltonville supporter who can still remember the darker days when the Troubles in Northern Ireland cast a shadow over the game. I recall a time when going to matches away from home was often physically perilous and when you could be subjected to attacks involving hand grenades courtesy of the UFF, bricks, bottles, steel so-called ‘Chinese darts’ and even hot coals chucked over us by irate grannies.On top of the physical violence and threats there was the ubiquitous sectarian chanting and abuse which lasted for decades.In fairness and in total honesty some of us were not blameless angels either and I am still ashamed of aspects of my own teenage behaviour following the Reds at certain fixtures in the late s and early to mid s.Mercully those days have faded far into the past and the atmosphere around grounds in the st century across Northern Ireland has been generally become de-toxied.The Irish League and the IFA have a code of conduct outlawing sectarian and racial abuse, which by and large the overwhelming majority of fans adhere to. Hooliganism is an extreme rarity and even when there is an odd outbreak of thuggery the fan bases condemn it without equivocation.In relation to the other important stuff – the quality of the football on the pitch – there has been a marked improvement over the last  years or more in the pace, passing and moving in Irish League games.A few weeks ago, on some rare days off I watched for nostalgia purposes reruns of ‘The Big Match’ on ITV. One of the most striking things about revisiting topflightclashes between the likes of West Ham and Spurs in the s was how much slower the tempo of even English elite football was the time.It also hit me thatyou could time travel one of the current leading Irish League football teams back to land-of-the-seventies given their pacey play they could give these top English sides from those days a real run for their money on the field.Whatever side you support at whichever level in Irish League football there is plenty to be proud of about the local game these days. As someone who has spent far too many tears and treasure watching often disinterested multi-millionaire English Premiership footballers sometimes casually lose games in the most lucrative league in the world the Irish League by contrast gives the ordinary fan real value for money.For instance, I remember one scintillating Saturday afternoon at Solitude attending a thrilling - draw with Linfield about a decade ago. Later that evening I sailed across the Irish Sea for the Merseyside derby which ended the next day in a drab - draw.The entrance fee at the North Belfast stadium cost £ while it was the guts of £ to enter Goodison Park  hours later. I know which game I was short changed in.The one aspect of Irish League football which is still a crying shame is the dilapidated nature of so many of stadia. From decaying, rotting stands like the old main stand at Solitude to the vile toilets at other grounds across Northern Ireland the state of the stadiums has long been a disgrace. Fans regardless of their religious or political allegiances were and are united in seeing a province wide upgrade of their grounds.The £. million initially promised to transform these grounds was aimed at giving supporters decent surroundings to watch their teams in safety, comfort, and dignity. The Northern Ireland Football League’s tenacious campaign under Gerard Lawlor may finally have paid idends. However, to depict that struggle was one tainted by sectarianism is to dengrate that achievement.  To refract that battle through the prism of sectarian ision was something clubs and their fans didn’t need in forcing the minister’s U-turn.Other opinion articles here:• Ben Lowry: Surprise us President Higgins, say something nice about Britain• Lord Empey: It is right and proper that the victims of Bloody Friday terror are commemorated• Anna Faro: Big surge in empty pews just another problem for churches that were already struggling pre-pandemic• Ben Habib: This is no time for unionist weakness on the Irish Sea border• Ruth Dudley Edwards: Doug Beattie’s engagement policy gets a boost from Alliance• Letter: The RUC did not help in the aftermath of the McGurk’s bar bomb"},{"url":null,"title":"christopher stalford political rivals praise for tireless mla ","story":"We are still opposed to the Northern Ireland Protocol, insists DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson   Breaking: DUP MLA Christopher Stalford dies aged NewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsPeopleChristopher Stalford: political rivals’ praise for ‘tireless’ representativeRivals from across the political spectrum have paid tribute to DUP MLA Christopher Stalford following his death aged .By Mark RaineySunday, th February , : pmUpdated Sunday, th February , : pm  \"       \"  Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said he was shocked and saddened at the news.“This is absolutely shocking and tragic and shocking news which will be felt by every single person who worked at Stormont,” he said.“In addition to his duties as an MLA, Christopher Stalford was a Principal Deputy Speaker and his role was to ensure the smooth running of the business of the Chamber, which he did expertly and with good humour.   \" fill\"#ea\"   to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

Just this week, we discussed his eldest child’s school transfer and it is dficult to put into words my shock, sadness and devastation just days later we are discussing his passing.“He was a genuine and funny person, who was dedicated to public service.

He just loved politics and engagement with the public and he was an excellent barometer of where public opinion within unionism rested.”He said a “shadow of loss” hangs over the party.Mr Paisley added: “He rose very quickly through the ranks of the party achieving electoral success and ultimately making the South Belfast assembly seat his own. He was cut out for the deputy speaker role and would have no doubt climbed to higher office.“I last spoke to Chris in the middle of the past week after his appearance on the media.

There is a coastal walk, chance to go fishing, surfing and views of Tusker Rock.For those owners who may not yet have ventured to the beach with their pups or are concerned about behaviour while at the beach, Wood Green’s dog behaviour and training specialist, Wendy Kruger, has provided some tips to prepare your dog for the beach.• Ensure your dog’s microchip and collar tag details are up to date – just in case.• Get used to checking ground surface temperatures before you take your dog out, as dry sand can be too hot for dogs’ paws on sunny days. To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

Women are more likely to ditch their partner than their pet, found a poll for nationwide pet retailer Jollyes. Asked about their relationship with their partner and their pet and which one they would ditch first,  per cent said they would ditch their partner against  per cent who would ditch their pet. Men were more loyal to their partners, with  per cent saying they would ditch their pet and  per cent saying they would ditch their partner. Overall,  per cent would ditch their partner first and  per cent said the pet would go first. The study was carried out by Jollyes to gauge humans’ attitudes to romance and relationships as it launches the search on social media for a canine couple to take part in a romantic dinner for two at its doggy dates diner, “C’est Jollyes”, open for one day only on  February at its Runcorn store in Cheshire . Two dogs will get the chance to enjoy a three course dinner featuring a menu from Jollyes Artisan Lestage range including angus beef with sweet potato, venison and salmon, and duck with sweet potato. The survey showed some big dferences in attitudes to pets and partners around the UK. People in North East England were more likely to ditch their partnerover their pet, followed by London , Northern Ireland , South West . [See table in editor’s notes below for regional breakdown.] Owners were asked what they loved most about their pets, with loyalty, unconditional love, loving nature, affection and a warm heart among the qualities cited. No matter how much love an animal gives, most pet ownerswould prefer a romantic Valentine’s night with their partner than one spent with their pet. Of male respondents,  per cent chose a night with their partner, compared with  per cent of female respondents. The figures were broadly similar across the country. Among the other popular traits cited by pet owners were: “they are so loyal and loving. And cute!” “unconditional love and loyalty” “they comfort me when I’m feeling blue” “doesnt argue or answer back” “they always cheer me up” “waggy tail and warm heart” and “her loving nature, always there for me when I need her”. One said: “Sometimes playful, sometimes cuddly, intelligent, independent, sometimes dangerous. All rather like my partner really.” Not everyone was totally enamoured with their pet. One said: “Nothing, it hates me, only loves my we”. And not all pets’ traits would make for a romantic night out – one said: “hassle free”, another said “doesn’t answer back” and one said “it’s a tortoise and he’s as indferent to use as we are to him”. Phil Turner-Naylor, head of marketing at Jollyes, said: “We’re known as a nation of animal lovers and this goes to prove it. When it comes to relationships, a lot people would choose their pet over their partner. “The good news for romantics though is that a big majority choose people over pets. What it does show, especially for men, is that partners have to work hard to keep the romance going or they might find themselves in the dog house. Women are looking for a romantic night with their partner on Valentine’s, butthe men don’t get it right, they had better watch out.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbeffeadecce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdfbadabc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"},{"url":"http://www.tyronecon.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/1645089617694.jpg--1_700_people_apply_for_a_life_less_ordinary_with_stena_line.jpg?164508961700","title":"  people apply for a life less ordinary with stena line ","story":"Ferry company Stena Line has been overwhelmed with the positive response from the public to its recent recruitment campaign ‘A Le Less Ordinary’, which aims to fill  vacant positions onboard its Irish Sea ferries. , applications were received from people across the UK and Republic of Ireland. The campaign promoted the unique nature of le onboard, with % time-off providing the perfect work-le balance for people wanting to live and work onboard for either a one or two-week sht and then spend equal time off. The positions available are part of the Onboard Sales and Servicesteam, with vacancies for service assistants and chefs. With January being the traditional time of the year when many people look for a new career, Stena Line had hoped for a favourable response but even the most optimistic of predictions could not have expected it to be so over-subscribed. Stena Line has now undertaken the initial stage of the selection process and, for the first-time, is hosting two Open Days for prospective candidates on Monday th February, where they will get a chance to meet members of Stena Line’s crews. The Open Days are taking place in Belfast and Birkenhead with the latter being held onboard one of Stena Line’s newest ferries, Stena Edda, giving candidates a chance to get a first-hand taste of le onboard on the Irish Sea. Stephen Bryden, Stena Line’s Head of Onboard Sales and Services, commented on the success of the campaign: “I am astonished by the public’s response to the A Le Less Ordinary recruitment campaign. We have never received so many applications. It really goes to show how many people are attracted to a le at sea with a company like Stena Line. Now our HR team has the challenge of how to sort and interview so many applicants, but that is a nice challenge to have. Thank you to every single person that has applied to work with us.”  addthis,     Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_bbeffeadecce   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_fdfbadabc   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]      []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
