With women only allowed to have one birth partner and home births restricted for a time, I spoke to women and men about how having a baby during lockdown has been for them and their new families. The project is ongoing.”Misgalla lives in south London and has been a doula for 4 years. She’s currently supporting Cath, who has undergone solo IVF, via Zoom.“I’ll be Cath’s birth partner, I’ve been supporting her since November. Sometimes doulas don’t do very much at all, but just seeing someone else’s face is enough, especially while pregnant women are in self-isolation.”Rooney lives in south London but is currently self-isolating in Bedford with her sister and brother-in-law and their three sons.“I was 42 when I started talking about IVF with friends. Once I’d decided, it all happened pretty quickly. A friend and I got pizza and a bottle of prosecco one night and went through the website.“Michele and I did a lot of the preparation together and she was there during the birth, looking after me.“Gaspar looks just like his cousin Jude when he was a baby, he feels like a total Rooney. Grandma and granddad are besotted. We Zoom with them every few days.”Kara has been a doula since 2017, supporting Becky and her daughter Silver, four weeks old, who live in Wirral.“I started supporting Becky on the day of her C-section, from when she went to hospital to immediately after the birth. Mums need a lot more support in the first week, then it gradually tapers off. Hopefully I’ll get to visit when lockdown’s over. It’ll be lovely to see them in person.”Thando has been a doula for seven years, supporting women around London and Bristol and attending hundreds of births.“It was horrible not being able to attend Colleen and Joe’s birth. I spoke to them on video call, but environment is everything in birth – you need intimacy and privacy. I haven’t met James and Juliet yet, we’ve had a telephone chat and a video chat instead of meeting face to face. I’ve been working with them since March.“We mother the mothers. Birth is really simple, we just overcomplicate it. Being a doula is such a beautiful thing.”Colleen McKeever, 39, and Joe Weber, 36, with baby Mae, born 26 MarchFrom the US, McKeever and Weber relocated from New York to north London three years ago. Thando has been their doula since February. McKeever and Mae were in hospital for eight days following her birth.Weber: “Mae was in intensive care for the first few days because she had jaundice. We’d meet up in NICU during the day, then Colleen would go back to her room and I’d come home and play Nintendo. I delivered supplies to Colleen in the days after. We could meet downstairs but not with Mae. Colleen held her up to the window for me.”Emily de Groot and Rashid Ariori with twins Maya and Joshua, born 21 March“My mum was going to come for a couple of weeks to help – that’s been hard because our families haven’t met them yet. My brother might come on Sunday and wave through the window.”Leah Bedwood, 35, south London, whose baby is due at the end of June‘I am determined to have a home birth with the sisterhood around me, women who are experienced birth keepers who’ve had their own children – my mum, my sister, my aunt – and my partner. At the moment my local hospital have suspended their home birthing service. They should be up and running again by the end of June, so hopefully the baby waits!“I had a socially distanced baby shower. I saw balloons and then suddenly this convoy of cars started coming down the road! We played games, everyone was guessing the sex of the baby, we had a bit of music, sweets. That was probably the nearest to having a social connection with people. It was a surprise, I really appreciated it.”Reyhan Akyıldız-Gladstone, 31, Jack Gladstone, 30, and Aphra, born 16 MarchAkyıldız-Gladstone: “We had Aphra at home 10 days before they shut down the local home birth team. She was born at 9am on the day everyone started working from home. I was quite aware that everyone was around in their houses! I went into labour at 4.30am and by 10am we were in bed and everyone had gone. Everything happened at a crazy pace.“We have no idea when our parents are going to meet her. My dad lives in Turkey – he had flights to come over but they were cancelled.“It’s had advantages, getting to know her and her getting to know us. The three of us have our little routine.”James Dow, 36, and Juliet Cochrane, 34, east London, who are expecting a girl on 21 JuneCochrane: “It’s definitely going to be different. The grandparents and siblings will have to self-isolate for two weeks when she’s born, and even then they might not be able to hold her. They might, it’s so hard to know what the right thing to do is. There’s a real plus side in slowing down and having time to really plan and get things organised. It’s quite good for us as a family.”Nilufar Anwar, 35, Johan Bjerke, 38, and baby Alma, born 13 AprilAnwar: “At hospital, my midwife’s name was Rachel. I wouldn’t be able to recognise her again as she wore a mask the whole time. It’s strange to go through such an intimate, intense, life-changing experience with someone you can’t really see. I would have loved to have given her a hug. But the pandemic has given us time to do nothing but adore every move and sound that Alma makes, and slowly grow into our new role as parents.”Raquel Ruiz Tognetti, 40, with baby Leonardo, born 20 April“I’m a solo 40-year-old mum, and had a complicated delivery in the worst weeks of the pandemic. My parents were supposed to come and help, but they were stuck in lockdown in Venezuela. In hospital you could feel the fear in everyone. Since the delivery, things have been much better, but I’ve been weighing my baby at home as the midwife visits stopped. Sometimes I think Leonardo thinks I’m the only human on earth.”Helen Ward, 35, and Oli Evans, 37, with daughters Emily, 4, and Erin, born 19 MarchWard: “We feel a lot calmer now. the start of this was insane. I was so anxious, crying all the time, really stressed. Now Erin’s putting on weight, I feel better about things. Emily has been remarkably fine. So far only Oli’s sister has met Erin, no one else. Friends have come for distanced drive-by drinks and cuppas so they’ve only seen her from afar. The experience has been otherworldly at times. Erin isn’t registered with a birth certificate yet, so coupled with no one meeting her, it’s almost as if she doesn’t exist.”“It’s nerve-racking taking the bus to maternity appointments. Even though you have a mask on and other people have a mask on, you still feel on edge. My partner can’t come to any scans, so we’ve booked a private 4D one so he can see her.“I’ve mostly been worried about the baby when she’s here, I’m not worried about myself. I think her grandparents can meet her with a mask, not touch. Maybe everyone can meet her around Christmastime. Hopefully it’s over by Christmas!”Sherica Spence, 34, and baby Caleb, born 4 March“The morning we checked out of hospital, I heard them say they had two confirmed cases of coronavirus. I just wanted to go home. We saw family and friends for the two weeks before lockdown, but after that we couldn’t see anyone. Everyone made sure we had food in the house: toilet rolls, nappies and wipes.“That was weird, having to rely on people. I’m a person that does everything myself. Celeb’s dad thought he might have the coronavirus, so he was at his house, doing video calls, making sure we were OK. I’m just lucky that he’s a peaceful child. He’s so good!”Lena Buhler, 31, and Johnson Aboaba, 27, due 1 SeptemberBuhler: “We were supposed to travel for work over March, April and May, but that was all cancelled. The hardest thing is not having a routine – that can make you feel a bit lost. My mum would have come over from Switzerland during this time but instead she’s been ordering baby stuff to the house. After the initial worry and anxiety subsided, I’ve found this to be good for us as a couple. Johnson’s been good. It’s a strange time for him but he’s been very calm.”Nissa Moger, 36, with baby Indy, born on 8 April“Indy was born in hospital and we were home 12 hours later. We were planning a water birth at home, but at that time they’d stopped the service, so we went in. It wasn’t what I planned, but the midwives were brilliant.“I work at St Thomas’ on the labour ward as a midwife and I teach hypnobirthing. All the classes moved online in March as soon as they said mums were at risk. It’s worked really well. I think initially my clients were more anxious because it was the unknown, but they seem more settled now.”Tammy Woodhouse, 30, and Adam Woodhouse, 28, due 9 AugustTammy: “They announced the lockdown the night of our 20-week scan, so off we went to our appointment. There were signs up, but we didn’t really read them, we just went up, and they told Adam he couldn’t be there. We had no idea. I just sat in the waiting room crying! It was a shock.“They let me FaceTime Adam in the appointment, but it turned out I had my hand over the microphone the whole time! In the first trimester I was sick quite a lot, but the second one’s been an absolute dream. I’m a little bit sad I had to spend it indoors.“I’ve deleted all my news apps – that was probably the best thing. I think it was just watching the numbers go up and up and feeling completely helpless.”Esther and Shahin Najafipour, both 31, with baby Milo, born 21 MayEsther: “I was in hospital for two days when I had him. No visitors were allowed. I work as a costume maker for film and had made 85 pairs of scrubs for the local hospitals while I was on furlough. Some of the nurses were wearing ones from the same batch. The midwife that delivered him was wearing some.”Shahin: “Normally, I would get two weeks’ paternity leave, so I’d go back next week, which doesn’t seem that much. It was kind of a blessing to be home as well and help where needed.”Farah Habibi, 28, and Faisal Imadi, 27, two-year-old Araaz and baby Zaayan, born 6 MarchHabibi: “Zayaan was born two weeks before the lockdown. My mum stayed for two weeks, then I sent her home. She would usually have stayed with me a lot longer. We FaceTime with her and my sister everyday.“My sister’s been dropping food outside the flat for us. We were self-isolating with him, but I’ve started going in the garden now. Today was the first proper walk I did with Araaz – he mostly goes out with his dad.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dec791e349f45c63f9abc884b054c47183d09240/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=580183158b26734cb0dce8608feddbe0","title":"monkey christ worst art repairs of all time","story":"As another religious painting restoration goes horribly wrong, we take a look at some of the finest examples of butchered statues, art installations and frescoes In the latest instalment of the greatest genre of art news – and I write that as a lover of art – another restoration has gone awry. The word “awry” is being generous.This is the revelation that a private collector, based in Valencia, paid €1,200  (£1,070) for a restoration job on baroque painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo’s Immaculate Conception of Los Venerables. It is no longer immaculate. It now looks like an e-fit issued by a local police force, with those thin eyebrows popular in the 90s. What’s more, the restorer (who it turns out was a furniture restorer by trade) made two attempts – the second significantly worse than the first. That one, the e-fit one, has the Virgin Mary staring straight ahead, which isn’t even the same position as the original, which has Mary looking to the heavens.Fernando Carrera, a professor at the Galician School for the Conservation and Restoration of Cultural Heritage, referring to the latest artwork to be botched in Spain, told the : “I don’t think this guy – or these people – should be referred to as restorers. Let’s be honest: they’re bodgers who botch things up. They destroy things.”If there is one saving grace, though I doubt the owner would agree, the painting was Murillo’s copy of an earlier painting of his in oil, created sometime between 1660 and 1665.There’s now a call for a change in the law to prevent non-trained restorers attempting such cleanup jobs. But Spain isn’t the only nation to suffer similar accidents, despite being home to the greatest one of all time. Here are some of the best worst restorations in art.I mentioned the best one of all time, and it is impossible not to begin with it. In 2012, 81-year-old Cecilia Giménez, with the best of intentions, trashed a fresco painted in about 1930 by Elías García Martínez, entitled Ecce Homo (Behold the Man), in a church in Borja, Spain.The fresco became known as Behold the Monkey, and Monkey Christ, because of its newly simian features. Jesus’s crown of thorns had also been transformed into what resembled a Russian ushanka hat, with an added vibe of Van Gogh’s Self Portrait with Bandaged Ear. Plus an added border to look like a scroll, a little like an early Microsoft Word feature.Giménez maintains she had permission from the priest to get her brushes out, but that is disputed by others. She has always insisted that it was only because she went on holiday mid-job, and the painting wasn’t finished, that it looks as it does. Brutally, her granddaughter threw her under the bus saying: “She had just painted the tunic. The problem started when she painted on the head as well. She has destroyed this painting.”The disfigurement is hilarious in its awfulness, but invasive press scrutiny took a toll on Giménez’s health. Now, however, Giménez says when she looks at her work she sees only positives. It continues to bring others joy too the botched Ecce Homo is now one of Borja’s main tourist attractions, thought to have brought in close to 200,000 visitors. It has raised tens of thousands of euros for the church and also for charity, and spawned a documentary, Fresco Fiasco, as well as a multitude of merchandise. So much so that Giménez has called for a slice of the profits. Her own work also sells for higher sums than before.“They didn’t let me finish,” Giménez later told Spanish daily El País. And we’re all grateful for that, because it is perfect just as it is.In 2001, Damien Hirst, already famous for his formaldehyde works, opened a new exhibition at London’s Eyestorm gallery, Painting-by-Numbers. This included an array of half-empty beer bottles and coffee cups, overflowing ashtrays and old newspapers arranged – but looking strewn – across the gallery.That is until cleaner Emmanuel Asare cleared it all away, thinking it was detritus from the launch party the night before. Asare said: “As soon as I clapped eyes on it I sighed because there was so much mess. I didn’t think for a second that it was a work of art – it didn’t look much like art to me. So I cleared it all into bin bags and dumped it.”Gallery staff scoured through the rubbish and saved, well, the rubbish, and “restored” the installation from photographs. Hirst, for his part, found the whole thing amusing, calling it “fantastic” and “very funny”. Happily, Asare faced no repercussions.Then-editor of the art newspaper the Jackdaw, though, said that: “If it doesn’t look like a work of art, you can’t blame people for getting rid of it. It is actually not difficult to replace it. Anything of seriously lasting value would be irreplaceable.”But Hirst’s work was estimated to have sold for a six-figure sum. Next up, possibly: someone tries to make Tracey Emin’s My Bed.Spain again, where a 500-year-old wooden effigy of St George was, um, improved upon, in a church in the town of Estella. The result was something along the lines of a character who wouldn’t look out of place in a Noddy cartoon. Who was also stoned.The restorer has never officially been identified, but the mayor of Estella said that the council of the region was not consulted beforehand and he was unimpressed, tweeting: “Estella isn’t in the news because of its spectacular historical, artistic, architectural or cultural heritage.” Accompanying the tweet was a picture from the local paper headlined: “Navarra’s own Ecce Homo”.Eventually, the government’s cultural department stepped in and the council paid €34,000 to have a professional restoration of the restoration job, using the traditional methods of x-rays and research from photographs. The original botchers were fined €6,000 for their efforts.I suppose setting out to sculpt a statue of someone as vain as the Portuguese footballer Cristiano Ronaldo is always going to be a hiding to nothing, but Emanuel Santo’s 2017 effort to garnish Madeira airport – newly renamed after the star – was … quite something. That something was widely ridiculed (which, again, it would be nice if this could somehow be done in a kinder way than outright abuse). With its goofy, lopsided smile and loopy eyes, the bust looked nothing like Ronaldo, and even more so, looked entirely unhinged.Both Ronaldo himself and Portugal’s president, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, were present at the grand and unintentionally hilarious unveiling. Ronaldo himself had apparently been happy with the bust, but had asked for some wrinkles to be removed around his (mad) eyes.Responding to the rest to the criticism, Santo said: “It is impossible to please the Greeks and Trojans. Neither did Jesus please everyone.”Still, Santo accepted a challenge from the football website Bleacher Report to give the much maligned bust a do-over a year later. But unfortunately by this time people had become fond of kooky Ronaldo and the update, while still looking nothing whatsoever like Ronaldo, was boring with zero personality and the consensus was that the first was better.“Look, they are both bad sculptures,” Eddy Frankel wrote in the . “The first one is ludicrous, the second one is bland. But at least the first one is an honest representation of the artist’s intentions.”Three butcherings for the price of one! You probably don’t need me to tell you the name of the country where these 2018 masterly transformations occurred of a trinity of late 15th-century statues. But I will say that the region was called Asturias, and the village itself Rañadoiro.As you can see, the outcome of this particular “freshening up” was the kind of makeup slathered on in a dark club mirror before emerging, blinking into the light, looking like the filling of a Victoria sponge.Frustratingly, the statues had been lovingly – and importantly, professionally – restored 15 years prior. Luis Suárez Saro, who did that job, gave his opinion of the update: “They’ve used the kind of industrial enamel paint they sell for painting anything and absolutely garish and absurd colours. The result is just staggering. You don’t know whether to laugh or cry.”The dab hand or not so dab hand who elicited that reaction was María Luisa Menéndez, a tobacco shop owner who was again good-intentioned and thought the statues looked dull.“I painted them as best I could using what I thought were the right colours. The neighbours liked them too. Ask around here and you’ll find out.”“I’m not a professional painter,” she confirmed, unnecessarily.Not strictly works of art, but they certainly became them after their restorations. A doubly whammy of castles, just like the trips your mum dragged you on. The first, the 2,000-year-old Ocakli Ada castle, in Şile near Istanbul, Turkey, became a social media sensation in 2015 when its restoration left it a dead ringer for the cartoon character SpongeBob SquarePants. It’s unclear whether this was the original intention, but one strongly suspects not. It was even criticised by the opposition party in the Turkish parliament.Back in, you guessed it, Spain, the Matrera Castle in Villamartín was restored by architect Carlos Quevedo Rojas for hundreds of thousands of euros. The only problem was that the crumbling edifice ended up looking like an Ikea Billy bookcase. It was variously described as “a barbarity” , “truly lamentable” and “a massacre of Spanish heritage”. Which, as reviews go, aren’t great. But hey, at least it elicited a (horrified) response.To end with, another laugh-out-loud effort. This time courtesy of Ontario, Canada. The head of a statue of baby Jesus which was apparently often lopped off and left “rolling around on the ground” was stolen by vandals in 2015 (no, I’m not sure why either). But local artist Heather Wise stepped in with a generous offer to restore the decapitated statue, which stood outside the Ste Anne des Pins Catholic church.Wise said she had never worked with stone before, but had studied sculpture at a local college. “To do a statue of baby Jesus for a church is like an honour of my entire art career,” she said. Unfortunately, the results were … surprising. An entirely random terracotta head, which many likened to Maggie Simpson, but also looked a bit like a gremlin, was added, and which soon started melting away in the rain.A kind commenter on a news site remarked: “Since nobody knows what Jesus looked like, what difference does it make?” Others were not so keen. Brilliantly, after the new head was unveiled, the thief even returned the original head. By this time, however, the parish priest had grown fond of what has also been described as a “demonic hedgehog”. It was returned to Wise, though, who said she wanted it back because it had become her “most famous piece of art”. You can certainly see why."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f54ed507203aabe0b98e339d917da33deed420fe/43_81_2915_1749/master/2915.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cdb19a41fc94e32a182f340d362d7234","title":"prince parade cherry moon jeff katz best photograph","story":"‘I took this on the Cote d’Azur where he was filming Under the Cherry Moon surrounded by megastars. He put some music on and said he was good to go. I didn’t have time to be nervous’Early in the autumn of 1985, Prince’s assistant called me and said: “Prince would like you to come to France to be his personal photographer for the new film he’s making.” I packed my bags and jumped on a plane the next day to Studio La Victorine on the French Riviera, to document the filming of Under the Cherry Moon, Prince’s directorial debut. I was only 25 at the time. To this day, I think it’s one of the craziest things I’ve ever done.It wasn’t my first time working with Prince. A few months earlier, Warner Brothers asked me to help him put together the album artwork for some of the smaller bands he was working with. I was mostly shooting his proteges – not Prince himself – but we got to know each other and I learned what he liked.I had shot a few concerts, some bands, but no real celebrities. Then there I was, in the Cote d’Azur, surrounded by megastars. Warner Brothers had assembled the most star-studded crew you could think of: Academy award winners, the best cinematographers in the world, the best set designers – everybody you could imagine was there.I arrived a week before filming got under way and I was in awe. Being in this place where Truffaut had made a number of his films with some of the leading lights of cinema felt like I was witnessing something legendary.There were some technical things like locations and lighting and sets that were still being worked out, so I thought I’d have time to soak it in. I soon learned that Prince didn’t like his time to be idle. He was constantly at work, whether it was playing, recording, shooting a music video or a photo session. In the first week, his assistant announced that the formal photo shoot would take place that day. Two hours later, I was shooting Prince.I didn’t have time to be nervous. The focus that kicked in was what I imagine people who do extreme sports feel. You know if you falter for even a second you will fail. So I focused, intently, and made sure I got what I needed.He led me towards a huge soundstage and we decided to keep things simple: I set up a white background with some unfussy lighting. I was fascinated by stripped-back portraiture at the time so I knew I wanted an image with nothing getting in the way. Prince let hair and makeup fuss over him, and then sent them all out of the room when he was ready. He put some music on a small boombox, and told me he was good to go. Within three rolls of film, I knew I had the shot.I captured exactly what I set out to achieve: something simple, dramatic and iconic. The way the delicacy of his face offsets the muscularity of his stomach and the drama of his hand gestures makes this photo special for me. It ended up on the cover of his album Parade.It was the start of more than a decade photographing Prince. I’ve worked with people of immense talent throughout my career, but nobody compares to him. Prince was Prince from the moment he woke up to the moment he went to sleep: he was meticulous in his art at every moment. Not once did I see him lose his temper or cause a scene, and working with him over such a long time frame allowed me to witness him in so many different iterations. Every year would herald a whole new reinvention, both in his aesthetic and his sound.We parted ways in 1996. It was an amicable split. I didn’t hear from him for years, but we caught up in the early 2010s about making new work. Then, inevitably, he got swept on to a different project, and we never had chance to reconnect after that.When I heard the news of his passing, I didn’t believe it. It sounds absurd, but I just didn’t believe he would die. The man was so endlessly creative that it was impossible to imagine his death. I spent 11 years of my life photographing him. Now, I hope my archive captures something of his inimitable creativity.• Limited-edition prints from Jeff Katz’s archive of Prince are available from his website, princebyjeffkatz.Trained: BA in film and cinema, Ithaca College, New York State.High point: “Being able to do what I love every day.”Low point: “The death of film.”Top tip: “Slow down, think more about your shot, and make something that makes people stop scrolling.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5b7a3a686f3fee2b41a3a7eacac4b74be49e39a/0_159_3378_2027/master/3378.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1117e21718935dd1d8cd9461c2710586","title":"grace jones jagger gaga and more music legends in pictures","story":"From Bowie outtakes to early shots of Rihanna and Amy Winehouse, these rare prints are being sold to support the entertainment industry during Covid-19 and fight racial injustice"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f7bffd882daf4050af551e3a393d3c696b824885/0_1_5141_3084/master/5141.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=30aaeeb06d42a2c0e89a436de94724fa","title":"ben and jerrys joins facebook advertising boycott racism","story":"Brands including North Face, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Patagonia pulling out in July over hate speech policing Facebook will be confronted with its largest ever advertiser boycott in July, as a coalition of some of America’s biggest brands, including The North Face, Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s and Patagonia, commit to pulling advertising from the platform in a row over its policing of hate speech.The boycott has been coordinated by the campaign group Stop Hate for Profit, set up after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which put out a call to businesses “to stand in solidarity with our most deeply held American values of freedom, equality and justice and not advertise on Facebook’s services in July”.Ben \u0026amp Jerry’s, a Unilever brand known for its social activism, became the latest advertiser to join the campaign on Wednesday, pulling all advertising in the US, as Facebook stared down another wave of criticism for its inaction over hate speech on its site. Three outdoor clothing firms – The North Face, Patagonia and Rei – announced this week that they were removing their adverts from Facebook and Instagram.In a repeat of the crisis that began the boycott, a tweet posted by Donald Trump has again been declared “abusive” by Twitter, yet left up on Facebook.Facebook’s perceived refusal to apply its moderation policies against Trump has been widely criticised. In early June, when it preserved a post from the president declaring “when the looting starts, the shooting starts”, civil rights leaders condemned its CEO Mark Zuckerberg for his refusal to acknowledge the context of the message.The three activist leaders – the heads of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and Color of Change – met Zuckerberg, the chief executive of Facebook, and Sheryl Sandberg, its chief operating officer.Vanita Gupta, Sherrilyn Ifill and Rashad Robison said in a statement: “He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump’s call for violence against protesters. Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook.”Facebook’s failure to act prompted the call from Stop Hate for Profit, a coalition of groups including the NAACP, Color of Change, and Sleeping Giants, a non-profit organisation that campaigns against advertisers spending on hate sites.The group has a series of demands for Facebook that go beyond taking down Trump’s posts and include removing “all ads from content labeled as misinformation or hate”.As well as receiving support from large advertisers, the group has been backed by a number of ad agencies, and many smaller advertisers. 360i, a digital advertising subsidiary of the Japanese group Dentsu, last week advised all clients to support the boycott, while the boutique New York agency Pearmill made the same call earlier in the month. Facebook generates nearly $70bn (£56bn) a year in advertising revenue.Joy Howard, chief marketing officer of the password manager Dashlane, one of the participants in the boycott, said: “Facebook is not committed to change.

Infections have fallen steadily from a peak in April, but Britain is still recording more new cases than other big European nations. As of 23 June, 8,309,929 tests had been carried out in total, of which 306,210 were positive. The number of daily deaths with Covid-19 has been falling. As of 22 June, in total, 42,927 people have died.Financial markets have risen in the past month amid rising hopes of a global economic recovery, as more countries around the world ease lockdown restrictions. Share prices did briefly slide into reverse in mid-June on fears of a second wave in China, as Beijing imposed travel restrictions. But the FTSE 100 has gained almost 200 points in the past month to reach 6,186, gradually recovering ground lost in March, when it collapsed further than any time since Black Monday in October 1987.Hopes of a rapid economic recovery as lockdown restrictions are lifted were boosted this month by surveys of business activity revealing a record rise in June. In the UK, the purchasing managers’ index, compiled from business surveys by IHS Markit and the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply, rose from 30 in May to 47.6 in June. Although that is still below the 50 mark that separates economic growth from contraction, the reading raised hopes for a rapid bounce back. The US economy also continued to shrink this month, but at a much slower rate than in May.

But above all, they made a few iniduals very richIt used to be a big day out for Mancunians: a shopping trip to the Trafford Centre, a stroll around its Barton Square fountain surrounded by dolphins, and a bite to eat in the Orient food hall, themed as a steam ship. Trips like that ground to a halt during lockdown, and now they may well never happen again. The Trafford Centre’s owner, Intu, which also owns the Lakeside shopping complex in Essex, has until Friday to reach a deal to save its centres, swamped by debt.If Intu fails, it will be more than the end of retail days out. It will bring down the curtain on an idea rooted in the Thatcher era: that the problems of post-industrial, urban Britain can be solved by a few government grants, carrier bags full of jumpers and trainers, and a pitstop for a pizza at one of the sparkly shopping malls built on the sites where industry used to employ thousands.The shopping centres were the longest lasting products of that world, often created by northern businessmen who spotted the potential of derelict sites, close to motorway connections and in their own localities, where factories and steelworks had been bulldozed.Some of these places took decades to open. The Trafford Centre was created by John Whittaker, who was from a mill-owning family. He fought a long battle to take over the Manchester Ship Canal Company in the 1980s, out of which eventually came the Trafford Centre, which helped make him a multimillionaire.Others got rich quicker. Take John Hall, son of a miner, and a former mining surveyor himself, who built Centre in Gateshead, which opened in 1986 on the site of the former Dunston power station near the River Tyne. Hall was typical of these shopping centre developers, with their chutzpah and charm. They convinced the Department for Environment and local authorities to put in enough money to make the deals work, and brought in financiers to provide the rest. In the case of Centre, it was the Church Commissioners who backed this temple to capitalism. Hundreds flocked there for its official opening – me included, in my role at the time as a business reporter. As I gazed around its 186,000 sq metres (2m sq ft) of retail space, clutching my gold embossed invitation card, Hall said to me proudly: “The buffet’s a quarter of a mile long.”Outside Sheffield, two developers as brash and breezy as Hall were fighting over who would succeed in creating South Yorkshire’s own version of Centre. Paul Sykes, another son of a miner and a tyre dealer-cum-property developer, and Eddie Healey, who worked in his family paint firm before running a DIY chain and MFI, both bought land off the M1, and eventually joined forces to create the 140,000 sq metre Meadowhall on the site of Hadfield’s former East Hecla steelworks.But what did they achieve? You could say they provided people with a lot of pleasure: places like Meadowhall, and Bluewater in Kent, built on an old quarry, each attract around 30 million visitors a year.Yet today those shopping centres look like the relics of a past quick fix to the problems thrown up by Thatcherism. Public money was used to help create low-skilled jobs fast, but failed to help the no-longer-needed smelters and welders train in new technologies. Local authorities, desperate to see some new employers and jobs emerge in their decimated industrial heartlands, backed public transport links to these new, out-of-town venues. But existing city centres, such as Sheffield’s, saw footfall drop dramatically and, despite the new tram and bus routes, most people drove to the centres’ free car parks. Green they were not. What they did above all was make iniduals – developers such as Hall, Sykes, Healey and Whittaker – very rich. In the case of Whittaker, he sold the Trafford Centre to Capital Shopping Centres, now Intu, in 2011. He joined the board and is now deputy chairman of Intu, which is one of Britain’s large property companies.Intu’s troubles had already started well before lockdown. But with evidence growing that people have been shopping nearer home and increasingly online in the past few months, the out-of-town habit may well have been shed for good. We may look back with some fondness to the days when we flexed the plastic during a shopping-centre splurge, but the planet may well breathe a sigh of relief if lockdown puts an end to these leftovers from the Thatcher era, and the future becomes local. The centres were a monument to that 80s revolution. It turns out they were built not to last.• Catherine Pepinster is a former editor of the Tablet"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c30a5f5743b02a98cfbde2e329ea6f32a6499887/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=23f26240c24fd0613c672840e7943b31","title":"germany coronavirus britain health spending test trace","story":"From health spending to test and trace, the German response to coronavirus has many lessons for the UK. Can we learn them?Rest assured that this is a column about politics, not football. Nevertheless the most resonant political insight of the week has come from Liverpool’s manager Jürgen Klopp, who has guided his team to the threshold of winning the Premier League. On the eve of the resumed 2019-20 football season, Liverpool’s German coach was asked last weekend whether he had ever worried about the dangers of the Covid-19 pandemic to the completion of the season. His answer was one to savour.“The problem I had,” replied Klopp, “was that I was getting the news from Germany as well as from England. I had no idea of the pandemic situation in Italy or France, but I do know exactly how it is in England and Germany, and an alien looking at it from outside would think we came from two different planets.”Klopp’s visiting alien will have been forced to stop and think this weekend after a surge of renewed coronavirus infections among workers in a North Rhine-Westphalia meat plant. But in the larger pandemic picture the difference between Planets Britain and Germany remains vast. Both are big and prosperous northern European countries, with Germany a bit bigger and a bit more prosperous. But that does not come close to explaining the gulf between the two countries’ overall performances in the face of Covid-19.By 23 June, according to official figures, Britain had sustained 306,210 confirmed cases of Covid-19, compared with Germany’s 190,862. In Britain 42,927 people had died from the virus. In Germany the figure on the same day stood at 8,895 deaths. In Britain, according to Johns Hopkins University data, the current death rate per 100,000 people stands at 64.27. In Germany, the rate is 10.73.It is a stunning difference. Germans have been six times less likely to die from Covid-19 than British people. What explains it? One underlying reason is that the UK’s health spending level per head of $4,000 is only approximately two-thirds that of Germany. Another more immediate one is that Germany was much quicker to lock down: most German schools closed from 13 March, a week before all parts of the UK shops and restaurants closed from 16 March, again a week before Britain. As a result, Germany was able to begin lifting parts of its lockdown at the end of April.Most importantly of all, Germany was much better prepared. This was true both of the German state and of German industry. Germany had a manufacturing sector capable of making the medical equipment the country needed. Its health spending had risen in real terms for most years since the millennium. Contact tracing was also well developed across the German health system before the pandemic and was able to swing into action straightaway. Germany had many more intensive care beds too 28,000, compared with Britain’s 4,000. Above all, German testing worked: while Britain abandoned mass testing in March, Germany conducted 160,000 tests a week that month, rising to 360,000 tests by mid-May. The contrast between the two countries was in most respects pitiful.Nor has Germany been a slouch in its pandemic economic policy either. The British Treasury’s prompt response, in the form of furloughing, business loans and tax holidays, has certainly been one of the UK government’s better pandemic performances. But Boris Johnson’s claim, which he again made on Tuesday, that no country in the world has done more to support its workforce during the pandemic, is false. Germany has had a more generous furloughing scheme than Britain’s in place for years, and it boosted support with other measures in March. In addition, Germany unveiled a further £116bn economic recovery package at the start of June.It is absolutely not part of this argument that Germany is perfect. The big post-lockdown surge in North Rhine-Westphalia last week – a region that had pressed hard and early to ease restrictions – is proof of that. Masks are now widely worn in Germany – more so than in Britain – but there was much dithering before it happened. Regions have taken different approaches. A tracing app took weeks to be launched (although there is one now). In the economy, foreign trade, always key to German prosperity, has taken a big hit. Germany’s recovery spending package is also a U-turn after the long years of piling up surpluses.Nevertheless, all of this poses a fundamental question. Why can’t Britain do things more like Germany? The question remains an absolutely crucial one. It affects not just the handling of Covid-19, massively important though that was and still is. It also affects many other vastly significant strategic challenges facing modern Britain too, especially in the aftermath of Brexit. These include the nature of Britain’s post-Brexit economic model, its social welfare system, its environmental approach, its governance, its values system and its international role.Johnson leads a government that is defined by the fact that it seeks “world-beating” nationally focused solutions to modern problems. That’s why it rejects the European Union. Yet the curious thing is that Johnson’s government also simultaneously rejects all the national models that have underpinned most politics and economic thinking in western Europe since 1945. It is just as scornful of suggestions it has anything to learn from Germany’s national success as it is of post-Brexit working with the EU. As a result it sets itself up to be world-trailing rather than world-beating.The result is that the British government has embarked on the pretence of a nationally focused policy rather than the reality. “Global Britain” is based on the nostalgia-driven fantasy that, by going it alone, Britain can again become a superpower, sitting at the top table, supplying high-end goods to itself and the world. But this is simply not going to happen. Or, rather, it would only happen in the way that China managed to do it over the past half-century – by copying best practice. Even then, Britain would be a big medium-sized player, not a global rainmaker.In the summer of 1908, David Lloyd George did what Rishi Sunak should also do as soon as he is able. He went to Germany to discover in detail how they did it. In Lloyd George’s case, the purpose was to find out about Germany’s social welfare system. This was to provide the underpinning of his thinking for what became the “people’s budget” of 1909. Britain’s welfare state – the lasting foundation stone of progressive politics in this country to this day – owes its origins to a government that was humble enough to learn from others. More than a century on, Johnson’s government lacks any equivalent understanding.If and when the pandemic is overcome, the most urgent lesson for Britain will be to grasp its need to learn seriously from others if we are to ensure improved national resilience against the inevitable next threat. That lesson applies with just as much, if not more, force in economics and politics. Many other nations get this. Modern Britain does not. Truly, and tragically, we inhabit a different planet."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2596342143b8e4bf06120d2a0052235b77abdab6/189_178_3311_1988/master/3311.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d578a13ba960da80dc821370633749","title":"worlds poorest people coronavirus vaccine gavi","story":"Rich countries’ governments are putting all their trust in a marriage of markets and philanthropy called GaviVaccines for Covid-19 are coming. Billions of dollars are flowing in, over 100 efforts are under way, and at least 13 leading candidates are already being tested on humans. But how will these vaccines reach the poorest people on the planet? This question haunts the fate of more than half the world’s population. It is the central question of our time. The failure to address this question in the past has resulted in millions of unnecessary deaths – and yet, some believe there is a simple answer. Ask pharmaceutical corporations about how they will ensure access to Covid-19 vaccines, and they say “Gavi”. Ask the wealthiest governments in the world what they are doing to ensure global equity, and they too say “Gavi”.Gavi, the Vaccines Alliance, is a 20-year old public-private partnership that believes the marriage of markets and philanthropy will bring vaccines to everyone in the world. The numbers are impressive: every year, Gavi sends out 500 million vaccine doses against 17 different diseases. The sums of money pumped into Gavi are equally impressive. At the Global Vaccine Summit held earlier this month, Gavi raised a record-breaking $8.8bn. With £330m committed annually for the next five years, the British government is their single largest donor, alongside other wealthy countries and the Gates Foundation. At the summit, Gavi launched its newest initiative, a fund for future Covid-19 vaccines – the Covax Facility – which invites countries to invest in a wide portfolio of potential vaccines, pool their risk, and gain dedicated access to eventual products.Gavi heavily publicised a unit of the Covax Facility called the Covax Advance Market Commitment (or AMC, and yes, it’s confusing) that deals with the access side of things. The first deal – a US$750m agreement with AstraZeneca for 300 million doses of the potential Oxford University vaccine – was heralded as a commitment by industry to meet the needs of the world’s poorest countries. But it came at a high price, representing only a minor discount over the full price paid by the US government. The problem is, we know very little about this deal because the agreement isn’t public, despite all the public money involved. We don’t know if, for example, AstraZeneca gets to keep the money if its vaccine fails. We don’t even know for a fact that all the vaccines bought are intended for use in poor countries. We asked AstraZeneca about this but did not receive a response in time for publication.Rich countries are “encouraged (but not required)” to donate vaccines if they have more than they need, but we do not know when poor countries will get these donated vaccines: will it be at the same time as the rich countries, or only after they have used up all the vaccines they need? We put the questions raised by this document to Gavi, but it was unable to provide answers before this week’s board meeting. The prospect of a two-tiered system puts into question the fundamental issue that Gavi was founded to address: equitable access to vaccines. In many ways, Gavi has helped create the problem it is now trying to solve. Three decades of getting medicines and vaccines to poor people have revealed the problem and the solution: monopolies over vaccines in the pharmaceutical industry, enforced through patents which, when suspended, result in prices going down and supply going up. The rich countries and organisations who fund Gavi are equally culpable: the US, UK and EU have committed billions towards vaccine research, almost all of which has gone to private pharmaceutical companies – without any conditions to prevent them from monopolising their vaccines.All these countries have further stockpiled future vaccines by making direct deals with manufacturers, again without any access conditions whatsoever. In failing to challenge the most perverse feature of the pharmaceutical industry – monopolies that block access to their products – Gavi is in step with the governments who fund it. At best, Gavi has failed at negotiating control over the vaccines it funds. At worst, it believes that pharmaceutical monopolies, which have thwarted equitable access, are somehow essential to achieving it.And unaffordable prices are only one part of the monopoly problem in this pandemic, expanding supply is a major challenge. We have a shot at making enough vaccines for everyone, everywhere, if we put the planet’s full manufacturing capacity to use. But that can only happen if the vaccines are set free. Gavi’s inability to consider this problem, or use its leverage to force a solution, is baffling.Pharmaceutical companies say they will make no money off the pandemic, that they will supply vaccines at a cost. Yet, they have already seen multibillion dollar increases in their market capitalisation, and are unwilling to relinquish the monopolies that drive their outsize profits. Leaders of rich countries (apart from the US) have said all the right things about equitable access to vaccines. Yet they are entering into multiple advance deals to stock up on possibly far more vaccines than they will ever need. They cannot have it both ways, and neither can Gavi. Seth Berkley, the Gavi CEO, cannot claim to want “the world to come together” with “no barriers” while failing to tackle both rich country nationalism and pharmaceutical industry greed.Gavi can change the rules of the game and turn the Covid-19 vaccine into a global public good.  It can ask far more of the pharmaceutical companies it is funding, and it can force the entire vaccine ecosystem to join a cooperative, collaborative and monopoly-free mechanism like the WHO’s Covid-19 Technology Access Pool. This would be the right move to make, and in doing so, Gavi could finally deliver on the promise it made to the world 20 years ago."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/68219b4efb61dd1d1676bb0db7238a633826e666/0_137_4287_2572/master/4287.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8724fa9e54735daf18cdd23f8395529d","title":"top public school asks teachers to exaggerate exam predictions","story":"Exclusive: Sevenoaks policy reveals predictions for lowest-performing students may be boosted ‘to facilitate application to a more selective university’One of the UK’s most prestigious private schools has a policy of asking teachers to exaggerate predicted exam results for some of its lowest-performing students on university applications to help them secure offers, documents seen by the  reveal.Sevenoaks school, which charges more than £38,000 a year for boarding pupils, prides itself on its students’ “tremendous record of achievement” in winning university places.Guidelines set out in the minutes of internal meetings and the 2019-20 teachers’ handbook reveal that for about 20 lower-performing students who may be in danger of missing out on their preferred degree course, staff are asked to increase their predicted grades on their Ucas applications.The documents seen by the  say that such changes in predictions for the International Baccalaureate (IB) exams, which the school uses instead of A-levels, will be “usually accommodated”.They also say that predictions may be improved for a few other students by a single grade in a specific subject “to facilitate an application to a more selective universitycourse”.Ucas guidance on predicted grades says that they should not be “influenced by university or college entry requirements or behaviours – predicted grades should be set in isolation of an applicant’s university or college choice(s)”.In total, Sevenoaks’ higher education department seeks to increase about 1 in 12 pupils’ predicted grades each year, the documents say. The policy is said to have been in place for “many years”.The school rebutted any suggestion that it would unfairly exaggerate Ucas predictions, adding that all predicted grades were “based on what is realistic and achievable for pupils” in line with Ucas guidelines. It said that the number of students meeting or exceeding their predictions “significantly outperforms the national average”.The disclosures will be greeted with anger by critics of private schools who fear that such practices are commonplace. While British universities usually make conditional offers of places, they sometimes accept students who miss their predicted results if they have been otherwise persuaded of their merit.“We’ve known this sort of thing is happening for some time, but it’s the brazenness of writing it down,” said Francis Green, professor of work and education economics at University College London and co-author of Engines of Privilege: Britain’s Private School Problem. While it might seem that any advantage gained by over-predicting would be negated by a poor exam performance, such practices “open doors” for pupils who may otherwise never be considered for a place at their preferred university, said Tom Richmond, director of the EDSK education thinktank, which published a report last week calling for the removal of predicted grades from the admissions process.“If a course has a three B requirement, and a student comes in with a higher prediction, then the chances of getting a very low or unconditional offer dramatically increases,” Richmond said. “They might think they’re getting themselves a really good student who might in a competitive environment risk being whisked away by someone else.”Because the coronavirus pandemic means that exams have been cancelled, IB – like other exam bodies – will be using predicted grades submitted to them as part of their calculations for final results this year. These predictions are made at a later stage in the academic calendar to the Ucas predictions referred to in the Sevenoaks policy, which predates the pandemic.“This is getting a lot of scrutiny because now we’re relying purely on these calculated grades,” Dr Gill Wyness, of UCL’s Institute for Education, said of the coronavirus provisions. “Ofqual will be paying a lot of attention and that’s a really good thing.” The school emphasised that the process is “entirely separate from Ucas predictions and follows the relevant government, Ofqual, JCQ and exam board guidelines”.The handbook says that “accurate predicted grades are important both for the student … and for the school”, and that teachers are asked to take into account previous exam results, work throughout the year and their own professional judgment.But it goes on to say that in “a small number of cases (approximately 20 per year) even these predictions will not be sufficient for the higher education aspirations of the student”.For these pupils, the document says that the higher education department “will... go back again to heads of department and ask whether the prediction may be upgraded to facilitate the application”.The document continues: “These interventions are almost exclusively made on behalf of lower-achieving students.” But it notes that in some other cases where students want to apply for a course that has a minimum requirement above their prediction, single-grade increases will be considered.Internal minutes of a 2018 meeting reiterate the guidelines and note that requests for students on “low” predictions of 31-32 points out of a possible 45 on the IB’s scale will be “usually accommodated” and increased to 34 points, which the minutes say “opens up many more courses”.Notes from another meeting, in September 2019, say that such increases “can occasionally cause issues” and suggests that students may be upgraded from 30 points to 34 so that they have “more options” – the equivalent of a grade higher in four of the six subjects that are typically studied.A Sevenoaks spokesperson said: “We are confident in the integrity of our processes and refute any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate Ucas predictions. All Ucas predicted grades are based on what is realistic and achievable for the pupils, in line with Ucas’s guidelines which make clear that predicted grades should be ‘aspirational but achievable’. A significant majority of Sevenoaks students meet or exceed their Ucas predicted grades and, in this respect, we significantly outperform the national average.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8523985c652c92b76797f1159014415a8c70afe6/0_156_5283_3170/master/5283.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbeb68529b42d8b41541d7e05fec0b71","title":"my land is now owned by lions maasai farmers offer kenya wildlife a lifeline aoe","story":"Parsaloi Kupai’s home, situated on the edge of Ol Kinyei conservancy near the Maasai Mara game reserve, is no different from any other Maasai homestead – oval-shaped huts with an almost flat roof and walls plastered with a mixture of water, mud and cow dung. At the centre of the homestead is a cattle boma, an enclosure where his livestock spends the night, safe from the many predators that roam the area.Kupai, 47, and his two wives chose to live here after they surrendered 69 hectares (170 acres) of land to the 7,500-hectare conservancy. He is among 240 landowners who gave up their highly valued grazing land for the project.“I cannot graze on that land any more,” he tells me, pointing to a hill far into the horizon, the outer reaches of the conservancy. “It is now owned by elephants, wildebeests and lions.”In 2018, Ol Kinyei achieved IUCN Green List status for its good governance, sound design and planning and effective management.Michiel Veldhuis, lead author of the study from the University of Groningen, concluded: “There is an urgent need to rethink how we manage the boundaries of protected areas to be able to conserve bioersity. The future of the world’s most iconic protected area and their associated human population may depend on it.”Communities around the national reserve were driving their livestock further into protected areas. This encroachment, coupled with a lack of clear strategy by the government, has brought wildlife conservation to a crossroads.The conservancy model, Kaelo says, is one way to tilt this imbalance, and in the greater Mara region, more than 14,000 landowners have embraced the idea by forming 15 conservancies that offer close to 142,000 hectares of refuge to wild animals. Apart from Ol Kinyei, other conservancies in greater Mara include Naboisho, Olare Motorogi, Lemek, Mara North, and Siana.Landowners in a conservancy identify a tourism operator willing to set up a safari camp within the new block of land. The operator benefits from tailor-made safaris since a conservancy has a higher concentration of wild animals owing to enlarged rangelands. Funds derived from conservation and accommodation fees and philanthropy are shared between the operator and landowners at an agreed percentage.Kupai receives Ksh20,000 (£193) every month for the land he surrendered to Ol Kinyei conservancy, money that he invests in livestock and his children’s education.Critics, however, ask whether setting up community-based conservancies is the best form of land use, as opposed to farming or raising livestock. Some landowners have protested over what they see as skewed agreements between them and tourism operators, with the latter being accused of making huge profits at the expense of landowners.In their defence, conservancy proponents argue that both agriculture and livestock-keeping heavily depend on adequate rainfall, something that is in short supply around the Mara. In addition, they say the soil in the area is too rocky for any meaningful form of farming to take place, and that mechanised farming is too expensive for the many small landholders.“Ideally, a conservancy is a commercial venture and an alternative form of land use to the local Maasai,” says Simon Nkoitoi, the senior warden and manager at Ol Kinyei Conservancy. “The economic benefits derived from this form of wildlife conservation outweigh other commercial ventures, otherwise the local Maasai would not trade their grazing fields for wildlife conservation.”Ol Kinyei was set up in 2005, partly due to the efforts of Jake Grieves-Cook, a veteran of the local tour industry who has worked in sustainable tourism for more than 40 years. His tour operations outfit, Gamewatchers Safaris, operates camps in a number of conservancies in Kenya, including Ol Kinyei.Operators like Gamewatchers must adhere to strict tourism regulations laid out by the group conservancy management. As an example, there can only be a single tent per 700 acres and no more than 12 tents per camp. Low tourism densities in such conservancies mean the few guests have access to thousands of acres, increasing the chances of a memorable wildlife experience. The carbon footprint is kept to a bare minimum.The economic benefits of a conservancy go beyond the land-leasing fees paid out to landowners. In the largely rural settings where conservancies are located, safari camps have created job opportunities for youths who now work as camp managers, drivers and tour guides, housekeepers and chefs.Nkoitoi is part of the conservancy management team. His role includes overseeing a team of 19 rangers charged with securing this vast piece of wild Africa. A smartphone app known as Wild (Wildlife Information Landscape Database) assists Nkoitoi and his team in collating wildlife numbers and their location, information that is then transmitted to the conservancy rangers’ post. The application also helps map out possible human-wildlife conflict hotspots. In the greater Mara ecosystem, such conflicts are not in short supply and continue to test the fragile coexistence between local communities and wildlife.Sitting under a giant yellow-backed acacia, Nkoitoi’s phone rings. On the other end is a ranger who informs him of an elephant incursion into a human settlement. “We will check it out in the morning,” he tells the caller. “If we don’t address such issues in time, those people can take matters in their hands,” he says after hanging up. “They can get trampled by the elephants as they try to chase them away.”The following morning, Nkoitoi visits the village, Ereyiet Oltome, located on the eastern edge of Ol Kinyei. Tempers are high following the invasion of elephants. Several homesteads stand a few metres from a thicket where more than a dozen elephants are holed up. The previous day, an elephant had chased a young man who, in a bid to distract his pursuer, threw his traditional wraparound to the ground. “Look! This is what the elephant did to his shuka,” a young man says, holding the tattered cloth belonging to his friend who was too traumatised to venture outdoors. He was fortunate. Some don’t live to relate a close encounter with an elephant.Nkoitoi is soon joined by Marc Goss, head of the rapid response unit at Mara Elephant Project. The villagers are relieved to hear the roar of his helicopter, a sound they have heard before when elephants have invaded their farms. For hours, Goss tries every trick in the book to drive the elephants back to the conservancy. “It is tricky driving elephants out of the private fields,” he says during a break in the operation. “They are clever animals. Mothers will never leave their young behind. Some even go under the helicopter to avoid detection from the air.”By 2pm, a handful have been driven back to the confines of the conservancy. “At least we tried. We did our best,” says Goss. The operation was set to continue next day.Elephant incursions into human settlements are a new phenomenon around Maasai Mara. While the conservancies have increased the land under wildlife conservation, communities on the borderlines have fenced off blocks of land partly to preserve the grass for livestock. Grazing is allowed in some conservancies and outlawed in others. Elephants are attracted by the lush grass within the fenced-off areas.Despite the periodic conflicts between wild animals and humans, there is general agreement that the conservancy model is the way to go in preserving what most of the world has lost.With funding for the conservation model disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, which has prevented thousands of foreign tourists who would have trooped to the Mara to watch the annual wildebeest migration, a number of emergency fund appeals have been launched. For example, £44,867 has been raised to support local communities and protect endangered wildlife in Mara Naboisho conservancy, while Gamewatchers is urging donors to adopt an acre of land for a year with a donation to the Wildlife Habitat Trust, a fund set up to help to pay the wages of staff working in the conservancies as well as the land leases.The Kenyan government has also announced it is setting aside 2bn Kenyan shillings (£15m) in the coming financial year (starting July 1) to support wildlife conservancies. “We have hope that wildlife will flourish,” says Kaelo of the conservancy model. “This will happen if investment in our national parks and reserves is quadrupled and private landowners and local communities are effectively incentivised to ensure wildlife is perceived as a national asset.”Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/420aec0f94937439eec87993973893b674966f63/189_0_2636_1583/master/2636.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=750427ead08a63510778b87cb25853ff","title":"seasteading a vanity project for the rich or the future of humanity","story":"Beloved by Silicon Valley tycoons and tyranny-fearing libertarians, are cities atop the waves Earth’s next frontier?A white steel pole rises out of the sea off the Caribbean coast of Panama, poking above the waves like the funnel of a sunken steamship. Launched into the water last month, this is no shipwreck, but the base of what will soon become a floating home and, in the eyes of its makers, the first step towards building a brave new post-Covid-19 society, out on the open ocean.“Coronavirus is an opportunity to show the world that what we’re building is actually going to be very useful in the future,” says Chad Elwartowski, in a recent video post from his beachside base in Panama. The Michigan-born software engineer turned bitcoin trader is a leading figure in the seasteading movement, a libertarian group dedicated to building independent floating cities on the high seas. Along with the bunker builders and survivalist preppers, their long-held ambitions have been bolstered by the current global pandemic. “No matter if you’re scared of the virus or the reaction to the virus,” he adds, “living out on the ocean will be helpful for these situations.”It is not the first time Elwartowski has attempted to realise his dream of a floating future. In April last year, he and his Thai partner Supranee Thepdet (aka Nadia Summergirl), were forced to flee their first floating home off the coast of Thailand, just moments before it was raided by the Thai navy. They had constructed what they declared to be “the first seastead” 12 nautical miles from Phuket, but the authorities decided that the six metre-wide fibreglass cabin, perched on top of a floating pole, posed a threat to Thailand’s sovereignty. It was an offence punishable by life imprisonment or even the death penalty. “The couple announced on social media declaring their autonomy beyond the jurisdiction of any courts or law of any countries, including Thailand,” said Rear Admiral Vithanarat Kochaseni, adding that they had invited others to join them. “We see such action as deteriorating Thailand’s independence.”After a few weeks on the run, dodging Thai patrol boats and eventually making their way to Singapore, the couple moved to Panama to relaunch their company, Ocean Builders with the financial backer of the project, Rüdiger Koch, a retired German aerospace engineer. “This event has doubled down our efforts,” the group said in a statement, following the Thai ordeal. “We can all clearly see that seasteading needs to happen now as tyranny creeps ever more deeply into our governments to the point that they are willing to hunt down a couple of residents residing in a floating house in middle of nowhere.”The coronavirus pandemic has given fringe libertarian groups around the world renewed vigour to pursue their dreams of building autonomous new societies. Government-enforced lockdowns and increased digital surveillance have added fuel to their suspicions of state control, while the suspension of day-to-day norms and the spectre of an economic meltdown have amplified their calls to rethink society. “When you’re not sure which virus is more contagious,” says the slogan of a recent meme made by Americans for Liberty, shared on Elwartowski’s Facebook page. “Covid-19, or those fine with complete government control.”The sentiment lies at the core of the seasteading community, a disparate group that has grown since 2008, when the Seasteading Institute was founded in San Francisco by Patri Friedman. The self-styled anarcho-capitalist (and grandson of Nobel prize-winning economist Milton Friedman) was working as a Google software engineer when he managed to attract funding from PayPal billionaire Peter Thiel to set up the institute. In a founding statement, they described its goal as being “to establish permanent, autonomous ocean communities to enable experimentation and innovation with erse social, political, and legal systems”. Thiel was nothing if not confident: “The nature of government is about to change at a very fundamental level,” he proclaimed.Seasteading represents the ultimate Silicon Valley approach to governance, conceiving society as a technology that can be hacked and innovated upon as simply as an operating system. It is predicated on the idea that government regulation stifles innovation, and therefore the route to a better world can only be found by unleashing a new generation of start-up societies that are forced to compete for citizens in a free market of ideologies. Don’t like the rules of your current micro-nation? Simply move to another one. “We will give people the freedom to choose the government they want,” said Friedman, “instead of being stuck with the government they get.” Its boosters see it as the route to salvation its critics say it would lead to “an apartheid of the worst kind”.Progress has been bumpy. Thiel’s donations soon dried up, and Friedman’s plans never got much further than launching Ephemerisle – a waterborne version of the Burning Man festival, staged in the Sacramento River delta near San Francisco, where rival floating pontoons compete for the attention of soggy partygoers. He has since moved his focus away from the water, recently launching a company to develop experimental cities on dry land instead. But the Seasteading Institute continues without him, headed by author and self-appointed “seavangelist”, Joe Quirk.“Nearly half of the world’s surface is unclaimed,” says Quirk, who published a book on seasteading in 2017, with the ambitious subtitle: “How floating nations will restore the environment, enrich the poor, cure the sick, and liberate humanity from politicians”. In an introductory video, he describes the planet’s oceans as “a sort of research and development zone where we could discover better means of governance”, and says that seasteading could “provide the technology for thousands of people to start their own nano-nation on the high seas”, giving people “opportunities to peacefully test new ideas about living together”. The most successful seasteads, he says, “will become thriving new societies, inspiring change around the world”.So far, his own attempts don’t bode particularly well for the future of floating utopias. In January 2017, after years of technical feasibility studies and political negotiations, the Seasteading Institute signed a memorandum of understanding with the government of French Polynesia to build the first seasteads in its territorial waters. The designs, developed by Dutch architects Blue21, looked like a high-end resort in the Males, depicting a series of villas linked by an undulating green landscape. It was all to be magicked from the waters by an initial coin offering, a form of crowdfunding through selling tokens of a new cryptocurrency, all the rage among the tech community in 2017. “We’re going to draw a new map of the world with French Polynesia at the centre of the aquatic age,” Quirk declared.The choice of location was strategic. Comprised of almost 120 dispersed low-lying islands and atolls, French Polynesia is at severe risk of suffering devastating consequences from even the slightest rise in sea level. It also happens to boast the world’s largest exclusive economic zone, an area of sea that can stretch for 200 nautical miles from a territory’s coastline, over which it can claim exclusive economic rights. At five million square kilometres, French Polynesian waters  an area as large as the landmass of the entire European Union, making it an ideal place to experiment with novel forms of aquatic jurisdiction. In theory.“We explained to the Polynesians how having a quasi-autonomous area nearby was a good thing,” says Tom W Bell, professor of law at Chapman University in Orange County, California, who drew up the legal agreement for the project. “Look at Monaco, or Hong Kong or Singapore – special jurisdictions create a lot of growth outside their borders.” In his book, Your Next Government? From the Nation State to Stateless Nations, Bell traces the projected evolution of a seastead. It would begin “like a coral polyp”, he writes, protected by a country’s territorial waters, where it would start to generate economic activity, “enriching its environment and attracting still more life”, before breaking free to start a new autonomous life on the open ocean. Ultimately, he imagines seasteads nurtured by different host nations congregating in mid-ocean gyres, sheltered within floating breakwaters. “A new kind of government arises,” he writes, “born in Earth’s last free places, fated to advance the human frontier.”The reality didn’t quite pan out that way in the South Pacific. “There wasn’t a perfect alignment of interests,” says Marc Collins Chen, former minister of tourism of French Polynesia, who co-founded the company Blue Frontiers with Quirk to realise the project. “The government was looking for something to address sea level rise and environmental degradation, whereas the Seasteading Institute was more about autonomy.” He says that the prospect of a tax-free enclave held little appeal for the locals, given that Polynesians don’t pay income tax anyway. One Tahitian TV host compared the situation to the evil Galactic Empire in Star Wars imposing on the innocent Ewoks, while secretly building the Death Star. The libertarian position didn’t help either. As Collins Chen puts it: “It’s very difficult to ask for government support when your narrative is that you want to get rid of politicians.” In retrospect, Bell agrees: “They already had a beautiful paradise in French Polynesia. The local community wasn’t very enthusiastic about the project, and I get it. They didn’t need strangers coming in and ruining their view.”Collins Chen has since moved to New York, where he has established a new company to develop further plans for floating cities, this time stripped of any libertarian tax-dodging ideology. “I realised that the real future for these sorts of projects has to be closer to cities,” he says. “They have to be an extension of an existing city’s infrastructure, they need to be run by the mayor, and they have to pay their taxes – as opposed to being enclaves for the wealthy.”His plan, titled Oceanix City, has been designed in slick Ted Talk style by Bjarke Ingels, the Danish architect beloved of Silicon Valley tech companies. His twinkling animations depict a floating world of interlocking hexagonal islands, where power is harvested from waves and the sun, where residents live on a diet of seaweed and fish, and where marine life is “regenerated” by artificial reefs. “If this floating city flourishes,” said Ingels in a presentation, “it can then grow like a culture in a petri dish.” On a screen behind him, the floating hexagons multiplied until they took up an area more than three times the size of Manhattan, a vision of low-density suburbia sprawling virulently across the sea.“Over the next 40 years, the world is expected to build 230bn square metres in new construction,” says Collins Chen, “the equivalent of adding one New York City every month. This could be a way to accommodate that growth, without the devastating effects of land reclamation or deforestation.” He says part of the appeal is the ability to reconfigure the urban form according to changing needs, in a process of drag-and-drop city building. “You could literally float one a city block away and put a different one in its place, when the need for a new school, hospital or university arose.”Remarkably, their sci-fi scheme has won the support of the United Nations’ sustainable development arm, UN-Habitat, which hosted a round table discussion for the project in April 2019. As global heating accelerates, sea levels rise and more people crowd into urban slums, “floating cities is one of the possible solutions,” said UN-Habitat’s executive director, Maimunah Mohd Sharif.Back in Panama, the notion that floating habitats could be an inclusive solution to global housing need seems a long way off, to put it mildly. Despite the country’s coronavirus lockdown, the Ocean Builders team has been at work throughout, laying the foundations for a factory that will soon house the largest 3D printer in Central America, ready to produce what their website touts as “the world’s first 3D-printed, smart floating home with an underwater room wrapped in an eco restorative 3D-printed coral reef” – yours for between $200,000 to $800,000 (£160,000 to £640,000).“In light of the global pandemic, we’re really focusing on making the homes feel like a kind of lifeboat,” says the company’s CEO, Grant Romundt, who worked on the Freedom Ship project in Florida in the 1990s, an aborted plan to build a mile-long cruise ship for 40,000 people, topped with a runway. “They should be a safe place to escape to and be totally energy independent, with solar panels on the roof, water desalination on board, waste collection by drone, and aeroponic systems to grow your own food.”Designed by Koen Olthuis of Dutch architecture practice Waterstudio, the plans for the luxury “SeaPods” look like a row of gigantic motorbike helmets on poles, sticking up out of the sea in pearlescent shades of blue, green and grey. “We wanted to have something that was very futuristic looking, very clean and flowing,” says Romundt. “I didn’t want to have a 90-degree corner anywhere in the house. I think that’s bad feng shui.” The interiors recall supersized sanitaryware, envisaged as white, wipe-clean worlds of free-flowing surfaces, echoing retro-futuristic visions of streamlined space capsules. The similarity is no accident: for company founder, Rüdiger Koch, seasteading is merely a stepping stone for trialling exploits in space. He has long harboured plans to build a cable “launch loop” to propel payloads into space without rockets, and he sees the ocean as the perfect launchpad. “There are almost only large open spaces at sea,” he told German regional newspaper, Rhein-Neckar-Zeitung, “and you need them to make sure that nothing goes wrong and nobody is hit by possible flying parts.”Romundt insists that the company is merely building floating holiday homes, which will be registered as boats under the Panama flag for legal purposes, and likely operate on a timeshare basis. “That would give you the slow adjustment period,” he says, “then more of an economy would start to build as more people come requiring more services, and it would start to self-perpetuate and grow.”For Bell, the ultimate goal is to see such floating communities raise their own flags in the open ocean. “Right now, a self-flagged seastead would have effectively no status at all in international law,” he says. “The coast guard would show up, assume you were either a pirate or a floating meth lab, and tow you right back in to shore. But if seasteaders can say they have enough people and a big enough territory, and start flagging themselves, that’s when things will start to get interesting.”And if they fail? “That’s the marvellous thing about seasteads,” says Quirk. “If a government fails, there’s nothing much the people who live there can do about it, but if seasteads fail, they simply disassemble and go away” – seeing all those bitcoin dollars sink into the sea just as quickly as they were conjured."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ff95247a1ddeffceef53f2bb0a1e68d44d57286/0_428_4341_2605/master/4341.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1368495f261919e0c761c1798e4eba82","title":"uks net zero pledge what has been achieved one year on","story":"The urgency of the climate emergency has grown but there has been little progress so farLast summer, Theresa May signed into law the UK’s ground-breaking target of hitting net zero carbon emissions by 2050 against a backdrop of increasingly vocal Extinction Rebellion protests, school climate strikes and Brexit-related political turmoil within the Conservative party.It was one of the last acts of a beleaguered prime minister, under fire after a series of missteps and haemorrhaging support in party and country. Protesters lined the streets, businesses despaired at the lack of leadership and the government seemed to have little strategy for extricating the country from its immediate travails, let alone a viable long-term vision.Since then, Britain has been transformed by the coronavirus crisis, with the economy mired in the deepest recession for centuries and braced for a possible second wave of infections. But while the skies have cleared and carbon emissions plunged during the lockdown, the urgency of the climate emergency has only grown.As the first anniversary looms this Saturday of the signing of the net zero pledge into law, there has been little concrete action, and no clear roadmap on how to meet the goal.Asked by the  what measures had been taken on net zero in the past year, the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) cited only: John Sauven, the executive director of Greenpeace UK, said: “If the government wants businesses, local authorities and households to make the appropriate investments over the next decade, they will need confidence that Britain really is committed to decarbonising the economy. But the practical measures taken by the government over the past 12 months add up to a tiny fraction of what is needed to keep us on course to meet that commitment.”The UK was one of the first countries to enshrine in law a net zero target for carbon dioxide. That leadership helped the UK gain host status for the crucial next round of UN climate talks, called Cop26, and the target – endorsed by all the major parties in last year’s general election – was intended to galvanise action across government and spur business investment.The Committee on Climate Change says cutting greenhouse gas emissions to zero by 2050 is necessary, affordable and desirable. Here are some of the actions needed to make that happen:• Petrol and diesel cars banned from sale ideally by 2030 and 2035 at the latest.• Quadrupling clean electricity production from wind, solar and perhaps nuclear, plus batteries to store it and connections to Europe to share the load.• Connection of new homes to the gas grid ending in 2025, with boilers using clean hydrogen or replaced by electric powered heat pumps. Plus, all homes and appliances being highly efficient.\u0026nbsp • 1.5bn new trees will be needed, meaning more than 150 football pitches a day of new forests from now to 2050.• Flying would not be banned, but the number of flights will depend on how much airlines can cut emissions with electric planes or biofuels. The law was passed amid political turmoil over Brexit, followed by Boris Johnson’s landslide victory in last December’s general election. The subsequent redrawing of the political map was still in progress, and the reshuffled cabinet still bedding in, when the coronavirus pandemic struck early this year. These upheavals forced the postponement of Cop26 to next year, and have also, according to insiders, stalled new climate policy.Progress has been slow on key fronts, however. Billions of pounds spent to bail out airlines, carmakers and oil companies have come without green strings attached. Home heating is the biggest source of emissions from households, but there is still no strategy for insulating Britain’s draughty homes, despite clear evidence that doing so would provide thousands of “shovel-ready” green jobs. Switching from gas boilers to low-carbon alternatives is essential, but at the replacement rate the government proposes, it would take 1,500 years, according to Friends of the Earth.“To see this kind of foot-dragging so early on is hugely concerning,” said Jamie Peters, the campaigns director at FoE.Investors want to see more direction from the top, to spur private capital into low-carbon projects, while businesses want more regulation that provides clear signals that private investors will follow, as well as support for large-scale trials of new technologies, such as hydrogen fuel and carbon capture and storage. But while many are prepared to cut ministers some slack for having to deal with the coronavirus pandemic, the government’s political opponents say the delay shows an unwillingness to take the drastic steps needed.Matthew Pennycook, the shadow climate change minister, said: “Setting a target is one thing, hitting it is quite another. As things stand, not only are the government failing to do anything like enough to meet our legally binding net zero target, they are not even on track to meet the less ambitious one that preceded it.” Wera Hobhouse, the Lib Dem climate emergency spokesperson, said: “Without a plan to cut emissions, the Conservatives’ pledges fall far short of the action we need.” There must be clear focus on a green recovery from the coronavirus crisis, added Caroline Lucas, the Green Party MP. “This really is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to put us on the path to a greener, fairer future. Going back to business as usual would be a one-way street to climate disaster.”A spokesperson for BEIS said: “Tackling climate change is a national priority, which is why the UK was the first major economy to commit to achieving net zero emissions by 2050. We have proven that green growth is possible, and our track record of driving down emissions while growing our economy and supporting our world-leading renewable and low-carbon sectors will see us go further and faster in the years ahead.”The government will be under the spotlight later this week when its statutory adviser, the Committee on Climate Change, produces a progress report on Thursday on the UK’s emissions-cutting efforts. The CCC will recommend a green recovery, for which there are indications of public support, and the government must make a formal response.Ahead of the chancellor Rishi Sunak’s pre-budget statement, thought to be slated for 6 July, ministers must show that warm words will be backed up by action, experts said. “There are encouraging signs that the government is beginning to realise that all policy and public spending must be put through a net zero filter,” said Shaun Spiers, the executive director of the thinktank Green Alliance. “The whole government now needs to shift gear and ensure that ‘build back better’ and ‘green recovery’ are not just slogans, but drive the economic recovery from Covid-19.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af112d4d8130bfa8ca7e5e8983ab5ca9beb30df2/0_0_1000_1000/master/1000.jpg?width=880\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=d362b9db1cf3c631e825dc2bfd933c4b 1760w","title":"all hail halloumi 17 delicious recipes from salty fritters to harissa flatbreads","story":"Beyond the barbecue, there are many exciting ways to cook with this hugely versatile ingredient, from fruity salads to an easy aubergine pieThe key to the versatility of halloumi cheese is its high melting point – you can’t grill a lump of cheddar on a barbecue. Packaged in brine, it also keeps for ages – the halloumi in my fridge passes its best-before date at the end of August, and I don’t remember when I bought it. Sliced and fried (not too long a couple of minutes on each side), with a squeeze of lemon, halloumi adds a salty, pleasantly squeaky note to almost any salad. But there’s more than one way to cook with halloumi. Here are 17 to be getting on with.First up is Claire Thomson’s recipe for halloumi itself. I can see that if you’re looking for innovative ways to use up your halloumi surplus, making more halloumi is a little counterproductive, but this is a project you can embark on with kids, and the process alone is worth reading about. The recipe’s biggest drawback is that it calls for 10 litres of milk. “They’d think you were insane at the shop,” my son said, perfectly crystallising my anxieties. A couple of months ago I could have pretended I was hoarding, but not now.Halloumi has an affinity with mint – it is often packaged with little flakes of mint floating round it – but that doesn’t mean you can’t use other herbs. A sprinkle of oregano, for example, works wonders. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall uses parsley when combining halloumi with new potatoes and asparagus. In Cyprus, halloumi is commonly paired with watermelon in summer, and Nigel Slater’s grilled halloumi with watermelon salsa is a fresh, uncomplicated take on the idea. He recommends chilling the salsa for a while to heighten the contrast with the just-grilled cheese.A freekeh salad with nectarine and halloumi from Thomasina Miers offers another pairing of halloumi and fruit and, if you don’t have nectarines, she suggests that dried apricots or blackberries would work as well. This orzo and halloumi salad, although fruitless, is in the same vein.Because it stands up so robustly to cooking, halloumi is often treated as if it were another sort of food altogether. It can work as a sort of fat chip for dipping or you can prepare it in the manner of a fish finger – rolled in egg and breadcrumbs and fried and, in this case, served as an accompaniment to creamed aubergine.Thanks to its saltiness and its firm bite, halloumi is widely deployed as a meat substitute, to the extent that a fat slab of grilled halloumi in a bun has served as an emergency veggie burger at many a meat-eater’s barbecue. To be perfectly honest, you could do a lot worse, but a little extra effort is rewarded. You can team it with portobello mushrooms or with grilled pineapple, slaw and chipotle paste.For a more considered approach, try this halloumi burger from David Frenkiel and Luise Vindahl, in which the cheese is grated together with carrot and courgette before cooking, and served not in a bun but in a cabbage leaf.Anna Jones uses two kinds of flour to produce crispy halloumi and courgette fritters, while her contribution to the barbecue is a harissa and lime halloumi flatbread.Cut into chunks, halloumi also makes excellent skewer material, alternated with wedges of onion, pepper and tomatoes for veggie kebabs, like those assembled by Jamie Oliver. If you are not vegetarian, you can even alternate it with meat: Natalie Salmon’s instructional video for steak and halloumi kebabs chimichurri contains hardly any instructions – she’s really just putting ideas in your head.Flaounes are a traditional Cypriot pastry made with halloumi Paul Hollywood has a recipe here. Traditionally, they contain mahalepi (or mahleb), a spice made from powdered cherry stones, which is not everyone’s idea of a store-cupboard staple, but it is pretty widely available online or in specialty shops. If you can’t source it, there are many suggestions for substitutes, including a combination of almond extract and star anise. Alternatively, you might want to try these non-traditional halloumi scones.Finally, for a quick vegetarian supper this simple aubergine and halloumi pie made with store-bought puff pastry, is hard to improve upon. Even making your own puff pastry would somehow ruin it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29474a7096d46dd812ac966b74dde8e60347f4b7/2_92_1549_929/master/1549.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4da000f5a3be2da3c3accd8acbf90b4","title":"david athertons recipe for tortang talong","story":"These aubergine omelettes are ideal for a quick brunch – and make the perfect introduction to the wonders of Filipino cuisineWhy isn’t Filipino food more popular in the UK?

It’s also known, especially outside the region, as tarte à la flamme or tarte flambée, though no alcohol is involved in its production – as the name suggests, it’s a tart, albeit one that’s cooked quickly in a hot oven much like a pizza, then topped with distinctly un-Italian combination of salt pork and soured cream.It is, however, often enjoyed with alcohol, and pairs particularly well with a chilled glass of crisp riesling or pinot blanc – preferably local, sitting at a cafe in a half-timbered square festooned with geraniums, happily watching the world go by.\u0026nbspFlammekueche recipes seem to fall into two camps: those that use bread dough and those that opt for an unleavened pastry. The latter is, in my experience, more common these days – despite being a committed consumer of the stuff, I’m not sure I’ve ever had a bread-based example on either side of the border.\u0026nbspSince that other regional speciality, the quiche lorraine, was also once made from leftover bread dough, it seems likely to me that this is the older variation, a theory backed up by its inclusion in a 1981 collection of recipes from a French television series exploring the nation’s culinary traditions, Les Recettes de Mon Village. A Monsieur Kohln, from Erstein in the Bas-Rhin, calls simply for “bread dough”, as does the late Paul Bocuse, widely considered to be one of the most important French chefs of the last century – though he hailed from farther south-west. Both versions are delicious in the same way that a pizza is, but with such rich toppings, the whole thing is unapologetically hefty. Great as a main dish, as the gloss in the tie-in recipe book to the French television programme suggests, but a bit much as a snack with drinks, which is how I’m used to consuming flammekueche.Another celebrated and much-mourned chef, Michel Roux, suggests using puff pastry in his book The Essence of French Cooking, while Gabriel Kreuther, a native of Niederschaeffolsheim now picking up Michelin stars in New York, makes a kind of flatbread, raised with baking powder and enriched with egg yolks. Puff pastry, to my mind – though a temptingly easy option if you buy it ready-made – turns this into just another tart. And the yolks make Kreuther’s base too soft and flaky for the job. The base that comes closest to those I’ve enjoyed in Alsace comes from the association of local winemakers and uses plain flour and a little oil, but no raising agent, giving it a winningly crisp texture that makes it the perfect foil for the rich dairy and pork on top.If you live in France, of course, you’ll probably be able to buy excellent dough at your local supermarket. No judgment here it’s not as if it’s the only ingredient we’re missing out on on this side of the Channel. Whatever you use, bear in mind that this is a dish traditionally baked in a bread oven, so, as with pizzas, you’ll need to crank up your home machine. I’d also recommend heating the baking tray, too, to help the middle of the base cook through before the edges burn to a cinder in the furnace.\u0026nbspIf this were a pizza, it would be a pizza bianca, with dairy replacing the familiar tomato sauce. Roux uses double cream mixed with a little lemon juice, presumably to simulate the tangy richness of creme fraiche, but if the latter, which is thicker and more interesting, is available, I’d choose that instead. Vins d’Alsace, the official site of the wine-growing area, mixes the cream with fromage blanc, a milky young cheese with a gentle acidity that’s all but impossible to find in this country. After many experiments, I’ve settled on drained whole Greek yoghurt as a decent, if imperfect substitute, or you could try Kreuther’s cream cheese, but really, if creme fraiche alone is good enough for Monsieur Kohln, it’s good enough for me.\u0026nbspInterestingly, Strasbourg textile designer and blogger Frédérique Froidevaux advises those watching their figure to use a mixture of half creme fraiche and half fromage blanc for a lighter result, explaining that, in the past, the cheaper fromage blanc was used alone. If you don’t add much, however – and I don’t think you need much – there’s no need to dilute it. I would mix it with some of the other toppings before spreading it, though it makes it go further and stops the onions from drying out.There’s very little variation here: onions and cured pork are the order of the day. Cut the former as thinly as possible and, to keep them nice and sweet, soften them in butter first, as both Monsieur Kohln and Vins d’Alsace suggest. I’d do the same for the pork, too, though it’s less important – fry it before the onions, so they can benefit from any rendered fat.That pork doesn’t have to be smoked, but for reasons of flavour, I’d strongly urge you to make sure it is the same goes for finding a cut with a decent amount of fat. That means streaky, rather than back – and go for lardons or slab bacon, if either is available the wafer-thin, cruelly trimmed slices favoured by British supermarkets these days will burn to a crisp in the oven.\u0026nbspRick Stein adds grated cheese (emmental or gruyère) in his latest book, Secret France, which makes his, strictly speaking, a flammekueche gratinée, while Froidevaux informs me that fresh mushrooms would make it a flammekueche forestière (perhaps a good option for those who don’t eat pork) a sweet spin can be made with stewed apple and sliced fruit. In fact, I’m sure you could put almost anything on there but, as with pizzas, that doesn’t necessarily mean you should.\u0026nbspRoux adds thyme to his tart, a flavour that works well with the other ingredients, but the warmth of nutmeg favoured by Kohln, Kreuther and Vins d’Alsace is even better. Most recipes are finished with a drizzle of oil but, for once, I don’t think it needs any extra fat. That said, to each their own.\u0026nbsp250g flour, preferably strong white bread½ tsp salt, plus extra for seasoning150ml water50ml neutral oil1 tbsp butter100g smoked streaky bacon or pancetta, preferably in one piece, or chunky lardons1 large onion75g creme fraiche1 good grating nutmegStart by making the base. Mix the flour and salt in a large bowl. In a jug, whisk the water and oil, then stir into the flour bowl and mix until you have a smooth dough. Continue mixing until it feels elastic, then cover and leave to rest for an hour.Meanwhile, peel and finely slice the onion (if you have one, a mandoline would be helpful here) and, if necessary, cut the bacon into chunky pieces.Melt the butter in a frying pan over a medium heat, fry the bacon until the fat begins to render, then scoop out with a slotted spoon and set aside, keeping as much fat in the pan as possible. Turn down the heat and fry the onions with a pinch of salt until soft and golden, but not browned.\u0026nbspHeat the oven, and a lightly greased baking tray, to 250C (conventional and fan)gas 9, or as hot as it will go. Mix the creme fraiche into the onions and season generously with nutmeg.\u0026nbspOn a lightly floured surface, roll or stretch out the dough into a rectangle or circle as close to 1mm thick as you can get it. Take the hot baking tray out of the oven, carefully transfer the base to it, then spread the onion mixture over the surface.\u0026nbspScatter the lardons all over the top, then bake for about 12 minutes, until the edges are crisp and well browned (the timings will depend on how hot your oven gets, so keep a beady eye on it). Cut into squares and serve immediately.\u0026nbsp• Flammekueche or tarte flambée – whatever you call it, how do you like yours? Bready or crunchy, creamy or cheesy – and where did you have the best one you’ve ever eaten? (I have happy memories of one eaten standing up at a wine festival in Colmar.)

Lys Mousset is visibly struggling for them, limping badly. For the second time in quick succession, the ball drifts out of play from the corner. What a waste ...36 min: Worrying times for Manchester United fans as Bruno Fernandes adjourns to the side of the pitch to receive treatment for a knee injury. There’s no break in play and after about a minute he sprints back into action.33 min: Sheffield United win a corner from which nothing comes after Victor Lindelof puts the ball out of play.32 min: Bruno Fernandes tries to pick out Marcus Rashford with a reverse pass in behind but the pair get their wires crossed and Sheffield United are able to clear. Marcus Rashford looks to be lacking a tiny bit of sharpness since returning from his busy lockdown - he had a quiet game against Tottenham and despite teeing up Martial for Manchester United’s opener tonight, has since missed an open goal. He’ll come good soon enough - there’s no denying his talent.30 min: Sheffield United enjoy a rare period of sustained possession on the edge of the final third but are unable to unpick the lock and Manchester United’s defence holds firm. John Lundstram eventually tries a shot from distance but his effort sails wide. 28 min: George Baldock plays a cross-field pass from right to left to Enda Stevens, but the Irishman is robbed of possession by Mason Greenwood. 26 min: “Sheffield United need to work out a way of winning the ball higher up the pitch,” says Gary Neville on Sky Sports. “They’re just going deeper and deeper.” Water break: What are the chances, do you think, of these water breaks becoming permanent fixtures and football matches being turned into games of four quarters rather than two halves? Before too long, don’t be surprised if TV networks start sneaking in a couple of adverts. Or maybe I’m just too cynical. 23 min: It’ll be time for the water break any second now and I suspect it can’t come quickly enough for Chris Wilder, who will doubtless have some instructions for his players after their diabolical start to this game. 21 min: Another corner for the hosts. Fernandes plays the ball to the far post, where Harry Maguire heads home. Anthony Taylor blows his whistle for a two-handed Maguire shove on Jagielka as he rose to head the ball and the goal is disallowed. A quick check by Stuart Attwell at VAR HQ later and play resumes. 19 min: More Manchester United pressure. Bruno Fernandes tries his luck from distance but Phil Jagielka blocks his effort. Fernandes looks a great signing for United.18 min: Bruno Fernandes tries to whip the ball into the top left-hand corner but Simon Moore tips the ball out for a corner. From the set piece, the referee spots an infringement as the ball comes into the penalty area and awards Sheffield United a free-kick.17 min: Rashford plays the ball forward to Luke Shaw in the inside left channel and he’s pulled to the ground by George Baldock. Free-kick for Manchester United, between the left side of the |Sheffield United penalty area and the touchline.15 min: A reminder that it’s the hottest day of the year in Manchester, if not the entire UK. Early indications suggest it could be a very long evening for Sheffield United.13 min: With Manchester United attacking on the break and Simon Moore committed, Martial turns provider and plays the ball a couple of yards to his right into the path of Marcus Rashford. The striker somehow contrives to side-foot the ball wide with an empty goal gaping in front of him. That was a lightning fast counter-attack, but Jack Robinson got back and did just enough to put Rashford off. That’s a shocking miss.12 min: Sheffield United seem a bit shell-shocked after going behind so early. George Baldock advances into the Manchester United penalty area and gets a sight of goal, but his shot is blocked.8 min: Martial really needed his wits about him there, doing well to convert a screamer of a delivery from Marcus Rashford. The patron saint of hungry British school children got in around Phil Jagielka at the byline and pulled the ball towards the edge of the six-yard box with phenomenal speed, but Martial was alert enough to get in front of his man at the near post and poke home from three yards. Manchester United lead as Anthony Martial converts a bullet-like low pull-back from Marcus Rashford at the near post.5 min: Manchester United go on the counter-attack and win their first corner when Anthony Martial tries and fails to take the ball past Chris Basham. Bruno Fernandes swings the ball into the Manchester United penalty area, where it’s only half cleared. A subsequent Nemanja Matic pass towards Mason Greenwood from the edge of the penalty area is cleared by Enda Stevens.4 min: Simon Moore gets his first touch of the game in the Sheffield United goal, fielding a back pass and sending the ball forward.2 min: Sheffield United begin on the front foot and Victor Lindelof is forced into action to deal with an Oliver Norwood cross aimed towards George Baldock. 1 min: Following a minute’s silence for former Manchester United full-back Tony Dunne, who died two weeks ago, the players take a knee and play begins. A Dubliner, Dunne played left-back in the Manchester United side that won the European Cup in 1968.Not long now: The teams are out on the pitch, the Stone Roses soundtracking their arrival in the empty Old Trafford with This Is The One. The stands are empty, but there are 40,000 digital images of fans from around the world in assorted stands. It looks quite good, to be fair. On Sky Sports: Graeme Souness is in as a pundit alongside Jamie Redknapp and is defending himself against the relentless criticism he gets for his relentless criticism of Paul Pogba.“I get hammered for this,” he says. “The midfield is the only position on the pitch where you’re trying to do the exact same thing ss the person you’re marking,” he adds, explaining that just for once he’d like to see Pogba go out and say he’s going to work harder than the guy he’s marking, rather than try to outdo him in the fancy tricks and flicks department.“I’m a huge fan of his ability,” Graeme concludes, making it abundantly clear that he’s not a huge fan of what he perceives to be the midfielder’s reluctance to put in a shift. Fair comment? For Manchester United, Ollie Gunnar Solskjær makes three changes from the side that started against Tottenham Hotspur. Paul Pogba gets his first start since September, while Nemanja Matic also starts in midfield with a beefed up Mason Greenwood playing in a front three. Fred, Scott McTominay and Dan James make way for the trio of newcomers.Five of the personnel who started Sheffield United’s defeat at the hands of Newcastle United are out today, with two of the changes enforced. Simon Moore starts in goal instead of Dean Henderson, who isn’t allowed to play against his parent club, while Phil Jagielka is in for the suspended John Egan. Further up the field, Lys Mousset, David McGoldrick and John Lundstram start, while Sander Berge, Billy Sharp and Oli McBurnie drop to the bench.Manchester United came from 2-0 down to take the lead but Oli McBurnie’s 90th-minute equaliser survived a VAR check for a 3-3 draw between the sides at Bramall Lane in November. Louise Taylor was there for the  ...Assistants: Gary Beswick and Adam NunnWith Dean Henderson’s loan deal from Manchester United due to expire on the final day of the month, Wilder is also confident of securing an extension to cover the end of the protracted season. “I believe it’s now just administration with the two clubs,” he said. “I had a chat with Ole and he was fine with extending his loan until the end of the season. Hopefully, that will get signed off before the deadline.”“We’ve developed over the season and I think now we had a spell of 11 unbeaten,” said Manchester United’s in the build-up to today’s game, when asked if he was planning a summer transfer splurge. “But then you add Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford to that and you’re thinking ‘Yeah, we’re not too far away and I’m very happy with the squad.“If there are any good deals to be made and players who can make us better, of course we might have to spend some money on that. But the squad is great to work with and it’s moving in the right direction. We’re still not where we want to be, close enough to challenge for the Premier League trophy but we take one step at a time.”Paul Pogba could make his first start for Manchester United since 30 September after impressing off the bench against Tottenham. Despite limping off against Tottenham, Victor Lindelof is available for selection, while Phil Jones and Axel Tuanzebe – unlikely starters at the best of times – remain sidelined with injuries.Sheffield United goalkeeper Dean Henderson has to sit this one out under the terms of his loan agreement with Manchester United, so expect Simon Moore to make just his fourth appearance of the season.John Egan will be watching from the naughty step after being sent off for two bookable offences against Newcastle over the weekend and will be replaced by Phil Jagielka, the veteran’s fitness permitting following an untimely twist of his ankle in training. Jack O’Connell, who has missed Sheffield United’s past two games through injury is reported by his manager, Chris Wilder, to be “progressing well”.An eerily empty and echoey Old Trafford is the setting for today’s match between Manchester United and Sheffield United, two teams harbouring notions of playing in next season’s Champions League.Five points behind Chelsea and just ahead of Wolves on goal difference, the hosts are fifth in the table but, with the outcome of Manchester City’s appeal against their Champions League ban still to be announced by the Court of Arbitration for Sport, have no idea if that will be good enough to earn them a return to European football’s top table. They must aim to reel in Chelsea and finish fourth. Three places and just two points behind them, it’s hardly unfair to say Sheffield United need at least a draw to keep their hopes of achieving Champions League qualification alive. Following their uncharacteristic horror show against Newcastle on Sunday, they will need to up their game to take some or all of the spoils home from Old Trafford.Having dominated the final 30 minutes of their draw with Tottenham Hotspur following the introduction of the lesser-spotted Paul Pogba, Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær ought to be reasonably confident on the back of his team’s first tentative steps out of lockdown. Kick-off is at 6pm (BST), but stay tuned in the meantime for team news and build-up."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bf6ce2a1ad7ad39b8b7ac4063d6ef0ef59729d48/0_53_4316_2591/master/4316.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d1e9b3527ccf15d992ebf35574871444","title":"norwich city v everton premier league live","story":"38 mins: Tettey tries to thread the ball through the defence but instead sends it out for a goal-kick.I am starting think about what the Hairy Bikers made on the programme on before this.

Norwich then take a woeful corner which does not beat the first man.16 mins: I must say, I admire the Playmobil stylings of Michael Keane’s hair. Solid. Calvert-Lewin spins, knocks the ball past Klose but is then cleaned out by the defender on the halfway line. 14 mins: Iwobi beats the defender, pulls the back but Tettey is there to meet it. Sadly, for the Norwich man, he passes it straight back to the winger who cannot make the most of it in the box.12 mins: Everton are on top here and look like they will be quite happy to keep the ball and move it side to side to create openings. Coleman almost gets on the end of a chip over the top but it just eludes him and bounces out of play. 10 mins: Digne gets down the line and whips in a cross, which is cleared. Another cross is sent in soon after but Calvert-Lewin gets under it and heads the ball straight to Krul.8 mins: Krul takes a poor touch when receiving a backpass but saves himself just in time as he whacks it clear before Calvert-Lewin can get to the ball.6 mins: I suspect the Canaries will just be desperate to be more solid than they were against Southampton at the weekend when they were cut open repeatedly.Holgate takes the ball up the pitch unchallenged but ruins it all by sending his through ball straight to Krul. 4 mins: A bit of a slow start with Everton looking slight brighter than Norwich.2 mins: The teams swapped ends before kick-off.

They may be in short supply on either team but at least referee Michael Oliver is still rocking a healthy lockdown haircut, sideburns and all.18 min: Bournemouth muster another corner after Romain Saïss is forced to clear a floated David Brooks free-kick, but it comes to nothing. Rui Patrício wellies it down the other end in search of Diogo Jota, who is a willing runner. It’s a straight fight between him and Adam Smith but the Bournemouth defender does brilliantly to nip in and head the ball clear. As it happens, Jota is penalised for giving Smith a nudge on his way to ground.15 min: Wolves fail to make the most of their first corner. It stemmed from a sloppy mistake by the returning Philip Billing on the edge of the Bournemouth box.14 min: Rúben Neves takes aim but, unusually, it’s high, wide and handsome.

The players will be very grateful of the drinks breaks in either half. I know I will be. By the time the first drinks break came around on Saturday evening, Bournemouth already trailed by two goals. They cannot afford for that to happen again.We have a bit of a MBM feast, you lucky things:Bad news for Bournemouth: Adama Traoré returns to the starting lineup for Wolves and, not only that, but Joshua King is absent through injury after taking a whack against Crystal Palace. Jack Stacey or Adam Smith, depending on which wing Traoré spends his time, could be in for a long night. Philip Billing is in for Harry Wilson and Junior Stanislas replaces King but Bournemouth are otherwise unchanged. Leander Dendoncker drops to the bench for Wolves as Nuno just makes one change for the game at Molineux.This is biggie for both teams. Wolves can continue their push for another round of European football next season, while Bournemouth, fighting for points at the other end of the table, cannot afford to surrender another game as feebly as they did last weekend against Crystal Palace. Eddie Howe’s side could have done without at trip to Molineux to face a team that, since New Year’s Day, have only been beaten by Liverpool in the Premier League. Given Bournemouth’s dire away form, it is fair to say they face an uphill task. Nuno Espírito Santo’s skeleton squad have proved a tough nut to crack and have been relentless pretty much all season, despite this being their 50th game of a season that began almost 12 months ago – they are still fighting on two fronts, with the return leg of a last-16 tie against Olympiakos to come in August – and showed no let-up in victory at West Ham on Saturday. Raúl Jiménez is as good a striker as there is in the Premier League, while Adama Traoré has been scarily potent, combining his raw strength and speed with a devilish end product."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/893c4234ce16d684159cfc88b869209cae30b022/70_0_2048_1229/master/2048.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=193bd1a4f09548a651d062048dfc9b13","title":"ditch the fan how to stay cool when home working in a heatwave","story":"Overheating without workplace air conditioning? These essential tips from one seasoned home-worker will make the rising temperature a breezeThis is set to be the hottest week of the year so far. Usually that doesn’t matter, because usually your workplace is comfortably air-conditioned. But now you are working from home, in a residence that has been specifically insulated to remain warm in winter. In short, things are about to get uncomfortable.This is where I step in. For the past three years, I have worked from a garden office that effectively acts as a giant greenhouse and, in the summer months, runs between five and 10 degrees warmer than the air outside. It is hellish, but on the plus side I have developed some coping strategies. Follow my lead and you, too, can minimise the discomfort.You are working from home. HR cannot be offended if you don’t get properly dressed. At the very least, remove your socks. As things become more and more unbearable, there is no shame in stripping off – but be sure to leave some clothes nearby if you do. That way, you will panic less whenever a delivery driver knocks. This is hard-fought personal experience talking.The trick here is to open your windows but close your curtains. You want a breeze, because there is nothing worse than sitting in an airless room for an extended period during a heatwave, but you also want to keep the sun out.Even sitting still in a heatwave is a recipe for sweat, so be sure to keep your fluid levels up throughout the day. Get a water bottle and take regular sips. Avoid tea or coffee, because caffeine will dehydrate you. Your reward for drinking more water will be getting to spend more time sitting against the cold porcelain of your toilet. Don’t tell me that doesn’t sound like heaven right now.There is a reason why we eat salads in the summer – components such as lettuce, celery and cucumber have a high water content to keep you better hydrated – so these should form your new lunches. Meanwhile, try to cut meat from your diet. When your body breaks down meat, it expends extra energy, which causes heat. This is a process called thermogenesis, but you might know it better as meat sweats.I bought a fan for my office during the last heatwave, and it’s rubbish. All it does is push hot air around, which helps nobody. If you do buy a fan, freeze a two-litre bottle of water and place it between the fan and you, which should help to cool the air.If outside is cooler than inside, it makes sense to go outside regularly. Walk around your garden. Sit in a park. And leave your phone at home, because the last thing you need is a roasting-hot electronic device nestled next to your thigh.If you see someone sitting with a laptop in the park, know that they are an absolute WFH novice whose behaviour should never be emulated. Working outside is something everyone tries once and then quickly abandons. The glare from the sun stops you from seeing your screen. Your posture will be awful, and you will start to ache. If you are not careful, you’ll burn. There are too many distractions. And wasps. Working outdoors is a mug’s game.This is not ecologically sound in any way at all, but needs must. Your house does not have air-conditioning, but your car does. If you get a break during the day, drive around for 10 minutes to cool down. The fastest way to cool down when things get too awful is to apply something cold to your pulse points. A cold wet towel on the back of your neck will cool your brainstem, which regulates temperature. A bag of frozen peas on your wrists or behind your knees will also work wonders.This, though, is the top tip. If you are working from home and your boss isn’t a complete monster, try not to do any work when the temperature is at its most brutal. I start working at 6am, for instance, because that maximises the amount of work I can get done before the heat becomes intolerable. I also know tenured home-workers who switch to night work during the hotter months. The main thing is that you leave the hottest part of the day free to relax. And this is why, the second I finish writing this, I am going to switch off my computer and sit in the park with my children. Once I’ve put some trousers on first, obviously."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74761d0d1d2fd4eb3c803d4a05edf88d303cae07/0_150_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7fb2dd2c96d5dec5639e10f8722d6436","title":"coronavirus lockdown eased 4 july england pub hairdresser gym","story":"People in England will able to visit a pub, restaurant or hairdresser, but not a gymThe government has announced an easing of lockdown rules in England from 4 July. Hospitality and leisure businesses will be allowed to reopen, and there will be more freedom to see other people.From 4 July you will able to go to a pub, cafe or restaurant, visit a museum, library or theme park, watch a film at a cinema, or stay in a hotel or on campsite – as long as the venue can open safely. You can also be part of a group meeting at a place of worship. If you need to sort out your lockdown hair, you will be able to go to a hairdresser or barber.You can’t go to the gym or do any type of exercise class – the risk is still too great to allow people to breathe heavily while in close proximity. The risk level also means that you can’t watch a play, except on a screen, or live music. Soft play areas will still be closed, as will activities that involve sharing or borrowing equipment – for example bowling or ice-skating. In more bad news for anyone trying to shake off any lockdown pounds, swimming pools will remain closed. Beauty salons, casinos and nightclubs won’t reopen yet, nor will cricket clubs. If you are a church goer, you will not be allowed to sing at services.Yes – and friends. But it is complicated. You will be able to spend time indoors or outside with another household, either at home or at a pub or restaurant. If you are outside at a pub, you can meet up to five people from more than two households, but if you are inside the two household rule applies. Social distancing of 1-metre-plus will apply in all cases.If you are already in a support bubble, that will count as one household so you can all visit another set of friends or family. You can stay overnight at someone’s home and there are no restrictions on how far you can travel to see people. But again the 1- metre-plus social distancing rule applies.Yes, over-70s can meet others under the easing, but they have been advised to remain especially cautious as their risk of complications if they do get Covid-19 is higher than for younger people.The government says the fall in the number of infections and the fact that the R rate – the number of people each virus-positive person infects – has remained below 1 means it can reduce the social distancing guidance for England. Instead of insisting that businesses cater for people to stay 2 metres apart, the guidance has been reduced to 1-metre-plus. This means that people can be closer as long as there are other safety measures in place – such as more handwashing facilities and screens at venues, or you could be asked to wear a face mask or sit so you are not facing other people.It’s a yes to staycations – you can stay overnight at holiday homes and second homes, book hotels, caravan parks and campsites, and tourist attractions can reopen. You can visit one other household, as long as you maintain social distancing.As for trips abroad, the government is in discussion to create “air bridges” with other countries, which would allow people to travel without quarantining, and an announcement is expected in the next few days. The countries being considered include holiday favourites such as France, Italy, Spain and Greece.At the weekend Tui said it would resume trips to Spain and Greece on 11 July, suggesting that the ban on travel could end by then.In Wales there is no date set for pubs and other leisure outlets to reopen but tourism businesses have been told they can open on 6 July and take bookings from 13 July. It’s a similar situation in Scotland, although tourism could reopen in the middle of the month. In Northern Ireland pubs, cafes and restaurants can reopen from 3 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4b202ba8de986a737d3646af9539146f943859ab/700_330_3662_2198/master/3662.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdG8tZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=09e55c9d5734b142355c83cf51693e15","title":"you cant pay cash here how cashless society harms most vulnerable","story":"Retailers and banks have been pushing us to use contactless payments and online services for hygiene reasons. But many older, abused and unbanked people still depend on cash. What will happen to them?It had taken so much for Tina to get to the supermarket to go home empty-handed left her in tears. Tina, 47, has conditions including chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety and depression. She should not have been out at all, but, although her doctor had told her to shield indoors, she had not been put on the government’s high-risk list, meaning she has to do her food shopping herself.Tina had taken the bus from her home in Kent to her local supermarket. She had queued up outside, which is tough when you are on crutches – standing up for any period of time is fatiguing. When she got into the supermarket, she hustled around as quickly as she could and was relieved to find they had almost everything she needed. At the till, the checkout assistant scanned Tina’s items. She got out her cash. The checkout operator waved it away. “You can’t pay cash in here,” she told Tina. “It’s against the law.”Tina knew that could not be true. “I said: ‘It’s not the law,’” Tina remembers. “‘You can only refuse a note if it’s a forgery. It’s the Queen’s legal tender!’” But the checkout operator insisted – it was a card payment or nothing. Tina told her that she could not pay by card because she did not have enough money in her account to cover the shopping. The checkout operator would not budge. “I got the bus home in tears.”Tina is one of the many people who have struggled to purchase necessities during the coronavirus pandemic, as retailers increasingly refuse to take cash. A recent study of more than 2,000 people by the consumer group Which? found that one in 10 people were refused by shops when trying to purchase essential items with cash during the pandemic. Which? has long been calling on the government to protect cash as a payment option, with some success: the chancellor of the exchequer, Rishi Sunak, pledged to protect access to cash in his 11 March budget.If you have ever seen a queue outside banks or post offices to pay bills in cash, you may have seen people like Tina. As is the case for many people on benefits, low incomes or without access to online banking, Tina usually withdraws her personal independence payment and her employment and support allowance in cash. She then tops up her gas and electric at the bank, where she also pays her council tax, and puts the rest aside for food.Those of us who use contactless payment technology routinely scarcely noticed the coronavirus-induced switch to a virtually cashless economy, apart from the limit being increased to £45. But for the approximately 1.2 million people living in the UK who are unbanked – meaning they don’t have access to any bank account – buying essentials became a herculean undertaking. “People without legal immigration status in the UK are not legally allowed to open a bank account,” says James Tullett of the migrant and refugee charity Ramfel. When shops refuse to take cash from these people, they leave them vulnerable to bad actors, Tullett adds. “They are likely to use informal services, which are more open to being exploited.”It is not only unbanked people who will have struggled during the pandemic. People with bank accounts prefer to use cash for a variety of practical and personal reasons. “Those who rely on cash are the most vulnerable people in our society,” says Ceeney. “They may live in a rural area where they can’t get the decent broadband or mobile signal they need for online banking. Or they may be older or on low incomes.”Domestic abuse survivors often squirrel away emergency cash – the odd fiver here and there is easy to hide. “Access to cash is really important,” says Nicola Sharp of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, “both in terms of their ability to flee and their safety after fleeing.” She explains that many abusers monitor bank transactions, leaving survivors reliant on cash. “Measures to go cashless create a context in which it is more difficult for survivors to access the cash they need,” Sharp says. Age UK received a surge of phone calls in the third week of lockdown, as older people with diminishing reserves worried about how they would reimburse neighbours and relatives for their food shopping. In response, Barclays, NatWest and Tesco Bank started sending out cash through the post. But some older people were left with no choice but to hand over their bank cards to strangers and trust them to do the right thing.“I will not do banking on the iPad at all,” says Audrey, an 87-year-old retiree from Bedfordshire. “I just refuse to do it.” Normally, this poses no problem: it is a 15-minute walk from Audrey’s house to her local building society. But during coronavirus, Audrey – who has lived alone since her husband died eight years ago – has relied on her son to withdraw cash for her, which she gives to her neighbours for food shopping. “I put the cash in an envelope and leave it on the doorstep,” says Audrey. But she worries about older people without family to help out. “What if you don’t have a family?” she asks. “How do you get cash then?”Consumers and retailers favour contactless payments for hygiene reasons: there is no need for customers to handle chip-and-pin machines. “Covid has been a massive win for the digital payments industry, and the digital world more generally, as people retreat from the physical,” says Brett Scott, author of The Heretic’s Guide to Global Finance.But, as the economy switched to contactless in a matter of days, many people were left behind. Jaki Whyte, 38, from Colchester, has only a chip-and-pin debit card. This proved difficult during the pandemic, as Whyte – who is disabled and on the shielding list – relies on care workers to pick up supplies. On three occasions, White’s care workers were refused at her local pharmacy because her card was not contactless. (She is not registered for online banking because she can’t afford the data on her phone and, until the banks reopen, she is not able to request a contactless payment card.) “It took nearly two and a half months to get what I needed,” Whyte says, “and only because a family member got a lift into town to help me out.”When Whyte ventures back into the world, she will probably find it more difficult than ever to purchase necessities. “When we emerge from covid,” says Ceeney, “our cash infrastructure will be even more unviable, and it’s likely we’ll see more bank closures. Shops need to deposit cash. If they don’t have a local bank branch where they can do that, it makes taking cash really difficult. That’s why more retailers are going to go cashless.”Some would argue that a cashless society is the future who are we to resist it? Surely people such as Audrey should receive digital literacy training and those who refuse should be corralled through the removal of ATMs, bank closures and card-only tills until the narrowing and more desperate cadre of digital refuseniks is finally obliterated. But there are ideological reasons to resist going cashless. “The war on cash is a bigger issue than people realise,” says Scott.The private banking sector, and payment companies such as Visa and Mastercard, want us to stop using cash. “These guys have been battling against cash,” Scott says. “They view cash as a cost.” (By contrast, state-run banks generally try to preserve access to cash.) When we move towards a cashless society, Scott explains, we are locked into the private banking system. “Imagine you go to a casino and you have cash with you – state money,” Scott says. “The casino gives you chips, which you can cash out when you leave. A similar thing goes on in the private banking sector. Every time they close branches or cut ATMs, they’re preventing you from exiting their system. Our ability to exit the banking sector is the single greatest thing that holds banks in check,” Scott says.The slide towards a cashless economy also raises privacy concerns. “With digital systems, there are huge amounts of data,” Scott says. “When you can see what people are buying, you can start to block payments, chaperone payments, mess with payments … financial data is one of the most sensitive forms of data around.” Moving to a digital-first system benefits the major players, something Audrey understands intuitively. “It’s all right for the big boys, for the banks,” Audrey says. “It makes their lives easy for them: no cash! But I don’t think for the small traders it will do them any good.” Retailers usually pay fees on contactless payments. She worries about how service industry workers will fare. “Suppose you go on a coach outing,” Audrey says. “Normally you put 50p into a whip-round for the guide. How would you do a whip-round if you haven’t got any cash?”This Covid-19-accelerated move to a cashless economy will hurt the most vulnerable in our society the most. “Cash dependence mirrors classic vulnerabilities in terms of income, disability and race,” says Ceeney. People who earn less than £10,000 are 14 times more likely to be dependent on cash than those who earn more than £30,000 a year. “The reason for this is primarily budgeting,” Ceeney explains. “If you’re a gig economy worker, direct debits can be dangerous. If you have a fixed amount of money in cash, you can budget for exactly what you have.” Contactless payments, which can often take a few days to come out of accounts, can skew a precarious financial balance.This is the reason Whyte prefers to use cash. “I can see in my hands how much, physically, I’ve got,” she explains. “I can’t budget when it’s not cash – I don’t know where I’ve spent my money. I can’t do mental maths like that.” Cash is either there or it is not – Tina also does not have to worry about a direct debit looming out of the digital ether and destabilising her finances. “I know what it’s like to go without food, gas or electric,” she says. “With cash, I know exactly how much is in my purse.”For Tina, having to switch to digital payments during the pandemic has been stressful. She recently got out of debt with the help of the charity Christians Against Poverty. Having to set up card payments during the pandemic – she could not pay for her gas or electricity at the bank – caused her mental health to deteriorate. Her daughter helped, but still Tina worries. “What if I’ve done something wrong and the bill hasn’t been paid?” Tina says. “It’s made my anxiety worse.”What are the long-term implications of starving a nation of its access to cash? More anxiety for Tina. Increased exploitation of unbanked people. Fewer options for women fleeing abusive relationships. People who beg and charities that rely on cash donations disadvantaged. A public locked into a private banking system from which we have no escape and increasingly less autonomy. “If we go to a cashless society, I won’t be able to cope,” Tina says.“Cash is really the bicycle of payments,” says Scott. “It preceded the car and is still popular today. We need to have a multimodal form of payment systems … cash and card working together, just as bicycles and car lanes go together.” Because, although cash may be a pain to carry around sometimes, it is actually pretty useful."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3095f6032b55f9daaf9696f8475070ece49cf2e/0_279_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=3d4ad6331e7429f5f6955c366dc4bdd8 1400w","title":"boris the narcissists narcissist flails wildly as pmqs exposes cracks","story":"The PM can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir StarmerWhat a difference a day makes. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson had been in his comfort zone. The Mr Bright Side telling the Commons more or less what it wanted to hear and getting little pushback even from opposition MPs. The saviour releasing the country from months of hibernation. Trusting everyone to still observe the essentials of social distancing even while they were getting pissed in newly-opened pubs and bars.Prime minister’s questions, though, exposes Boris’s fallibilities. Not because he is too lazy to properly prepare and isn’t nearly as clever as he imagines himself to be – though both of those things are true – but because the very idea causes his psyche to go into meltdown. Johnson is the narcissists’ narcissist. He believes in his inalienable right to do whatever he pleases. Even the merest hint of a challenge is an insult to his fragile ego.Someone more self-aware might realise that the coronavirus is nowhere near half-done. That mistakes have been made and others may well be in the future. That the pandemic can make fools of anyone and a degree of humility might be in order if he is to keep the country onside in the weeks and months ahead. People can forgive a lot if they feel they aren’t being taken for mugs. But for Boris any admission of failure or liability is a psychological impossibility.Asking Boris to take responsibility for his own actions is pointless. He just can’t do it, because he is the centre of his own universe, locked into his own closed system of thought. What he wants he must have. So it follows that whatever he does must automatically be right. People who disagree with him or are no longer useful to him are easily discarded as inconveniences.The trouble is that Boris can dump wives, mistresses, ministers and friends but he just can’t get rid of Keir Starmer. For the first time in his life, Johnson has come up against an immovable object. And rather than accept the inevitable, Boris has merely allowed himself to regress.Initially he saw the Labour leader as a mild inconvenience – an unwelcome intrusion into his alternative reality – but, after discovering that he couldn’t make him go away with mockery, a few cheap gags and by trying to turn the session into an interrogation of Starmer, his feelings have turned to hatred. Keir has got under his opponent’s skin. Somewhere in Boris’s subconscious he knows that Starmer is both better briefed and a great deal sharper and he can’t bear it. So all he can do is lash out, flailing wildly, tilting at windmills.Part of Starmer’s skill is to keep things simple. His questions have a logic that even a 10-year old can follow. It’s just a shame that Boris is still stuck in the toddler age of development. The Labour leader began by pointing out that easing restrictions was all very well providing that the track and trace system was functioning properly. Which at present it wasn’t as it was missing two-thirds of cases. So how did the government propose to get it working properly by 4 July? Boris was outraged. How could the person who had offered him cautious support the day before dare to now challenge him on the detail? That was the kind of disloyalty only he was allowed. The Labour leader just kept plugging away. This wasn’t obstruction, it was constructive criticism, he observed, as he reiterated the point that he was quoting from the government’s own data and wasn’t interested in the one-third of the system that was working. He then moved on to the app that had been downgraded in the past few weeks from critical and world-beating to ‘additional support’ before observing that the prime minister had misled the house on the child poverty figures last week and would he mind correcting himself. Just for the record.All that Boris had to offer was histrionics and lies. Gestures of feigned “What me Guv?” innocence, combined with blatant untruths. Boris still labours under the impression that if you tell a lie often enough then it somehow becomes true. But what might work on the campaign trail on the side of buses just doesn’t cut it when you’re supposed to be the prime minister during the greatest health crisis for a century.We reached full-on meltdown shortly after Johnson claimed he had never said the app would be anything other than “icing on the cake” – since Boris begins each day as a tabula rasa, he must think the rest of us are equally amnesiac – when he went back to the tactic of asking Starmer about schools that had been moderately successful the week before. Only this time it failed dismally as Starmer had long since answered it.The few dozen Tory backbenchers in the chamber kept their heads down. They were as embarrassed as Boris would have been had he the capacity for that level of empathy. It’s slowly dawning on most Tories that Boris just isn’t up to the job as they witness their leader unravel at PMQs week after week. Nor do many have much faith in his ability to make the right calls at the right time with the pandemic. And having used up what little good will he might have had – Boris has never bothered to conceal his contempt for most, make that all, of his colleagues – his support is dwindling.Too many more PMQs like this and something will start to give. And as Boris is incapable of change, then it can’t be long before his suitability for the job comes under scrutiny from his own party. It was probably always inevitable that the person who would ultimately destroy Boris was Boris himself. But Starmer is doing a great job of exposing his faults. There is a crack in everything. That’s how the light gets in."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9902d6a2af850c018b2050ac3a888ed7bee058d2/0_136_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=e499ea047cd436fe6daed96219fb3372","title":"dominic cummings could face inquiry over special advisers","story":"Exclusive: MPs asked to examine whether PM’s chief of staff exerts excessive control• Gazza, Caino and Roxstar: the strange world of Dominic Cummings’ ‘spads’Dominic Cummings is facing a possible parliamentary inquiry following claims No 10 is exerting excessive control over ministers’ special advisers, the  has learned.The FDA union, which represents more than a dozen “spads”, has asked the public administration and constitutional affairs committee to investigate why the prime minister’s chief of staff has been given extra powers. It follows concerns that Cummings, on behalf of Boris Johnson, has centralised power in No 10 and is impeding the roles of cabinet ministers and parliament.According to latest government figures, there were 109 special advisers in December, more than half of whom were new to government, costing just under £10m a year. In the past, cabinet ministers typically hired and oversaw their own special advisers, who are political appointees paid from the public purse, though the prime minister approved all appointments.Since September, the Cabinet Office has required advisers to sign new contracts, which say the responsibility for their conduct and discipline will be jointly held between the appointing minister and the PM’s chief of staff.Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA, has written to William Wragg, chair of the committee, saying there is mounting evidence that the role of spads has been radically altered to break the link with ministers and put Cummings in charge.“We have a cadre of special advisers with little security of employment and who are being directly managed by No 10 through the PM’s chief of staff. Even without the concern over how this power over employment is being deployed, it is clear that there is a deliberate approach from No 10 to fundamentally change the nature of the role,” he wrote.The committee has agreed to examine the complaint, which could result in Cummings being asked to give evidence to MPs.The FDA letter claimed that weekly meetings for special advisers, chaired by Cummings, are being used to enforce the idea that spads are now run from Downing Street, not by ministers.“There was a consistent message that special advisers were being directed in their work and essentially centrally run. The conduct of these meetings was also criticised as being overly confrontational,” Penman wrote.Following the election, Penman added, spads were being used as a central resource and moved around different departments by No 10.“This resulted in some special advisers being left without posts, and concern that the process for determining who stayed, moved or left not only lacked transparency, but was being used to exert control and dilute the relationship between minister and adviser,” he wrote.One former permanent secretary told the  there was a belief in Whitehall that Cummings was forcing out independent-minded advisers to create a pool of spads who could keep an eye on departments. “The concept of ‘No 10 narks’, placed in departments to keep a close eye on ministers and civil servants, is gaining ground,” he said.Cummings is facing a sex discrimination claim from Sajid Javid’s former special adviser Sonia Khan, after she was frogmarched out of Downing Street by a police officer last year. Javid resigned as chancellor in February after refusing to fire all five of his advisers.Before Johnson, special advisers were chosen by ministers themselves and worked directly to them, but were ultimately hired by the PM.In a further development, the Conservative party has launched a new process for the hiring of media and digital staff using the website www.spadjobs.uk.In a break from tradition, the strategic advisory firm Hanbury Strategy will do the initial recruitment. Paul Stephenson, a founding partner of the firm, was director of communications for the Vote Leave campaign.Though the initial screening will be done by Hanbury, the new intake of spads will only be appointed if the government’s director of communications, Lee Cain, approves, which is said to be the normal hiring convention. The Conservative party did not respond to a request for a comment.Cummings, the former Vote Leave campaigner who worked closely with Johnson during the general election, has faced intense criticism for driving 260 miles to Durham with his sick wife during the height of the coronavirus pandemic and making a further 52 miles round trip to Barnard Castle to test his eyesight.A spokesperson for the select committee said MPs were considering whether to hold an evidence session or launch a full inquiry in light of a backlog of inquiries because of Covid-19.No 10 did not respond to a request for a comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c9cbafc0b3a21dffc69439e6d91a86da80825f7d/24_0_3451_2070/master/3451.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cd619fc7db57ed2247ed82afb6b25afb","title":"uk border force detained pregnant woman for 24 hours inspectors find","story":"Report says children are routinely handcuffed and those detained often held in ‘very poor conditions’ A pregnant woman was detained at the UK border for more than 24 hours with “little meaningful contact”, a damning report into the agency responsible for controlling entry to the country has revealed.Children are being routinely handcuffed by Border Force when they arrive in the UK before they are detained in its short-term holding facilities, which are often in “very poor” condition, inspectors said.Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons (HMIP) visited sites at eight seaports and five airports in March – the first time the inspectors had assessed them on a national basis.Inspectors hit out at Border Force, which is part of the Home Office, for an “alarming” lack of oversight as the organisation was unable to tell them how many short-term detention cells it ran or how long detainees were held for.Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, said: “The fact that Border Force senior managers could not even tell us with certainty which of their ports actually had detention facilities suggests an alarming lack of oversight and accountability.”He added: “There is an urgent need for Border Force managers to undertake a comprehensive national audit of detention, to assure themselves and the public that all sites of detention are identified, properly equipped for holding detainees and subject to consistent management.”Migrants detained at airports generally arrived after short flights, usually from Europe, while those stopped at ferry docks arrived on foot or by car, most after “arduous and often dangerous journeys concealed in lorries and containers”, Clarke said.He said staff tried to provide “respectful detention” but added: “These detainees were subsequently held in often very poor conditions.“Local Border Force staff were themselves commonly embarrassed by the low standard of accommodation and lack of facilities.”According to the report, inspectors became aware last year they had not been notified of some short-term holding facilities being used by Border Force.The organisation subsequently provided a list of 11, nine of which were previously unknown to inspectors.Holly Lynch, the shadow immigration minister, said: “The Border Force has come under real pressure in this pandemic – and this is set to increase as quarantine rules are loosened. Once again we are calling on the government to ensure both compassion and competence underpin the work of Border Force.”A Home Office spokesperson said: “We take the criticisms contained in this report seriously and work to make improvements is already under way.“An audit of all Border Force-run short-term holding facilities, which will establish national accommodation standards, was launched last month and new processes for record keeping, to ensure length of detention is kept to a minimum, have been developed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1a492d40bbfa7cbd79f24dc3ccd20d124a8f076/0_78_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=16fc2f8e0e3130406cd8cc8929d5db88","title":"have you become unemployed due to coronavirus","story":"If you live in the UK and are worried about losing your job due to coronavirus, we would like to hear from youAccording to a former Bank of England official, unemployment in Britain  may surpass the levels reached during the Great Depression in the 1930s.David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Darmouth College in the US, said unemployment was rising at the fastest rate in living memory.If you have become unemployed due to the pandemic, we would like to hear from you.When were you made unemployed and what were the reasons?

They say “substantial challenges remain” despite many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus “beginning” to be put in place. The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase, they suggest.A review into the UK’s handling of Covid-19 so far is “crucial, they write, and needs to happen soon if the public is to have confidence that the virus can be contained”.The review should “not be about looking back or attributing blame. Rather it should be a rapid and forward-looking assessment of national preparedness, based on an examination of the complex and interrelated policy areas.”They suggest it should not be handled by select committees in parliament but by a cross-party commission, establishing “a constructive, non-partisan, four nations approach that could rapidly produce practical recommendations for action, based on what we have all learnt, and without itself becoming a distraction for those at the front line or in government”.Epidemics of infectious diseases behave in different ways but the\u0026nbsp1918 influenza pandemic\u0026nbspthat killed more than 50 million people is regarded as a key example of a pandemic that occurred in multiple waves, with the latter more severe than the first. It has been replicated – albeit more mildly – in subsequent flu pandemics.How and why multiple-wave outbreaks occur, and how subsequent waves of infection can be prevented, has become a staple of epidemiological modelling studies and pandemic preparation, which have looked at everything from social behaviour and health policy to vaccination and the buildup of community immunity, also known as herd immunity.This is being watched very carefully. Without a vaccine, and with no widespread immunity to the new disease, one alarm is being sounded by the experience of Singapore, which has seen a sudden\u0026nbspresurgence in infections\u0026nbspdespite being lauded for its early handling of the outbreak.Although Singapore instituted a strong contact tracing system for its general population, the disease re-emerged in\u0026nbspcramped dormitory accommodation\u0026nbspused by thousands of foreign workers with inadequate hygiene facilities and shared canteens.Singapore’s experience, although very specific, has demonstrated the ability of the disease to come back strongly in places where people are in close proximity and its ability to exploit any weakness in public health regimes set up to counter it.In June 2020, Beijing suffered from a new cluster of coronavirus cases which caused authorities to re-implement restrictions that CHina had previously been able to lift.Conventional wisdom among scientists suggests second waves of resistant infections occur after the capacity for treatment and isolation becomes exhausted. In this case the concern is that the social and political consensus supporting lockdowns is being overtaken by public frustration and the urgent need to reopen economies.The threat declines when susceptibility of the population to the disease falls below a certain threshold or when widespread vaccination becomes available.In general terms the ratio of susceptible and immune iniduals in a population at the end of one wave determines the potential magnitude of a subsequent wave. The worry right now is that with\u0026nbspa vaccine still many months away, and the real rate of infection only being guessed at, populations worldwide remain highly vulnerable to both resurgence and subsequent waves.Polls show that a majority of the public now support an inquiry, with the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, requesting a full public inquiry. “There’s a strong case for an immediate assessment of national preparedness, with the first results available no later than August, and that all its work should be completed by the end of October,” the health leaders argue.Ministers have already said the temporary Nightingale hospitals set up in case the NHS was overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases will remain on standby over the coming months.Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday the biggest easing to date of the coronavirus lockdown in England. The prime minister said the 2-metre distancing rule would be replaced with a “1-metre-plus” rule, paving the way for pubs, restaurants, hotels and cinemas to begin reopening from 4 July."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6abefe8497ec34f1ff138f345afd320260fd70c6/68_0_3224_1934/master/3224.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=86adbf029318fdd01dfdb29e32753232","title":"cricket clare connor first female mcc president in 233 year history","story":"Clare Connor, a former England captain, has been named as the next president of the Marylebone Cricket Club and will become the first female president in the MCC’s 233-year history.The decision was confirmed at an annual general meeting on Wednesday - held via an online platform - and the 43-year-old former all-rounder will take up the post on 1 October next year. Kumar Sangakkara, the current president, has been invited to remain in the role for a second 12-month tenure due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on cricket.Connor, the England and Wales Cricket Board’s managing director of women’s cricket, said: “I am deeply honoured to be named the next president of MCC. Cricket has enriched my life so deeply already, and now it hands me this wonderful privilege.“We often need to look back to see how far we’ve come. I made my first visit to Lord’s as a starry-eyed, cricket-obsessed nine-year-old girl at a time when women were not welcome in the Long Room. Times have changed. Now I find myself entrusted with this remarkable opportunity, the opportunity to play a part in helping MCC, cricket’s most influential club, to thrive and grow in an even more modern and inclusive future.“MCC does wonderful work for communities in the UK and overseas. It stages the most uplifting events. It brings people together. And as we take small steps to emerge from this uncertain and difficult time, we are going to need the power of sport and strong sporting organisations like the MCC more than ever. I really am very proud to have been asked to be its next president.”Should Sangakkara’s two-year term be approved, Connor’s tenure will start on 1 October 2021 and conclude on 30 September 2022. Sangakkara, the former Sri Lanka international who became the first non-British president of the MCC when he assumed office in October 2019, added: “I am thrilled that Clare has accepted the invitation to become the next president of MCC.“The club has a significant role to play in cricket’s global appeal and with her influence, I am sure she will make a considerable contribution to MCC. With the extended lead-in time until she takes office, she will have an important part to play as President Designate.”Connor made her England debut at the age of 19 in 1995 and went on to become captain of her country in 2000 before retiring six years later."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/853d3a08d0d1832ec9b267248a3c186c6c97d4eb/0_550_8256_4954/master/8256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b0c0298453403e5455a4a3398cc5fee","title":"england and wales cricket clubs face lost summer amid lockdown","story":"Fans and players express disappointment at government’s decision not to lift ban on matchesPerched on a hilltop just north of Bath, the Broadleys ground, home of Marshfield CC, looks picture-postcard perfect. The playing surface has been cut and rolled, the spectators’ benches are in place, the practice nets ripple in the summer breeze.The only problem is that no competitive sport is being played here, and the prime minister’s assertion that the cricket ball is a “natural vector” for Covid-19 has left players, coaches and supporters scratching their heads and worrying about when the next match will take place.“People are very frustrated,” said the club secretary, Ben White, “especially as the weather has been so cracking. The club has been doing so well. Our first team was promoted last year, the youth section has been building brilliantly. There was a buzz about the place. Then, bang, you can’t play cricket.”Many fans of recreational cricket are baffled that people in England can visit shops and will soon be able to head to pubs, restaurants and hairdressers. Tennis and basketball courts have been allowed to open but cricket matches remain off.“It’s a funny one,” said White. “Cricket is a non-contact sport. Most of the time you’re miles away from anyone else. I find it tricky to understand.”In common with many village clubs, Marshfield CC, motto: village cricket at its best, is at the heart of the community. Robin Hand, a stalwart of the youth section, which last year numbered more than 200 girls and boys, said that Friday night training was usually one of the highlights of village life.“People from the village and surrounding areas descend on the ground to drink, eat and talk together,” he said. “Parents can decompress after a busy week at work, players can whack a ball to finish the school week. New friendships are formed, old ones paused by the winter are re-energised.”Training for men, women and children has carefully resumed at clubs like Marshfield in recent weeks, with safety measures in place and reduced numbers. But bars remain shut and the loss of actual matches is keenly felt.Marshfield first team scorer Jonathan Burnstone said he was missing matches enormously. “The routine and patterns of a summer weekend are lost: the chat, the rivalries, a hard-fought game, the teas and the cosiness of the bar afterwards. It’s hard to think that we might have to wait another year until things return to some semblance of normality.”Boris Johnson’s “vector” comments have confused many, including the English and Wales Cricket Board, which issued a statement saying that it still hoped recreational cricket would start next month, and Bharat Pankhania, an expert on communicable disease at Exeter University, and a huge cricket fan.Alan Birkinshaw, development officer at the Bradford Premier League, said it had fully expected to relaunch. “People were buoyed up, ready to play. Now there’s a sense of disgust and disappointment,” he said.Clubs across the country are counting the cost of lost revenue from membership fees and bar takings. Birkinshaw fears that if cricket doesn’t fully resume, a generation of youngsters will be lost to other sports or computer games. “This should have been a great year,” he said.The grassroots competitive game is also on pause in Wales. Chris Thorne, the head of senior cricket at St Fagans, a village on the outskirts of Cardiff, said: “The consequences of a lost summer of cricket will be hugely damaging for clubs. The cricket authorities need to hammer home the message with government to ensure we can get the show back on the road as soon as possible.”As the hundreds of thousands of volunteers who keep cricket going attest, it is more than a game.Peter Spavin, a mental health nurse and Sunday skipper of the Easton Cuttlefish club in Bristol, said there was something comforting about the sport’s metronomic rhythm. “It’s nice to get into that rhythm, that flow.”Teams like his bring together a broad spectrum of people from different backgrounds. And without it? “I think there’s a big dip in people’s mood. I think there’s a big increase in social anxiety. I think you miss the exercise, the camaraderie. We’d love to get back and will play games as soon as we’re allowed.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9d7abe083c2d89c0dba9940872a4233a1b8002ec/0_197_3744_2246/master/3744.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=8e43d1abdab4ed5b405e564182e34b03","title":"rugby football league investigate social media posts black lives matter","story":"The Rugby Football League will decide within the next few days whether a series of allegedly racist posts on social media linked to the Black Lives Matter movement are serious enough to be investigated.The governing body has decided to address the matter after at least one person came forward and provided evidence of what they considered to be racial remarks.Jermaine Coleman, the Jamaica and London Skolars coach, the only black coach in the professional game, told the  this week he was keen to see how the RFL would react to comments he said could “incite racism and violence” apparently made by white players within the sport.He said: “Seven or eight white players have written things on Twitter that are disgusting.

The pair also hosted a private online portion for high-dollar donors, which was not open to reporters, and brought in more than $3.4m.It was the most money raised by a single event by the former vice-president so far during his presidential campaign, and came on the heels of the Democratic party and Biden’s campaign out-raising Donald Trump in May for the first time.At the event, however, Obama urged viewers to learn the lessons from 2016 and not take the election for granted. Referencing what he called a “great awakening” among younger Americans pushing for reforms, Obama said that “just because this energy is out there does not mean that it assures our victory and it does not mean that it gets channeled in a way that results in real change.”“There’s a backlash, that is fierce, against change,” Obama added.The Trump campaign has so far been ahead in overall fundraising, with $265m in cash at the end of May. Trump’s Dallas fundraiser earlier this month raised north of $10m for the campaign, Republican National Committee and the Trump Victory Fund. Biden and the Democrats had a combined $122m, Reuters reported, though the former vice-president’s fundraising efforts appear to have picked up in recent weeks.The fundraiser marked Obama’s official return to the presidential campaign trail and underscored his unmatched popularity within the Democratic party.Tuesday’s event was a kickoff of what Obama’s team says will likely be a busy schedule heading into the fall, as he looks to help elect not just Biden but Democrats running for House and Senate. And his comments suggest Democrats are taking very seriously the possibility that their base could grow too comfortable this fall, with a number of state and nationwide surveys showing Biden with significant, often double-digit leads over Trump.Democrats are hoping Obama’s appeal, especially among Black and younger voters, can help boost energy for Biden.“There’s two groups of voters that Biden needs to move,” said Dan Pfeiffer, the former White House communications director. “You have the 4 million Obama 2012 voters that sat out in 16, Obama obviously has cache with them. And you have to persuade some number of voters who voted for Barack Obama in 2012 and either Trump or a third-party candidate in 2016, and Obama obviously is very, very high-performing with those as well.”Indeed, during Tuesday night’s fundraiser, Obama made a frequent pitch directly to young voters, telling them he was “hopeful” about the new energy he’s seen but warning them not to get discouraged with a political process he said “is always going to be slower” and “less satisfactory” than engaging with a social movement through public demonstrations.Obama endorsed Biden with a video message in April, but kept an otherwise low profile throughout the primary and largely avoided wading into national politics. In recent weeks, however, he’s re-emerged publicly to speak out on policing and the civil unrest that followed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Some Democrats say that, in the wake of Floyd’s killing, Obama’s voice as an advocate for Biden and a leader for the party is needed.“Biden doesn’t have the strongest record on criminal justice reform so having Obama there is helpful in reinforcing that issue,” said Ben Tulchin, who polled for Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign.“Given what’s going on with criminal justice reform and Black Lives Matter, having the first African American president out there publicly backing Biden is extremely helpful.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f539f36d60f0e16034650071f028b1679ca8ed9/0_206_5110_3066/master/5110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=423efbfcc01b970079425243d3728572","title":"boris muddled approach easing covid 19 lockdown rules","story":"Gail Mitchell grapples with the confusing new guidance, while Harvey Sanders is worried about Boris Johnson’s laissez-faire attitude. Plus letters from Philippa Edmunds, Colin Rogers,  Paul Garrod and Penny AldredNow let me see if I’ve got this right (Pubs and places of worship: what 4 July lockdown rules mean for England, 23 June). Single people can only be in a bubble with one other household, but bigger households can meet with numerous other households and can stay overnight, but must stay 2 metres apart. And you can go into a pub as long as you stay 2 metres apart, unless you can’t stay 2 metres apart, then you must stay 1-plus metres apart. You can go up to the counter in a shop, but not in a pub or restaurant. You have to give your name and address if you go to a pub, but not in a shop. You have to wear a mask on a bus, but not in a shop (not sure about pubs). You can have your hair cut from 4 July, but not your nails painted or legs waxed.But that’s only in England. It’s completely different in Scotland or Northern Ireland. You can’t go to Wales, but you can go to Spain, but you can’t go out for two weeks when you come back. So just remind me: are we still supposed to be washing our hands?Gail MitchellGotham, Nottinghamshire• Your editorial (23 June) reminds us that the government had said that any easing of the lockdown would depend on there being an effective test-and-trace system. Well, that seems to have been conveniently forgotten. This seems to be collateral damage as a result of the libertarian in the prime minister, who has been bursting to get out, is finally being released and is now implementing the classic libertarian shibboleths of maximising autonomy and freedom of choice while exercising inidual judgment.It is all very well for Boris Johnson to say that he can trust people to “use their common sense in the full knowledge of the risks”, but regrettable that this is happening just at the very time that we desperately need the guidance that the libertarian view would eschew, in order to assess what those “risks” really are.Harvey SandersLondon• Given that the government is allowing pubs and funfairs to reopen, it should at least let outdoor swimming pools join them on 4 July. Swimming is the most accessible sport for all ages and backgrounds, and often the only safe sport for disabled people. The Royal Life Saving Society has issued guidance on how to rescue swimmers while protecting lifeguards from Covid-19, and Swim England has stated that Covid-19 is not transmissible in chlorinated pool water. Philippa Edmunds East Twickenham, Middlesex• Boris Johnson has said that it will be imperative that people who have symptoms get themselves tested immediately. Here in Cornwall, we face a huge influx of visitors. It is likely that there will be an increased number of cases, yet testing facilities are non-existent.A friend sought a test last weekend, but no home tests were available. She requested an appointment at a testing centre, but found there were none in Cornwall except those for NHS and care home staff. Thus the only way of getting “tested immediately” was to drive to Exeter, a round trip of up to seven hours. Why is it not clear to the government that restrictions should not be eased until a fully functioning testing service is available to all? Colin RogersPenzance, Cornwall• Pubs before gyms? Yes, that reinforces confidence that our leaders know what they’re doing. Which group, I wonder, will be more adept at social distancing? Beer drinkers or people who care about their health?Paul GarrodPortsmouth• I should have thought our classicist prime minister would have known better – hibernation happens in winter in summer it’s aestivation.

A recent beach party near Lisbon attracted 1,000 revellers, and a birthday party for 100 people in the Algarve resulted in 76 new cases.Spain is monitoring 12 new outbreaks. One of the most serious is in the north-eastern region of Aragon where more than 70 new cases have prompted authorities to reimpose limits on public gatherings for the area’s 68,000 residents.Belgium’s prime minister, Sophie Wilmès, also condemned a rash of recent street parties held in defiance of restrictions. “Directly or indirectly, these people risked putting months of joint effort at risk,” she said. “Basic health protection rules were not followed.”She said new surges in neighbouring countries, including Germany, could herald a second wave of infections. Authorities in the western German district of Gütersloh placed 360,000 people back in lockdown this week after more than 1,700 employees at a local meat processing plant tested positive.Mainland France is so far managing its exit from lockdown smoothly, but doctors are being dispatched to its overseas territory of French Guiana, which shares a long border with Brazil, in response to a sudden surge in infections there.Annick Girardin, France’s minister for overseas territories, said she would discuss the possibility of reimposing confinement measures for the territory’s 300,000 people and cancelling upcoming elections to stem the spread.Bulgaria’s health minister, Kiril Ananiev, said the country would extend its state of emergency until 15 July after a sudden jump of 660 new cases this week. It had begun to relax its restrictions earlier this month.Ananiev said face masks would again be mandatory in all indoor public spaces, including trains and buses. “We have an increase of the intensity of the epidemic and an increase of coronavirus spread,” he told a government meeting.Croatia, which has limited its infections to 2,300 and its death toll to just over 100, said it would reinstate mandatory 14-day quarantine for travellers from Bosnia, Kosovo, Serbia and North Macedonia because of an increase of infections in the Balkans and a consequent rise in new cases on its territory.Iran called for face masks to be made compulsory as the country reported its highest daily death toll in more than two-and-a-half months on Wednesday. The 133 deaths in 24 hours were the highest since 6 April and brought its overall toll to 9,996.After closing schools, cancelling public events and banning movement between its 31 provinces, Iran succeeded in halting the rise in new infections until early May. But since a gradual reopening of the economy in April, the number of cases has begun to rise again.According to the Johns Hopkins University tracker, the coronavirus has now infected more than 9,295,000 people worldwide and killed more than 478,000. The International Monetary Fund said its expected the global economy to take a $12tn (£9.6tn) hit from the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4c7e23a80b7fd29bfabd38525553552889c0f4c/0_80_3179_1909/master/3179.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=242d6d5815bfe20bdd9442eb27aa917e","title":"moscows victory day parade in pictures","story":"Russia is holding its postponed Victory Day military parade despite rising coronavirus infections.

Ireland’s Health Service Executive (HSE) announced plans to roll out the phone app in late March, just as the country went into lockdown, and initially expected it to be launched within 10 days.  HSE’s chief executive, Paul Reid, told a news conference on Wednesday that it has been approved by Ireland’s data protection agency and was awaiting final sign-off by the government.  So far, 1,720 people have died from Covid-19 in Ireland, which has had a manual contact tracing programme in place since its outbreak began at the end of February.  The number of confirmed cases has fallen to an average of 11 a day over the past week as the economy prepares to almost fully reopen next week, with just 37 patients in hospital compared to a peak of nearly 900 that threatened to overwhelm the health service in mid-April.  Ireland will adopt a decentralised model for its tracing app where the data will be held on the person’s mobile phone and not centrally by the health service, which authorities hope will alleviate privacy concerns.  “We’ve done our own research in the early stages of the trial, there is pretty much a positive pick-up, that people feel they will use it and would use it in the future. We’d be strongly encouraged by that,” Reid said. In South Africa, nervous volunteers were also receiving some of the first injections of an experimental coronavirus vaccine on Wednesday, according to the Associated Press. The large-scale trial of the vaccine is being conducted in South Africa, Britain and Brazil (see previous post).South Africa has nearly one-third of Africa’s confirmed cases with more than 106,000, including more than 2,100 deaths. The country reported its biggest one-day death toll so far on Tuesday, with 111 new fatalities recorded.“I feel a little bit scared but I want to know what is going on with this vaccine so that I can tell my friends and others what is going on with the study,” one of the vaccine trial volunteers, Junior Mhlongo, said in Johannesburg.Volunteers in Brazil have begun to receive injections of an experimental coronavirus vaccine developed by researchers at Oxford University, AFP reports.The vaccine, developed together with pharmaceuticals group AstraZeneca, is one of dozens that researchers worldwide are racing to test and bring to market.Known as ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, it is already being tested in volunteers in Britain, and was due to start being administered this week in South Africa as well.The Federal University of Sao Paulo (UNIFESP), which is coordinating the study in Brazil, said in a statement its researchers had begun issuing the first doses on Tuesday to health workers, including doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers, who were deemed to be likely to come into contact with the Sars-CoV-2 virus.“Starting Tuesday, volunteers with a negative blood test were administered the vaccine.” Volunteers must be between 18 and 55 years old and work “on the frontline” of the pandemic at the Sao Paulo-UNIFESP hospital, it said. The vaccine will be administered to 2,000 volunteers in Brazil, while more than 4,000 participants are enrolled in the clinical trial in Britain, with another 10,000 due to be recruited, according to Oxford.Brazil was selected because it is one of the countries where the virus is spreading fastest. It has the second-highest caseload and death toll worldwide after the United States, with more than 1.1 million people infected and 52,000 killed so far. Brazil’s acting health minister, Eduardo Pazuello, said on Tuesday the country was close to signing a contract to produce the vaccine domestically.The coronavirus crisis is likely to speed up the development of central bank digital currencies, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) said in an except of its annual report released on Wednesday, according to AFP.Since the beginning of the pandemic and the implementation of physical distancing measures in many countries, along with high street shutdowns, contactless payment methods have boomed, said the bank.“The Covid-19 crisis, and the attendant rise of electronic payments, are likely to boost CBDC (central bank digital currency) development across the globe,” the BIS said in a chapter on central banks and payments in the digital era, released ahead of its full annual report.“Central banks, as s of the safety and integrity of the payment system, must keep evolving to meet the challenge of rapidly accelerating digital innovation,” the BIS said in its report. With the rise of cryptocurrencies, a handful of central banks have looked into the idea of launching digital versions of their own currencies.“Central banks around the world are stepping up their efforts to study CBDCs and, whether wholesale or retail, the goal is to create safe and reliable settlement instruments for transacting in the digital economy,” said Benoît Cœuré, head of the BIS Innovation Hub.Hyun Song Shin, the BIS head of research, added: “As innovations increasingly emerge from outside the traditional two-tier structure provided by central banks and commercial banks, it is essential that policymakers meet the challenges of these new innovations to maintain the integrity of the payment system. “While the private sector is well placed to draw on ingenuity and creativity to serve customers better, this is best done on solid central bank foundations. The head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said he expects the number of coronavirus cases around the world to reach 10 million in the next week. Nearly 9.3 million people have tested positive for the Sars-CoV-2 virus since the outbreak was first recognised at the beginning of the year, and 478,289 have died of the disease it causes, according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University in the US. Tedros said the rate of new infections was accelerating:In the first month of this outbreak, less than 10,000 cases were reported to WHO. In the last month, almost 4 million cases have been reported. We expect to reach a total of 10 million cases within the next week. This is a sober reminder that even as we continue R\u0026ampD into vaccines and therapeutics, we have an urgent responsibility to do everything we can with the tools we have now to suppress transmission and save lives.The “disinfecting” of Roma communities by low-flying planes and the high number of fines handed to minority groups has been cited in a report as evidence of the racial bias in the policing of the coronavirus lockdowns in Europe, writes Daniel Boffey, the ’s Brussels bureau chief.The report by Amnesty International, examining the enforcement of physical distancing measures in 12 European countries, concludes that the pandemic has led to greater “marginalisation, stigmatisation and violence”, echoing the long-standing concerns aired by the Black Lives Matter movement.An increase in the stopping and searching of black people in London – from 7.2 out of 1,000 in March to 9.3 out of 1,000 in April – is referenced in the report, along with the lengthy curfews imposed specifically in areas in France where black, Asian and minority ethnic communities live.In the département of Seine-Saint-Denis in Paris, home to a high proportion of black residents, the number of police checks was more than double the national average. The number of fines issued was also three times higher than in the rest of the country, despite respect of lockdown measures being comparable with other regions in France.Amnesty said it had verified 15 videos of unlawful use of force or racist and homophobic insults by law enforcement officials from 18 March to 26 April 2020 in 15 French cities. Six of these involved enforcement of lockdown rules.Some of the more shocking examples cited by the report, Policing the Pandemic: Human Rights Violations in the Enforcement of Covid-19 Measures in Europe, concern the mistreatment of Roma communities, often spurred on by populist politicians.Michael Rosen has returned home after 47 days in intensive care with Covid-19, writes Alison Flood.The award-winning and popular poet and children’s author began charting his illness on Twitter in March, writing of “bed-breaking shakes” and “freezing cold sweats”, of “deep muscle exhaustion” and the “image of war hero biting on a hankie, while best mate plunges live charcoal into the wound to cauterise it”. He went into intensive care at the end of the month, with his family warning that he was “very poorly” at the time.It took 47 days for him to leave ICU, but on 6 June he took his first steps, and by 12 June he was back on Twitter, sharing his progress as he began walking again. “Just as I was beginning to love my stick, Sticky McStickstick, I’m told, ‘You mustn’t become totally stick-reliant.’ Oh noooooooo!!!” he wrote on 22 June. “This wasn’t a snide dig at the physios! They are progressives. They see me walking the corridors with Sticky McStickstick, then walking a bit without, so they want me to go on. Quite right. Physios are the best!”The World Health Organization’s regular coronavirus briefing is starting now. You can watch it in the player embedded at the top of the blog. Slovenia has reinstated the mandatory use of face masks in indoor spaces after recording a rise in coronavirus cases following the lifting of restrictions earlier this month, AFP reports. People will once again be required to wear face masks in all indoor public spaces and on public transport – and disinfect their hands when entering those spaces. “This measure is urgent, it’s necessary, since it has proved to be effective in the past,” the health minister, Tomaž Gantar, said after a government meeting.The decision to reimpose restrictions would be revisited in 14 days, he added. The measures had been lifted at the beginning of June after weeks of comparatively good coronavirus news for Slovenia. The Alpine EU state of two million people, which borders Italy, has so far registered just 1,541 cases and 109 deaths. But officials were concerned at 38 new infections recorded last week, up from 15 the week before. For the first time in nearly four months, residents at a care home in Barcelona have been able to kiss, hug and hold hands with their loved ones – safely shielded from the virus by thin sheets of plastic, writes Ashifa Kassam. As it prepared to open its doors to visitors, the Ballesol Fabra i Puig care home set up plastic curtains to allow residents some form of physical contact, echoing a strategy adopted by care homes in Brazil and Argentina.Among the first visitors to arrive was 81-year-old Agustina Cañamero. For the past 102 days she had been gripped by fear as Spain’s death toll rose to one of the highest in Europe, worried constantly about how her husband, Pascual Pérez, was faring at the care home where he lives. On Monday the couple of 59 years was reunited, trading kisses through layers of surgical masks and plastic.Other photos captured by the Associated Press showed tears falling freely as visitors hugged and tightly grasped the hands of their loved ones and parents through the plastic. In March, as Spain battled one of the world’s fastest spreading outbreaks, officials barred visitors from care homes across the country. Stories soon began circulating of the virus silently stalking the halls of care homes across the country, with regional data suggesting the coronavirus has claimed more than 19,000 lives in Spanish care homes. Egypt’s public prosecution says a prominent human rights activist will be held in pre-trial detention for allegedly “spreading fake news” about Covid-19 in Egypt, writes Ruth Michaelson. Plainclothes security bundled Sanaa Seif into an unmarked van outside the Egyptian public prosecutor’s office yesterday when she, along with her family members went to report an assault that occurred earlier this week outside the Tora prison complex in Cairo. Seif, her sister and mother were attacked and violently beaten in full view of the prison as guards looked on, after staging a sit-in as they attempted to receive a letter from Seif’s brother, Alaa Abd El-Fattah, a prominent activist.Fears are mounting for thousands held inside the vast Tora prison, including Abd El-Fattah, over reports of Covid-19 cases inside the complex. Rights groups including Amnesty International have demanded a list of infected prisoners and staff, as well as the release of prisoners to ease overcrowding.Seif appeared before Egypt’s supreme state security prosecution, a specialist national security court. Prosecutors decreed she be held for at least 15 days in pre-trial detention. She is charged with “disseminating false news and rumours about deteriorating health conditions in the country and the spread of the coronavirus in prisons,” after allegedly making statements on her personal Facebook page. The prosecutor also accused her of “calling for demonstrations,” after she demanded prisoners be released to curb the spread of Covid-19. Egypt criminalised “spreading false news,” in 2018, using a sweeping new media law which specifically targets anyone with over 5,000 social media followers. The controversial charge is often arbitrarily applied, especially by the supreme state security prosecution, to anyone making public statements even on benign topics. In recent years, charges of “joining a terrorist group,” and “spreading false news,” have been handed out to doctors, journalists, activists, civil servants and ordinary citizens. Amnesty International says at least 12 journalists have been jailed in a crackdown on news related to Covid-19. Egypt’s public prosecutor warned in May that anyone accused of “spreading false news,” about the virus faces up to five years imprisonment and large fines. Belgium’s prime minister Sophie Wilmès has condemned recent street parties held by young people after bars close, in defiance of anti-virus restrictions.Wilmès warned that, while the latest figures still show Belgium emerging from the worst of the epidemic, recent new surges in neighbouring countries like Germany could herald a feared second wave. “Directly or indirectly, these people risked putting months of our joint effort at risk,” Wilmès said.“Basic health protection rules were not followed.” Over the weekend, amateur footage on social media showed large crowds of young people gathered around a sound system in Place Flagey, a popular late-night gathering spot in Brussels. Police intervened to break up the impromptu rave, but there were no arrests. Belgium has reopened its bars and restaurants under distancing rules, but public gatherings are still banned. In a separate incident reported by the Belga news agency, students celebrating the end of term at the prestigious College of Europe in Bruges held a banned house party.

Photograph: Google Street ViewA cafe located behind Dublin’s Four Courts has been operating a sit-in service for almost three weeks ahead of the permitted reopening of cafes and restaurants next week.Fegan’s 1924 Cafe on Chancery Street, 200m from Bridewell Garda station, is allowing customers to use its indoor tables, despite the cafe and restaurant sector being restricted to operating take-away services until June 29th under coronavirus regulations.Cafe owner James Fegan said he was providing a service particularly for barristers who would have “nowhere else to go” if the cafe was not available to them. He said gardaí had also been using the cafe’s toilets when it was not practical for them to return to the Garda station.Mr Fegan said he had operated a take-away service for approximately six weeks but was now in his third week of providing an indoor service, in line with 2m distancing of tables and a strict hygiene and cleaning regime.“About 85 per cent of our business comes out of the Four Courts. We would get a lot of legal eagles in here, people giving advice to clients. They haven’t got the space in the courts and we would be the closest place for them to use a table. The likes of barristers would have nowhere else to go.”Mr Fegan said he was only allowing regular customers to sit in, with those he did not know being restricted to take away only.“During the Gemma O’Doherty and John Waters case there were some protesters who wanted to come in, but we didn’t allow that. I have no problem with protesters but we didn’t know them. But we did have guards in using the toilet at that time.”Mr Fegan said his business differed from a standard cafe or restaurant in that it was part of a cash and carry.“The cash and carry and wholesale business has continued all the way through, so given we were here anyway we thought we might as well keep the cafe business going.”Health and safetyThe cafe is “fully sanitised” at the start of every morning and before and after lunch, while the tables and chairs are cleaned after every sitting, Mr Fegan said. Staff had undergone health and safety training, including training on how to reassure customers who might be nervous to return to cafes.As he had opened ahead of the official date of June 29th, he had been asked to advise other cafes and restaurants ahead of their reopening next week. Mr Fegan said he had not been asked by the Garda or any other authority to stop serving customers indoors.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287489.1593013152!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"schools set to reopen next month without social distancing for children with special needs","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh said strict social distancing requirements were ‘neither practical nor possible’ for a summer programme across more than 200 schools. File Photograph: Dave ThompsonPA WireSchools will reopen next month for children with special needs without any requirement for strict social distancing.The move is seen as significant trial run for for the planned full reopening of schools to all children in late August and September.In the Dáil on Wednesday, Minister for Education Joe McHugh said strict social distancing requirements were “neither practical nor possible” for a summer programme across more than 200 schools.However, he said prevention and control measures - such as handwashing and rules for dealing with a suspected case - will be in place to manage risks.He restated that it was the Government’s intention to see a “full return to school in late August and September” in line with inidual schools’ usual timetables.Detailed public health advice is due to published on Thursday for schools taking part in the summer programme.Interim public health advice will be kept under review to ensure it is informed by the latest evidence on Covid in advance of the re-opening of schools at the end of August.“I know of schools who have already communicated to parents and students their first day back after the summer holiday - albeit noting that this will be subject to appropriate arrangements and guidelines which are currently being worked on. “It is worth reiterating again we are between nine and 10 weeks before schools are scheduled to re-open. This gives us time to continue to consult with the public health experts to develop and plan appropriate guidance.”Among the plans to support the reopening of all schools in late August include on-line training on safety measures for schools, parents and students additional resources for enhanced cleaning and hand-sanitisers for every classroom to be provided by the department.However, Solidarity and People Before Profit TD Richard Boyd Barrett said the Government was trying to “ put a square peg in a round hole” by squeezing students into some of the most overcrowded classes in the EU while striving for physical distancing.He said splitting classes and hiring additional teachers was the only safe way to reopen schools.Separately, Mr McHugh said in excess of 200 schools have registered to run a summer education programme for students with special needs, while 9,200 children have registered for home-based programmes.In addition, a further 210 disadvantaged or Deis primary schools have expressed an interest to participate a summer camp for students towards the end of August. At second level, 14 schools have registered with a number of others considering participating in the programme. “It is fantastic to see this level of response and it is a real demonstration of the commitment of local schools to their local communities,” Mr McHugh said.However, Sinn Féin’s education spokesman Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire said the numbers due to take part in the programme were only half of what had been projected for an “expanded” programme this year.He said a lack of clarity and uncertainty over the reopening of schools had contributed to confusion and uncertainty on the part of schools and parents and dented participation in the programme.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"Friends of the Irish Environment challenges Government\u0026rsquos National Mitigation PlanFrench president created convention in April 2019 in response to gilets jaunes revoltMinister for Climate Action and Environment says funds would go to just transition"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Another Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoringMarine life with very specific habitat needs threatened in the face of sweeping changeThree terrapins as pets seems a bit ambitious considering their needsThe list of causes of damage is long, making it hard to know where to startFew, if any, of Ireland\u0026rsquos mammals have evolved the ability to eat venomous creaturesGolden kelp is notably bare of other sea life, so there are concerns over its possible impactLong-term objective is to see how wildflowers are responding to changes in weather patterns and climateTime to restore meadows once full of insects and nectar in summer and spires of seeds in winter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

If we are just to wag our fingers at people and say that there is no hope of you turning around to this. I believe the other parties are starting to do that, all that, and I think that is because the Irish people want to do it.”ChangesMr Ryan told RTÉ’s Morning Ireland that he believes both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael “are up for making the sort of changes we need to make” and for working as a team to “do that in a way that helps to meet other goals and does help us to get out of the economic crisis”.“I believe that is absolutely possible,” he said.Mr Ryan added that it “is going to create a huge challenge.”The Green Party leader said an annual 7 per cent reduction in carbon emissions – “a 51 per cent cut over the decade” – was “agreed and it is critical and it is important”.A lot of it will take place in the “latter part of the decade” but measures would start immediately during the incoming government to prepare for the cuts. “Within the first 100 days of government, if we are in there, we would introduce legislation that starts to set out five year budgets, so you start measuring and monitoring and introducing the measures you need to do to achieve it and you have real power to do that, because there is political commitment to do it,” he said. A proposed significant increase in carbon tax is a “huge project and will take time”, he said, adding money raised would be returned to those in fuel poverty and farmers.On the broader economic plan, Mr Ryan said the would-be coalition’s strategy “first and foremost” will be to borrow money to stimulate the economy.“I’s a Keynesian response, where you actually put money into the economy,” he said.Economic analysis“What you hope and expect, and the economic analysis is that this is very possible, is you see the economy lift, you see incomes growing, and tax revenue increases in that way because there will still be all those taxes on income and other measures.“If that isn’t enough to close the gap, there are other measures. Included in that is a potential increase in employers and employee PRSI and possibly other tax... there will be an increase in carbon tax and other taxes such as plastics... the primary approach to this is initially in the first two to three years to increase borrowing rather than taxes to stimulate the economy.”Mr Ryan said the approach “makes sense” at a time of low interest rates. If the Greens reject the deal, the party will still have to be part of the “wider political system to come up with some alternative of running the country”, he added.Results of internal ballots on the proposed programme for government will be announced by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party on Friday.The Green Party has widened eligibility for members who can vote by telephone on the programme. It has emailed members saying that registered voters who have not received their ballots can vote by phone.With many votes already cast, the contest is said to be delicately poised between the Yes and No camps.Leading figures on both sides have been involved in campaigns in recent days, making thousands of telephone calls."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287324.1593000908!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in abstains for first time in offences against state act renewal vote","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe Dáil was told on Wednesday that the view of the gardaí was that there remains ‘a real and persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups on this island’. Photograph: PAFor the first time since Sinn Féin entered the Dáil in 1997, the party has abstained in a vote on the renewal of controversial Offences Against the State Act.The party’s\u0026nbspdecision came after Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan promised that a proposed review of the legislation would be independent.Sinn Féin justice spokesman Martin Kenny welcomed the Minister’s commitment to an independent review but said he was disappointed there was no deadline on the review.Sinn Féin has called for the past 20 years for the special Criminal Court to be abolished mainly because it was initially used to prosecute IRA members. The party’s objections now are focused on the fact that it is a non-jury court.The legislation provides for the non-jury Special Criminal Court and along with the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act of 1998 is used in the trials of subversives and in gangland crime cases.As emergency legislation both Acts are renewed annually and both passed in separate votes by 32 to three with two abstentions.There is added urgency as the renewal of both Acts must be completed before June 30th.An amendment to the legislation proposed by the Social Democrats was defeated, as was an amendment by Independent TD Michael McNamara, who called for the legislation to be reviewed by the Law Reform Commission.Mr Flanagan said the debate each year on the legislation was not “rubber stamping”.He said “none of us can be blind to the threat posed to the criminal process by iniduals, terrorists and organised criminal groups who seek to subvert the system through intimidation of citizens”.He said the view of the Garda was that there remains “a real and persistent threat from republican paramilitary groups on this island”.Mr Flanagan said the “fine details of the review can be worked out by the incoming government” but said a review of this nature “will indeed require a significant body of work”.The Minister added: “It will be independent, comprehensive. The arrangements are currently being scoped” and work was being done in line with the report on the future of policing in Ireland.”Mr Kenny said what was meant to be temporary legislation had become permanent by renewing it every year.“That is not appropriate and I think the Minister would have acknowledged that that is not appropriate.“We need to have sound legislation that doesn’t require a review every year. The fact that we’re here on the brink of a deadline which is next Monday night at midnight, and we’re talking about this I think highlights the reality of the absurdity of the situation.”The Green Party has on occasion opposed renewal of the legislation but its justice spokesman Roderic O’Gorman said on Wednesday the party supported the renewal.“We are now faced with a serious and significant threat from criminal gangs, some of which are international in their reach”.He referenced a series of arson attacks on the homes of gardaí and the “ongoing campaign of intimidation harassment against members of Quinn Industrial Holdings - arson attacks, assaults, criminal damage, culminating in the brutal kidnapping and torture of Kevin Lunney.”“It’s through fear, intimidation and violence that criminal gangs seek to operate.”Labour’s Ged Nash referred to the case of the “two gangs at war over the drug trade in my own hometown have wreaked havoc over the last two years and more” in Drogheda.The legislation must also be renewed by the Seanad which is abeyance pending the appointment of the new taoiseach’s nominees"},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"The decades-long project sees a constellation of 35 satellites circling the Earth to rival the US-owned Global Positioning System (GPS)Regime rows back on threat to deploy troops near border amid rising tensionsOfficials prepare \u0026lsquoretaliatory punishment\u0026rsquo after anti-North balloons arrived from SouthBan on cruise ships extended beyond June 30th cases increase as more citizens return homeCovid-19 outbreak in staff at Tyson foods in Arkansas sparks Beijing U-turn on policyChina says draft law is aimed at separatist activity, subversion, terrorism and collusion abroadChina may have shut down its controversial re-education camps, but minorities are still persecutedSamira Imin\u0026rsquos father was incarcerated for three years in XinjiangDelhi says Chinese dammed a river and lay in wait for clash in which 20 Indians diedCases widely seen as Chinese \u0026lsquohostage diplomacy\u0026rsquo following arrest of Huawei\u0026rsquos chief financial officer Meng Wanzhou in VancouverInvestigators say they have found gun and are talking to two \u0026lsquopeople of interest\u0026rsquoTensions remain high despite two governments agreeing to de-escalate confrontationAustralia says it will not name country responsibleKim Yo-jong\u0026rsquos criticism of Seoul illustrates her seniority and potential to become rulerBatons wrapped in barbed wire used in high-altitude brawl in which 20 Indian soldiers diedNZ officials tracing 320 people regarded as \u0026lsquoclose contacts\u0026rsquo of pair who returned from UKClash on Himalayan border is the most serious since 1967, why now and what next?Any moves to invalidate peace deals posemajor setback to Moon\u0026rsquos efforts for more lasting reconciliation with NorthFirst loss of life in area for decades as \u0026lsquoviolent face-off\u0026rsquo between troops elevates disputeLatest in a series of threats from the Kim regime since diplomacy with US broke downStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287336.1593002285!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"coronavirus how latin america became global epicentre of the pandemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tPedestrians in the Pinheiros neighbourhood of São Paulo, Brazil. Photograph: Victor MoriyamaThe New York TimesBy late March, the Mexican government calmly predicted that its coronavirus outbreak would peak in April. A few weeks later, it changed its prediction to mid-May. And then to late May. And then to June.Now, with new infections surging and the government facing growing anger, even ridicule, over its constant guesswork, many Mexicans have drawn their own conclusion: No one really knows.“Obviously, prediction is not a guarantee of precision,” Hugo Lopez Gatell, the federal health official in charge of the nation’s virus response, has acknowledged.Mexico, like the rest of Latin America, has quickly become a focal point of the pandemic, a worrisome frontier for a virus that has claimed the lives of more than 460,000 people and infected more than 9 million worldwide.The coronavirus was always going to hit Latin America hard. Even before it arrived, experts warned that the region’s combustible blend of inequality, densely packed cities, legions of informal workers living day-to-day and health care systems starved of resources could undermine even the best attempts to curb the pandemic.But by brushing off the dangers, fumbling the response, dismissing scientific or expert guidance, withholding data and simply denying the extent of the outbreak altogether, some governments have made matters even worse.Months have passed since the pandemic struck Latin America, but unlike in parts of Asia, Europe and the hardest-hit cities in the United States, the virus is only gaining steam across the region. Deaths have more than doubled across Latin America in a month, according to the Pan American Health Organization, and the region now accounts for several of the world’s worst outbreaks.In recent weeks, Brazil has often recorded the world’s highest number of new infections and daily deaths – and shows no signs of slowing down. Peru and Chile now have more cases per capita than the United States. Cases continue to climb in Mexico, which recently became one of the few countries anywhere to hit 1,000 deaths or more in a single day.Civil rightsAnd as the virus storms through the region, corruption has flourished, the already intense political polarisation in some countries has deepened, and some governments have curtailed civil rights. In El Salvador, thousands of people have been rounded up, many for violating stay-at-home orders, despite the supreme court’s demands that the detentions end.Economies already stretched thin before the virus lie on the precipice of ruin. Millions are out of work, with millions more at risk. The United Nations has said the pandemic could result in a drop of 5.3 per cent in the regional economy – the worst in a century – forcing some 16 million people into extreme poverty.“In a matter of months, we could lose what we have gained in 15 years,” said Julio Berdegué, the regional representative for the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.In Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro spent months downplaying the threat of the virus – calling it a “measly flu” and railing against shutdowns imposed by governors – epidemiologists say the death toll could surpass the total in the United States to become the world’s highest by late July.In Mexico, where President Andrés Manuel López Obrador has suggested that a clean conscience helps ward off infection – “no lying, no stealing, no betraying, that helps a lot to not get coronavirus”, he recently told reporters – the country has already suffered three times as many deaths as officials first predicted.Not all is dire in the region. Nations like Uruguay and Costa Rica seem to have avoided the worst so far, while an almost military-style health care intervention in Cuba has left the island nation in better standing than most.But in much of Latin America, the worst may still be on its way. Colombia is entering its harshest recession since record-keeping began more than 100 years ago. Venezuela has tumbled into freefall. Ecuador is facing a debt crisis and a return of mass social unrest. Peru has gone from projecting the region’s fastest economic growth to one of its worst contractions.In some South American nations, such as Chile and Colombia, the cases are just beginning to surge. In Argentina, which enforced strict, successful quarantine measures, a fresh outbreak, largely in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, has troubled officials. The number of cases has more than quadrupled in the past month, while deaths have more than doubled.“We’re doing well because of everything we did, but there is a real possibility that the increase in cases will turn into a problem that is difficult to manage,” said Ginés González García, Argentina’s health minister.CommonalitiesLatin America has a vast array of distinct politics, cultures, geographies and histories. But some commonalities may help explain why, despite at least a month of advanced notice that the virus was on its way, many countries struggled to buffer the blow.Regionwide, 53 per cent of workers are estimated to toil in the informal sector, selling food on the streets, working in part-time construction jobs or cleaning the homes of wealthier families. Many live in densely crowded parts of the region’s largest cities, in neighbourhoods where sanitation is poor and access to fresh water is limited. By and large, they have no paycheques, no pensions, no insurance, no benefits.For many, to quarantine is to starve. “If I can’t work, I can’t eat, it’s as simple and plain as that,” said Mario Muñoz Cruz, a shoe shiner in Mexico City. “If the doctors and experts tell me to stay home, I would ask them, ‘What do I eat then?’”While there is a seemingly democratic quality to the virus – it can infect anyone, including leaders like the president of Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández – it follows and exploits the disparities that already ide the region.Risk factors like diabetes, hypertension and obesity are generally higher among the poor. And while the wealthy can afford private hospitals, the poorest rely on public health systems plundered by years of neglect. On average, nations in the region spend about a quarter of what developed nations spend each year on health.Even in nations where the response was arguably exemplary, like Peru, endemic poverty overwhelmed the best intentions. Now the country is fighting one of the world’s worst outbreaks – and the economic consequences.Delmira Vasquez (36) moved to the capital, Lima, in early March, like many Peruvians from poorer provinces who have seen their hopes vanish in the pandemic. Her husband, a construction worker, found a job within a week of arriving in Lima, but lost it the week after because of the strict national lockdown that shut down most activities.“Now we only eat because our neighbours take pity on us,” Vasquez said from the one-room shack on a hillside shantytown that she shares with her husband and three children.Rural areasRural areas have hardly been spared, either. In the small Colombian city of Leticia, along the Amazon River, the recorded death rate is nearly 28 times as high as for the country as a whole, according to government data.“The situation is incredibly grave,” said Dr Mauricio Diaz, who works in Leticia and described his hospital as “a parody” of a hospital. A few days ago, he said, four ventilators arrived. But the hospital’s wall outlets are broken, and “we haven’t been able to use them”, he said.The degree of suffering endured by some nations was not inevitable, experts say, pointing to Brazil, Mexico and Nicaragua for particularly poor leadership during the crisis.In Nicaragua, President Daniel Ortega rejected measures adopted worldwide to curb the spread of the virus, saying that most Nicaraguans were too poor to not work under a shutdown. Schools and businesses remained open, though hundreds of doctors across the nation urged the government to acknowledge the virus was proliferating.In open disregard of the risks, the government organised a rally, held in solidarity with countries going through the pandemic. It was dubbed “Love in the Time of Covid-19”, and was held while other nations ordered or urged their citizens to stay at home.As the virus was tearing through Brazil and stirring widespread anger at Bolsonaro, the president, his administration made a decision that shocked health experts: It simply stopped reporting the total death toll. And while his health ministry was urging people to stay home, Bolsonaro encouraged mass demonstration and shook hands in public.Mexico’s president, Lopez Obrador, also mocked the virus early on, continued to hug and kiss his supporters, and encouraged Mexicans to patronise restaurants until the end of March. Even his coronavirus czar, Lopez Gatell, claimed that the president’s “moral authority” would protect him from the virus, and until last month, he dismissed the utility of face masks.“One of the fundamental lessons that is coming out of this pandemic is that governments make a difference,” said Octavio Gomez Dantes, a researcher at Mexico’s National Institute of Health. “The evolution of a pandemic depends in an important way on the responses of various governments.”Exception of UruguayWith fewer than 1,000 confirmed cases and 24 deaths, Uruguay is a standout in the region. The tiny country of 3.4 million quickly enacted a system of contact tracing and, when it had only four confirmed cases, it closed borders, suspended schools and called on the population to stay home. Uruguayans listened.“We have been able to succeed thanks to the citizens who understood the urgency and the importance of taking care of themselves and each other,” explained José Luis Satdjian, sub-secretary of Uruguay’s health ministry.The relative success has extended the honeymoon period for President Luis Lacalle Pou, who had been in office just two weeks when the nation confirmed its first Covid-19 outbreak in mid-March.“Uruguayans believe the government has handled this situation well,” said Mariana Pomiés, executive director of Cifra, a local polling firm. “The government has benefited from the pandemic.” – New York TimesEverything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287567.1593020359!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu mulls keeping travel restrictions on us","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Orly Airport on the outskirts of Paris, a few days before its reopening as France eases lockdown measures taken to curb the spread of coronavirus. Photograph:   Stephane De SakutinAFP via Getty ImagesThe European Union may recommend that casual travellers from the United States continue to be barred from entry as the continent opens up borders that were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.The bloc’s executive body is expected to publish on Monday a recommended list of countries for which member states should drop travel restrictions from July 1st.The US was not included on initial draft lists due to the high rate of Covid-19 infections there. EU ambassadors who met to discuss the issue on Wednesday were briefed that the rate of infections in the US was 107 per 100,000 people and growing, compared to just 16 per 100,000 across the EU.The issue of whether to permit casual travel from the US is highly politically sensitive, as continued exclusion would be seen to reflect badly on the ability of the Trump administration to contain the virus.Assessing which countries to include on the list can also be contentious due to different national priorities and ways of collecting data. The European Commission recommends only opening to casual travel from countries that have infection rates, and testing and tracing systems, comparable to or better than the EU average.Infection ratesCountries with low infection rates such as Australia, New Zealand and Japan are likely candidates for inclusion on the safe list.The decision on which countries to include will also take into account how close their ties are to the EU, and reciprocity: whether European citizens are also free to travel thereEU ambassadors are lobbying Washington to allow EU citizens with visas and who ordinarily reside in the US to return to their homes, many of whom are currently unable to re-enter the United States due to US restrictions imposed in March.The commission recommended EU member states close their borders to all non-essential travel from outside the bloc shortly after the US ban. People legally resident in the EU, including Americans, were exempt from these restrictions. Member states are ultimately free to make their own decisions regarding borders, and Ireland never implemented the initial travel ban, as it applied to the 30 countries associated with the EU’s Schengen free movement area, of which the Republic and the United Kingdom are not part.The commission has been trying to co-ordinate the re-opening of travel between EU member states, and earlier this month recommended that all countries in the bloc should open their borders to each other as long as infection rates were at a comparable level.The reality however is a patchwork: countries keen to accept tourists such as Greece and Italy were quick to open up, but other member states are more cautious. Many require incoming travellers to go into quarantine, or allow non-essential travel from only a small list of countries.\u0026nbspStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Only under-65s can take part and pilgrims will be quarantined before and after pilgrimageWorld community urged to reject move to intensify \u0026lsquoprofound human rights violations\u0026rsquoAmple evidence uncovered of movement\u0026rsquos widespread persecution of Yazidi minority and other ethnic minoritiesSarah Hegazi\u0026rsquos simple gesture at a concert led to outrage, persecution and heartbreakDemonstrations against prices and wages erupt in Sweida and spread to DeraaAnnexation would be incompatible with international law, Maas warnsTerror group ramps up attacks as crises including coronavirus provide opportunityGovernment pressed to speed up talks with IMF and donors to secure funds and halt slideBritish-Iranian woman seeking release after first furlough from jail in Iran since 2016Police and security force officers killed in roadside bomb and gun battleHealth authorities confirm more than 3,000 new cases on two consecutive daysOpponents warn that US-backed plan would lead to independent Palestinian stateWar and coronavirus-ravaged country to get $1.35bn from UN and Saudi ArabiaTension rises in region with Israel planning to extend sovereignty to Jewish settlementsGiven lack of other options, authorities used restrictions as main tool to fight pandemicFormer cabinet minister Saad al-Jabri was strategic architect of Saudi counter-terrorism effortsPrime minister claims allegations are a \u0026lsquodeep-state\u0026rsquo, left-wing political witch-huntLong-serving politician will become first sitting prime minister in Israel\u0026rsquos history to stand trialPA president cites imminent threat of Israeli annexation of parts of the West BankFirebomb attack on home claimed the lives of a couple and their 18-month-old sonStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4287137.1592977840!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"eu asks united states to reconsider covid 19 travel ban","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tUS president Donald Trump speaks with Rodney Scott, the US Border Patrol Chief, as he tours a section of the border wall on Tuesday in Arizona. Photograph: APThe European Union has stepped up efforts to persuade the United States to exempt EU citizens legally residing in the US from the travel ban, as both sides consider the next stage in opening-up borders for international travel in the wake of coronavirus.In a letter to US secretary of state Mike Pompeo last week, EU ambassador Stavros Lambrinidis and Croatia’s ambassador to the US, whose country holds the rotating EU presidency, asked the US to reconsider the scope of the current travel ban imposed by the US in March to take account of Europeans living in the US on non-immigrant visas.Thousands of Europeans are employed under various categories of so-called “non-immigrant” visas in the US, but under the terms of the travel ban which applies to most European countries, China and Iran, they are unable to re-enter the United States if they visit those countries.The European Commission already offers more flexibility to non-EU nationals, and has recommended that third-country nationals, including Americans, legally residing in the EU should be exempt from travel restrictions.Ban on visasOn Monday, US president Donald Trump announced a ban on issuing new non-immigrant visas to foreign workers for the rest of the year, though those who are already living and working in the United States on visas are not affected. However, the presidential order means that thousands of people who had expected to travel to the United States for work later in 2020 will be unable to do so.Discussions between inidual embassies and the EU mission in Washington are taking place with the administration and the State Department on possible exemptions to the travel restrictions or a standardised approach by the two blocs. Other categories of foreign residents in the United States are permitted to re-enter, though they must abide by quarantine and other health requirements in each state on their return. In the letter, the ambassadors point out that current US coronavirus travel rules mean that EU citizens resident in the United States are banned from entering the US if travelling from the Schengen area or Ireland.The diplomatic push comes amid reports that the EU could ban US travellers from entering the Schengen area as it considers taking a coordinated approach among member states to reopening the bloc’s external borders from July 1st.The US has reported more than 2.3 million cases – the highest in the world – with top immunologist Anthony Fauci warning on Tuesday of a “disturbing surge” in infection rates in some US states.One possibility is that both blocs could maintain restrictions on tourist visitors, but have different arrangements for those ordinarily resident in either the EU or the US.Less than five months before the presidential election, immigration is returning to the political agenda in the United States.Border wallMr Trump toured a section of the border wall in Arizona yesterday, as he made a trip to the electorally-important state.Stating that illegal immigration was down 84 per cent compared to a year ago – a figure that has been impacted by the coronavirus pandemic – Mr Trump said that no administration had done more to secure America’s southern border.“Our border has never been more secure,” he said, accusing presidential rival Joe Biden and Democrats of wanting “open borders” and “criminal sanctuaries”.Mr Trump inspected a section of a 320km segment of the steel wall, signing a plaque attached to the barrier. Earlier, he described the structure as “just about unclimbable”, and “the most powerful” barrier in the world.Mr Trump’s visit to Arizona came a day after he signed a presidential order expanding immigration restrictions, by halting the issuance of new visas for certain categories of foreign workers until the end of the year. He also extended a ban on green card applications until at least next year. Speaking at the border wall on Tuesday, Mr Trump defended the move, stating: “we want to give jobs to Americans right now”. But he hinted that some breakthrough on DACA – the programme that protects young Americans who arrived in the country illegally as children – could be imminent.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreakStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com\"/polopoly_fs/1.4192672!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/landscape_940/image.jpg","title":"us democratic","story":"The process to choose the Democratic nominee to take on Donald Trump in November’s US presidential election is well under way.States across the country are in the process of choosing\u0026nbsptheir preferred candidate, either through a primary contest or a caucus. A primary is a traditional election where eligible voters select their candidate privately through a ballot system. A caucus is a public process which sees voters align publicly with their chosen candidate at caucus sites.Based roughly on their share of the vote in each state - states have different rules -\u0026nbspcandidates are assigned a number of “delegates”, which will be sent to represent each state at the Democratic National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in July.On March 3rd – Super Tuesday – 14 states and one overseas territory voted. After a faltering start to the primaries that almost saw him written off, former vice-president Joe Biden got his campaign firmly on track with victory in nine states. Though Vermont senator Bernie Sanders finished first in four states, including delegate-rich California, Super Tuesday checked the Sanders momentum after a strong opening to the primaries in Iowa, New Hampshire and\u0026nbspNevada.On March 10th\u0026nbspsix more states vote, with most of the remaining primaries taking place throughout March and April. The final primary contest takes place on June 7th. However, by the end of March, well over 50 per cent of the delegates will have been allocated.In order to be selected as the party’s nominee at the convention in July, a candidate needs a majority of 50 per cent of delegates plus one, so the magic number is 1,991 pledged delegates out of the total of 3,979.However, with four candidates remaining in the race - Elizabeth Warren and Tulsi Gabbard complete the field, after Michael\u0026nbspBloomberg’s\u0026nbspwithdrawal -\u0026nbspit is possible that no one candidate will have a majority of delegates when Democrats convene in July.Though the rules were changed after the 2016 convention following tensions between the Sanders and Hillary Clinton campaigns, so-called superdelegates - unpledged delegates - still play a role. These are senior members of the party – governors, former members of Congress, etc. Their 771 votes come into play if the convention is contested, which is\u0026nbspa possibility.Notably, six of the candidates were asked during a debate in Las Vegas on February 19th if they would support the idea of a candidate winning the nomination if they secured a plurality but not a majority of the delegates. All but one – Sanders – said they were opposed to this. The issue may become a headache for the Democratic Party as the primary process progresses."},{"url":null,"title":"give back old normal lockdown took away freedoms","story":"When a rattled-looking Boris Johnson popped onto our television screens on March 23 to announce the most significant restrictions on British life and liberty in peacetime, he promised a review within three weeks.Few would have guessed that three months later many of the measures would still be in place. At the time, there had been 350 deaths from Covid-19 in the UK. Today there have been close to 40,000. That grim figure explains why the Government has retained the controls over social interactions, albeit with modifications as the pace of contagion has slowed.Now that it has almost halted, Mr Johnson is emboldened to relax the restrictions further and, in delivering better news, he certainly looked far more chipper in the Commons than he has done for a while, back to the old Boris.But listening to his statement about what we are now permitted to do was to appreciate in the starkest terms what it is that we have lost. For a country that is defined by its love of freedom to be told that we can go to the pub, though only if we supply our names and addresses to the innkeeper or can get our hair cut, though only if our coiffeur dresses like a nuclear power plant worker or we can have a dinner party but must not embrace or kiss our guests, these are hard orders to take, even if they are dressed up as “guidance”. As a law-abiding nation, we take these things seriously even when they are not actually the law of the land as many of these “rules” are not, including the two-metre distancing.Many restrictions seem arbitrary. Why, for instance, is professional football allowed but not cricket? This makes no sense since the former involves much more close contact. Mr Johnson said the ball in cricket acted as a vector for disease but on that basis the game will never restart.We were promised Independence Day on July 4 but remain in chains, even if they are looser than before. Even when we are freed, which will not happen this year because of the Government’s fear of a second wave, much will have changed.Looking through my wallet yesterday was like a Proustian journey into a past life. Photo-passes to offices \u2028I no longer visit an oyster card for trains that I no longer use a library card for books no longer borrowed and even some cash – remember that? These may well be the detritus of a world never to be regained. Will those of us able to work at home ever be allowed back into the office or even want to go for that matter?I had thought that once this nightmare was over, we would all be commuting into cities again, eager to return to the camaraderie and woke minefield of modern office life, but I have my doubts now.Parents whose children have been at home since March and face another two months with the little darlings cannot wait to get back to the office but once the schools have returned they might think differently. Home working by millions will be an abiding legacy of this time with all the implications that will have for the viability of public transport, commercial property management and businesses like cafes, restaurants and taxis that rely on commuters for their livelihoods, especially in London.Foreign travel will change even when the 14-day quarantine for all arrivals is dropped. While there are many people desperate to get back to the beaches of the Med, there are others who find the thought of a masked four-hour queue at the airport intolerable. Eating out, going to the cinema, attending the theatre – all these activities are to reopen but their pleasures constrained by pettifogging rules and for how long?What else will change? The BBC has been running a series of podcasts called Rethink in which leading figures in their fields consider what might happen. One contributor, Lady Hale, the former president of the Supreme Court, suggests that we might reconsider how we use juries in criminal trials.This has been a theme recently among jurists alarmed at the growing backlog in the system. One proposed “temporary measure” is for judges to sit alone or with a couple of lay assessors rather than with a full jury in order to get through the mountain of pending trials. But it would not be a temporary measure. Once introduced it would be hard to get rid of it. Do we want the “new normal” to erode our ancient juridical rights?Or what about Parliament: when will it go back to proper functioning? Now that voting is carried out remotely or by proxy, do we ever see the old system returning or a full complement of MPs allowed back to Westminster? What will that mean for the scrutiny of legislation which was never especially well done and has been almost non-existent in recent weeks?Research by the Hansard Society think tank found that more than \u202890 pieces of legislation, including significant restrictions on people’s freedoms, were pushed through without parliamentary scrutiny. We have lost a great deal in the past few months. We cannot dispense with our democracy as well.Do events like a pandemic create a new reality or accentuate changes that were already lurking beneath the surface? Notwithstanding the death toll, this has not been the catastrophic plague that some had feared and has mercifully spared the young almost entirely, unlike past contagions. Moreover, when Mr Johnson announced what he acknowledged to be an unprecedented curtailment of inidual freedom, he said the aim was to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed.That justification passed some time ago and yet the Government still thinks it should dictate how we conduct our lives, including our most intimate contacts.

And if, as official data currently suggests, China is able to keep future outbreaks of Covid-19 under control, then it will no doubt look to capitalise wherever possible for its own economic, commercial, and political advantage.  The existential threat facing the EU, meanwhile, cannot be underestimated. Although we have seen the EU bounce from crisis to crisis over the past 10 years, it seems that, in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic – ironically a crisis originating almost certainly in China – the decisions the EU takes now will be a defining moment for the future of European integration. This combination of a China looking to exert and strengthen its global power and a Europe battling for its very survival has sadly created a truly perfect storm. And it is Italy – which was one of the EU’s most struggling countries financially pre-Covid-19, and which has been arguably the hardest hit by the virus – that sits firmly in the eye of this storm.As Italy faces its most severe crisis since the Second World War, with more than 35,000 Covid-19 deaths and its economy on course to suffer the deepest recession in modern history, there is a rising feeling within the country that it is being abandoned by its neighbours. China, meanwhile, is clearly looking for a major “satellite” in Europe, or, more politely, for a more permanent entry-point to the continent. And Italy would appear to be an obvious choice. As one of the G7 advanced economies and the second-largest manufacturer in the EU, it would be quite a catch. Put bluntly, Italy’s feelings of betrayal by its European partners, Germany in particular, seem to coincide  unfortunately with Chinese attempts to deepen its penetration of Europe. And an Italy reeling from the fallout from coronavirus, and from previous woes, may, by providing China with a willing partner on the continent, be the weak link in the EU’s approach to Beijing and to the defence more generally of European values.We have witnessed this crisis magnify the economic and political isions between northern and southern Europe that have long threatened to tear apart the EU.When Italy appealed to the rest of the EU for assistance, it was initially rebuffed. Italy, and the rest of southern Europe, had hoped for a real demonstration of solidarity from the rest of the EU early in the pandemic. And even if the EU has subsequently increased assistance in the form of financial aid and equipment, the initial hopes and expectations were by no means met. Last month, the new European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, tacitly admitted this, offering Italy a “heartfelt apology” for not having done more to help.But was this act of contrition too late? With regards to Italy in particular, it is a situation that has been brewing for quite some time. Italy’s economy has barely grown since the launch of the euro in 1999. “Reforms” were imposed on the country during the financial crisis and it has seen its status as one of the “big three” founder-members of the EU, alongside France and Germany, effectively downgraded.A migrant crisis in which, again, Italy was hit hard and the EU faced accusations of a lack of solidarity, merely added to the resentment. It is, therefore, unsurprising that, long before coronavirus was a word on most people’s lips, Italy last year signed up to China’s Belt and Road initiative, a hugely ambitious scheme to drive trade links via infrastructure projects from the Far East into the heart of Europe. It was the first major Western country to do so.Perhaps fittingly, an early symbol of Italian participation in this scheme was to be found in Chinese involvement in the deep-water port city of Trieste in the Adriatic, once part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and ceded to Italy after it joined the Allies during the First World War. Trieste has long been considered the European terminus of the maritime Silk Road from the Far East to Europe, a key trade route for about 2,000 years until the 1700s, which is thought to be a key inspiration for the Belt and Road project.Of course, European partnership with China is not confined to Italy. George Osborne, Chancellor from 2010 to 2016, ignored US opposition and signed the UK up for Beijing’s Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, widely seen as a rival to the Washington-based World Bank. Neither is Italy alone in feeling bruised by its treatment by its EU partners after bearing the initial brunt of the coronavirus crisis. Spain harbours similar feelings of neglect.Nevertheless, it is Italy that will surely be the immediate battleground for any clash of ideas and ideals between China and the EU. And unless bold action is taken by northern European countries, there is a very real risk of Italy turning its back on the European project forever and potentially turning to China. The EU must take significant measures to support and protect both Italy and wider EU integration. As Donald Tusk, now president of the European People’s Party, notes: “We must save Italy, Spain and the whole of Europe and not be afraid of extraordinary measures. This is a state of emergency.” Italy itself must also look to do everything it can to be as attractive as possible to foreign investors and businesses. There must not be overwhelming bureaucracy or an ineffective legal system preventing investment into the Italian economy. Reform in these areas – in Italy and across southern Europe generally – is long overdue and cannot be delayed any longer. We must hope that EU leaders and their Western allies take action now. They will not get a second chance – especially as an opportunistic China lurks in these unchartered waters. Nicole Junkermann is the founder of NJF Holdings, an international investment companyMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"coronavirus qa expert answers travel questions","story":"The recent easing of lockdown restrictions and reports that air bridges could be introduced in the coming weeks have given Britons fresh hope that foreign holidays could still go ahead before the summer months come to a close. But there are still signs that when holidays return, the options for where Britons can travel to and what they can do on those trips will be limited.As the uncertainty continues, the \u0027s Chief Consumer and Culture Editor, Nick Trend, answered your most pressing questions on refunds, travel restrictions and the proposed air bridges scheme. I\u0027m due to fly on holiday on July 29. The problem is I\u0027m shielding and the government has said that\u0027s in place until August 1. If I go on holiday on July 29 will my insurance be void?It depends on your policy and the condition which means that you have to shield. I’m not sure if you want to travel, or if you would like to cancel, but either way your best bet is to talk to your insurer and – most importantly your GP. If your doctor says it is safe to travel, that should be enough to convince your insurer. If they say it isn’t safe, then you may be able to activate the cancellation clause in your policy.We are due to fly from Portugal to Faro on July 5. Sunshine holidays say we can’t transfer our holiday and if we cancel we lose our money. The hotel is open and they said that we have to wear masks and gloves while around the pool area and in restaurants. Has an air bridge been agreed with Portugal? Why is it Ryanair can carry on selling flights for July when only essential travel is allowed?We expect some news to be announced about reciprocal arrangements which will allow travel to Portugal in the next couple of days. If that is the case, then your holiday will most likely go ahead and you won’t be able to transfer or cancel. If the FCO continues to recommend against travel, you should be able to get a refund. I’m afraid the issue of masks and gloves is an unpleasant side effect of the global emergency and there probably isn’t much which can be done about it.I am due to travel on July 8 for a stag party. But I am unable to quarantine when I return due to work commitments, am I able to get a refund? I am flying with Ryanair.It depends on your destination. There are several factors at play – are you allowed to socialise in groups the size of your party, for example? It may well be that air bridge arrangements to be announced in the next couple of days will remove the need for quarantine, but only a few countries will be covered. Either way, if your flight is operating, you are unlikely to be able to get a refund.We booked a safari holiday in Kenya for August 11 for a party of 4 people. We have paid the full amount. If they ask us to defer our holiday for next year and cancel again, will we still be covered by our travel insurance? Or is it best to see if we can get our money back?You’d need to check with your insurer. But you would probably need to renew the policy - in which case, check that it still has the levels of cover that you need - many policies have been altered since the outbreak of the pandemic. Personally, I’d be inclined to ask for a refund, but if there is no extra charge for deferral, it might be better to do that, since holidays are likely to be more expensive next year.We have a villa booked with TUI in October in Cyprus. We can defer it until next year (we still have to pay the remaining money in July) but two people have medical problems and at the moment Cyprus is not accepting British visitors. As I don\u0027t want to lose my deposit I would consider paying extra to defer the holiday. What should I do?TUI is allowing bookings before August 31 to be deferred, but it is unlikely to be extended as far as October. I also think Cyprus is likely to be open to UK visitors by then. So you need to weigh up your options. If you friends are unable to travel for medical reasons, the cancellation charge may be covered by your insurance. If not, much depends on how much you have paid for your deposit, and whether you are happy to lose it. No easy answer I’m afraid.Last week we received a call from our holiday company asking if we are looking forward to our holiday to Mauritius this July. We were somewhat shocked as we presumed that this would be cancelled but we were told that it is likely to go ahead. Do you think this is actually possible as we really don’t want to travel at the moment?You don’t say when in July that you are due to travel. If the FCO revises its warning against overseas travel and includes Mauritius in the list of destinations it considers safe before you are due to depart, then it is likely that your holiday will go ahead. If you really don’t want to go, talk to the operator and see if it will allow you to postpone it - otherwise I’m afraid that if you don’t go, you may have to forfeit the cancellation charges, which are likely to be high so near to the departure date.I live in Scotland where the current guidance is to only travel 5 miles from home. I have a holiday booked in England from July 3. If the situation remains the same but the agent says I can have the week I have booked, where do I stand? It seems likely holidays in Scotland will start on July 15, but on July 4 in England. Should I go? If I don\u0027t will I have to pay the balance and also lose my deposit?That’s an incredibly awkward situation! But, as I write this I hear that Nicola Sturgeon is planning to relax the rules so that you would be able to travel to England by the date in question. But I assume also you have booked a holiday cottage and  I would point out that  it is not legal to stay overnight on holiday in England on the night of July 3. So I think the agent ought to offer you the option to cancel, since it can’t fulfill the original contract.Your best bet is to  speak to the agent and try to sort it out. You might also point out that there is huge demand for cottages and that, if you do cancel it shouldn’t be difficult for the agent to re-let it and so give you a refund.Hoseasons Boating holidays on the Norfolk Broads are scheduled to restart on July 3 and we are booked on a boat for the end of July, but as a shielded inidual I am unlikely to be able to take my holiday then. Do I have the right to a refund if I cancel?If you are shielding and you have a doctor’s letter to say that it is not safe for you to travel on that date then your travel insurance may well cover the cancellation costs. If you don’t have insurance, then talk to Hoseasons. They are a reputable company and I think it is unlikely that they will force you to cancel in those circumstances. A full refund is unlikely however, they may well offer a deferral instead. How likely is it that British overseas territories such as Bermuda will be included in the air bridge scheme?There is a good chance Bermuda will be included - an official announcement is likely in the next couple of days.We booked our holiday through Loveholidays in February to go to Salou for 20 nights on July 7. However we were notified last week that the flights have been cancelled and we cannot get in touch with loveholidays. They have taken the rest of the money for the holiday today.If your holiday has been cancelled, you are entitled to a refund. I’m sure Loveholidays will be in touch. If not, please do contact asktheexperts@telegraph and we will help if we can.When will coach day trips be allowed again? I have booked a day trip for 24 people (all aged over 65). The trip is due to take place on July 2. I have not heard anything from the coach company yet.Many of the 24 people are very wary of going on the trip due to ongoing health problems. I do not want to cancel it because we would all lose our money.Is it best to wait for the coach company to contact me with the hope that they will hopefully cancel the trip? Yes – don’t cancel unilaterally or you will lose your money. I’m sure the company will cancel and if it does, you should be given a refund.Our Jet2 flights to Alicante on July 4 have been cancelled. We have rented a villa via a well established Spanish villa rental company and currently are having problems with them in regard to them explaining their coronavirus cancellation policy. All we want to know is what are our options. Thus far we have not received any answers to our question. This is extremely worrying as the cost of the villa was over £4000.I’m afraid this is one of the risks of making independent travel arrangements rather than booking with an operator. Assuming the company is based in Spain, you are subject to the law there and I’m afraid you may struggle to get a result. However, it may well be possible to find alternative flights with another airline – either to Alicante or Valencia, and it is looking possible that a deal may be in place to allow you to travel from the UK to Spain by July 4 – so it is possible that you will be able to salvage your holiday after all.Leave your questions for our next Q\u0026ampA in the comments section of this article or email them to yourstory@telegraph.

Despite this, many commentators are still pessimistic and even eager to emphasise the downside risks. It is time to view the glass as half full instead.Let us start with what we already know. The economy shrank by an unprecedented 25 per cent in just two months between February and April, but it could have been even worse. The Office for Budget Responsibility’s projections for the public finances are still based on a 35 per cent fall in GDP, sustained for a full three months. The Bank of England had warned of a 30 per cent decline.What’s more, there is now ample evidence that April was indeed the trough, and that activity picked up sharply in both May and June, even while large parts of the economy were still in lockdown. This evidence includes surveys of business activity, such as the Purchasing Managers Indices (PMIs) published by Markit. The handful of official numbers released so far have generally been better than expected too, including a 12 per cent jump in retail sales last month.Indeed, both the OBR and the Chief Economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, have now acknowledged that the economy is performing less badly than either had predicted. Even the record level of Government borrowing is slightly below the path that the OBR had pencilled in.Of course, it is still too much to hope for a neatly symmetrical V-shaped recovery, where GDP returns to its pre-crisis level as quickly as it fell. But the latest data suggest that the UK economy should get back close to this level much sooner than many had anticipated, and the picture will look far more like a V than the U, or even L, that some had feared.Indeed, I’d go further and say that an initial V is now nailed on. Some people will understandably be reluctant to venture out and spend, even if they are allowed to do so. But the latest polling suggest that a clear majority of the public support the further easing of the lockdown.In the meantime, some households have been hit disproportionately hard, including many poorer families and the self-employed. Many of those on the Government’s furlough scheme are worried about losing their jobs when it ends. Nonetheless, most households have actually built up their savings during the lockdown. Pent-up demand is therefore still likely to be strong.So, why the continuing pessimism? In part this may reflect several biases, some of which are more forgivable than others: bad news usually sells better than good news, many commentators are reluctant to appear complacent in the midst of a pandemic and may simply want to see more evidence, while others would never want to appear to give any credit to a Government led by Boris Johnson.But to be fair to the pessimists, there is also still a chance that the initial V-shaped recovery is just the first stage of a W. This double dip scenario could come about for one or both of two reasons.First, there could be a devastating second wave of the coronavirus itself. This would presumably force the Government to reimpose the lockdown, or at least prompt many consumers and businesses to behave as if it had. Others are better qualified than me to judge the likelihood of this happening, although most of what I have seen suggests that this risk is now small and that the UK is much better prepared than it was in March.Second, the rise in unemployment so far might only be the tip of a very large iceberg. It is certainly possible that many more job losses will follow in the coming months as the furlough scheme is wound down. But again, I think it right to be relatively optimistic.Crucially, the further easing of the lockdown is running well ahead of the timetable for scaling back the employment subsidies. There is also still more that the Government could do, should this be needed. However, the UK’s relatively flexible economy and labour market is pretty good at creating jobs on its own, if allowed to do so.In short, ever since the early days of the coronavirus crisis, pundits have been debating how quickly activity would rebound when the lockdown is lifted, or indeed whether it could recover at all. Thus far, the evidence points to a pleasant surprise.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"hungry monkeys run riot thai temple town","story":"Residents of the ancient Thai city of Lopburi are living in fear of marauding gangs of monkeys, as thousands of primates brawl with each other, attack shops, and take over the streets in search of food during the coronavirus lockdown. Lopburi province and the antics of its macaques have long lured hordes of foreign tourists who pose with them for selfies in exchange for free bananas.  But as tourism dried up because of the global pandemic so too did the monkeys’ food supplies, prompting a violent turn in their behaviour.  Local efforts to offer the monkey mobs some nutrition may have backfired as some say a sugary diet of fizzy drinks, cereal and sweets has fuelled the animals’ sex lives, making their population grow even more. The more they eat, the more energy they have... so they breed more, Pramot Ketampai, who manages the city’s Prang Sam Yod temple shrines, told AFP.Monkeys patrol the walls of the temple, in the centre of the 800-year-old city, to protect their turf.  In March, they staged a brazen raid on another group of monkeys living around the Phra Kan Shrine, on the prowl for temple offerings. Their invasion – captured in a video that went viral on social media - resulted in a vicious street fight that stopped traffic for ten minutes as the rival gangs screeched, charged at each other and engaged in paw-to-paw combat.  “They’re so used to having tourists feed them and the city provides no space for them to fend for themselves,” Supakarn Kaewchot, a government veterinarian told Reuters. “With the tourists gone, they’ve been more aggressive, fighting humans for food to survive,” she said. “They’re invading buildings and forcing locals to flee their homes.”The human population has had to continue with uneasy coexistence as parts of city cede complete control to the monkeys. An abandoned cinema has reportedly become the primates\u0027 headquarters, with the projection room turned into a cemetery where the monkeys lay their dead to rest. A nearby shop owner said he displayed stuffed tiger and crocodile toys to try to scare off the creatures and prevent them from snatching spray-paint cans. We live in a cage but the monkeys live outside, said one resident, Kuljira Taechawattanawanna. Their excrement is everywhere, the smell is unbearable especially when it rains.For years, city residents have had a love-hate relationship with their monkey neighbours, who attract tourist dollars but regularly create mayhem, breaking windows, stealing groceries and damaging cars. But the worsening fights, along with reports of locals barricading themselves in their homes, and no-go zones for humans, have prompted the authorities to intervene, restarting a sterilisation programme after a three year pause. Wildlife department officers have placed big cages around the city, filling them with fruit to lure the animals inside and then take them to a clinic where they are anaesthetised, sterilised and left with a tattoo to mark their neutering. They aim to treat hundreds out of the 6,000-strong macaque population within the next few weeks. More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"marilyn monroes lost handkerchief saves paris theatre financial","story":"It is a happy ending not to be sneezed at.A handkerchief belonging to Marylin Monroe has single-handedly saved a historic Paris theatre from bankruptcy after its owner auctioned the legendary Hollywood actress’s ephemeral possession for €300,000 (£270,000). For decades, the silk kerchief with floral embroidery and bordered by ivory lace had pride of place in the baroque hall of the Comédie Italienne,  France’s only theatre dedicated to Italian commedia dell’arte, in Paris’ Left-Bank 14th arrondissement.Its owner, Attilio Maggiulli, kept it as a lucky charm and the item even inspired a play two years ago called “Le Mouchoir de Marilyn” (Marilyn’s Handkerchief) in which the star has a love child with John F Kennedy, who interns the actress in a care home.According to Mr Maggiulli, the handkerchief came into his possession after a series of cross-Atlantic twists of fate.A concierge at New York’s luxury Waldorf Astoria hotel first found the item in the toilet of the room in which Monroe had been staying in 1960, he told Le Parisien.He offered it to pop art icon Andy Warhol who in turn passed it on to the illustrious art gallery owner Leo Castelli.In 1983, Mr Castelli gave the unused hanky to Mr Maggiulli as a keepsake at a time when he was renting him out a small theatre space in Soho in New York.Almost 40 years later, the nonconformist Italian said the gift had proved a godsend for the theatre, which was facing financial ruin in February shortly before the coronavirus pandemic struck, despite donations from patrons.Reluctantly, he contacted a group of wealthy fans of the theatre and organised a private auction.The handkerchief went to an unnamed bidder described as “someone who adores the theatre and admires Marilyn,” according to Mr Maggiulli’s associate, Claudine Durand-Simone.“We were able to reimburse colossal debts and the mortgage is paid,” Ms Durand-Simone told Le Parisien. “It was a happy surprise.”Despite the financial boost, the theatre is still for sale after 46 years in the hands of its Italian boss.However, here too, the tale may have a happy ending. According to the owner, just before Paris went into lockdown in March, a couple of affluent theatre-lovers visited the venue and talks over a sale are at an “advanced stage”. The potential new owners have reportedly offered to buy the theatre but allow the Comédie Italienne to continue its shows eight months of the year. All of France\u0027s theatres were closed during nationwide confinement that started on March 17. While all have been allowed to reopen this month, many are remaining shut until September due to draconian health restrictions and problems rescheduling plays.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rules lockdown new uk update","story":"The move will enable pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other businesses to be run profitably when they are allowed to reopen on the same day, and will change the way in which schools, shops, transport and workplaces can operate.Mr Johnson told MPs the rate of infection in the community – as opposed to hospitals and care homes – is now low enough to relax the social distancing rule as long as steps are taken to mitigate the risk of people being closer together.Face coverings will be needed in some indoor locations, perspex screens could be used between tables in restaurants and al fresco dining will be encouraged to minimise the risk of transmission.A Downing Street spokesman said: After a long period of asking the public to follow very strict and complex rules, the Government believes we are now in a position to enable people to see more of their friends and family.The infection rate has fallen significantly in the first half of June. Only one in 1,700 people have the virus, compared with an average of one in 400 a month ago.Where it is not possible to stay two metres apart, people are advised instead to keep one metre plus apart – meaning one metre apart plus mitigation.But I must say to the House it will be all too easy for that frost to return. And that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through, and to see us to victory over this virus.From July 4, any two households can meet together under the same roof, and even stay overnight, as long as they observe social distancing. That means families could invite one set of grandparents over for lunch and then see the other set of grandparents for dinner, as long as they are not there at the same time.The new rule also allows any two households to meet up in a pub, restaurant, museum or cinema, or even go on holiday together. There will be no limit on how many people can gather, as long as no more than two households are meeting at the same time.The Government decided against an alternative plan to allow two entire households to form one social bubble, partly because it would have forced families to choose which set of relations they could see.Existing rules allowing up to six people from up to six different households to meet outdoors remain in place, as does the rule that allows someone living alone to join a support bubble (see below) with another household and be treated as if they live in the same home.Downing Street admitted people would need to show a lot of discipline and restraint to adhere to the new rules, such as preventing children from hugging grandparents, but stressed that the changes would be swiftly reversed if coronavirus started to spread again.A Number 10 spokesman said: Your household will be able to link with one other household at a time, which includes staying over at someone\u0027s house.This is not a bubble because households should continue to remain socially distant from one another when they are indoors or outdoors, so they will need to stay two metres apart or follow the new one-metre plus advice.This will allow customers to sit closer together in venues in which it is not possible for them to be two metres apart, so long as there are additional mitigating measures in place. New safety guidance, due to be issued later, will set out a menu of options for hospitality bosses to use as part of the new system. These include more back-to-back seating, perspex screens, partitions between tables, disposable menus and more cleaning of commonly touched surface areas. Waiters will be required to wipe down surfaces more often and collect glasses and plates more frequently. People will be discouraged from returning their glass or ordering from the bar, with more table service and mobile apps expected to be introduced. The changes will also place limits on the number of people who can sit together indoors in pubs and restaurants, with just two households of any size permitted to drink or eat together. To assist the Test and Trace system, customers will be required to register their details with a venue before entry.Hairdressing salons will be able to reopen, but the experience of getting your hair cut is likely to be very different.Hairdressers will be required to wear a full-face plastic visor to reduce the risk of infection and will also need to follow strict rules over the disinfecting of equipment.Customers will have to make appointments, and there will be limits on the amount of people in salons. It is also anticipated that hairstylists will be told to cut down on small talk.But the mass reopening will come with a number of conditions attached. Recommendations to stop coronavirus from spreading include emptying mini bars, offering buffet-free breakfasts and regularly deep cleaning rooms, with 24 hours left between bookings.All paperwork is likely to be removed from rooms, along with the telephone, while the plastic pouch containing tea and coffee sachets will either be removed or quarantined for up to 72 hours between guests.Those checking in should expect to see social distancing stickers on the floor, perspex screens at the reception desk and hand sanitiser available throughout. It is thought campsites will be instructed to ensure that tents are pitched further apart than normal so social distancing measures can be adhered to, along with frequent deep cleaning of facility blocks such as showers. Some campsites will be required to reduce the number of pitches to keep numbers down. Campers are likely be told they cannot have day visitors in order to further limit the numbers on site. Communal areas such as receptions, shops, laundries and playgrounds are likely to remain closed, with guests advised to bring all their own essentials, including gas canisters.As with hotels and other overnight accommodation, guests will be asked to pay in advance and use contactless payment rather than cash. Changes to the rules, allowing two households to meet up, mean that two families will now be able to go on holiday together.The Prime Minister confirmed: From July 4, provided that no more than two households stay together, people will be free to stay overnight in self-contained accommodation, including hotels and bed and breakfasts.Mr Johnson did not specifically mention Britain\u0027s 2.2 million shielded people in his statement.However on Monday, Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary, announced that this extremely clinically vulnerable group would finally be able to meet friends and visit relatives\u0027 homes from July 6.Shielded people, considered to be the most medically vulnerable to the effects of coronavirus, including those with lung conditions and people being treated for cancer, will be able to meet up to five other people outdoors after having been virtual prisoners in their own homes for the past three months.If they live alone they will also be able to form a support bubble with one other household, meaning they can visit their families and stay overnight with them. It is hoped the infection rate will be low enough for shielding to end all together at the end of July, though help will still be available from NHS volunteers and local councils.As long as they continue strict social distancing measures, shielded people will be able to visit supermarkets and places of worship, and those who cannot work from home will be able to return as long as their workplace adheres to Government guidance.Until now, the only easing of lockdown for shielded people has been allowing them to go outside once a day with their household or, if they live alone, to meet one other person at a two-metre distance.It advises that shielded children can return to school in line with their peers, provided they wash their hands frequently and adhere to social distancing. Mr Johnson said that Easter, Passover and Eid all occurred during the lockdown and he was pleased to announce that places of worship will reopen for prayer and services, including weddings with a maximum of 30 people, all subject to social distancing.Weddings will restart from July 4, with up to 30 people able to attend under social distancing rules. Lockdown is easing - but here\u0027s are the things you still can\u0027t doSwimming pools and water parksBowling alleys and indoor skating rinks Nail bars and beauty salons  Indoor fitness and dance studios, and indoor gyms and sports venuesfacilities Exhibition or conference centres From July 4, provided they are Covid-19 compliant:Restaurants, cafes, bars and pubs             Cinemas and bingo halls       Theatres and concert hallsMuseums and galleries            Outdoor playgrounds, gyms, and skating rinks         Funfairs, theme parks and adventure parks and amusement arcades       Aquariums, zoos, safari parks, farms, wildlife centres and any place where animals are exhibited as an attractionMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"travel news eu could ban american tourists summer","story":"British holidaymakers could travel to Spain this summer if the two countries secure an \u0026#39air bridge\u0026#39What are the candidates for an \u0027air bridge\u0027?When will destinations reopen to British tourists? Listen to our brand new travel podcastForeign holidays will be a step closer when UK air bridges are announced, which could be as soon as Monday.The  understands the first of these bilateral travel agreements – which would  circumvent quarantine – will be with Portugal, Greece, Spain, Bermuda, Gibraltar and the Canary Islands.

This pandemic has put life into perspective for us all, no matter where we live, which language we speak and what we believe in. It has taught us that nothing can be taken for granted and that it took us to pause as a human race in order to come through the dark times. From now on we are sure that people will cherish the safety of the Azores Islands, a destination which has always prided itself on its commitment to welcoming visitors with open arms, with their wellbeing at the forefront of our minds.We are immensely proud of the swift action taken by the Portuguese government, tourism industry and local establishments here on the islands to ensure that we can return to a state of normality, with the utmost safety measures in place to maintain this.Acrobats performed gravity-defying stunts above Les Diablerets in Switzerland yesterday.

It has suggested alternatives to isolation plans, including testing, contact tracing and minimising the risk of contracting coronavirus while travelling. Safely restarting the economy is a priority. That includes travel and tourism. Quarantine measures may play a role in keeping people safe, but they will also keep many unemployed.The alternative is to reduce risks through a series of measures. Airlines are already offering flexibility so there is no incentive for sick or at-risk people to travel. Health declarations, screening and testing by governments will add extra layers of protection. And if someone travels while infected, we can reduce the risk of transmission with protocols to prevent the spread during travel or when at destination. And effective contact tracing can isolate those most at risk without major disruptions.Imposing quarantine measures on arriving travelers keeps countries in isolation and the travel and tourism sector in lockdown.The UK is due to review its lockdown on Monday, June 29, with air bridge agreements likely to be announced. Following yesterday\u0027s announcement, many will be planning their next staycation.

At the end of a five-minute monologue extolling the benefits of handmade syrups, seasonal mixers and boutique spirits, I had to explain demurely that I was teetotal.A momentary look of confusion on his face dissolved into disbelief and, a second later, stunned laughter – loud, dry, incredulous laughter that ricocheted around the bar like a thunderclap, turning the heads of nearby patrons. He hadn’t meant it in any offensive way, he explained. It was just that the concept of being alcohol-free was strange to him, and more so in a cocktail bar the irony of the bar being called voda (“water”) did not escape us. The dainty, alcohol-free strawberry martini he made for me completed my emasculation in the eyes of the liquor-swilling punters all around me.Despite such episodes, the past year or so of living and travelling without booze has been wholly positive.Read the full story.Temperatures should continue to climb this week – London is set to be hotter than Ibizia – and many Britons are soaking up the coastal sun.Lifeguards keep watch in Weymouth, Dorset, todayThe busy beach at WeymouthA dog enjoys a dip in the sea at South Gare near Redcar, North YorkshireEuropean Union countries could block visitors from the US due to America\u0027s failure to effectively tackle the coronavirus outbreak. Brussels has drawn up two draft lists of acceptable travellers ahead of its July 1 border reopening, according to The New York Times. America is not named on either list. The US has recorded more than 2.4 million cases of the virus and over 123,00 deaths, the highest rates in the world.

After initially leaving the UK off its restricted list, the ban was soon extended to Britons. In an exclusive interview with the  earlier this month, Dr Anthony Fauci warned that British holidaymakers could be banned from travelling to the US for months, dashing hopes of summer trips to America. Around 3.8 million Britons visit the US each yearEngland might be in the throngs of a heatwave but Down Under snow has been falling and Australia’s ski resorts have reopened, reports Lucy Aspden.Lifts in Thredbo in New South Wales and Mount Buller in Victoria began turning on Monday, followed by the country’s most popular resort Perisher plus Mount Hotham and Falls Creek in Victoria today.Australian resorts follow the lead of their southern hemisphere cousins in New Zealand, which reopened earlier this month.Life on the slopes looks a lot different to what keen skiers and snowboarders are used to.

A world where palm trees whispered in the breeze and basking sharks cruised beneath the cliffs in waters bluer than the Caribbean.This I had discovered because my father worked for the Southern Railway. Every year he was given privilege tickets which allowed him to take us on holiday anywhere in Britain at no expense. So, while my childhood friends spent their summers at easy-to-reach South Coast resorts like Bognor and Littlehampton – this was long before the advent of package tours and cheap flights, when the Mediterranean was still a rich man’s playground – we travelled by steam train down to Britain’s own Cote d’Azur: Cornwall. Read the full story.Merlin Entertainments has said it will reopen all its major theme parks, attractions and accommodation across England from July 4 for day visits and short breaks.  Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, Legoland Windsor, Warwick Castle and Chessington World of Adventures Resort are among Merlin’s holdings.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.The pound sterling has behaved more like the volatile currency of a developing country over the past four years since the Brexit referendum vote, according to an analysis by foreign exchange traders.Since the Brexit vote on 23 June 2016 the pound has suffered a record fall against the dollar, a rapid gain and then another precipitous slide to its weakest level in 35 years.The price swings of the currency have been notable, but Kamal Sharma and Myria Kyriacou of Bank of America also note that the “liquidity” of the currency – the difference between the rates at which traders are willing to buy and sell – seems worse than for other major currencies and that traders are also pricing in a higher risk of future volatility.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesWhat really forces currency markets and exchange rates to change?Their research also suggests that during the coronavirus crisis only the Brazilian real has seen more volatility in foreign exchange futures markets than sterling.This has led them to argue that the UK’s currency should best be seen as an emerging market (EM) currency – such as South Africa’s rand or Turkey’s lira – rather than compared to traditional peers such as the US dollar or the euro or other members of the G10 group of industrialised economies.“A more bespoke view of the pound is required and one that would take an EM-esque view.”The Bank of America analysts are clear that the volatility of sterling in recent years has been largely driven by the result of the Brexit vote and they warn that this is likely to intensify, rather than fall away, as the UK formally leaves the bloc, with or without a trade deal, next year.“Brexit is likely to permanently alter the way in which investors view the pound,” they say.They also see the fiscal and economic fallout of the coronavirus crisis in the UK influencing the way the currency is traded.They see the government’s fiscal deficit at 6 per cent of GDP in 2021 and the current account – the amount the country as a whole borrows from abroad – at 4 per cent. This would put the UK’s “dual deficit” – a combination of the two measures – higher than the G20 average and also wider than that of South Africa and Turkey.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Am I the black spokesperson?”He then told Morgan that, while he has “a bunch of views” to share, he felt that “now is not the time” to speak about them.Meet Che Lingo, the London rapper confronting police brutalityHow the art world can step up for Black Lives Matter“I’ve brought my afro out, I’m looking a bit natural and so maybe that’s why you’re asking the question, but not today,” he said. Morgan defended himself by saying: “That’s not why I’m asking you the question. You’re a high-profile black man in this country, and it’s been a huge issue and has been a huge news story for four weeks.”Dizzee, attempting to get a word in, replied: “You know what, I watch you on telly and you never let no one speak. You’re not going to do this to me, mate. Let’s keep it calm.”After Morgan called his response “aggressive”, Dizzee – laughing – replied: “This is what happens – I become the aggressive black man! I just wanted to be nice, and look how he’s behaving.”Viewers praised the rapper for “totally owning” Morgan.“Dizzee Rascal has made everyone’s morning,” one tweeter wrote, adding: ”I love watching Piers Morgan squirm for once. Totally owned haha.”Another added: “I’m so happy the way Dizzee Rascal called out Piers Morgan for asking him about BLM on GMB – why does every white host ask every black person about BLM, but not white people?!”“Dizzee Rascal what a bloke,” one person concluded. “Sticking Piers Morgan in his place whilst fishing to stir up more issues when he’s got positive things to talk about.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Promotion for the event makes no mention of social distancing measures.On Facebook, one of the event’s organisers wrote: “When the lockdown first happened, my first thought was OK we can all do 2 weeks, then it went on and on, things were getting cancelled, I started to worry about people not only for this Covid but mental, physical, financial.How Coldplay’s ‘Yellow’ altered the course of 21st-century rock musicInside the raucous new south London guitar sceneTalking Heads’ star-studded monologues will sand-blast the soul“As humans we NEED other human contact.

Two of the stores – in Ross-on-Wye and Leominster – reopened on Monday 15 June.“Being able to shop in person, especially at smaller independents, is a joy,” owner Andy Rossiter, pictured above, says. “I think lockdown made a lot of people realise that they don’t want all their shopping to just land at their door, but booksellers also know they need to work hard for their audience. It’s not simply a case of just opening your doors.”Rossiter has been busy preparing the stores, moving fixtures and checkouts so that staff and customers can socially distance while browsing for books.Carry out a risk assessment: employers will need to carry out Covid-19 risk assessments in consultation with their workers or trade unions.Maintain social distancing: employers should redesign workspaces to maintain social distancing between people and stagger start times.Manage transmission risk:\u0026nbspemployers should look into putting barriers in shared spaces, creating workplace shift patterns or fixed teams.Reinforcing cleaning processes: workplaces should be cleaned more frequently, paying close attention to\u0026nbspdoor handles and keyboards.“We have installed Perspex screens at till points, bought hand sanitiser stations for the entrances to our stores and placed tape and signage throughout so we can clearly indicate the social distancing rules within our stores,” he says.The bookshops have reopened with less members of staff and they have limited their opening hours from their pre-lockdown seven days to just five. Rossiter has also been consulting staff and getting their input on the UK Government’s coronavirus advice.“Our trade body, the Booksellers Association, has been brilliant at reading and interpreting this advice to make it bookshop-specific and releasing it in digestible and accessible weekly bulletins, he says.“Booksellers love serving customers, and we’ve been serving our local community for a decade, so seeing those regulars again and having that relationship start to return to normal will be fantastic.Surinder Josan, owner of All Seasons DIY, a family-run shop, explains how he has used strict safe workplace measures to keep his shop doors open and his businesses afloat.“All Seasons DIY is a family-run shop which was established over 40 years ago, run by myself, my wife, and my mother. My son and daughter work in the shop around their university studies as well,” Josan, below, says.The family decided to shut the shop when school closures were announced. But after just a week they decided to reopen the business in order to serve the local community, who relied on the store for essential food and other items.“In order to reopen, we had to reassess how we both serve and interact with our customers,” Josan explains. “We adopted several new measures to comply with social distancing to keep both ourselves and our customers safe.”These new measures they adopted included safe distance markers outside the shop, to limit the number of people in store at any one time, installing screens at the checkout areas, encouraging contactless payments, lowering the minimum card spend to £1, and offering hand wipes to customers.“The number of customers who have come in and complimented us for it is unbelievable. They say when they come here they feel really safe,” Josan adds.Blend Coffee Co is an independent coffee shop based in Portslade, East Sussex, near Brighton. The two directors behind the business, Oli Crawley and Tom Jennion, have introduced a range of measures so they could confidently reopen for staff and customers.“Our primary concern is to keep people safe, so to make sure our coffee shop was ready to be reopened we implemented a number of safer working measures,” says Crawley.These new measures included a deep clean of the shop prior to reopening, implementation of a new ordering layout and adopting a new policy which stipulates that no customers are allowed inside the store.Working alongside Crawley and Jennion are a further three members of staff.“Only the directors returned to work to alleviate any pressure on our barista team feeling they need to work,” says Crawley. “This also allows an operational analysis of all our new protocols to ensure they are efficient and safe.”The checkout system has now been moved to the front of the shop, Blend now only accepts card payments and there is a new waiting area outside the shop.This plan was developed after we undertook a risk assessment and analysis of the premises to ensure that customer-staff interaction could be maintained and sustained in a safe manner. We ran a test prior to reopening to ensure that our new measures would work and allow us and our customers to stay safe,” adds Crawley.For further information from the UK Government on how employers, employees and the self-employed can return to work safely, click hereThis is Government advice for EnglandWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

Unfortunately, not long after her return, jobs began to get cancelled because of the intensifying Covid-19 crisis.She started looking for something else right away – and is currently living and working on New Moor Farm in Southminster, Essex, working with asparagus, having swapped fashion for food.Though a far cry from a usual career, Philip is enjoying her new setting. “Right now, I live on site on the farm, in one of the caravans in the orchard. It’s nice,” she explains. “The community is amazing. There are so many different characters on the farm. Everyone is really friendly and we’re all here for the same reasons: to help and to work.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHer day-to-day routine varies. “Most days I’m up at five, start working at six on the farm, in the packhouse,” she says. “Generally, I’m doing a little bit of everything, so I’m helping on the line, bundling, helping customers, grading – just helping out wherever I can.”Philip is among Brits across the country working on farms in order to help the industry continue despite the many obstacles presented by the Covid-19 pandemic.The temporary closure of much of the food and hospitality industry has left huge quantities of fresh produce at risk of going to waste. The pubs and restaurants that would usually purchase large amounts of vegetables remain shut and travel restrictions have prevented pickers from overseas working on the farms.Join the Pick For BritainThat’s why the Government is urging fit and healthy people looking for work across the country to get involved. The Pick For Britain initiative is helping to bring workers and employers together to ensure the farming industry can continue.From furloughed employees whose contracts allow them to work during this time, to university students on their summer breaks, it’s a great opportunity to earn money and meet new people – while helping Britain’s food industry during these unprecedented times.The growing season is only just getting started, so from now until September, bringing in the harvest requires a major effort. Visit pickforbritain.org.uk to find out moreEat seasonal and local vegBut that’s not the only way to support the industry right now. Simply eating more in-season local produce will help to prevent wastage.A wide range of vegetables are currently being harvested in the UK. These include asparagus, cucumbers, mushrooms, courgettes, spinach, summer squash, radishes, beetroot and tomatoes – and buying and cooking with this seasonal veg is a great way to contribute to the farming industry.​In need of some recipe inspo?

That’s why there\u0027s never been a better time to try something new.Among the wide range of different species found in UK waters are mussels, crab, mackerel, herring, rainbow trout, hake and coley (or saithe).

No,” he added, saying the NPCC had commissioned a “plan of action”.It will look at the representation and treatment of black and ethnic minority police officers, as well as community relationships, the use of force and powers including stop and search.Concerns have been raised about the disproportionate use of force, including Tasers, against black people as well as the way coronavirus fines have been handed out.Created with Sketch.Black Lives Matter protesters gather across the UK Show all 79Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.People take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Parliament Square, London, in memory of George Floyd who was killed on May 25 while in police custody in the US city of MinneapolisA girl wears a face mask during a Black Lives Matter rally in Parliament SquarePeople are seen by a mural of George Floyd who died in police custody in Minneapolis, Stevenson Square, ManchesterPeople take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Manchester Piccadilly GardensChildren pose for their family in front of discarded placards fixed on a wall in Piccadilly Gardens after a Black Lives Matter demonstrations in ManchesterPeople shout slogans during a Black Lives Matter rally in Parliament SquareDemonstrators in LeicesterA demonstrator holds up a placard during a Black Lives Matter protest in Parliament SquareA demonstrator gestures during a Black Lives Matter protest in ManchesterA mounted police officer raises their baton as police horses ride along Whitehall, past the entrance to Downing Street, in an attempt to disperse protestors gathered in central LondonPeople take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Bute Park, CardiffPeople take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally march on Vauxhall Bridge Road, LondonProtesters hold up signs as they march along a road during a peaceful Black Lives Matter march in AylesburyPeople climbing on top of the Queen Victoria Statue as they take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Manchester Piccadilly GardensChildren pose for a photo during a Black Lives Matter protest at Parliament Square Demonstrators hold placards as they attend a protest march to the US Embassy in London Protesters demonstrate near the the US Embassy in Nine Elms in LondonProtesters in Whitehall following a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Parliament SquareDemonstrators wearing protective face masks and face coverings hold placards during a Black Lives Matter protest in LeicesterA demonstrator is seen during a Black Lives Matter protest in Parliament SquareDemonstrators are seen as police officers look on during a Black Lives Matter protest near Downing street in LondonDemonstrators are seen wth police liaison officers during a Black Lives Matter protest in LutonA protest at Parliament Square in LondonA demonstrator in LeicesterPeople take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Parliament SquareDemonstrators wearing protective face masks and face coverings hold placards during a Black Lives Matter protest in LeicesterPeople take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Custom House Square, BelfastPolice on horseback in Whitehall following a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Parliament Square, LondonProtesters hold placards as they attend a demonstration in Parliament SquareDemonstrators throw flares above a police line during a Black Lives Matter march in LondonPeople climbing on top of the Queen Victoria Statue as they take part in a Black Lives Matter protest rally in Manchester Piccadilly GardensDemonstrators raise their hands facing police officers after scuffles during a Black Lives Matter march in LondonPeople are seen placing placards on a fence in London A demonstrator is seen with a protective face mask during a Black Lives Matter protest in WatfordA sign alternatively naming Wilson Street \u0027Rosa Parks Street\u0027 in Glasgow.

Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive morning headlines Monday - Friday plus breaking news alerts by emailShe accused Mr Hewitt of making a “basic mistake” by failing to take account of the fact that ethnicity has not been recorded for almost a quarter of the 18,000 fines handed out.Ms Cooper said police had been warned of potential racial disproportionality in the emergency powers but did not put adequate protections in place.She added: “You didn’t have built-in data or systems you could easily draw upon to find whether or not these fines were being used disproportionately.‘Postcode lottery’ of coronavirus fines across England and Wales“Your initial analysis made some really basic insensitive errors that meant you claimed something was proportionate, when it clearly wasn’t … doesn’t this reveal something really serious about the police response to race and ethnicity?”Mr Hewitt said the statistical mistake had been corrected and denied the allegation, adding: “I don’t think that’s an entirely fair challenge.”He added that police had to create the system for unprecedented coronavirus fines “from nothing within literally 36 hours” following Boris Johnson’s lockdown announcement on 23 March.The Home Affairs Committee asked for an ethnic breakdown on the fines issued by each police force in England and Wales, but the NPCC has refused to publish the data until it is analysed.“I think there’s a real concern that this isn’t just being made public so everyone can debate and discuss the context publicly, as opposed to the police spending a very long time doing so,” Ms Cooper said.Figures released so far by the NPCC show that between 27 March and 8 June in England, 79 per cent of fines were handed out to white people in England, 12 per cent to Asian people, 5 per cent to black people, 2 per cent mixed-race and 1 per cent other.The figures exclude the 23 per cent of fines were ethnicity was not stated - a group that campaigners believe contains many more black and ethnic minority people.According to the 2011 census, 86 per cent of the population of England and Wales is white, 8 per cent Asian, 3 per cent black, 2 per cent mixed and 1 per cent other.Mr Hewitt argued that regional police forces had been enforcing the coronavirus lockdown “in their own context” and had experienced different issues based on issues including whether they contain cities or beauty spots.The NPCC “plan of action” will also look at the use of force and powers including stop and search, which has rocketed in London during the lockdown despite plummeting crime.Mr Hewitt promised to “engage with critics” but admitted that several members of the national Taser stakeholder advisory group quit in April, accusing the NPCC of failing to take racial disproportionality seriously.He said: “The last few weeks have caused some real reflection, and to take a really hard look at ourselves. That hard look says we need to do more and we need to do it quicker.”According to the latest figures, 238,000 people have joined around 834 protests held across the UK since Mr Floyd’s death.The numbers cover Black Lives Matter demonstrations and counter-protests by right-wing groups and people claiming to “defend” statues.There have so far been almost 300 arrests and 100 officers have been injured.Stop and Search\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Viruferrin has been scientifically proven to block 98 per cent of similar viruses to Covid-19, including influenza and Sars.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe snood-like coverings can be worn for up to 50 hours before they need washing, and their effectiveness only drops to 96 per cent after over 200 hours of wear.The face coverings are cut and sewn together by Cookson \u0026amp Clegg in Blackburn, which is run by Patrick Grant, star of the Great British Sewing Bee. He is also behind a campaign to get Britons making their own coverings, The Great Community Sew.How to support our campaignThe coverings, which retail at £20, are different to medical grade PPE used by NHS workers. However, due to the protein coverings they are more effective than standard face masks at protecting wearers from viruses.There was a buzz at the Royal Park Felix Project depot when boxes of Virustatic Shield coverings arrived.David Clark, who has been volunteering for three years, said: “I think it is important to wear these face coverings when you’re delivering to members of the public who potentially come into contact with vulnerable people.”Mr Clark dropped off some coverings to Ian Breen, centre manager at Acton Homeless Concern, which serves hot meals five days a week to those in temporary accommodation or on the streets. Mr Breen said: “It is fantastic to have a delivery of some masks for free.

Each section features a famous face, including Morgan Freeman, Whoopi Goldberg and Sir Paul McCartney, and is signed by Sir Peter, 87.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesProceeds will go to two beneficiaries, including The Independent\u0027s Help The Hungry Now appeal partner The Felix Project.Today, Ms Lumley said it was an “honour” to be part of the fundraising effort.

It is a fabulous way of making life worth living.”Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mDame Judi said: “How wonderful that Peter Blake’s amazing artwork will have a new lease of life for such good causes.

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Our Help The Hungry appeal today passed the £7m mark, enabling our appeal partner, The Felix Project, to deliver the equivalent of 4.3 million meals to hungry schoolchildren and vulnerable Londoners in the 12 weeks since lockdown began.The milestone was reached thanks to more significant corporate donations, including an additional £100,000 from online grocer Ocado, taking its total donation to £390,000, and a further £90,000 from banking group Citi boosting their aggregate give to £250,000.It comes as the charity Feeding Britain warns that 3 million children face the prospect of hunger during the upcoming school holidays. Of these, it cautions, only 1 million are eligible for the government’s free school meal summer holiday voucher of £15 a week, with the remaining 2 million living with parents who narrowly do not qualify but cannot always afford food.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHelen Barnard, of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, confirmed that the summer voucher scheme – agreed by the prime minister after being forced into a U-turn by footballer Marcus Rashford – only covers a minority of children in poverty. She said: “Soaring numbers of families are being pulled under and having to rely on food banks to get through the current crisis, even with the voucher scheme in place.”The harsh reality is that an astounding 66 per cent of food-insecure families – amounting to almost 200,000 children in London – cannot access government help and are forced to rely on food parcels from charities such as The Felix Project.Food and 10,000 face coverings donated to charities and vulnerableWhich star will you bid for in Peter Blake’s big hotel cover auction?Help the Hungry: Our readers help us reach £6.5mHow Help The Hungry is helping refugees forced to live on £5 a day At the start of lockdown, The Felix Project faced an existential crisis with a total collapse of its fundraising. Thanks to The Independent’s campaign, it has not only been able to survive but has operated at twice its normal capacity, delivering up to 40 tons of nutritious produce a day and supplying 86 schools and 400 charities and community hubs across the capital over the course of a week.The Independent shareholder Evgeny Lebedev said: “These generous new donations take us 70 per cent of the way towards our goal to secure £10m to combat food poverty in London over the next three years. Our pledge is given added urgency by the release of worrying economic data, including that the number of people out of work and claiming benefits jumped 23 per cent to 2.8 million last month.”Jo West, of Ocado Retail, said most of its donation had been raised from Ocado and their customers via their “you give, we give” scheme. She added: “We’re extremely grateful to our customers for their generosity which enables groups like The Felix Project to bring food to people in desperate need.” James Murray, chair of the Bridgepoint Charitable Trust, which donated £50,000, said: “We are delighted to contribute to the work of The Felix Project in feeding vulnerable communities.”Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The sum paid is determined their income.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe women behind the judicial review said unpaid money had forced them to resort to food banks and accumulate debt on credit cards to ensure their children had food to eat.Some £354m is owed by absent parents across the UK and less than 10 per cent of that has been recouped by the DWP, according to the latest figures.DWP loses Court of Appeal Universal Credit case against four mothersThe legal action comes after The Independent reported on an increase in fathers not paying child maintenance during the coronavirus pandemic. During the pandemic, the DWP has halted investigations into missing child maintenance payments.Around 70 per cent of the 2 million single parents living in the UK are currently in work, but three out of 10 single parents who work are living in poverty. Some 90 per cent of single parents are women.Gingerbread’s, a charity for single-parent families, said the DWP had been “so slow and negligent in cases of child maintenance” and had “failed to use their enforcement powers to make parents pay in order to provide for their children”.Victoria Benson, the charity’s chief executive, said a parent only had to pay a fraction of the sum they owed for the DWP to deem them compliant.She added: “It is a child’s legal right to be supported by both parents, and yet the service designed to protect this right is failing them. Even before Covid-19, there was £334m in unpaid arrears and over 100,000 children across the country were not receiving a penny in maintenance.

It simply cannot be right that a government service is responsible for leaving children of single parents in poverty.”Increase in fathers not paying ‘child maintenance amid coronavirus’The charity warned parents not making child maintenance payments pushed many single-parent families into poverty. It noted research has demonstrated that 60 per cent of families who are owed maintenance and are living in poverty would be pulled out of the “poverty trap” if they received what they were owed.Justine Roberts, founder and chief executive of Mumsnet, said: “Contributing towards the food on your child’s table and the roof over their head is surely the minimum basic standard for being a decent parent, which makes the low priority accorded to enforcing child maintenance payments close to inexplicable. As countless single parents on Mumsnet will attest, the effects on children’s physical and emotional wellbeing are profound. It’s long past time for the Child Maintenance Service to do its job.”Jolyon Maugham, director of Good Law Project, which supporting the legal action, said that being a single parent was “just about the toughest job” in the UK. The women facing lockdown burnout as they juggle jobs with childcareHe added: “What single parents really need is help from government. But what they’ve had is laws which remove their right to sue absent parents for financial support and an agency that fails to collect that money. “The Child Maintenance Service – along with its predecessors – has failed single parents, usually mothers, for years. It is high time it was made fit for purpose.”The DWP has been contacted for comment.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

minister has refused to reveal the details of the proposed deal that would allow chlorinated chicken into the UK – claiming the Americans might be listening.A “dual tariff” plan has been put forward to Donald Trump’s administration that would permit US food that does not meet current British standards, provided they paid higher levies.But, asked for the first time about the idea by a committee of MPs, trade secretary Liz Truss refused to discuss it – while twice ducking the opportunity to deny it.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I’m not going to go into detail in this committee on our negotiating strategy, because I suspect our counterparties from across the Atlantic might be taking account of my comments,” she claimed.The comment was made despite it being widely accepted that the proposal has already been made to Washington, in detailed talks continuing this week.Johnson confronted over claim no country has working coronavirus appEarlier this month, No 10 dropped a pledge to maintain bans on both chlorinated chicken and hormone-fed beef, as talks towards a trade deal with Washington ramp up.Ministers have been accused of risking the greatest risk to food safety since mad cow disease 20 years ago, undermining “a food safety revolution” that protected British shoppers.The comments also came after a separate committee accused ministers of drawing a “veil of secrecy” over decision-making after Brexit, MPs having been shut out of scrutinising trade deals.Put under pressure by the Commons international trade committee, Ms Truss came out fighting – insisting she was ready to walk away from the US talks, if her “red lines” were crossed.Created with Sketch.Brexit day: UK says goodbye to EU  Show all 66Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with

Here are some of the measures that schools are implementing to make the transition easier for pupils, staff and parentsIn association with the UK GovernmentHinchingbrooke School is an academy school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire, with more than 1,900 pupils and 200 staff. Teachers started welcoming back A-level students last week.“We’ve only had the Year 12s in so far, but for them it was really clear they were delighted to be back,” says Mark Patterson, school principal, pictured above. “You could see it on their faces. It’s getting back to some sense of routine, structure and normality.He continues: “I think a lot of them have been surprised by how much they’ve missed school. I think if you’d asked them before lockdown ‘Would you like a week off?’, they’d have said ‘Please!’. I bet if you asked them now, they’d say ‘Can I come back?’. I think the parents and students now realise how important school is.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesPrior to the return, teachers organised a virtual assembly for Year 10 and 12 pupils, and sent a booklet home detailing the new guidelines which would be in place.5 back-to-school tips for parents\u0026nbsp“Don\u0027t give them a lot of small instructions – recognise your child would have had an enormous amount of\u0026nbspinstructions during the course of the day.”“If you are rewarding your child\u0027s behaviour, it\u0027s very important to do it every time.”“For a child who\u0027s been finding it tough,\u0026nbsptalking to another child who\u0027s been in the same situation is by far the best way of letting it out.”“It\u0027s important to encourage a child to work for themselves and get on with their own inner task.”New measures include red circles marked on the ground that are two metres apart and one-way systems throughout the school.“We’ve reorganised all the classrooms that we’re using so the desks and chairs are two metres apart,” Patterson explains. “We’ve got designated areas set aside at break and lunchtime for each group to go to, and we’ve got signage around the school reminding everybody of the importance of hygiene, frequent hand washing and keeping their distance.”Implementing new measuresRheeya Makwana is one of the Year 12 students who has returned to Hinchingbrooke. “We’ve been having online lessons and voiceover PowerPoints, but it’s not really the same as being in a classroom,” she says. “The structure was really good and I felt like I learned a lot more being back at school. I came home in such a good mood.”Rheeya’s father Yogesh Makwana did have some initial worries about his daughter returning to school: “There’s always some concern, but all the communication from school has been excellent in the build up to it and all the measures that have been put in place have reassured us. If you offered our 13-year-old the chance to go back to school tomorrow, he’d do it in a heartbeat. He misses his classes the social interaction. He loves PE and he does so much at school that he misses.Year 10 pupils Vahine and Lucia will also be returning to the school this week. “The twins are really looking forward to it,” says their mother, Alesia Dickinson. “They’ve been messaging all their friends to find out what group they’re in. Less than a week after we said yes to going back we found out what bubbles they were in and we had clear guidelines about times, rooms and what they can expect when they go back to school. They’re raring to go.”Both Makwana and Dickinson agree that their children have missed the structure of school lessons and that the transition back to the classroom has been easier than expected. “I think it’s a positive thing,” says Dickinson. “I think it’s a step in the right direction. We need to let the children start that process.”Going back to Embark schoolsTrust leader at Embark Matthew Crawford, pictured below, has been welcoming back primary pupils to the Federation’s schools across Derbyshire.“The feedback we have had so far from all the schools across the Trust is that it’s going really well in terms of welcoming the children back,” he says. “It’s not a one-size-fits-all. Each school has done a risk assessment based on what they can do.”Most Embark schools are now back at around 25-30 per cent capacity, Crawford says. It\u0027s up from around two per cent when lockdown began, when it was just key workers’ children and more vulnerable pupils in the classroom.“It’s lovely to hear the children playing and see schools becoming vibrant again,” he adds. “As soon as lockdown began, we started work on our Reconnection to Recovery and Resilience programme, a nine-stage support package to welcome children back safely.”Keyworker Vicki Ellis has two children who have returned to one of Embark\u0027s schools Richardson Endowed Primary - Amelia in Year 3 and Darcey in Year 1, pictured below.The first day the girls were back I was wondering how they were all day. I knew the school had done everything possible to welcome the children back in a happy, positive way but I worried whether Amelia and Darcey were enjoying themselves. But when they came home they were so happy to have had that day at school – and eager to go back next day. Crawford explains that the school has tried to make the transition back to the classroom as fun as possible for the children: “We’re following the guidelines but in a way that’s fun for the children. We aren’t marking big Xs on the floor. Some of our schools, for example, are painting snakes in bright colours to show the way.”Embark has also shared its programme with schools as far as Devon, Durham, South Gloucestershire and Wales.“It’s a suite of resources and activities that schools can adapt to their own settings, taking the bits that work for them,” explains Crawford. “It’s lovely that the brilliant work of our staff is making a difference and impacting the lives of millions of children across the country, not just the 3,000 within our Trust.”Information in this article applies to schools in England only.

There have been more than 170 new cases of Covid-19 since last week, marking the biggest increase since the virus\u0027s spread was close to being eliminated in April.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.More than a thousand parliamentarians from across Europe have signed a joint letter protesting Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank.It is part of a growing international opposition to Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s promise to begin annexing parts of the West Bank that have Israeli settlements – potentially as early as 1 July.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesSigned by 1,080 parliamentarians from 25 European countries, the letter calls for “commensurate consequences” from European governments If Israel goes ahead with the annexation.More than 240 signatories are British politicians, including former Conservative leader Lord Howard, former Labour leader Lord Kinnock and Labour’s current shadow foreign secretary Lisa Nandy.The joint letter called for decisive action to “prevent annexation and to safeguard the prospects of the two-state solution and a just resolution to the conflict”.Will Netanyahu really annex the Jordan Valley? Netanyahu isn’t bluffing about his plans to annex the Jordan ValleyIt stated: “Failure to adequately respond would encourage other states with territorial claims to disregard basic principles of international law.”Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 war and in the decades since has built dozens of settlements that are now home to roughly 400,000 Israelis.Most of the international community considers the settlements illegal. The Palestinians seek the territory as part of any future independent state.Mr Netanyahu’s government has yet to publish details of the proposed annexation but the prime minister has called for roughly 30 per cent of the territory, including the Jordan Valley, to be annexed by Israel.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They do what they are told to by top brass but these horribly mixed messages are not a good look.It was once commonplace to hear that this country has the best police force in the world. When was the last time you heard that But it was true. Think of the late PC Keith Palmer, who died in  while heroically preventing a kne-wielding Islamist terrorist from entering the Palace of ­Westminster.Yet during this lockdown, there has been a steady draining away of respect for the police.How we all chortled to learn that in Hampshire,  per cent of police are now overweight or obese — the fat-buttocked blue line.While in London, when a ­protester leapt in front of the PM’s car causing a minor crash, it was hardly a complete surprise to see day-dreaming officers gormlessly staring off into space, as oblivious as Keystone Cops in a coma.There is a growing lack of respect for the police and that is the reason why  officers were injured in one weekend.The ordinary copper has been poorly led, leading to inevitable inaction the moment they are met by protesters or a crowd of eager shoppers at Nike Town.Their own senior officers seem far more concerned about ­displaying their politically correct credentials rather than anything resembling law and order. More than  years ago, the Macpherson Report into the death of Stephen Lawrence in South East London found the Met Police to be ­“institutionally racist”.There has been a great overhaul in the force since.It is hugely welcome that there are Black Asian and Minority ­Ethnicofficers now in senior Scotland Yard roles. This was long overdue.But there is still a long way to go before the force can be regarded as being truly erse.Five of the nation’s police forces have only one black officer.Forces in Durham, North ­Yorkshire, Warwickshire, Dyfed-Powys and North Wales had only one black officer in their ranks each as of March last year.This doesn’t mean our officers should be drawn into events like the death of George Floyd , miles away.It should be self-evident that British police were not in any way responsible for that death in Minneapolis.And yet a statement issued on behalf of Britain’s Chief Constables solemnly stated: “We stand alongside all those across the globe who are appalled and ­horried by the way George Floyd lost his le.“Justice and accountability should follow. We will tackle bias, racism or discrimination wherever we find it.”But the appalling racist violence of American cops — or indeed, when the police go on a violent rampage in Paris or Hong Kong — should not be clumsily confused with the issues our bobbies face here.As the violent clashes of the past few weeks have demonstrated, our officers should be focused on our own problems dealing with crime on our own streets.PAMELA ANDERSON ­promotes fake leather vegan handbags.You would never guess it’s mostly plastic.The bag, I mean. Not Pam.“Is Dad a James Bond fan by any chance ” cooed Britt on the website Cameo. “I’m here to fulfil your wildest desires.”Wow – you’ve got one old dad going now, Britt!You couldn’t get me a signed photo of Ana de Armas, could you AND they’re off!” cried Lizzie Cundy. No, not her clothes – the horses.“Doing this year’s Ascot at home,” sighs Lizzie.Just as well. They would never have let her into the Royal Enclosure carrying that glass of champagne.SIR KEIR STARMER, Labour’s gutless leader, is scared ­witless of upsetting his union paymasters so he can’t bring himself to admit that opening our schools is safe – despite sending his own children to school throughout the lockdown.Same old Labour – always hypocrites when it comes to educating their children. One law for them etc.Meanwhile, the Government is finally showing some urgency about getting the schools open again for all, pumping £billion into state schools over the next year, including £million for the most disadvantaged children.It beggars belief that non-essential shops have reopened while schools remain closed or see only a trickle of pupils.There are no non-essential children.DOMINIC RAAB says he would only take the knee for his missus and the Queen.Cue widespread and totally predictable outrage from the likes of Labour’s permanently apoplectic David Lammy.But as Raab’s Jewish father Peter fled the Nazis as a six-year-old Czech in , I don’t think the Foreign Secretary needs lessons in opposing racism from anyone.And to many of us, “taking the knee” looks like a servile and empty gesture, bowing down before the great gods of woke.During World War Two, there were those who thought Dame Veras songs were too sentimental for fighting men who might never see home again.But with We’ll Meet Again and The White Clfs Of Dover, Vera gave hope in the darkness all around.It is signicant that the Queen chose that immortal phase “We will meet again” in her address to the nation at the height of the pandemic.Some songs last for ever.DAN WALKER, the BBC presenter, mocks a supporter of the online campaign Defund The BBC as “a Russian bot” – meaning a fake account run by foreign communists who seek our demise.Oh, Dan! Defund The BBC was started by a smart young Glasgow University student called James Yucel.And there are millions who believe that the funding model of the BBC is laughably old-fashioned in the age of Netflix, Amazon and the rest.Sometimes I think it is the BBC’s preachy, ridiculously overpaid presenters such as Gary Lineker, Emily Maitlis and deluded Dan Walker, above, who are the Russian bots – planted to hasten the end of the BBC.Great, but Lewis is paid £million a year by the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One team – and , forced labourers once toiled in Mercedesfactories in Nazi Germany.I drive a BMW, who also used slaves under the Nazis.When it comes to symbols of racism, Lewis, German carmakers take some beating.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

You can now at last be within ft in of someone outside your immediate household! What’s more, from July , you will be able to eat in restaurants, have a drink and, of course, continue shopping.⚠️ Read our coronavirus live blog for the latest news  updatesWhat you won’t be able to do, unless you are very fortunate, is to get your children into school, which says something about our national priorities. Make no mistake about it, this is a “national emergency”. Education should have the upfront priority that we rightly give the NHS and saving our economy. The failure since the beginning of March to plan ahead for getting all schools and all youngsters back into the classroom has been reprehensible.I say all schools because the majority have been open for the children of key workers and for children designated as vulnerable.Many teachers have been doing a first-class job trying to keep in touch with children at home, providing them with online tuition, homework and marking. But there is still time to mobilise all the necessary resources to make it possible to get children back to school for at least a couple of weeks before the end of this term.Yes, it would involve finding extra premises for schools with inadequate space. Yes, we would have to appeal to teachers who have recently retired to come back for perhaps a few hours a week. Yes, we would need to employ supply teachers.In addition we could use university students, who won’t be finding summer jobs any time soon, to assist.Of course, we don’t have that reliable summer weather that will allow teaching outside on a regular basis, butDenmark can place many lessons in an outside setting, we can.If the French, Lord help us, can get their schools mobilised and back to full operation, we can. Their trade unions are far more bolshy than ours, and teachers regrettably much less well paid.So we need a combination of creativity, imagination and drive to get pupils back. We need to rebuild the confidence of parents and staff that they are highly unlikely to contract the virus from the children, or of the children passing it on to each other.That way, we can have ironed out the glitches and be ready in September to be absolutely on the ball. Small group tutoring for recovery programmes, mentoring not just organised centrally, but co-ordinated locally.For anyone who doesn’t believe that two or three weeks matter in terms of education, when children have been out of school since the middle of March, then think again. This is about equality, narrowing the gap between the haves and have-nots, and opening a window on the world. But it is also more than that. It’s a place of social interaction, of well-being and of safety. Don’t take my word for it. Take the word of the Royal College of Paediatricians, the people whose whole le is spent on the well-being of children. They are very clear: Schools must , children need each other as well as their teachers.The recognition of the importance of schools was something I was proud to oversee in , when the incoming government’s priority slogan was, “education, education, education”.Don’t get me wrong. The belated announcement last week of a one per cent uplt for all schools and a £million pot for an online recovery programme is extremely welcome. A pity, therefore, that in making a really great announcement, the Government managed not to put any money aside for the  to -year-olds in further education, who are surely the target group we would want to be helping the most.So, thank you to all those who have done everything they can to keep the wheels on the cart over the past dficult three and a half months. But now we need both national leadership and local organisation. To use an old adage, we need to think national but we need to act local. Education trusts, local authorities, teachers’ unions and all those committed to the future of this nation should want to come together to make it work.In the next ten days, while the Government thinks about its advice, others can get on with the job. Take what is working best and spread it.What can work in France or Denmark or Germany can certainly work here. We are not out of the woods yet, but we can take logical, rational and brave decisions. That is what leadership is all about.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

How could it not The sense of countryside and fresh air it evokes, the tweed caps, the fingerless mittens, the ornate walking stick . . .  just the innate Britishness of it all. Such a far cry from the smog, red carpets, bling and supercars of LA.And then, of course, it’s a reminder of the people he’s known since birth.Those who, unlike the “mwah mwah”, showbiz crowd, love him for who, rather than what, he is.Whichever way you view his behaviour of late, it’s undeniable that there is a huge, Harry-shaped hole in this image of family togetherness.Of course, there are Zoom meetings to be had and, post-lockdown, the occasional visit to be made. But it’s never quite the same.And therein lies the rub when you marry someone from another country.At first your initial attraction and then love for each other transcends geographical or cultural dferences.But when children come along and you’re required to stay in one place, inevitably one of you has to give up more than the other.Meghan tried it, albeit for a very short time, and now Harry is the one living thousands of miles away from his family and the only le he’s ever known.He made the decision to step down as a senior royal and decamp to the US for the sake of his new family — Meghan and Archie — but that doesn’t make it any less tough to see the old one ticking over nicely without him.A couple of years ago, I was in a central London restaurant with a group of other married couples and, much to the annoyance of we wives, the husbands couldn’t take their eyes off a woman sitting at the bar.Wearing the shortest of dresses, her legs were encircled around the object of her affections and her tongue made frequent visits to his ear.I recognised the man as actor Stephen Campbell Moore, ex-husband of The Crown star Claire Foy, and his obviously smitten companion as Sophie Cookson, who played Christine Keeler in last year’s BBC drama about the Profumo scandal.Fast forward to lockdown and this photo, suggests the couple may now be expecting their first child.The fond arrival of which will mean a heavy-hearted goodbye to those late-night, lust-filled liaisons that had the rest of us drooling with envy.Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson says he amuses himself by lying in interviews then changing his Wikipedia page to match his inventions.It reminds me of my stint as a royal correspondent when, after days of being on the road together, we would challenge each other to use silly names in stories.Hence, “Toby Lerone” was quoted in an article filed from the royals’ favourite ski resort in Switzerland, and in another story to do with Italy, “Sam Buca” made an appearance.Daft, I know, but it amused usno one .Mr Pendragon, who refuses to pay to park, says they stopped him from leaving his car on nearby roads.Shouldn’t he have been on horseback Bored by St Tropez, billionaires are reportedly snapping up “expedition yachts” that will take them to more adventurous corners of the globe.The one owned by US billionaire Ray Dalio has three deep-ing submersibles, and converted former Soviet spy boat Olivia is currently on the market for £million.Back home, lock-down quarantine rules have forced a  per cent rise in multi-millionaire Brits splashing their cash on vast private pools.Meanwhile, the rest of us will make do with a boat in the bath and a paddling pool.Sarah Ferguson – aka Prince Andrew’s ex we – is building up quite a following on her YouTube channel, where she reads children’s books such as The Wonky Donkey and Little Red Riding Hood while wearing fancy dress.Her success is no surprise, because on the many occasions I’ve seen her at charity events, she always connects brilliantly with the children in attendance.But personally, I can’t wait for her to get round to the critically acclaimed Idan Hadari book about a boy who wants to be famous.It’s called Andrew’s Claim To Fame.Or, in the Duke of York’s case, should that be infamy Yep. She now looks about .When -year-old Khairi Saadallah started his alleged kne rampage in a Reading park, a young, off-duty police officer ran towards the danger and rugby tackled him to the ground.It was a selfless act of bravery that, according to sources, saved “many more people dying”.Meanwhile, a judge has praised the bravery of PC Andrew Harper, who died after being dragged along by a car as he chased some thieves.Both of these are salutary reminders that, while every police force in the world has a few bad apples, the majority of those working in law enforcement are undeniably courageous people doing a tough job that most of us would shy away from.The latest money-making exercise candle from Gwyneth Paltrow is called This Smells Like My Orgasm.Which, as you ask, is “tart grapefruit, neroli, and ripe cassis berries blended with gunpowder tea and Turkish rose absolutes”. Er, right.Like its highly successful predecessor This Smells Like My Vagina candle – which, for the blissfully unaware, is “geranium, citrusy bergamot, and cedar absolutes juxtaposed with Damask rose and ambrette seed” – it costs£.Clearly, she’s a sales genius who could flog underwear to a nudist, but one suspects any attempt to branch out with a, to put it politely, Smells Like My Winkle range might prove a tougher sell.Hmmm. While the new name — Lost The Pot Noodle — is inspired, one notes that it now requires the consumer to put the ingredients in a mug or make it in a pan on the stove.As any self-respecting, Olympically idle student will tell you, a clean mug is a rarer sighting than an eclipse and, as for a pan, eventhey own one it will be housing enough penicillin growth to solve America’s recent shortage.So, memo to Unilever: Don’t phase out the original just yet.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They, and our many other attractions, are the reason people fly thousands of miles to enjoy the West End.“So we are doing what we can to support our hospitality business through the vital summer months and into the autumn.

AntihistaminesAntihistamine tablets, capsules and sprays can relieve most hay fever symptoms – sneezing, itchy, runny eyes, skin irritation, itchy nose and throat – but are less effective for nasal congestion.Although strong antihistamines can be prescribed by a GP, most people buy antihistamines over the counter in a pharmacy.These usually contain either Cetirizine or Loratadine. If one doesn’t work for you, you can try the other one.Some contain chlorphenamine and these are more liable to make you drowsy. All antihistamines can make you drowsy and it is illegal to drivethey do. It is also dangerous to operate machinery.. Steroid nasal spraysSteroid nasal sprays help reduce inflammation in the nose.They work best for clearing nasal symptoms – itching, sneezing, watering and congestion – although sprays sometimes clear eye symptoms too.Again, look for the active ingredients - beclomethasone, budesonide, fluticasone or mometasone – own brand versions can be cheaper.. Allergen barrier balmsOrganic drug-free allergen barrier balms such as HayMax are applied to the nostrils and bones of the eyes in the morning and throughout the day.They are used to stop allergens from entering the body through the nose.They are especially useful as they can be used immediately, together with other hay fever products and are suitable for children and pregnant and breastfeeding women.”. Immune supportTaking products that can help boost your immune system can be useful.Bee Prepared Daily Defence Immune Support is an immune boosting wellness formula for adults and children that contains all natural ingredients which have a history of benefits and clinically researched actions which help support the immune system.Please note that this product isn’t suitable for pregnant or breastfeeding mums.. Acupressure bandsAcupressure is a non-invasive form of acupuncture, achieved by applying physical pressure of hands, elbows, feet or devices to the same acupuncture points.It is used in a wide iety of conditions including hay fever. The Qu-Chi Hay Fever Band uses acupressure to target key pressure points on the body associated with allergy symptoms.The band is worn on one of these pressure points, the elbow. Adult and child sizes are available. This product is not suitable for pregnant women.Hay fever sufferers need to make sure they have plenty of aids this week as experts have claimed that the freak heatwave in the UK will make it the worst week in the year for sufferers.In some places temperatures are set to reach C and this spells further misery for hay fever sufferers.Airborne allergens expert and creator of HayMax allergen barrier balms, Max Wiseberg, said: “Once again we’ve just had lots of rain during the peak pollen season, which has fed the grass beautully.“And this can only mean one thing – yet another massive explosion of pollen.“This is turning out to be one of the worst weeks for hay fever sufferers that we’ve had in a long time, in fact we could be having one of the worst years ever too!”Max also recommends the Qu-Chi band as a hay fever remedy.He added: “Acupressure is a non-invasive form of acupuncture, achieved by applying physical pressure of hands, elbows, feet or devices to the same acupuncture points.“It is used in a wide iety of conditions including hay fever.

The PM said yesterday he was looking forward to the bustle toto Britains streets as he announced most businesses would be able to reopen. Mr Johnson told the House of Commons: We will also re-open restaurants and pubs.    But he warned: All hospitality indoors will be limited to table-service, and our guidance will encourage minimal staff and customer contact.The PM has refused to rule out bringing back a national lockdowncoronavirus cases start to rise again - so restaurants and pubs will have to follow strict rules to make sure people stick to social distancing. The days of crowding around bars waiting to order are over in a new normal of pub visits. Venues and being encouraged to be table-service only, and have guests order drinks and food through an app where possible.The guidance said: Indoor table service must be used where possible. Outdoor table service should also be encouraged though customers are permitted to stand outsidedistanced appropriately. The guidelines do not rule out ordering from the bar entirely, but warns venues should prevent customers from remaining at the bar or counter after ordering. Pubs have been told to encourage the use of contactless ordering from tables where available - for example, through an ordering app. The new rules mean people wont be able to hang out at the bar after theyve ordered, and will have to find a table or stand outside. All meetings indoors must only be with no more than two households at a time. Staff could also radio orders through to the kitchens to reduce movement by discouraging non-essential trips within venues. While both pubs and sports matches will have ed, Brits wont be able to do both at the same time. To discourage large groups of people coming together and yelling at TV screens or each other, broadcasts have been banned. Loud music will also be banned to stop people having to shout to be heard by their friends.The guidance says venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission.Live music and performances wont be allowed to continue under the new plans. The guidance warns venues they should not permit live performances, including drama, comedy and music, to take place in front of a live audience. Singing is a particular concerns - as droplets potentially carrying coronavirus could travel further as pub goers belt out their favourite songs.Dancing is also out, pubs have been told totake steps to prevent other close contact activities such as communal dancing. Venues are being encouraged to use disposable condiment packets where possible to limit the spread of germs via surfaces.Otherwise bottles need to be cleaned thoroughly after each use. Cutlery wont be laid out on tables unless people order food either. The guidance says venues should minimise customer self service of food, cutlery and condiments to reduce the risk of transmission. For example, providing cutlery and condiments only when food is served.The guidance says businesses should help the NHS Test and Trace system by keeping a registry of patrons contact details for at least  days in case of an outbreak. Venues are told to assistby keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for  days, in a way that is manageable for your business, and assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that dataneeded. This could help contain clusters or outbreaks. Many businesses that take bookings already have systems for recording their customers and visitors – including restaurants, hotels, and hair salons. If you do not already do this, you should do so to help fight the virus.If there is an outbreak, it will allow contact tracers to easily find out who was in a pub or restaurant at a particular time. Pubs and restaurants will have to reduce the number of people in venues at any one time to allow for social distancing - but also to discourage public transport use. The new rules will ban groups of more than  people to form. That means evenvenues can have  people  metres apart they wont be able to.The guidance says: Evenit is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue. Venues in nearby areas will have to work together to stagger arrival and departure times to avoid massive queues forming close to each other. Toilets which have been closed throughout the coronavirus crisis will reopen in pubs, restaurants and public places.But they will have to be subject to strict hygiene restrictions and extra cleaning. Venues are encouraged to use hand sanistiser where entering.And pubs are urged to use a limited entry approach to toilets inside venues with a one in one out rule.   To receive The Sun’s Coronavirus newsletterevery tea time, sign up here.To follow us on Facebook, simply ‘Like’ our Coronavirus page.Get Britain’s best-selling newspaper delivered to your smartphone or tablet each day – find out more.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

People will finally be able to get a professional haircut for the first time since March and hairdressers are expected to be in high demand. But things will look very, very dferent to how they were before - starting with your hairdresser wearing a big plastic visor over their face. There will be screens between tills and between many chairs doors and windows will be kept open to increase ventilation and you should turn up alone. Walk-ins will be banned, gowns made disposable and while talking is allowed, raising your voice is not. Here are  ways getting a haircut will be very dferent from July . The guidance admits itaposs clearly not possible to maintain social distancing when cutting someoneaposs hair - and that means wearing a visor. This is a clear visor that covers the face and provides a barrier between the wearer and the client from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing or speaking. Visors must fit the user and be worn properly. It should cover the forehead, extend below the chin, and wrap around the side of the face. These are a bigger deal than simple face coverings - which are not recommended in hairdressers. Nor is any other extra PPE recommended. Hairdressers should go into isolationtheyaposre told to by Test and Trace, eventheyaposre wearing a visor. . There may be a screen between each chair  Hairdressers are advised to follow social distancing rules - keep people two metres apart, or one metre with mitigations when m isnapost possible. But thereaposs an extra rule - theyaposre also asked to create a physical barrier between workstations, where this is practical. That doesnapost mean a screen between hairdressers and their clients - it means a screen between each chair. . The same hairdressers should keep working side by side The guidance says there should be a consistent pairing system, defined as fixing which workers work together,workers have to be in close proximit. Close proximity means being within arm’s- of someone  for a sustained period of time. . Youaposll get a health screening before you come in  The guidance says COVID- related screening questions should be asked of clients ahead of their appointment. The questions are:Have you had the recent onset of a new continuous cough  Do you have a high temperature  Have you noticed a loss of, or change in, normal sense of taste or smell If the client has any of these symptoms, however mild, they should stay at home and reschedule their appointment, the guidance says.  . Disposable gowns - and a washing regime between each appointment Hairdressers are advised to use disposable gowns for each client. Where this is not possible, they should use separate gowns and towns each client, washing between use. Hairdressers and beauty salons should also sanitise any reusable equipment, including client chairs, treatment beds, and scissors, after each appointment, and at the start and end of shts. . You can talk - but not shout, and not listen to loud music  The guidance says hairdressers should ensure steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes refraining from playing music or broadcasts loud enough to encourage shouting. . You canapost get a haircut unless you book The guidance recommends operating an appointment-only system. That means no walk-ins. People are also being urged to turn up to their appointment on time. Venues should avoid overrunning or overlapping appointments.  . You may have to queue outside Hairdressers are told to use outside spaces for queuing where available and safe, for example some car parks. People can wait in waiting areasthereaposs sufficient social distancing, butthere isnapost, venues should consider moving to a ‘one-in-one-out’ policy.The guidance suggests contacting clients virtually to let them know when they are ready to be seen. . You shouldnapost take your spouse or kids The guidance says: When booking an appointment, ask the clientthey can attend on their own, where possible. Those with children will be reminded they are responsible for supervising them at all times and should follow social distancing guidelines.

Government guidance today shows many toilets will need to be one-in, one-out and bar staff hidden behind screens to prevent the spread of the virus. Pubs will be told to keep lists of everyone who comes in for  days in case there is an outbreak - with more outdoor seats and tape to mark distance on the floor. Bar managers will be told to work with their rivals on the same street to make sure they stagger their opening times. And punters will be warned they canapost shelter insidea rainstorm - otherwise they could cause an outbreak. We knew a lot of the restrictions already. For example, you can only sit indoors with one other household - socially distanced. If youaposre in the beer garden, you can sit in a group of up to six - socially distanced - or in a group of two households of any size. Now the governmentaposs guidance shows just how dferent the new normal will be to le before. Here are  key ways itaposll change your experience of the pub. . Loud music or broadcasts will be banned to stop people shouting  Loud music or loud broadcasts like football will be banned to stop people shouting at each other. The guidance says all venues should ensure that steps are taken to avoid people needing to unduly raise their voices to each other. This includes, but is not limited to, refraining from playing music or broadcasts that may encourage shouting, includingplayed at a volume that makes normal conversation dficult. This is because of the potential for increased risk of transmission, particularly from aerosol transmission. It also says loud background music, communal dancing, group singing or chanting should be prevented. . Live music, comedy and dance floors will be banned  The guidance says venues should not permit live performances, including drama, comedy and music, to take place in front of a live audience. This is to stop aerosol transmission - from either the performer or their audience. Theatres are likewise allowed to open but onlythey donapost put on a live show. Dance floors in pubs and bars are also banned. You should take steps to prevent close contact activities, such as communal dancing, the guidance says. . Ketchup bottles and cutlery are banished from tables  The guidance says pubs and restaurants should provide cutlery and condiments only when food is served. And the days of the communal ketchup or mayonnaise bottle are numbered - as pubs and restaurants should provide only disposable condiments. Communal bottles are allowed but onlythey are cleaned after every single use. . Everyone has to give their name to staff - and itaposs kept for  days  All pubs, bars, restaurants and more are being told to assist with the NHS Test and Trace programme. That means keeping a temporary record of your customers and visitors for  days. The guidance doesnapost say how this should be done but lists visitor books or bookings records. Pubs will need to assist NHS Test and Trace with requests for that dataneeded in order to contain clusters or outbreaks. . Bar staff will stand behind screens  The guidance recommends using screens or barriers to separate workers from each other, and from customers at points of service. That could mean bar staff serving from behind a perspex screen to avoid transmission. Staff are also asked to use back-to-back or side-to-side working possible. And staff rotas will need to be redrawn so each person only has contact with a fixed number of others on their team. Tables will be spaced further apart and floor tape or paint will be used to mark areas to help people comply with social distancing. They should be two metres apart - or one metrethere is risk mitigation in place like screens, back-to-back seating or face coverings. . Some toilets will be one-in, one-out  The guidance recommends one way flow systems to stop people bunching up - such as using one door as an entry and one as an exit. Pubs should also arrange one-way travel routes between transport hubs and venues, it says. But thataposs a problem when it comes to pub toilets, many of which are cramped with narrow entrances. On toilets, the guidance urges pubs to use a limited entry approach, with one in, one out. . Youaposll get more outdoor seats, table service - and use apps to order your drinks  Pubs are being encouraged to put in more outdoor seats - with changes coming down the track to let them use car parks as beer gardens. Outdoor table service should also be encouraged, the guidance says - and table service should be followed as a rule to stop people queues. Where bar or counter service is unavoidable, people should be stopped from staying at the bar or counter after ordering, or leaning on it. Pubs are also told to encourage use of contactless ordering from tables where available - for example, through an ordering app. . Staff could radio food orders through to the kitchen Staff are told to reduce movement by discouraging non-essential trips within venues. That could mean restricting access to some areas, encouraging use of radios, telephones or other electronic devices when sending orders from service areas to kitchens, where permitted. The radios would have to be cleaned between use. . Youaposll be banned from propping up the bar - or sheltering from the rain  Pubs are warned they have to plan for keeping the -metre or aposone metre plusapos rules eventhere is a thunderstorm. They need to be clear that customers cannot seek shelter indoors unless social distancing can be maintained. . Indoor spaces will have to be massively below capacity  Sitting indoors will be allowed - but numbers are strictly limited. New coronavirus laws from July  in England will make it illegal for groups of more than  people to form. Pubs, restaurants, cinemas and other venues will be exempt from the aposgroup of apos law, which exists mainly to prevent things like raves. But even so, the guidance warns pubs may have to lower capacity even further than it would bethey had all tables two metres apart. The guidance explains: Evenit is possible to safely seat a number of people inside a venue, it may not be safe for them all to travel or enter that venue. . Youaposll see this sign in the window  Pubs should work with their customers to tell them about the restrictions on gatherings. That means not gathering indoors with more than one other household. And it means not gathering outdoors with more than either one other household, or six people in total from any number of households. In , firms should also display a notication in a prominent place to show a risk assessment has been carried out and theyaposre following the rules. A picture of the notice is above. . Nearby pubs must work together to open at dferent times Inidual businesses should consider the cumulative impact of many venues re-opening in a small area. This means working with local authorities, neighbouring businesses and travel operators to assess this risk and applying additional mitigations. This might have to include staggering entry times with other venues and taking steps to avoid queues building up in surrounding areas.

Next time, thereaposll be no furlough. No boost for Universal Credit, no protective arm thrown around us.It wonapost happen, partly, because weaposre bored and wonapost wear another  months of self-incarceration. But it also wonapost happen because we canapost afford to do it twice. The most worrying thing is not just that the government will leave us to weather the storm on our own - itaposs that the government created the storm, put it in the air, and knows full well that rain is on the way.  There are a handful of great positives from the coronavirus pandemic so far. Itaposs infected only % of the UK population the government managed to scale up the NHSapos capacity to deal with it by more than was needed most people who got it survived, without lasting side effects and it hit at the start of summer.From evidence now being gathered and shared by researchers more honest than the Chinese government, the virus expires after minutes in direct sunlight. It does not spread easily outdoors, from hard surfaces, or from person-to-person without sustained, close contact. Itaposs not Novichok.And it is the nature of viruses to get apostiredapos. The more virulent versions kill their hosts, limiting their ability to replicate, and natural selection means that in time only the milder versions survive to spread in the community.  But there is one huge problem, which is that Covid- is new. Its mutation rate is unconfirmed, our immunity to it is close to nil, and while the infection inferno has been reduced to flickering embers, those flames are being fanned by easing the lockdown which got us this far.Covid- deaths in the UK are now at the level they were before lockdown. And that daily number of the dead is STILL  times worse than the total death toll in New Zealand. The lockdown is being lted for political reasons, not scientic ones. Not only will backbenchers and businesses not stand any more, but the government is announcing that people can start doing things they were doing about  weeks ago. Households were already aposbubblingapos. Many were already visiting each otheraposs gardens, or homes. And no-oneaposs bothered staying metres apart for more than a month. But some of the new rules do make sense, not least the one about how you can go to church, but not sing. Forcefully propelling air and water droplets at others seems to create the most risk. From South Korea to Bradford, Amsterdam to Washington, whole choirs have become super-spreaders. And in the UK, even in the height of summer, we have had outbreaks in meat processing factories - noisy places where staff have to shout to be heard, stand close to each other on production lines, and temperatures might be as low as  degrees C. In Texas, Iowa, South Dakota, Germany and Wales, slaughtermen and meat packers are testing positive in huge numbers. You donapost need to be an epidemiologist to realise that colder, shoutier places are going to be safe spaces for coronavirus to spend the summer. And that, come colder weather, it will stage a break-out. But the Prime Minister does not seem too concerned, publicly, about whataposs coming down the track. His ministers are making baseless claims for testing that no-one can prove, belittling student nurses, and making a fuss about how going to the pub will save us all. Itaposs time to move on, apparently, even though what comes next could well be just as bad, or even worse. Winter always sees a rise in respiratory infections, and problems for the NHS. Throw in a new bug only % of us may have some immunity to, and the second wave of deaths may be as disproportionately larger than the first as it was during the  Spanish flu pandemic.Instead we have Johnson claiming his  tests for easing lockdown have been met, when only  of them have been ticked off. And when the World Health Organisationaposs entirely-dferent  tests for easing lockdown are only half-completed.If he were a leader,he were the clever man he pretends to be, andhe had ever been a half-competent journalist, he would be honest, and tell us lockdown can go on no longer, and that we have perhaps four months before the virus s.Hopefully less strong, but with NHS staff who are exhausted, their resources depleted, and a population that has lost thousands of jobs, missed millions of hospital appointments, and learned to distrust this governmentaposs every pronouncement. A good Prime Minister, faced with that, would tell us to squirrel away every penny, build a store cupboard, prepare for what is to come. Remortgage, lose weight, ersy your business, move as much as you can online.

Downing Street said the government would discuss what support we could potentially provide as England moves into the next phase of lockdown. However, Boris Johnsonaposs official spokesman did not make clear what that support might be. And it comes a week after Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden already said theatres might get further support. Theatres and concert halls have been told they can reopen in England from July  - but not put on any live shows. Showbiz union Bectu last night warned thousands of people are facing losing their jobs.Chief Philippa Childs said: A comprehensive rescue and recovery package is needed and the Government has failed, once again, to recognise the seriousness of the situation. And the English National Ballet - which has furloughed % of its staff - warned the Christmas ballet season is in jeopardy unless the government steps in to help. We have no income, said artistic director Tamara Rojo. Unless something happens soon, there will be no Christmas shows - Christmas will have to be cancelled.

Britainaposs leading medical experts have written an open letter calling for an urgent review of whether the country is properly prepared for the real risk of another fight against Covid-. Earlier modelling has suggested a new peak could hit after Christmas and kill as many as  people a day. The letter published in the British Medical Journal warns ministers that urgent action is needed to prevent further loss of le and to protect the economy amid growing fears of a renewed outbreak over the winter. The appeal is backed by the presidents of the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Surgeons, GPs and Nursing - as well as the chairman of the British Medical Association. It comes after Boris Johnson announced on Tuesday the biggest easing to date of the coronavirus lockdown in England. The Prime Minister said the two-metre social-distancing rule would be replaced with a one-metre plus rule paving the way for pubs, restaurants, hotels and cinemas to begin reopening from July . In an open letter to the leaders of all the UK political parties published in the British Medical Journal, the health leaders call for a rapid and forward-looking assessment of the state of national preparedness in the event of a renewed flare-up. While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk, they said. Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain. The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide-ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase. They called for the creation of a cross-party commission with a constructive, non-partisan, four nations approach, to be established to develop practical recommendations for action based on what had been learned so far.  We believe this will be essentialthe UK is to get ahead of the curve, they said. It should focus on those areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of le and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible. We think thereaposs a strong case for an immediate assessment of national preparedness, with the first results available no later than August, and that all its work should be completed by the end of October. Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the powerful Liaison Committee apossupergroupapos of MPs, backed calls for a cross-party review. He said: It is essential that the UK is prepared for a second wave of coronavirus later this year. We do not want another Chilcot-type inquiry at this stage, but medics are right to call for a swt cross-party aposlessons learnedapos exercise to be completed by October.This would not only contribute to UKaposs readiness for a new Covid peak but would also strengthen public confidence in the government’s readiness. Ministers have already said that the temporary Nightingale Hospitals set up in case the NHS was overwhelmed by Covid- cases will remain on standby over the coming months.  The letter comes as former chief scientic advisor Sir David King, who now leads the unofficial ‘Independent Sage’ group, told Sky News the lockdown easing is “ extraordinarily risky”. He said lting lockdown too quickly means “the risk of running into a second wave becomes very signicant”. He added: “We must aim to completely get rid of the virus of this country before the winter” “We still see , new cases at least a day in this country. I don’t think there’s anyone who can believe from the scientic point of view that this is a wise move.” Imperial College economist Professor David Miles told BBC Radio  the easing of lockdown measures was overdue. He said: We probably have gone past the point some weeks ago where the benefits of keeping in place the lockdown were large enough to match the rising and enormous costs of lockdown. In other developments: - The Government is providing £ million to help prevent vulnerable people given emergency accommodation during the pandemic being ed to the streets. - Labour is calling for NHS staff to undergo weekly testing for coronavirus in order to ensure waiting list backlogs can be safely cleared. - First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said the two-metre rule would remain in place in Scotland. Announcing, the easing of the two-metre rule in England, Mr Johnson said the Government was taking a cautious approach and that ministers will not hesitate to apply the brakes in the event of an upsurge in the disease.

However at the final daily No  briefing, both the Governmentaposs chief scientic adviser Sir Patrick Vallance and the chief medical officer for England Professor Chris Whitty stressed it was not a risk-free move. Prof Whitty said it was absolutely critical that people continued to observe social distancing, taking steps to mitigate the spread of the disease when it was not possible to stay two metres apart. He warned the virus was likely to be present in the UK until at least the spring of  and thatpeople ed to their normal patterns of behaviour we will get an uptick for sure. Sir Patrick also warned that despite the falling numbers of people infected with the disease, the threat remained. Donapost be fooled that this means it has gone away. The disease is growing across the world. It is coming down in the UK but it hasnapost gone away, he said.  The easing of the two-metre rule was warmly welcomed by the hospitality sector which had warned that many pubs, cafes and restaurants would be forced to closeit remained in place. Hairdressers, barbers, cinemas, museums and art galleries in England are now also preparing to open their doors to visitors again from July . However close proximity businesses including nightclubs, soft play centres, indoor gyms, nail bars and beauty salons will remain shut, as will bowling alleys and water parks. Professor John Edmunds, who attends Scientic Advisory Group for Emergenciesmeetings, said the Governmentaposs switch to one metre-plus restrictions could put the country at risk of increased Covid- transmission. The London School of Hygiene  Tropical Medicine academic told BBC Radio aposs Today programme on Wednesday: The easements that are coming are going to have a double effect really because we are going to be allowed to go to pubs and restaurants and so on, and so that will increase our number of contacts.  The easement of the restriction on two metres and allowing people to meet inside is also going to change the nature of the contact to be slightly more risky, so it is likely to have a double effect. There is a risk that transmission will take off again, so we have to be really vigilant, and this is where the Test and Trace system needs to be really working well to make sure we can stamp out any infections that occur. Business Secretary Alok Sharma said protections are in place for staff who feel unsafe while working under the new one metre-plus restrictions when pubs and restaurants open again next month. He told BBC Radio aposs Today programme: There is a legal duty requirement for businesses to keep their workers safe, for those who interact in those businesses to keep them safe. Mr Sharma added: If people are ignoring the rules and they are not keeping a workplace safe, then there are clearly measures that can be followed and it is possible for there to be enforcement notices, there are going to be checks that are carried out, spot checks by the Health and Safety Executive, which they are already doing. And in the case where someone is not following an enforcement order and not fixing things in a workplace, then, for the most serious offences, people can go to prison for up to two years. These are real powers and real teeth that are in place.

Scientists believe the cold air inside the food processing factories could make those inside more susceptible. The close working conditions and ventilation problems aposincrease the risk of infectionapos. This new blow comes after Anglesey and Wrexham food plants also reported a high level of positive tests. But Vaughan Gething, a health minister in Wales, doesnapost think local communities are at risk.The MP for Cardf South and Penarth said: We have two confirmed coronavirus outbreaks, centred on two meat and food processing plants- one on Anglesey and one in Wrexham.In addition, there is a small cluster of cases at a meat processing plant in Merthyr Tydfil. I want to restate, that at the moment, there is no evidence of wider community transmission beyond these plants.  But he stressed numbers are falling across Wales We have seen fewer than  cases each day in the first few weeks of June, he added. There has been an increase over the weekend, which is probably related to these outbreaks. These outbreaks reinforce the need for all of us to continue to take coronavirus very seriously - it has not gone away.

Please ask us why.The couple first received an email warning them to remove the sign and when they refused the company followed up with a letter, resulting in the Wrights backing down and taking the sign down hours later, reports said. Mr and Mrs Wright, who live in Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, now say they were wrong to publicly criticise the Newcastle-based property developer but are still unhappy, according to reports.In an interview with The Sun, Jake said: We backed down because we didnapost want to end up in court.We were being threatened with legal action for being defamatory. Chloe added: Bellway pointed out that signage on walls was breach of our contract which, on reflection, was fair enough. But we’re still not happy. Bellway had said it was working hard to fix the issues the couple have faced and that the sign was breaching “restrictive covenants entered into at the point of sale”. A Bellway Homes spokesman has since said that because the Wrights removed their sign they would not be taking any further action. They said they are in the process of resolving the issues with the garage. Jake and Chloe bought their property in December  but say that since they moved in, it has caused them nothing but problems. After splashing out £, on the house, they realised that the garage kept flooding, with water seeping through the brickwork.  Jake says he reported the issue to Bellway not long after moving in to the property. A contractor visited and seemingly fixed the issue months after they moved in. However, a few weeks later, the couple noticed that the garage was flooded. They asked the developer to fix the issue again.Jake told LeicestershireLive : “Another couple of men came out and said they knew what the issue was and that it was related to the brickwork.“So we let them fix it. They told us they would have to dig up about half of our garden, but we agreed because we wanted it sorted.”  According to Jake, the work took around four weeks to complete and most of it was completed only days before he and Chloe got married in November . Jake says that the company offered to flatten his garden to compensate for the issues that arose from the building work. But the problems didn’t stop there. Jake’s mother-in-law told the couple while on their honeymoon in Singapore that the garage had flooded once again. Jake said it was just aposone thing after anotherapos.

Jess Jackson, described as a beautul lady and a massive character, lost her two-year battle with the disease on June  leaving behind her three young children Max, seven Leo, six and Jenson, three. Her heartbroken mother Lynda Gilling has made an emotional appeal to other young women to make sure they attend their cervical screening appointments. Lynda said: My daughter knew what she wanted in le. She loved doing things with her three children outdoors, like taking them to the park. They were her world. Jess, who lived in Rumney, Cardf, first noticed typical signs of cervical cancer - which can include unusual bleeding and pelvic pain - at the age of just . After tests were carried out in hospital, it was confirmed that the disease was present. I was shocked more than anything . She was so young to have cancer. It was heartbreaking, added Lynda. Jess, fondly known to family members as aposJapos, then underwent several rounds of chemotherapy which her mum said made her sick and led to her losing her hair.  Despite making small signs of progress, in January this year the cancer was found to have spread to her stomach and lymph nodes and was deemed terminal. A GoFundMe page has now been set up by one of her close friends, Stacey-Marie Osborne, to pay for Jessapos funeral which is set to take place next month. Any money left over will be put into a bank account for her three boys, said Lynda. Friend Stacey-Marie Osborne added: Jess was a massive character and fought a very hard battle.  She was the type of friend you needed in your le to give you a straight, honest answer - and she did just that. She was very protective over her friends, but most importantly her three gorgeous boys who have now lost their mum to such a horrible disease. Jess was big, bold and beautul. The cancer never phased her and she never wanted sympathy, just love and kindness. Every year around  women are diagnosed with cervical cancer in Wales. It is the most common type of cancer in women under the age of .

Just  children have been treated for this condition in the UK over the last  years, figures show. Dylan also developed an aggressive Nephrotic Syndrome, which causes swelling due to fluid in the body as the kidneys leak protein, causing puffiness around the eyes, abdomen, feet and legs. Have you got a story  Email webnews@mirror Rachael and her husband Craig, , both feared that aposnormalapos childhood would be out of Dylanaposs reach as he battled the risk of a complete shutdown. Rachael said that it broke her heart when his condition caused him to swell up - almost doubling his clothes size as he struggled to walk. Dylan underwent a while range of treatments including high doses of steroids and anti-organ rejection medications to suppress his immune system but never went into remission. An organ transplant was out of the question as the disease would cause his body to reject the new kidney. But mum-of-two Rachael, who gave up her job to care for her children full time, said she did not give up hope of improving her sonaposs le. She spent many nights researching the disease online and says social media allowed her to connect with a handful of other families going through the same thing.Out of the blue, Rachael contacted Dr Joshua Zaritsky, a US specialist who treats children with transplanted kidneys, after stumbling across his medical work in the field. In an fortuitous turn of events, Zaritsky helped put her in touch with a London-based consultant Dr Ania Koziell who was pioneering a radical trial that would directly benefit her young son. Rachael said: I had emailed dozens of doctors at this point and didnapost expect a reply but she got straight back to me. I thought,I could just introduce Dylan to her then maybe she will be able to help us. In September , Dr Koziell offered to meet them at Evelina Childrenaposs Hospital in London and it was decided that Dylan would undergo special treatment, becoming only the second pre-transplant child to be given LDL apheresis which would help filter his blood.  In January , Rachael and her family travelled from Doncaster to London for the first three weeks of private treatment as Dylan had a central heamodialysis line fitted under general anesthetic. Travelling back and forth to the capital has come at great financial cost butt the results of the treatment have been astonishing as doctors reported Dylanaposs kidneys improved by % in less than a fortnight. Dylan travels down weekly to London and is hooked up to a blood filtering machine for up to  hours. However, he enjoys going to hospital and always thanks the kind nurses and other hospital staff who make him feel at home.  Although he is on a high dose of steroids, Dylan is progressing remarkably well and hopes of a full remission are on the horizon. Rachael has reserved special praise for the incredible doctors that responded to her emails when they could have ignored her, especially Dr Ania Koziell who spends an hour or so with Dylan every time he travels down to London.

Plaid Cymru Westminster leader Liz Saville-Roberts highlighted that there had been Covid- outbreaks at three meat-processing plants in Wales and she urged the Government to increase statutory sick pay for workers having to self-isolate. Mr Johnson replied: #xCAs I said in my statement yesterday ... the coronavirus job retention scheme - the furlough scheme - what we#xve done for self-employed people which has also been very considerable, the expansion of Universal Credit. #xCThese have been massive commitments by our Government to the workforce of this country. #xCWe will continue to make those commitments and I stress, as I said yesterday,we have to move back, and obviously we don#xt want to... to local or indeed national lockdowns then nobody should be penalised for doing the right thing. So, that#xs her answer.#xD Boris Johnson in the House of Commons:Health and economic emergency after Covid- requires an unprecedented responseSNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the health and economic emergency following the Covid- outbreak requires an #xCunprecedented response#xD. Speaking during PMQs, he said: #xCOn Monday, the Scottish Government#xs economic advisory group led by independent business leaders published their initial analysis to secure a strong recovery. #xCWill the Prime Minister welcome these efforts in finding a way forward out of this economic crisis #xD Mr Johnson replied: #xCYes indeed, I will be only too happy to study the documentswhichrefers.#xD :Keir Starmer accuses Boris Johnson of giving dodgy answers to questionsSir Keir Starmer said there is a theme to his exchanges with Boris Johnson in which the Prime Minister gives #xCdodgy answers#xD. He highlighted how two previous answers from the PM about a decrease in absolute child poverty and relative child poverty were judged #xCmostly #xD by the office of the Children#xs Commissioner for England, while another claim about fewer families living in poverty was also deemed #xC#xD. Sir Keir went on: #xCHe#xs been found out. He either dodges the question or he gives dodgy answers. #xCNo more witnesses, I rest my case. Will the Prime Minister do the decent thing and correct the record in relation to child poverty #xD Mr Johnson replied: #xCI#xm happy to point out to my learned friend that actually there are , fewer children in absolute poverty and , falling below the thresholds of low income and material deprivation.#xD The PM defended the Government#xs spending record before pressing Sir Keir to encourage children back to school. :Transport Secretary discusses key consideration in agreeing travel corridorsTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said a key consideration in agreeing travel corridors with other countries is whether they have a test and trace system up to the standard of the UK#xs. He told the Commons#x Transport Select Committee: #xCDo they have something equivalent to our NHS Test and Trace system  The test and trace system is enormous here now. #xCWe#xve got the capacity to test far more than is immediately required but that would allow for any uplt anywhere. #xCDoes the country we#xre talking to have that kind of capability #xD :Labour leader argues other countries are ahead of UK with working appSir Keir Starmer, when asked to name a country which has a al contact tracing app, replied: #xCGermany -  million downloads. I checked that overnight.#xD The Labour leader said other countries are ahead of the UK, asking: #xCWhen are we going to have a working app #xD Boris Johnson said Sir Keir was #xCcompletely wrong#xD, adding in the Commons: #xCNo country in the world has a working contact tracing app and I#xve always been clear, we#xve always been clear, that the app would be the icing on the cake. #xCIf we can get it to work it#xll be a fine thing but there isn#xt one anywhere in the world so far.#xD The PM praised the NHS Test and Trace operation before challenging Sir Keir to press Labour councils to encourage children back to school in their areas. Mr Johnson asked Sir Keir to confirm he #xCwants all children who can go back to school to go back to school this month#xD, with the Labour leader replying #xCyes#xD and accusing the Government of a U-turn over its school plans. :Is the contact tracing app critical or not in combating coronavirus Sir Keir pressed Boris Johnson on whether the contact tracing app is critical or not in combating the virus. He said: #xCUp until last week, the Government maintained that the app was critical, another of their slides . #xCBut at the weekenddownplayed the app, saying it was only ever additional support. So which is it - critical or not #xD Mr Johnson responded: #xCI wonder whethercan name a single country in the world that has a al contact tracing app  Because there isn#xt one.#xD:Local authorities concerned they wont have powers to implement local lockdowns quickly in event of outbreaksSir Keir highlighted the concerns of local authorities that they will not have the powers to implement local lockdowns quickly in the event of outbreaks.

What NHS Test and Trace is doing is contacting the vast majority of those who test positive and their own contacts and getting them to self-isolate, and it is a formidable achievement.#xD:NHS Test and Trace team have so far contacted , peopleBoris Johnson said the NHS Test and Trace team have so far contacted , people.Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: #xCYesterday the Government announced the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions.

Luckily for those affected by symptoms include sneezing, runny or blocked nose, itchy eyes, mouth and throat, by Thursday and Friday some areas are given respite with levels ing to just high. Although those in Wales, the south east and all of the east coast remain at very high even as the weekend begins. Most people being affected by pollen in June are allergic to grass or weed pollen, although nettle, dock and fungal spores are also posing a risk. The Met Office says tree pollen occurs first in the UK, typically from late March to mid-May. Grass lasts from mid-May until July, and weed pollen covers the end of June to September. However, dependent upon where you live in the UK, the hay fever season will start at dferent times. There’s a later start and shorter season in the north of the UK, where generally there is less pollen. Urban areas have lower counts than the countryside, and places inland have higher counts than around the coast.A Met Office spokesman said: There are also loads of factors that change the start date of the pollen season. Low temperatures in winter will keep plants and trees dormant for longer into the new year. Essentially, the lower the temperature the less pollen is produced, but, this can changesoil and air temperatures in spring are higher than normal. Today has seen the start of an official heatwave in the UK. The Met Office says that heatwaves are counted when a temperature peaks at  in London and  in the north for three consecutive days. Crowds have been spotted at beaches across the country, soaking up the good weather. Some who were photographed in Brighton were seen sunbathing, while others enjoyed the sand at Barry Island, Wales. Although the offical heatwave temperature was missed yesterday, the meteorologists expect it to be easily hit on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday before thunderstorm hit parts of the country. Hay fever affects almost  million people in England, equating to almost one in four adults and  in  children, and research shows that the number of sufferers is rising, year on year.

As they settle into their new le in Los Angeles, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have reportedly signed up with Harry Walker Agency. Their website boasts of representing former Presidents Mr Obama and Bill Clinton, and the latteraposs and we and former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - along with a host of stars including actor Matthew McConaughey. The agency calls itself aposThe Worldaposs Leading Speakers Bureauapos. In recent years, Mr Obama has earned ,sums for speeches at events held by big firms.Bloomberg reported in  about an address he gave to private equity firm Carlyle Group LP which followed one he gave to clients of Northern Trust Corp. for which he was paid the sum. While the Clintons averaged almost £, per appearance in . Now the Los Angeles times reports Harry and Meghan have joined the agencyaposs roster, quoting an anonymous source said to be familiar with departed royalsapos plans. The paper reports the couple will focus on social issues such as racism - in line with the Black Lives Matter movement - gender, and the environment. So-called keynote speeches will be performed for corporations, trade associations and community forums, the source told the paper. The couple will also reportedly take part in moderated discussions.It is expected Prince Harry will also look to take parts in talks on mental health, the duke having recently shared his own experiences with grief and the pressure of the public spotlight.The Harry Walker agency will source these potentially lucrative speaking gigs as the royal couple look to promote their charity foundation Archewell andto public le on their own terms. On January  this year, the couple stunned the world by announcing that they would be stepping back from senior royal duties and carve out a progressive new role.  And this latest move will give fans and critics alike an idea of what that new role could look like. It is yet to be seen how much weight their cultural capital retains since splitting from the Windsors.But in February we reported how the pair had spoken at their first paid-for event – ­ earning an estimated £, from the bank JP Morgan at at South Beach’s  Hotel, where rooms cost up to £, per night.At that event Harry revealed he had been in therapy for the past three years.  Public relations experts said they could have commanded anything up to £,. PR boss Ronn Torossian told the Mirroraposs US Editor Christopher Bucktin: “Given their status, this event is a massive win for JP Morgan. How can any brand go wrong by having them as speakers ”The CEO of New York PR firm WPR added: “There is no celebrity in the world hotter than them. The Obamas  You alienate some Republicans.

The unbelievable sight was spotted by Valery Narudinov, who decided to visit the nightmare-inducing attraction on his honeymoon. The seemingly never-ending number of dolls, some headless, some disfigured and others simply downright disturbing can be seen hanging from every tree, branch and fence on the island. The legend reveals that the dolls were placed on the island in Xochimilco by its original owner, a man by the name of Don Julian Santana Barera, after a young girl drowned in the waters surrounding the island in the s. Seeing a doll floating in these waters and believing it to have belonged to the deceased girl, he hung it from a tree both as a sign of respect and to ward off evil spirits. He then continued to hang dolls all across the island for the next  years until his death in .A death which some say can be attributed to the dolls themselves, as he apparently died in the same spot as the little girl was found some half a century earlier. Some witnesses claim they had heard the dolls whispering to each other, while others who were on a boat near the island said the dolls lured them to come down to the island. After Julian’s death in , it has become a tourist attraction, with visitors bringing more dolls.

Despite its name change dogs and cats are still being tortured, before being killed and sold for meat after spending days crammed in tiny cages desperate for food and water. In one shocking video dog was filmed having a blowtorch used on its body while still alive, before it was likely boiled to remove the rest of its fur. Another one shows a greyhound being carried to a boiling cauldron by three men as a little boy watches in horror. The dog howls in terror as it tries to free itself before two men hold it down and cover it with a lid until it dies. Keith Guo, a media officer for PETA Asia, toldthat dog traders hit the dogs in the head with a rod and blow-torch them to burn their coats before boiling them in hot water to remove any remaining fur. He said: Most of the time, the dogs are not killed instantly but are knocked unconscious when the vendors batter them in the head. The dogs wake up when they were being boiled or blow-torched alive. Some of them are slashed in the throat to have the blood drained from the body.Campaigners have been calling on the closure of the barbaric markets, and last year saw the festival shrink down to just a two-day event. But this year, despite the threat from Covid-, the festival is back for  days from Sunday, June  to Tuesday, June . Video footage of this year’s Yulin dog meat festival shows dozens of animals crammed in small, dirty cages and butchers at several large stalls piled high with dog carcasses.But restaurant workers told AFP reporters that attendance was down. “The number of arriving customers has dropped a lot,” one worker said. Some posts on the Chinese social network Weibo called for the festival to be cancelled entirely after the pandemic, and a recent fresh outbreak of the disease in Beijing linked to a wholesale food market. But it has gone ahead nonetheless. After Covid- the Chinese government fast-tracked laws banning the consumption and trade of wildle.The law does not apply to dog meat, but southern cities Shenzhen and Zhuha not far from Yulin both banned the consumption of dogs in April, becoming the first cities in China to do so. And last month the agriculture ministry reclassied dogs as companion animals, not livestock, though it did not explicitly prohibit eating them. Most of the animals killed for the meat trade in China are stolen pets, stolen guard dogs, as well as street dogs grabbed from towns and cities.  The torture and meat festival is not a Chinese ancient tradition, but part of a new ritual.Lisa Vanderpump from ITVBeaposs the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills has been campaigning against Yulin since . She recently filmed The Road to Yulin And Beyond , a  documentary now available on Amazon Prime with her husband Ken and TV personality Sharon Osbourne.Speaking about Yulin dog-lover Lisa said: I was incredulous and shocked at the images and the stories behind them… they are some of the most barbaric, repulsive atrocities I have ever seen.  I have seen images where a beloved golden retriever has been strung up as his limbs have been severed and cooked in front of him. Dogs are inhumanely transported in cages with no food or water they are piled on top of each other, their limbs purposefully broken as they are stuffed into cages. Although the dog meat trade is repulsive to me, it is the belief that the torture stimulates the adrenaline and therefore makes the meat more tender that has galvanized us into action.

We’ve seen some unbelievable matches. They’ve given us some dramatic moments over the years.“It’s one of my favourite derbies I’ve ever worked on or watched. It’s an amazing game.“All of these games would be better in the top flight – Glasgow derbies, Edinburgh derbies, Dundee derbies, Highland derbies.

I know Gordonmade some strong comments and, for me, you absolutely need the sides that have a good history. You need them in the top flight.“I get that itshould be done in the fairest possible way. Right now, though, the game is crumbling and it’s on its knees.“We need our biggest clubs around and we need to make sure they emerge unscathed.”BT Sport’s live coverage of the SPFL ended when the   campaign was called and Darrell – involved in the broadcaster’s Bundesliga action – admits he is gutted at how events transpired.He said: “I think it’s sad I won’t get to work with the people I’ve worked with weekly in Scottish football but, equally, I’m under contract with BT and I’m fully expecting to stay on with them so you start to put your mind to what  you’re going to be working on right away.”Ex-Dundee star Nicky Riley is top of the class after big career change\" title\"#Ex-Dundee star Nicky Riley is top of the class after big career change# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp ex-dundee-star-nicky-riley-is-top-of-the-class-after-big-career-change embed # secretdmoPRlobSr\" data-secret\"dmoPRlobSr\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

He did an exemplary job at St Johnstone and I would have no concerns about the Terrors under his stewardship.For now, the Tangerines will be licking their wounds, though, because this one will sting for a while.The sub-plot of Hearts’ legal action against the SPFL, which could threaten United’s promotion to the Premiership, is bubbling under the surface. While the rapid exit of Robbie for his former club doesn’t sit right with me.From a footballing perspective I can see how the move would make sense for Robbie and the Jambos – he’ll feel he has unfinished business there as a Hearts man.However, I think the problems might run a little deeper than Robbie wanting toto Gorgie.It could work out well for United, getting compensation and a new manager, of course, but there will be a lot of questions to answer from confused fans and staff alike.Just when it seemed things were settling down, United are back in disarray.It is, of course, not a positive situation for them right now but Dundee need to be thankful for what they’ve got.Last week’s statement from John Nelms will have sent shivers down the spines of Dark Blues scarred by two administrations since the turn of the century.It’s clear the coronavirus is going to have a huge impact on the club’s finances, and they are not the only ones, but they have to look at what they have in place as a huge plus.Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality\" title\"#Dundee say #tough choices# must be made to protect the future of the club amid a grim financial reality# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp dundee-john-nelms-finances-future embed # secrettSsuFoaHq\" data-secret\"tSsuFoaHq\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"Boss James McPake has a playing squad which isn’t a million miles away from being ready, there is an insurance policy in place which could be a lesaver and, most importantly, the Americans are clearly committed to staying put at Dens Park.It was a realistic statement from Nelms but not a death knell or the end of his and owner Tim Keyes’ involvement with the Dee.They may have to curtail some of their grand plans, like the stadium, and might not be able to give McPake a huge budget but the club is in the safest of hands.I was bitterly disappointed with the Merseyside derby on Sunday.The quality on display just wasn’t there and without the fans, rival clashes inThe supporters make these games and watching such a massive game with fake fan noise in the background made for a strange atmosphere.This isn’t football. The sooner we get bums back on seats the better!I hope the financial impact of the coronavirus doesn’t lead to Dundee following Hibs in mothballing their academy.For me, times like this are when clubs should be investing in their young players.Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice \" title\"#Former Dundee United manager Craig Levein would #never say never# to Tannadice # # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp former-dundee-united-manager-craig-levein-would-never-say-never-to-tannadice- embed # secretjjsgqCov\" data-secret\"jjsgqCov\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles. blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

recovery strategy as brexit looms","story":"Scotland#s seafood, fishing and food and drink industry will need to pull together to #thrive# in a post-Covid, post-Brexit world, experts have warned.Industry leaders from fish processing and salmon industries and the Scottish Fisherman#s Federation appeared before the rural economy committee at Holyrood on Wednesday, where it was warned recovery depended on the reopening of the hospitality sector.Jimmy Buchan, chief executive of the Scottish Seafood Association, said the industry was likely to survive the current pandemic, but it should be #thriving# in future as long as everyone pulled in the right direction.Hotel and restaurant closures have had the largest impact on Scotland#s seafood industry, with around % of custom coming from the hospitality sector.At Peterhead landings had reduced by %, while shellfish catches were down by half and selling % cheaper than they should be.The salmon industry had been more adversely impacted by overseas trading.China is the industry#s third-largest market but has dropped signicantly because of the coronavirus and subsequent food scares.James Withers, of Scottish Food and Drink, warned that due to Covid- as much as £ billion could be wiped from the industry in , which usually has a productivity of closer to £ billion.The country#s North Sea fishing fleet was most impacted by the lockdown, warned Elspeth Macdonald, chief executive of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation.The limit on the number of boxes has risen from its low point of , per day in March, she noted, while Scottish fishermen were having particular dficulties landing catches in France.French processors had placed #enormous pressure#, she said, on French retailers to support French catches only. French fishing vessels were still able to land and sell fish in Peterhead. White fish catches had reduced, but shellfish overall had been worst hit.She said: #The fish catching sector has obviously been signicantly hit by Covid-.#It was early and hit particular parts of industry hard, particularly in the shellfish fleet.#There is a very high reliance on the hospitality and food service sectors at home and abroad for shellfish, so it is safe to say that is the part of the fleet hit most severely.#When we look back at lockdown across the UK it is fair to say the prawn fleet has been most signicantly hit – we are catching half the volume we were this time last year for half the price. The impact has been very signicant.#There was also a signicant and early impact on inshore shellfish fleet – lobsters and crabs etc – and also signicant impact on our white fish fleet.#That part of the fleet managed to keep fishing but there was a signicant reduction in activity.#When we look at the landings at Peterhead market, for example, from March to May landings were down %.#Obviously the market had to put limits in place to manage the landings they could handle due to social distancing requirements.#So there has been signicant impact on the fishing sector. The market has been volatile, there is still a market for white fish but it has been up and down, entirely unpredictable.#It’s been hard to plan for landing to meet demand.#But there has been very good communication for the last few months across the supply chain to try to manage what has been a very dficult situation.# has shown to us the very high reliance the industry has on the hospitality sector. I am not sure there is a lot we can do about short term, but around % of the UK seafood market is hospitality.#Because that has been completely closed over the last few months, UK and abroad, it has had a really signicant impact on us.

The Chinese market slowed down signicantly in January, China being the third-biggest market for salmon exports, so we felt the impact early on.#With the lack of export opportunity farmers had to change their methods.#Fish welfare and people welfare has been very important throughout the outbreak# farmers worked quickly at the beginning of the outbreak to put measures in place to look after their fish and ensure work patterns were going ahead, with minimal numbers of people so social distancing could be kept in place.#She added: #If we could break out of costly, inefficient ways of farming would help unlock recovery in Scottish salmon farming recovery.#Right now we can survive, but really need to thrive.#Jimmy BuchanMr Buchan agreed regulation was key to keeping the industry on track, noting boats could sell direct and avoid processing sites legally — but warned regulation would be needed to protect the food supply and make sure only the best was getting on to plate and table.He added: #Seafood Scotland, Seafish, Scotland Food and Drink have all played a huge part in moving the industry forward.#Right now we can survive, but really need to thrive.#We need the investment.

They are doing the same to support other temporary NHS services across Scotland.Our people have worked around the clock with health boards across the country to offer new, technical solutions to help frontline health workers get on with their jobs during this crisis.Our frontline staff in contact centres across Scotland – including Aberdeen, Dundee, Glasgow and Greenock – have risen to this unprecedented challenge. We’ve received a huge surge of customers asking for faster connections to help with home working, home schooling and running their businesses remotely.These colleagues – most of whom can now work from home when they want to – have performed a critical role keeping our customers, including frontline health workers and vulnerable people, connected.The people in our two  contact centres in Scotland are also playing a critical role, answering lesaving emergency calls.I couldn’t be more proud of how my colleagues have responded to these challenges and their desire to help us all through this crisis.Jane Wood, BT Group director in Scotland, Edinburgh.COVID- is seriously not a jokeGlobally kills thousands of folkYou start coughing, you can#t breatheWithout a respirator, this earth you#ll leaveSocial distancing is now in placeKeep two metres apart, not face to faceWash your hands frequently and well hours on surfaces it can dwellShop infrequently, for essentials onlyDon#t mix with othersyou#re lonelyKeep in touch by text and phoneDon#t put yourself at risk, stay aloneIt#s hoped soon this contagion will peakThen we canto normal, so to speakDon#t travel to other towns by carIt can spread the virus near and farSports, socialising and most work on holdThe alternative could cause damage untoldSupport the NHS, essential workers and neighboursThen we#ll defeat this virus by all our laboursDugald MacGilp, Lochgilphead.Sir,We are looking for people who have the passion to bring communities together, believe in the power of co-operation and who hold the well-being of their community at the forefront of their mind.The successful #Member Pioneers# will receive full training and business support as they help groups and iniduals during the coronavirus pandemic and beyond.

People who may have previously felt isolated in remote and rural communities may be feeling this even more acutely at this time, so it’s important they know support is available.Across the region, many people have also sadly faced the pain of losing loved ones to the virus or have fallen ill themselves, while others have seen their livelihoods put at risk or incomes reduced. All of this has put additional strain on people’s mental well-being.This year’s Mental Health Awareness Week is putting the focus on kindness as a means of helping people through the pandemic and building a better society as we emerge from it. We see many acts of kindness in the Highlands and Islands all the time, but this week is an opportunity for people to reflect on their interactions with others and how they can try and be a little kinder during this unprecedented time.David Stewart, MSP for Highlands and Islands region.Sir,During Mental Health Awareness Week, sight loss charity RNIB Scotland is highlighting the emotional reassurance and practical help it is offering during the coronavirus lockdown.Our Need to Talk telephone counselling service remains available in Argyll and Bute for anyone diagnosed with sight loss, as well as their families, friends and carers.Losing some or even all your sight can be devastating news to take in, but our trained helpers can support you in coming to terms with your condition and finding the way forward.RNIB is concerned the lockdown might be affecting people who are blind and partially sighted, many of whom are older, particularly hard. The uncertainty over access to basic shopping and medication, to information in accessible formats, the social isolation and barriers to being guided because of social distancing can all add and compound to the mental and emotional stress people are experiencing.As well as our Need to Talk service, the RNIB helpline on    is available for anyone with sight loss and we continue to organise social activities over the phone and social media.We want people with sight loss to know they are not alone and that help is available.James Adams, RNIB Scotland director, Edinburgh.The Scottish Invasive Species Initiativehas launched Alien Detectives – a fun and educational online resource to help the young and not so young  learn more about alien # or non-native – invasive species.Originally designed as a school education pack, the huge array of activities now includes a wide range of fun games and activities that anyone can enjoy at home, in the garden or on local walks during lockdown.Alien Detectives includes crafts, quizzes, worksheets, presentations and puzzles all themed around invasive species and the river environment. Although primarily aimed at young people, anyone with an interest in the environment or invasive species can enjoy them too.Our project team has been busy while homeworking during lockdown to produce these fantastic resources. We hope becoming Alien Detectives will bring many hours of enjoyment to iniduals and families during lockdown, especially at a time when most young people are not in a regular school environment and might be looking for a new challenge or activities to continue their learning.Invasive non-native species might be a new topic to many but it is a really important one. Invasive species can have a major impact on our environment and native wildle and are responsible for signicant bioersity loss in Scotland and across the world. We hope these resources will help raise awareness of the impacts of invasive species and inspire more young people to learn something about them.No prior knowledge is needed and there’s lots to learn and have fun with so become an Alien Detective and help us tackle invasive species today.All of the ‘Alien Detectives’ resources can be found at www.invasivespecies.scot alien-detectives.Callum Sinclair, SISI Project Manager, Newton Stewart.Sir,We may not be able to hold picnics in the usual way just yet, but why not hold the next best thing – a virtual picnic  That way you can invite as many people as you want.National charity Family Action is running its Virtual Family Picnic from May  to May  and everyone is invited.

We stayed with Margaret and Iain McDonald at their home named Meadowview in Tarbert which was located near the school.We all enjoyed the area so much that we continued to visit every year for the next consecutive eight years.Margaret invited me to go out on the herring boats once or twice. One was named Village Maid and the other Village Belle and, needless to say, we often had kippers for breakfast, which were very nice. I remember there was a boat called the Southern Cross tied up to Cock Island # can anyone tell me any history of it and when it disappeared There also used to be a smokehouse for kippers along from Tarbert to Ardrishaig.Another fond memory I have is watching the logging trucks unloading on the quay and watching them get loaded on to large boats and I think then being shipped round to Sweden or Finland. Is that correct or not as I thought there was a paper mill at Fort William As mentioned earlier, I joined North West Ambulance Service in the s and Margaret used to send me the Argyllshire Advertiser and in one of them was an advert for recruitment to the Scottish Ambulance Service.I duly got an application form from Paisley and was all but sending the form in when I realised it would be very unfair to move so far away from our young children#s grandparents and for them to be unable to see them growing up. At the time your local pharmacist was retiring and my we Sue was a qualied pharmacist, but our children were both under school age so relied on her parents for child care. Ironically, I believe the job was filled with a Blackpool pharmacist whom I had met ocassionally.My love for Scotland continued, and we had our honeymoon travelling around Scotland and calling in at Tarbert for several days on the trip round.Our last trip up there was  in June as a treat from our daughter who accompanied us on this trip. The weather was glorious, and one day we caught the bus to Skipness and walked part of the Kintyre Way back.Another day we took the MacBrayne Ferry to Islay, which was again a glorious day out, also visited Crinan, Lochgilphead and Inveraray, followed by a couple of days fishing off the pier in Tarbert. We travelled back via Portavadie and Dunoon, and have in the past used the ferry to Arran, then Brodick, Ardrossan and home.Thank you for taking the time to read this. It has been good to share some of the memories of Argyll with you.#"},{"url":null,"title":"happy lockdown birthday june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSend us a photograph of your family member or friend enjoying their special day and we will publish it and wish them a happy birthday.Remember to include their full name, age, where they are from and a bit about what you did to make the day at home special.Send your photographs to editor@argyllshireadvertiser"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 5 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe featured image this week was submitted by Aileen Gillies of Lochgilphead, who caught this stunning sunset on May  at Bellanoch bridge on the Crinan Canal."},{"url":null,"title":"plans in place for 2021 camanachd cup final","story":"Fiona ScottUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsFollowing the expected cancellation of shinty’s  cup competitions, the Camanachd Association has confirmed with title sponsor Tulloch Homes and Kingussie Camanachd Club that the plan to host the final in Kingussie will be postponed for a year and will now take place on September  .The Tulloch Homes Camanachd Cup Final willto the Highland venue for the first time since  and for its th anniversary.First contested in , the final of shinty’s national knock-out cup competition promises to be a brilliant day out for all the family and a  chance to watch two of the country’s elite shinty teams.Hundreds of tickets have already been sold and to be part of this historic moment you can secure your tickets, including some exclusive offers, on shinty.The  final takes place at The Dell and will be one of the biggest stagings of the event in its -year history with live traditional music, entertainment and a dedicated Kids Zone adding to the festival feel.The first final of the Camanachd Cup took place at Inverness on April  .

Star lost -.Two strong performances in October saw Star record  a terric - win over Shettleston, last season’s league runners up, and a - win against St Patrick’s Sports Academy # an entertaining but nerve-wracking game.A mid-season stutter in November saw the Lochgilphead boys lose out to Cathcart -, then Clydebank -, both newcomers.The losing run continued into early December as Star faced last season’s champions Drumchapel Amateurs ending up down - at half-time before recovering their form with a committed second half display to pull it back to -. Unfortunately they lost out to a fourth Drumchapel goal as they chased the winner themselves.This set Star back on track as they finished the year with a hugely convincing performance, demolishing Cathcart -.January and February proved a real battle with the weather with wind, rain and freezing temperatures # often all three # only allowing four games to take place. Star secured fine victories over Busby, -, and Glasgow Red Star, -, and fought back to grind out creditable draws with Shettleston, -, and Place Park, another new team, -.Star played one league game in March before lockdown and again it was another entertaining game with a rollercoaster feel to it. Facing up to Drumchapel Amateurs, both teams played out another terric match which had everything.Coming back from a goal down and with only  men, Star played cracking football to race into a - lead but it took its toll as Drumchapel stuck to their task to draw level before adding a couple more goals to secure a win in the final five minutes.This was another fine season for Red Star s, competing well in a strong league, with only  signed players.Though the season was cut short, the boys played  games winning , drawing two and losing seven. They scored  goals and conceded  goals. There were some cracking games and the boys were looking forward to the knock-out stages of the league cup.Inconsistency probably cost Star a few more wins, but that’s what youth football development is all about and there is potential for the boys to develop.Well done from coaches and parents to the  boys who played this season – Craig Aitken, Zak Barclay, Gregor Brown, Keiran Caskie, Lewis Curran, Ruaridh Green, Woody Hoad, Alexander McLean, Conner McMurchy, Leon Murphy, Innes Paterson, Jamie Stewart and Tom West.Thanks for great support goes to sponsors Ardrishaig Community Trust, main strip, SC Crawford Building Contractors Limited, change strip and zip tops, Jewsons, tracksuits, and Mid Argyll Youth Development Services and the parents, supporters, referees and opposition teams that have made the season so enjoyable."},{"url":null,"title":"sheena shows the way as tarbert tees off","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsGolf started again at Glenralloch as lockdown measures were eased slightly across Scotland.The first members were on the tee at am on Friday May  for the re-opening, followed by a steady stream as the day went on.

infected person will pass the virus to on average.Coronavirus has an estimated reproduction number of three, meaning an infected person will likely pass the virus on to at least three other people.A

single dose, astudy in pigs has revealed.The ChAdOx nCoV-vaccine -developed by the University of Oxford - is currently undergoing human trials and it is hoped an effective vaccine could be ready later this year.Previous research indicated that macaques were protected against lung disease after a single immunisation.Now the Pirbright Institute, working with the University of Oxford, has shown that two doses of the Covid- vaccine might produce a greater immune response in pigs and therefore be a more effective approach to developing a protective response.What did the study find In the study, researchers saw a marked increase in neutralising antibodies, which bind to the virus in a way that blocks infection.It is not yet known what level of immune response will be required to protect humans against SARS-CoV- .Researchers said the finding in pigs is important as it suggests that two doses of the new vaccine could potentially give signicantly more protection in humans than a single dose.But they said further research in humans is required.What has Professor Bryan Charleston said Professor Bryan Charleston, director of the Pirbright Institute, said: ldquoThese results look encouraging that administering two injections with the same vaccine boosts antibody responses that can neutralise the virus, but it is the response in humans that is important.ldquoThe pig has proved to be a valuable model for testing human vaccines for other diseases to give an indication of the type of immune response induced and testing dferent doses.ldquoPigs are more physiologically similar to humans than some other animal models ndash for example, their body weight and metabolic rate ndash and are more accessible than studies using non-human primates.In the research, the pigs were split into two groups, with both receiving an initial dose of the vaccine, and one group receiving an identical booster immunisation on day  of the study.Latest developments are very encouragingProfessor Simon Graham, the lead author of the study, said: ldquoWhile it remains to be determined what immune responses are required to effectively protect people against Covid-, the demonstration that ChAdOx nCoV- induces both neutralising antibody and T cell responses is very encouraging.ldquoIt is likely that a combination of these responses would act in synergy to prevent and control infection, as we and others have recently shown in the context of experimental flu vaccines.What has the reaction been to this update Dr Stephen Grfin, associate professor in the school of medicine, University of Leeds, added: ldquoThe work done at Pirbright is an encouraging advance in support of the Oxford vaccine on three important fronts.,params: .pushldquoFirst, it has been conducted in a large animal model, namely pigs, which we know recapitulate human-like responses to influenza vaccines better than many other systems.ldquoSecond, it shows that a second dose of the vaccine, a so-called lsquoprime-boostrsquo strategy, gives rise to far better responses than a single inoculation, which might allay concerns arising from some of the earlier work on this and other spike-targeting vaccines.ldquoThird, it shows that the prime-boost strategy may well be achievable using the same vaccine rather than having to switch to an alternative  for the second dose, which could conceivably delay roll-out of the vaccination programme.ldquoWhilst these studies will need to be repeated within human subjects, and the precise nature and longevity of the responses might require further investigation, this is a heartening study that can be built upon and ideally followed by other potential vaccine s for SARS-CoV-."},{"url":null,"title":"staycation-five-scotlands-photogenic-places-visit-lockdown-eases","story":"WITH lockdown measures slowly beginning to ease and the coronavirus continuing to be

Drenched in the cold September rain, I had lost my appetite to explore the area, which now seemed grim and gloomy.By contrast, my second visit to Musselburgh is one worth remembering.I had come to check on the progress of the house and to join a group of birdwatchers for a stroll around the Esk and the lagoons.The walk started at the river mouth, from where we watched a couple of cormorants sunbathing.It was not long before someone raised the cry: ldquoA kingfisher!I promptly directed my camera to where everyone was looking, and I saw him: a beautul, bright blue kingfisher.After that sighting I knew my le would change.Moving to Musselburgh ended up being one of the best decisions I have made .Since that day I have been studying this wee bird.Every spare moment is spent at the river watching for our kingfisher.It has become my all-encompassing obsession.Each encounter teaches me something new and I never stop learning.This one bird inspired me in many ways, such as helping me understand the importance of fieldcraft in wildle photography, and allowed for some unforgettable captures.So, without further ado, let me formally introduce Mr KingfisherhellipThe kingfisher is an unmistakeable bird, with its metallic azure blue back and bright orange breast.The bird is usually glimpsed, a sudden flash of glistening blue, flitting at the riverbank.If you are luckyenough, the bird may comfortably land near you.Usually, despite its exotic colouration, the bird is dficult to spot sitting on a branch surrounded by foliage, a kingfisher successfully blends into the landscape.I have spent hours in the field and can still struggle to spot a perching kingfisher.When I locate a bird, I identy the sex by the birdrsquos beak: the malersquos is completely black, whilst the femalersquos is orange underneath.Kingfishers are territorial and they will hold their ground against other iniduals.Breeding season is the only time when the male and female tolerate each other and share territory.The choice of feeding ground is extremely important as the bird is dependent on it all year round.Each area covers at least km of slow-flowing fresh water or lake, but this may extend anywhere up to km.The resident male I have been watching for almost three years exhibits slight migratory behaviour it travels upstream during the breeding season, whilst it spends the winter months near the river mouth. For its fishing ground, a kingfisher will often choose a shallow pool in the river bend.They are not titled ldquoking fishers for nothing and are experts in this field.Before ing, they sit patiently on a perch, bobbing their head back and forth to assess the exact position of a fish.Once it has spotted a fish, it es headfirst at speeds up to mph.The kingfisher enters the water with beak half open and eyes protected by its third, transparent eyelid.A split second later, the bird emerges, beak first, and flies back to the perch.Here, it twirls the fish so that it may be held by the tail, proceeding to bash it against the perch to kill it and break the spine, making it easier to swallow.If you have a favourite animal you would like me to feature next month, or are looking for advice on how to spot and photograph a kingfisher, contact me through my website or social media channels.

But the journey became more than I anticipated, and gave me a new angle on Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity.To reach the island I went on a cycle with my good friend Gareth. He is a keen cyclist, and in my early days I was too. I literally cycled hundreds of miles a week. It gave me freedom and a sense of adventure.Over the last couple of decades my cycling adventures have signicantly declined. Those long adventurous rides I used to go on, well they have been a thing of the past, especially after my beloved bike was stolen years ago.But then, during the lockdown, my wee daughter Skye decided she wanted to learn to cycle, and with gritty determination she did so, magically on the same path in the Greenhills at Prestonpans where I learnt so many years before.So another friend very kindly leant me a bike and I was able to accompany my daughter around the then quiet streets of our town as she developed her confidence.I enjoyed this, and it was good exercise, but it began to give me itchy feet and a nostalgic longing to re-experience some of the joys of my youth and head off onto the open road and go exploring on two wheels under my own steam.So when Gareth suggested we go for a ldquovery short cycle ride to visit Green Craig island that I had heard so much about, I gladly accepted.The destination was just beyond the big gates of Gosford House in total just under five miles away. And, of course, the road follows the coast, so no horrible hills to climb.So I set off, with my children waving at me asI was going to war, and met Gareth outside Cockenzie House as arranged.It was from here I became increasingly aware of the depreciation my body has suffered since my last long cycle.The road was, as far as I could ascertain, flat.There was a very slight breeze on my face to cool me, so in theory it was perfect cycling conditions.But something was wrong I was very quickly puffing and panting as I tried to keep up with my friend, who was coasting effortlessly in front of me.I could feel my face turning red and an old lady walking her small dog looked up and gave me a sympathetic glance as I passed her.I was cycling faster than she was walking but not by much.Then another cyclist passed me, at what seemed to be close to the speed of light, at least compared to the pathetic speed I was travelling.It was at this moment I noticed Gareth was well ahead of me, and talking to himself, as he believed I was still just behind him.So I called out, ldquoGareth, slow down a wee bit! He waited for me to catch up.ldquoSorry, I said, ldquofeel free to cycle ahead but I will have to go slower.ldquoYou want to go ahead  he asked.ldquoNo, I said, ldquo we do that we may be in danger of falling over due to lack of velocity!And so we headed out of town.My comment about velocity had put me in mind of Einsteinrsquos theory of relativity that speed is not absolute and objects move at a speed relative to one another, and that this affects the passage of time.My time was most certainly being slowed down. Never had that short journey felt so long.I discovered small hills I had driven over but never noticed. I became acutely aware of the power of gravity, and I lost count of how many stops I needed before we finally arrived at our destination.But what elation when we did arrive: I was shocked on one hand at just how unfit I was, but on the other I had a sense of achievement.We locked our bikes and headed along the coast to the island. The tide was out which meant we could reach it without getting our feet wet.Gareth was keen to find a trig pole which he had discovered was on the wee island. It was used by early map makers but we didnrsquot find it.We sat on a log, and Gareth offered me a cup of tea from his flask. Hersquod bought an extra cup, and we sat there, two metres apart on an old log looking out to sea, talking. It was the best cup of tea I can remember in a long time.The island isnrsquot much in itself, more like a tuft of land or gloried sandbank, just beyond the coast.But itrsquos the location and what you can see from it which makes it special, both in terms of wildle and landscape. And history too is all around.The sea comes in fast at this point and it was soon moving in a pincer motion, enveloping the wee tuft of land to make it an island once again.Itrsquos that which perhaps excites the childhood imagination in us, beating the tide before being marooned or maybe being marooned could be the best bit!But we left just in time. The sea lapped at our feet as we walked past the huge concrete blocks from wartime and we discussed the goings on in the world.As we reached our bikes I noticed some dens made by previous visitors.Impressive constructions, showing perhaps that the lockdown for many of us has given us an opportunity to explore and discover our own area in ways perhaps we never did before.Then we set off home. The journey back gave me a new phenomena to contemplate that a road can feel uphill both ways when you are an unfit, overweight man on a bicycle.Gareth insisted on cycling with me all the way home, you know, just in case.But I made it, and got a kind reception from my kids who asked me, ldquoWhere have you been all this time, you must have gone really far Well in one way I had. Not in terms of actual physical distance perhaps, but certainly in terms of having an unexpected and unforgettable adventure with a kind and understanding friend."},{"url":null,"title":"former-mens-club-become-four-flats","story":"East Lothian Council has given the green light to East Lothian Propertyrsquos plans to transform  Sidegate.The former Haddington Recreation Club closed its doors in the early s and will now become home to a ground-floor office and four flats.The three-storey property is currently used as bedsit accommodation.One member of the public objected to the proposals on grounds including road safety, the likelihood that ldquothe use of the building to accommodate an office and four flats will lead to a large number of cars parking on street at this potentially dangerous spot and that the proposals ldquodo not accommodate any dedicated off-street parking, the consequence of which would result in cars being parked on the narrow road outside the building which would result in dficulties for other road users and would create a road safety hazard.Despite the objections, the plans were given the go ahead, with the planning officer noting that colleagues in the roads services department raised ldquono objection to the plans.Billiards, draughts and table tennis were all played by male members of Haddington Recreation Club before it closed.

we knew that losing your sense of smellwas a signicant symptom of the disease.Now, after months of reports, both anecdotal and more rigorous clinical findings, we think we have a model for how this virus may cause smell loss.One of the most common causes of smell loss is a viral infection, such as the common cold, sinus or other upper respiratory tract infections.Those coronaviruses that donrsquot cause deadly diseases, such as COVID-, Sars and Mers, are one of the causes of the common cold and have been known to cause smell loss.In most of these cases, sense of smell s when symptoms clear, as smell loss is simply the result of a blocked nose, which prevents aroma molecules reaching olfactory receptors in the nose. In some cases, smell loss can persist for months and years.For the novel coronavirus , however, the pattern of smell loss is dferent. Many people with COVID- reported a sudden loss of sense of smell and then a sudden and fullto a normal sense of smell in a week or two.Interestingly, many of these people said their nose was clear, so smell loss cannot be attributed to a blocked nose.For others, smell loss was prolonged and several weeks later they still had no sense of smell. Any theory of anosmia in COVID- has to account for both of these patterns.This suddenof a normal sense of smell suggests an obstructive smell loss in which the aroma molecules cannot reach the receptors in the nose .Now that we have CT scans of the noses and sinuses of people with COVID- smell loss, we can see that the part of the nose that does the smelling, the olfactory cleft, is blocked with swollen soft tissue and mucus ndash known as a cleft syndrome.The rest of the nose and sinuses look normal and patients have no problem breathing through their nose.We know that the way SARS-CoV- infects the body is by attaching to ACE receptors on the surface of cells that line the upper respiratory tract.A protein called TMPRSS then helps the virus invade the cell. Once inside the cell, the virus can replicate, triggering the immune systemrsquos inflammatory response. This is the starting point for the havoc and destruction that this virus causes once in the body.Initially, we thought that the virus might be infecting and destroying the olfactory neurons.These are the cells that transmit the signal from the aroma molecule in your nose to the area in the brain where these signals get interpreted as ldquosmell.However, an international collaboration showed recently that the ACE proteins the virus needs to invade the cells were not found on the olfactory neurons.But they were found on cells called ldquosustentacular cells, which support the olfactory neurons.We expect that these support cells are likely to be the ones that are damaged by the virus, and the immune response would cause swelling of the area but leave the olfactory neurons intact.When the immune system has dealt with the virus, the swelling subsides and the aroma molecules have a clear route to their undamaged receptors and the sense of smell s to normal.So why does smell notin some cases This is more theoretical but follows from what we know about inflammation in other systems.Inflammation is the bodyrsquos response to damage and results in the release of chemicals that destroy the tissues involved.When this inflammation is severe, other nearby cells start to be damaged or destroyed by this ldquosplash damage. We believe that accounts for the second stage, where the olfactory neurons are damaged.Recovery of smell is much slower because the olfactory neurons need time to regenerate from the supply of stem cells within the lining of the nose.Initial recovery is often associated with distortion of the sense of smell known as parosmia, where things donrsquot smell like they used to.For many parosmics, for instance, the smell of coffee is often described as burnt, chemical, dirty and reminiscent of sewage.Physiotherapy for the noseOlfaction has been called the Cinderella of the senses because of its neglect by scientic research.But it has come to the forefront in this pandemic. The silver lining is that we will learn a lot about how viruses are involved in smell loss from this. But what hope is there for people with a loss of smell now The good news is that the olfactory neurons can regenerate. Theyrsquore regrowing in almost all of us, all of the time. We can harness that regeneration and guide it with ldquophysiotherapy for the nose: smell training."},{"url":null,"title":"headteacher-praised-leadership-style","story":"North Berwick High Schools head Lauren Rodgerwas described by Education Scotland inspectors as having a clear direction and being well respected.However while the inspection, carried out in February,praised the staff and leadership at the school and achievements of its senior students, it pointed to improvements required to enable more S-S pupils to learn a foreign language.The report called for more work to be done to ensure all younger students received their full entitlement to Broad General Educationin the first three years at the school.In particular it stated: \"Currently, a few young people are not experiencing a modern language until the end of S.\"Inaddition, the current arrangement is not sufficient for young people to receive their entitlementto a meaningful experience of a third language.\"Inspectors urged the school to ensure the focus was on ensuring younger pupils received full access to experiences across the curriculum and did not allow a focus on reaching exam levels to impact on them.The inspectors said: \"Teachers should ensure that learning at Sacross all curriculum areas remains focused on the experiences and outcomes of CfEanddoes not prioritise the requirements of National Qualications .\"Senior and middle leadersshould ensure that learning experiences in S provide those young people specialising atfourth level with appropriate depth in their learning to provide successful progression to thesenior phase.\"Inspectors visited the school in February  and assessed the schoolrsquos performance across four key indicators: leadership of change learning, teaching and assessment raising attainment and achievement and ensuring wellbeing, equality and inclusion.The school was evaluated as lsquovery goodrsquo in the first three categories and lsquogoodrsquo in the fourth.Headteacher Lauren Rodgerrsquos leadership style was described as ldquocharacterised by openness and by trust, promoting empowerment in a supportive ethos.

This was a logical result of the requirement by the government of clan chiefs sons to be educated in England or the Lowlands. It was the inevitability of insisting these Scots be forced to enter schools which to this day are the production line to leadership in government and the military. Hoist by your own petard comes to mind.It is an obvious fact that history is written by the victors. I would suggest thatmore Scots actually knew their history there would be a much greater feeling of anger aimed at the Parliament in Westminster. Of course we were involved in the slave trade, but so were the African chiefs who sold their countrymen to the slavers and the plantation owners, many of whom were freed slaves in later days. Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, Vikings and Moors all have history of slavery and Brazil only banned slavery in . I am not being deafened by their apologies.If you throw a stone into the wake of a boat it will alter the pattern of the waves in some way but it will not affect where the boat is going. It is the same with history. If you are willing to learn from it you can better move forward, but changing street names and pulling down statues benefits the future not one iota. I would suggest to Mr Smith that he should worry far more for the future of his unionist ideologyScots do give up victimhood, as the next logical emotion is anger.David Stubley, Prestwick.I AGREE with Mark Smith that Scots need to face up to their history, good and bad, but when I was at school I studied history for five years and the curriculum contained not one iota of Scottish history what I got was Henry VIII and his marital woes, the Battle of the Nile, the League of Nations and the Russian Revolution. I note that in his cherry picking of bits of Scottish history, Mr Smith has made no mention of the  Act of Union, when Scots rioted in the streets because their nationhood had been signed away, and the Speaker of the House of Commons declared \"We have catchd Scotland and we will bind her fast\".The past should serve as a lesson to the present, although that is a lesson which seldom seems to be learned sadly, the war to end war didnt, and in the st century UK foreign policy would appear to have learned nothing from past centuries, involving itself in foreign wars including an unwinnable war in Afghanistan, and to the UKs eternal shame, the illegal invasion and bombing of Iraq. Carl Sagan wisely said: \"You have to know the past to understand the present,\" and many would dismiss Henry Fords comment that \"history is more or less bunk\". But he went on to observe: \"It is tradition. We dont want tradition. We want to live in the present and the only history that is worth a tinkers dam is the history we make today.\" In making todays history, how we deal with present issues, many of which are rooted in the past, will determine our future and the future of generations to come that is what should concern us most of all.Ruth Marr, Stirling.NOT that long ago the Scots actor David Hayman narrated an excellent BBC documentary on this countrys involvement in the slave trade entitled Scotlands Shame. The essence of the programme was that it related actual and authentic history, highlighting how the trade in human beings impacted every aspect of Scotlands economic, social and cultural le. In doing so it broke with the Great Man or Great Inidual view of history which so often trivialises serious history. The same approach has been adopted by Professor Sir Tom Devine.This authentic appraisal of the nations past is not an easy debate to have and it is important that it is conducted as objectively as possible. It is, however, related to another aspect of Scotlands history and one that remains important for many peoples view of their Scottish identity. When I was younger I, in common with millions of other Scots, listened uncritically to the song a Scottish Soldier. This relates the story of the Scot who soldiers far away and fights in many a fray. If I listened to the same song today I would do so much less uncritically and would be inclined to consider the origins of the Martial Scot.History is an interesting area of study but it is also something we can learn and progress from. After all, we dont need to go back to Britains imperial past to find examples of pointless, avoidable wars.Brian Harvey, Hamilton.MARK Smithrsquos article on how we view our history is interesting and perceptive, but may I take him up on one point . We talk, he says, ldquoabout our lonely imprisoned queens and not our brutal warrior kings. The sole member of the former set is easily identiable but whom has he in mind for the latter War is brutal anda king, whose supreme obligation is to protect his people, is faced with the choice of seeing his country overrun by a brute and adopting brutal means to prevent it, as was true ofRobert Bruce, then there is no choice at all. Robert III and James III, who failed to prevent the English from ravaging the Borders, are not highly regarded in our history. James IV was incontrovertibly one of our greatest kings but his reputation would have been higher stillhe had been capable of some brutality:while the English army was taking its position at Flodden he had followed his master gunnerrsquos advice to strafe them with his cannon. Had he done so he might well have ed alive, with much of his army, to continue his energetic rule over a prosperous and outward-looking European power ndash instead of, by chivalrously withdrawing from his strong position and allowing the English an orderly muster, dying in the course of a catastrophic defeat and leaving his realm to years of near-chaos under his infant heir.It is certainly true that Scotland played its full part in the discreditable history of British imperialism but prior to the Union, there is no question which of the two kingdoms on the island had the worse record as an aggressor power.Derrick McClure, Aberdeen AB."},{"url":null,"title":"talking-heads-series-three-episodes-one-two-review","story":"****SPITTING Image used to portray Alan Bennett as a fussy old Yorkshire dear, forever having tea with Thora Hird and wittering on about summat and nowt.

The risk now is that Scotland is left behind socially and economically.ldquoIt will be very dficult for people here to look on as England, and indeed the rest of Europe, begins ato normal.ldquoIt will also be very costly for businesses, industries like tourism and hospitality, and the mental health of the nation.

These include reducing the amount of time spent indoors with other people and wearing a mask on public transport.Two households of any size will also be allowed to meet up indoors under the plans, though they cannot hug.Conservative MP John Lamont said his constituents in Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk, would \"not get the benefits\" of the PMs measures \"as the First Minister of Scotland is delaying Scotlands release from lockdown.\"Alister Jack, Secretary of State for Scotland added that Scotland \"must also start looking at how to open our economy safely.\"He said: \"Given the signicant fall in the incidence of the disease, and following the review from our scientic experts, the UK Government has taken cautious steps forward.\"I would urge the Scottish Government to also act quickly and decisively to help Scottish businesses get back on their feet.Nail bars, beauty salons, spas, nightclubs, indoor play areas, and tattoo parlours will remain closed in England, but places of worship will be allowed to hold services from July  - though singing, thought to increase risk of transmission, will be banned.Weddings with up to  people will be permitted, and customers to pubs and restaurants will be asked to leave their contact details in case the venue is subsequently linked to a positive case.Meanwhile Health Secretary Jeane Freeman confirmed that from July  all hospital staff working in specialist cancer units, long-stay mental health wards, and long-term care of the elderly wards would be routinely tested for Covid once a week as part of measures to limit transmission of Covid as NHS services are stepped up.Medical and adult care home staff who are in contact with patients or residents will be required to wear medical-grade face masks from Monday.

This involves welfare, becoming a statistic for the first time, trusting and hoping the place of last resort, that of social security, will be there in the hour of need.Applying for welfare is a very daunting experience and for many it is alien, because for most who join the workforce, there is no need to familiarise oneself with the ins and outs of the welfare system, that is for others. So this will be a whole new chapter and one that will be daunting.The current system of welfare involves applying for Universal Credit and your article highlighting the research by Bath and Oxford Universitiescertainly exposed the downfalls of this system. It pointed to an unfair and thoughtless system of payments, and ndash confirming what opposition MPrsquos have been telling the Government for years ndash the view that Universal Credit should be reviewed, even replaced, with immediate effect. Perhaps two million new applications for Universal Credit, consequences of Covid-, will once and for all expose the shortfalls of this system to a Government at Westminster who must tackle this sector of the economy going forward.Catriona C Clark, Falkirk."},{"url":null,"title":"Opinion  Rosemary Goring  I look like a Holby City cast member in my mask","story":"Normally I pick up litter. Not today. The mask might have lain there for weeks, but it felt better to leave it for someone with rubber gloves to deal with. In the coming months, I suspect paper masks will become the new crisp packet or plastic water bottle, the leading litter offender of our times. Artists are doubtless already photographing bandit-style objects dangling from trees or trapped in drains, compiling a photo-montage of Covid detritus, to look back on in years to come.Now that face coverings are obligatory on public transport, and recommended in smaller shops and confined spaces, the day is coming when most of us will carry some form of protective gear in our pocket. This is meant to make us, and others, safer, yet the sight of bus passengers earlier this week, hidden from chin to eye, was anything but reassuring. It reminded me of cattle trucks, where all you can see between the slats are the animalsrsquo eyes, rolling in fear as they head for the abattoir.Some of my friends have been covering up for months others would rather head for the hills and ride out the storm like outlaws than comply. But like it or not, I suspect this latest accessory will be with us for the foreseeable future. The days when we used to stare in bemusement at Oriental tourists wearing what looked like BQ dust protectors are long gone. In some places, especially cities, it seems face coverings are already de rigueur, so much so that fashion houses are producing their own lines, to complement their designer range. This could either be seen as a definition of sad, or defiantly le-affirming.How did it come to this  In a text exchange with a friend, we were comparing styles, and recommending ones we liked, when a shudder went through both of us. Who ever thought we would be having this dialogue  It was a sobering moment, stark proof of how altered the world has become in a matter of months.The fabric visors I have on order are as non-medical as it gets, short of the Venice carnival. If Laura Ashley were still in business, I could have lurked unnoticed among the rails in one of these for days. Perhaps wisely, my husband has opted instead for the Ned Kelly look. With a hill-walking snood pulled up over his nose he looks dastardly, and warm. With the hottest days of the year approaching, wearers will be severely tested. It is no joke. On overheated buses, tubes and trains ndash often tropical even in winter ndash being cocooned behind cloth, wool or paper will raise temperatures to simmering point. Tempers might follow. This is no time, certainly, for the menopausal. It will be interesting to see what happensanyone finds it so unbearable a prospect that they dare to go bare-faced.So far the enforcement of lockdown measures has been largely consensual, the police working amicably to ensure peoplersquos safety. Butany passengers revolt or feel unwell when under wraps, who will handle that situation  Itrsquos simple enough to prevent refusniks getting on at the bus stop, but thereafter the driver cannot be expected to enforce the law. Will there be a member of transport police on every service or at every station, or a rapid response squad within hailing distance What about those who suffer from asthma or other respiratory complaints that mean they cannot trap their noses and mouths  Confronting public anger or filthy stares as they appear to flout the rules will be bad enough but how do they convince officials that their condition is genuine  The mere prospect of having to prove their credentials, or to run a gauntlet of jibes and stares, will deter many from even attempting to hop on public transport.Of course we will eventually get used to swaddling ourselves, just as wersquore now programmed to reach for soap after every foray beyond the front door, and to keep a cowrsquos distance from neighbours. Yet the potential hazards of facial wraps are fiercely debated. The main concern is that people will feel a  sense of security behind their personal protective barrier and neglect to wash their hands. Nor, Irsquove read, is cloth very effective at preventing the passage of small contagious droplets. When you add to this the likelihood that the discomfort of prolonged use leads to constant tweaking and touching, it seems their health benefits might be less assured than wersquove been encouraged to believe.All of this suggests the psychological signicance might be as important as the medical purpose. Seeing a sea of veiled faces around you reinforces the message of pervasive threat. Visors, in whatever shape, are a visible reminder that each and every one of us presents a potential risk to others. They are symbols of our collective duty to be seen to be taking precautions by wearing them, we signal willingness to help lower anxiety and alarm, and to play our part in the communal effort to defeat this disease.Will we ever feel relaxed under these circumstances  I can cope with the prospect of covering up while heading off on holiday but once at my destination, how easygoing will a cafe or gallery, beach or bar feel when you can only see waitersrsquo and bartendersrsquo eyes, and art lovers or bookshop browsers look like the cast in Holby City  Holidays are about escaping the everyday, and switching off. Learning to do that now will require mentally airbrushing out the red flags in the scene before us, be it perspex screens, the distance between tables, or a proleration of nosebags. Itrsquos not impossible, but it will be quite a feat.To get into training, Irsquove written this column while wearing a paper mask. Itrsquos not a flattering sight. With every breath the screen has come in and out of focus as my glasses fog up. That is not good either.

A storm in  showed something strange in the sand at the Bay of Skaill and the Laird, William Graham Watt, went on to excavate part of a , year old village. After reading the original reports, I now know that this isn’t true. The real story is more interesting.The Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, has three papers on Skara Brae. The first was by Samuel Laing, who visited the site in autumn .“Two chambers have been completely excavated, together with the passage and parts of the entrances to other chambers by Mr William Watt, a relative of William Watt, Esq of Breckness, residing at Skaill, to whose zeal the scientic world is indebted for the discovery and exhumation of this interesting relic of antiquity.#When I saw the credit being given to a relative of William Watt Esq, rather than the man himself, I remembered my father, Peter Leith, telling me that his father, also Peter, had told him that a dferent William Watt, known as Black Willie, had been the man responsible.In the  Census, I found the Laird living at Skaill, aged , with a son William, aged . His son and heir, William WG Watt was  and living at Kierfiold, so there were two sons called William.In James Irvine’s  book, ‘The Breckness Estate’, I read that William G Watt had a natural son, William, who in  was given £ a year and free board, “so long as he chose to remain a clerk in the house.”The story then turned into a neat circle. I followed up a reference in the book and found it was an Orkney Herald article written by my grandfather. It was about Hugh Miller’s book ‘Rambles of a Geologist’, in which Miller recorded his visit to Orkney in .My grandfather had written: “Another interesting person, who has already been mentioned, was William Watt of Skaill. This was not, as some readers may suppose, the laird of Skaill, but a distant relative who made his home there. He was well-known to everybody as “Black Willie” from his dark hair and complexion. Like Miller, he was a self-taught geologist, he always carried a little bag with a hammer and chisel to dig out any fossils he came across. He brought some of his more interesting specimens for Hugh Miller’s inspection and they had an interesting discussion. When Skarabrae was first dug into in the ’s, it is certain that Black Willie took an active part in the work and saw to it that anything found was safely preserved.”I looked up the references to William Watt in the book and found that Hugh Miller had come with a letter of introduction to him and described him both as an intelligent geologist and an intelligent palaeontologist. He showed Watt, along with Dr Garson of Stromness, where his famous discovery, the Astrolepsis fossil, lay.To read about the second and third papers on Skara Brae and what Patricia found out, see page  of this week#s edition of The Orcadian.Patricia Long is a tourist guide based in Stenness with a strong interest in social history.

Transport operators continue to play a key role in supporting essential travel and in ensuring passenger confidence in public transport while maintaining physical distancing. The use of face coverings forms a fundamental part of gaining that public trust.“We are asking people to take personal responsibility to do the right thing. Wearing a face covering while on public transport means you are playing your part in the collective effort to prevent the spread of coronavirus and reducing the risk to your fellow citizens.”In line with this, the council is asking people to provide their own face coverings when travelling by ferry, bus, plan, taxi or private hire cars. People who are not able to wear a face covering for specic medical reasons will be exempt, as will children under five.Orkney Ferries timetables are currently being revised in consultation with Community Councils in the North and South Isles. It is hoped that an enhanced service can be provided after Monday, June .Further information about this will be provided next week.In the meantime, the Council is asking public transport users to please be patient and consider others needs when planning future travel – and thanking people for their help and co-operation with this.Advice on face coverings, including how to make one and instructions for using one, will be available on the Transport Scotland website. This advice is being updated to include full details of the applicable exemptions.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

These include play areas within school grounds and the skate park in Kirkwall.From that date, the play area at the Pickaquoy Centre will be open, but the rest of the complex and surrounding grounds will remain closed.Gwenda Shearer, chairwoman of OIC’s education, leisure and housing committee, said: “I am very pleased that the gradual easing of lockdown allows us to reopen play areas throughout Orkney.“I am sure this will be welcomed by many children, young people and their families, especially as the summer holidays are fast approaching.“In line with Government requirements, we strongly advise that everyone follows hand hygiene and physical distancing guidance when visiting play areas. That will help ensure all of us stay safe.”The latest advice on this can be found here: https:www.nhsinform.scot illnesses-and-conditions infections-and-poisoning coronavirus-covid- coronavirus-covid--physical-distancingcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The Deputy First Minister said that, when the part-time #blended# plan for schooling had been developed, he and his colleagues could not have anticipated such an improvement in infection levels. The #blended# model will remain a contingency plan, should infection rates dramatically increase or progress against the virus slow.#I must stress that this is the aim the government is working towards, but it remains conditional on scientic and health advice,# Mr Swinney explained.#If we continue to make progress on the route we envisage, we may have successfully achieved — or be well on the way to achieving — Phase Four.#It is this more positive outlook that means the Scottish Government can make this updated planning assumption for schools.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It is important that we face our fears and do not avoid them.“The enjoyment we might get from moving more freely outside, travelling and meeting friends and family is tempered when we are worried about the spread of infection. By sticking to the rules during the gradual lting of restrictions, we can be confident that risk won’t rise. Less virus around us can be matched with less restriction.“Although there are practical things we can do to help ourselves cope over the coming weeks, remember that help is availableneeded.  We’ve never had to deal with a situation like this before, so be kind to yourself and to others, and reach outyou need to talk to someone.  Support is there.”For practical tips, you can visit clearyourhead.scot.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"owners asked to let coastguard know if boats are left unattended ","story":"Boat owners are being reminded to please inform the coastguardthey will be leaving vessels unattended for any period of time.The Aith leboat was called out on Sunday evening after reports of a small boat lying empty near an uninhabited isle to the west of Scalloway.While no missing people had been reported in the area, the volunteer crew of the Charles Lidbury were asked by local coastguard officers to make their way to the scene and investigate.The call out came at .pm and the leboat team steamed south to where the skf had been moored – near the skerry of Sanda Stour at the entrance to Weisdale Voe.On arrival the small boat was recognised by a crew member – who then made contact with the boat#s owner to confirm that they were safe and well.

All i would say is that modern day slavery is still rampant in the world and the criminals who run these things don#t care what skin colour you have. This is what BLM should be protesting, becauseall le matters!..Fun fact..The only #BAME# person to be killed by uk police in the past  months was the London bridge terrorist attacker!The moment you see people using words like #virtue signalling# and #woke#, the more you can be sure they have got their whole education from Facebook.Brian, You nailed it right there.

Continuing to work backwards, BLM doesn#t need to be protesting all le matters. For one, that is not contested . More importantly the lives of black people and people from Britain#s ethnic minorities are blighted by racism and are too often cut short because of racist violence and institutional and ingrained discrimination, as is sadly also the case in too many other countries.Quite where George gets off on saying #these people # hold #being white is a bad thing# is dog whistling two common racist tropes.There is no #these people# when it comes to those who want to stand up for a fairer world.The only #bad thing#evident is demonstrated amply by #anti-racist# George.George can claim to struggle all he likes to understand the issue of #white shame#, but there#s only one reason why he struggles.He seeks to lambast those with concerns about the nature of inequality in stC UK, as is evident from every sentence he hascontributed.His is hateful commentary.I ask the people on these marches where does the clothes and shoes you wear come from and how much do these workers get paid nobody caring about that and the rest of us have stayed home for months to stay safe and not infect others .

agreed to pursue shetland energy hub to boost the economy ","story":"A Shetland partnership has agreed to develop an #Energy Hub# focussing on renewables to boost the economy.Shetland Islands Council and the Oil and Gas Technology Centrehave announced todaythey will work together on the concept to deliver clean, sustainable energy for local consumption and export to the UK.It will focus on using renewable energy to power offshore oil and gas s while also producing industrial quantities of hydrogen.While project backers have hailed its “massive” opportunities, campaigners opposed to onshore windfarms claim it will lead to “further industrialisation” of the landscape.The announcement comes just a week after SSE Renewables approved a final investment of almost £ million in the Viking Energy windfarm project.Although the Viking scheme is said to be running “in parallel” with the energy hub, both projects depend on an interconnector going ahead, connecting Shetland with the UK#s energy grid.The hub is hoped to make West Shetland oil and gas assets achieve carbon net zero targets by  as well as providing five per cent of the UK#s low carbon energy by .Project leaders say it is an ambitious concept, marking a sht from Shetland#s traditional energy industries, with the hope to benefit the community, provide jobs and energy security, both locally and nationally.SIC leader Steven Coutts said: “This is exactly the boost that our economy needs at this time.“I am delighted that the project has moved so fast since the council set it up earlier in the year as the opportunities are massive and the engagement is very strong.“It is particularly important for our young folk and the wider community as we look to develop our workforce into the future.”SIC chief executive Maggie Sandison added: “The hub’s aim is to provide local communities and industry access to clean energy, reduce emissions and maximise the value of the region’s oil and gas sector during energy transition.“This project will create sustainable local and regional employment, which is of paramount importance in these dficult times.”The next stage for the project is a period of planning, early stage concept engineering, research and studies.  It will run for two to three years before any investment decisions are taken.Colette Cohen, chief executive of the OGTC said: “Energy hubs are an exciting concept, which have the potential to accelerate the transition of our industry to a net zero future, while also supporting the UK’s net zero ambitions.#Our objective at OGTC is to reduce the cost of developing and deploying technology to enable and accelerate the energy transition.#The energy hub concept is a priority, working in partnership with industry, the regulators and research organisations, it will accelerate the development of key technology to create an integrated energy future for Scotland and enable the region to transition to a hydrogen economy.”Douglas Irvine, project lead for the SIC said: “An essential part of our ambition is to ensure that the Shetland community’s energy requirements are integrated into the project, and community-scale schemes are encouraged as well as industrial-scale ventures.#The interconnector between Shetland and the Scottish mainland is important for the project, but only a part of a much wider integrated renewable energy solution for Shetland and for the region”.Sustainable Shetland, which was formed in opposition to the Viking Energy windfarm project has raised fresh concerns about the energy hub.Campaign chairman Frank Hay said alternative proposals for a gas fired power station remained a “far better” use of oil and gas technology than the hub’s proposalsMr Hay also said he felt the cost of the interconnector would be “prohibitively expensive” at a time when oil and gas is trying to cut costs.an inter-connector to the mainland,” he addd.“However, hydrogen has yet to make a much of an impact as an energy source and is not very competitive cost wise.would appear to be a further PR exercise to boost support for the inter-connector.covered most of our island with wind turbines.“Perhaps they should focus

metagrobilisation, among the rank and file of Scottish golfers that courses, particularly those in the environs of our urban cousins, were being widely used as exercise areas for a myriad of

denied to them since late March.Ten long and lonely weeks had passed and lots of long walks had been necessarily wasted when striding out mile upon mile along the highways and byways without being able to pause even momentarily in order to hit a wee white ba#!However,what a spectacle greeted the ing players.Keeper-of-the-green John Cunningham # all the while working in absolutely splendid isolation # had lavished care and attention on the  acre enclosure, the viridity of which despite near drought conditions for many of the lockdown weeks, was indeed a joy to behold.In the interim the compact but admirably sedulous committee had worked tirelessly to prepare mountains of perspicuous materials in order to put into place the government-required protocols for accountability at the club should #track and trace# become necessary somewhere down the line.Consequently, a work of art, the online tee-time booking system metamorphosed and that particular stipulation for the resumption of play was completed both satisfactorily and timeously.The government edict was that initially only the members of golf clubs should be allowed to play on the courses for both social distancing and accountability purposes with no member#s guests or visitors to be allowed access to the course in the easing of the phase one lockdown.Incidentally could the prize for the #biggest lock-down turkeys#

worried too much though as #The Tent on Staffin Island# doesn#t quite trip off the tongue Car parking with social distancing was to be easy. The auld yins used the on-course site while the large overflow parking space easily accommodated the youngsters.Hand sanitising gel dispensers were installed and made available outside the clubhouse which like all others in the land is closed for business for the foreseeable future.Fortunately, although our clubhouse generates a decent amount of money from sales of teas, coffees, confectioneries but most importantly club logo-ed items of clothing we will not suffer quite as much as the larger clubs who maintain essential bars and restaurants.On the actual playing surfaces greenkeepers were required to make provision for golfers to be able to #hole# their golf balls without requiring to touch either the cup, the flag or the pin.Creativity came to the fore and what would our fellow dream up for our edication and delight #

This should have been readjusted to the UK fit-testing requirements. We are advised that any risk to staff is likely to be low.The HSC system is now carrying out a validation and audit exercise of all fit-tests conducted by this independent contractor.The PHA has been asked by the Department of Health to undertake a serious adverse incident review.This is defined as any event or circumstance that led or could have led to serious unintended or unexpected harm, loss or damage to patients.They must be carried out after an incident resulting in serious harm, or an unexpected or unexplained death, for example.Incidents may include infection outbreaks in a hospital or the failure of equipment.Additional measures across the HSC will be put in place to review and monitor fit-testing outcomes moving forward, the PHA said. Staff impacted will be informed and offered support. Fit-testing will be carried out under the correct NI setting.We fully recognise that the issues raised may cause some concern and we very much regret that. We would again stress that these checks are being taken as a precautionary step to reassure staff that the masks are being fitted to the highest safety standards. Rigorous tried and tested procedures have been in place during the pandemic for staff to highlight any concernsthey feel their PPE equipment does not properly fit. Further information will be made public following the conclusion of the audit.Health union Unison had been advised last Thursday by health trusts of a regional alert in relation to PPE fit-testing carried out for trusts by an external company. It said it was told that some staff may have received a positive fit-test when, in actual fact, under HSE standards this may not have been the case. Unison regional secretary Patricia McKeown said last night her main concern is the extent to which our members have been exposed and what liability lies with employers and the department.I think there are more issues here than the calibration of machines. We raised concerns about nature of the masks, and the instruction at least one company gave to tie knots in them to make fit, she said.There was a major issue about masks being generally made to fit a larger male face, rather than a smaller female face - and the majority of staff are women.We will certainly be giving evidence to any inquiry being carried out.Belfast Most ReadNoah Donohoe: Community determined to reunite boy with family, says teacherBelfast streets #renamed# as part of republican campaignPolice say missing Noah Donohoemay have head injury after abandoning clothing Unionist anger as republicans rename Belfast streets and Queen#s University after IRA womanBelfast home designed by Mater Hospital architect goes on market for £.m,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

I think it will work as long as people use their common sense.There#s a worry as well that children are falling behind with their work.Kate said her choice would be to start back full-time straight away.I#m not getting as much done at home and it would be good to get back to see my friends.Lola Elliott , from Dundonald, has just finished her final year at Brooklands Primary School early and is due to start at Bloomfield Collegiate.Her mother, Dawn Elliott , said she still has safety concerns, but recognised the importance of getting back to structured learning.To be honest, I don#t even know what any of the arrangements are as nothing has been confirmed, she said.Transport wise, I would be very concerned as she would take the Glider, so we#re going to have to drive her to and from school for now.But we don#t know anything, there#s talk about using small bubbles for classrooms, but we don#t know for sure yet.She added: If I could keep her at home forever, I would, but doing school work at home has been tough. We started off on the right foot and it just faded away, but everyone is dealing with things dferently. Lola loves it.Lola said she has enjoyed learning at home, but was thankful she got to say goodbye to her primary school classmates with a special online Assembly. While many students might relish the idea of an extended break from school, for Niamh Larkinand her dad Andrew Larkin , from Portadown, the chance tocan#t come soon enough.Niamh is about to enter her third year at St John the Baptist#s College and is hoping to do a GCSE early as part of a high achievers class.Andrew said: I think their education is going to suffer as things are. If they can go back safely then I would be happy. It#s hard to get them to learn in the house, they need structured education, but at a safe distance.I would like them to get back to five days with a teacher in the classroom using social distancing.Niamh agreed she had missed friends and was worried about falling behind in her studies.Colleen McCluskey , from Belfast, was out shopping with son Caolanand grandmother Maureen McStravick .Colleen said: My son is in pretty small classes, so I do feel happy for him to go back. The way I see it isthey can go to childcare, as both myself and my husband work full-time,that#s okay, it#s alright for them to go to school. On dealing with months of lockdown, she said: We have to say we#ve been looking on the positive side of it, it#s been lovely to have time with the children, eventhey are a bit annoying at times.Grandmother Maureen added: We#ve been told that children have a very low risk of passing on the virus, so I think they should be back in school. Teaching at home works for some people, but there#s a lot that it doesn#t suit.

Queen#s University was renamed #Mairead Farrell University Belfast# with signage erected across its prominent front gates after the former student and IRA volunteer, killed in Gibraltar on active service in .The streets surrounding Belfast City Hall including May Street and Donegall Square were renamed after three hunger strikers - Joe McDonnell, Bobby Sands and Kieran Doherty - who died in Long Kesh in . Group spokesperson Pol Torboid said that they had compiled a list of place names from across the city that they say featured prominent iniduals responsible for historic abuses in Ireland.He added: Belfast#s streets, littered with the poverty of its people, its homeless and jobless are also littered with the names of those whose attitude to Ireland was one of subjugation, and who, by force of arms, forced a political and economic system upon our people, which became the foundation for partition, and for the current economic struggles faced by the Irish people.These street names, monuments to those who delivered misery across our nation in one form or another, also serve as monuments to the political and economic system that they helped to build in Ireland.These street names, the symbols of oppression, hate and servitude, must be stripped away. They must be replaced with the names of those who sought to build a better Ireland, the names of those who fought against oppression, against hate and against servitude.They must be replaced with the names of heroes: of normal people. Not lords. Not kings or queens but rather those who weren#t the heirs to vast riches.Those whose only inheritance was that which they tried to carve out of a political system that railed against them.It is our inheritance as Republicans to end the oppression immortalised in these street names and statues.It is our duty to end colonialism, to end the normalisation of imperialism and, consequently, the political and economic system that maintains it.Belfast Most ReadBelfast streets #renamed# as part of republican campaignNoah Donohoe: Community determined to reunite boy with family, says teacherPolice say missing Noah Donohoemay have head injury after abandoning clothing Belfast home designed by Mater Hospital architect goes on market for £.mUnionist anger as republicans rename Belfast streets and Queen#s University after IRA woman,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Lavey Parish pooled their energies to raise almost pound, to contribute to the recent work on St Mary’s Church of Our Lady of Mercy. Parish priest Fr Eamon Graham was delighted to see the community coming together. “Weve just come to end of a very extraordinary week in our parish and community,” he said. “Ive certainly been overwhelmed - I think we all have - by the level of generosity, but I think something even more important was that so many aspects of our community pulled together. googletag.cmd.push “You know, we enjoyed it, enjoyed it very much. At the end of the lockdown period I think we were all, kind of, looking for a lt of some kind and it certainly gave us all a great lt. “I want to say a sincere thanks to everybody who was involved - everybody who was at the organising end of it, and particularly to the groups that took part.” The fundraiser received huge community support, with local sports clubs in the area all taking on a specic challenge to help with the chapel’s restoration. Erin’s Own GAA’s underage footballers and hurlers ran km each, while their senior counterparts ran a collective km. googletag.cmd.push Termoneeny Hill Walking Club had originally pledged to walk a collective km, but upped their target to ,km during the course of their challenge. Termoneeny Cycling Club members each cycled km, while the Erin’s Own camogie players each clocked up at least km. -year-old Harry Boyle’s remarkable contribution saw him cycling around all the townlands in the parish, while Fr Graham and his parochial team got involved by running in their Lavey gear. The challenge was not just limited to Lavey, though, and their diaspora throughout the world got involved via social media, sharing photos of them completing their contribution. The club have raised almost pound, to date and donations can still be made via the Lavey Parish Just Giving page.

Publicans in Derry who took a ‘massive’ financial hit by closing ahead of St Patrick’s Day in the interest of public safety have encouraged the public to ‘support their local’ once they reopen. Northern Irelands hotels, bars, restaurants and cafes can reopen from July . William McGuinness and his business partner Phil Nolan own Paedar O’Donnells, The Gweedore and Fty Seven nightclub on Waterloo Street. Before the government issued any formal directive for businesses to shut, Paedar’s led the way by announcing that it was closing its doors on March . googletag.cmd.push It came two days before the busiest date on the calendar for Irish bars, St Patrick’s Day. “It was a matter of conscience for us,” Mr McGuinness said, “the general feeling at the time was that the NHS was going to be under pressure and we thought St Patrick’s Day would have been a petri dish for infection and we didn’t want to be responsible for that.” Boris Johnson’s order for all non-essential businesses would come over a week later on March . Derry City and Strabane has the second lowest COVID- death rate of every council area in the country and just  positive Coronavirus cases to date – also the second lowest in the country. googletag.cmd.push Chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Derry doctor Tom Black, has credited the part played by local businesses who took their cues from the Republic of Ireland. Mr McGuinness said they’re happy they made that decision even though the business took a ‘massive hit’ because of it. “St Patrick’s Day is our busiest day of the year and we were thinking about retirement soon but this thing has thrown it all up in the air. “We knew that, but we were just concerned about the health of Derry people.” Paedar’s missed out on grants because it didn’t meet the criteria but employees were furloughed. The rebuild will be a slow process, Mr McGuinness said, as the pandemic took its toll. DIFFICULT From July  pubs and bars will be allowed to trade but must serve food and operate on a table service basis. Pubs that do not serve food will be allowed to sell alcohol outdoors, such as beer gardens, also restricted to table service. Mr McGuinness said that will make it ‘very dficult’ for small bars like Paedar’s with limited outdoor space. Permission to use that space is absolutely essential in his view. He added: “I would object to the fact that restaurant bars are allowed to open but bars aren’t allowed to serve inside. “I think the risk is higher in a restaurant bar with adults and children being served food and drink whereas we’re just serving alcohol to adults. “With food there are all sorts of utensils but we just have glasses and disposable plastic. “I don’t see the sense in holding us up because we don’t do food.” The ‘rush’ is now on to ready the bar for customers and bar owners like Mr McGuinness are looking to the government and local authorities for guidance. Paedar O’Donnell’s has been cleared of tables and chairs to allow for the walls to be freshly painted and floors nished ahead of the grand reopening.  Mr McGuinness hopes that the government advice is relaxed to allow bars to serve indoors. They’re awaiting further guidance before spending any money on Perspex screens or other safety measures. He concluded: “We’d encourage people to come back but it’s going to be very limited space. “We don’t have the tourists, we were a very busy bar at weekends, and we’re not going to get those numbers in – nowhere is – because Derry people like to go out on a Friday and Saturday and nowhere will be able to cater for them because of social distancing. “There’s no money to be made in the next few months that’s the reality. “But hopefully over timeit is under control and there’s no resurgence maybe we can get back to some normality.” INFORMATION The owner of numerous bar-restaurants in the city including the Bentley, The Magnet and Molly Malones, Tony O’Connor, is also seeking clarity. “I’m surmising that they’re working on it at Stormont but we need more information about social distancing and so on,” he said. With all of his restaurants serving food he’s assured by the fact that customers can sit indoors but is unsure as to whether dining customers can stay longer to socialise. Mr O Connor said: “Every one of our premises will be opening on July  because of the food situation. Out of our six bars, five of them have outdoor areas.” This week he held a meeting with management and they’re ‘all positive and raring to go’. Like many businesses, the pandemic has been a ‘nightmare’ for Mr O’Connor but he realises that everybody is on the same boat. The Irish government ‘deserves a massive pat on the back’ for closing bars before St Patrick’s Day, he said, because ‘you would have had thousands and thousands across Ireland’ spreading the virus. “A lot of bars lost out on revenue there, no money was coming in and none getting paid out, so you just start over again,” he added. AMAZING  Bars have been actively discouraged from staging live music events or screening football matches to minimise the urge for customers to ‘dance’ or ‘hug each other’ after a goal is scored. It’s Mr O’Connor’s aspiration that the bar will be allowed to have a singer-songwriter, two-piece band performing or DJ providing entertainment. The local businessman said they will have hand sanitisers at each entrance, on every floor, at every table and also behind the bars and in kitchen areas for staff. “I’d rather not open as to have big screens in front of the bar because I think it takes the atmosphere away. “We have enough space so we can take tables away to create distance,” he stated. They’re also considering an App on which people can order food and drinks but are awaiting further guidance. And extra staff will be on hand to carry out an increased cleaning schedule. Looking to the future, Mr O’Connor would like to see visitors to the city from other parts of the island. He said: “I think Derry will get a good turnout because we handled the pandemic well as a city, there was a low number of Coronavirus cases. “I can’t wait to get my teeth back into it, we’ve been doing nothing the past few months, and the not knowing is the worst thing. “We’ve been doing takeaways but getting fully open is going to be amazing. “We’d invite people to get back out and support your local. “Self-awareness is key, Derry has played a blinder, it should be recognised and people here don’t have to be told to social distance, they’re fully aware.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The defendant had been released on bail on June  after being charged with common assault, namely throwing bread at a woman and attempting to grab her, and disorderly behaviour in a public place. A police officer said that on June  the PSNI became aware of a video circulating online showing a man acting in an ‘indecent manner’. googletag.cmd.push It was brought to the attention of police by community representatives and family members of children who witnessed it. McGonagle was identied in multiple reports. The officer said the incident took place at Old School Lane where the -year-old was seen ‘defecating in view of children’. A -year-old recorded the incident. The officer added: “He used chip shop wrappers to wipe himself. He was extremely intoxicated.” Police located the defendant at Old School Lane and he charged straight away. Objecting to bail, the officer said on June  McGonagle was warned about his behaviour and not to be intoxicated in a public place. googletag.cmd.push The court heard the -year-old has  previous convictions and two suspended sentences. There is an ‘extremely high risk of reoffending’, the officer added, ‘this man is incapable of not being intoxicated in a public place.’ Defence barrister Stephen Mooney said his client pleaded guilty to the offences before the court on Monday at the first opportunity and it was adjourned for a pre-sentence report. McGonagle was not in a position to be interviewed by the police due to his level of intoxication. Mr Mooney told the court that back in   the -year-old spent a ‘very signicant’ period of time in custody on remand. He was then found ‘unfit for trial’ because of his mental capacity and the prosecution was discontinued. The defence barrister said it is not so much a ‘fool’s pardon but a street drinker’s pardon’ as he is a well-known street drinker. His alcoholism is being criminalised because of his inability to stay sober, he added. Mr Mooney asked for bail to be granted with strict conditions attached. District Judge Peter King said ‘you’re absolutely correct’ and any bail conditions would have to include a prohibition on alcohol which would set him up for ‘spectacular failure’. He added that McGonagle may upset the ‘wrong person or group of people and find himself facing more dficulties’. The defendant was remanded in custody due to a ‘clear risk of reoffending’ to appear by way of video link on July .

The RQIA – Northern Ireland’s health and social care regulator – was directed by the Department in March to reduce the frequency of its statutory inspection activity and cease its non-statutory inspection activity and review programme. This temporary measure was introduced to minimise the risk of health and social care professionals and other visitors spreading infection within care homes. Similar restrictions were introduced in GB and the Republic of Ireland. With community transmission of Covid- now signicantly reduced, the Department has been able to rescind the March direction. googletag.cmd.push With the rebuilding of health and social care services under way following the first wave of the Covid- pandemic, the RQIA will be able to increase its activity across all areas of work. It is important that this increased activity remains as safe and as flexible as possible. Returning to pre-pandemic inspection levels will not be immediately possible. Whilst RQIA’s planned inspection programme was temporarily paused, RQIA’s inspectors – including registered nurses, social workers and pharmacists – continued to regulate services and respond to risks and concerns. It reports that since the outbreak of the Covid- pandemic, it conducted around  on-site inspections at care homes and domiciliary care services. It has also taken enforcement action against five services during this time. googletag.cmd.push In recognition of the threat from Coronavirus to older and vulnerable people, the Department of Health also “repurposed” RQIA from March to provide enhanced support to care homes and domiciliary care services. In response, the regulator established a Service Support Team.This has involved RQIA inspectors and senior staff providing detailed advice and direction to care homes and domiciliary care services in managing their services during the pandemic period.

This is dferent. Last weeks edition of this column made two proposals for a new-look Derry senior football championship. Both were based around the inclusion of isional teams and in part two, we put some flesh on the bones. The thought process is the poorof players from the intermediate and junior grades coming through to the Derry senior football team in the last decade. Of  players used in league and championship, by five dferent managers, none hail from junior clubs and  from intermediate, one less than Ballinderrys club total. googletag.cmd.push Also, the decade saw Coleraine, Slaughtneil and Ballinderry dominate the competition. Its great for the clubs in question, but in a bid to help raise the quality overall. A county team needs more options. In Sideline Views proposal,  senior clubs have been selected on the basis of the last five years of the senior championship. The  teams who reached at least one semi-final were joined by Swatraghand Dungivenas the highest placed teams in the  league standings. The other three teams are isional teams picked from the rest of the clubs. Foyle Oaks , North Derry and South Derry. googletag.cmd.push Logistically it will be dficult to fit in around hurling. So in a case where Tiarnaacuten McHugh is trying to balance North Derry, Drumsurn and Kevin Lynchs, it will be far from ideal. A balance will be needed and proper dialogue between all three managers, with the players training regime at the heart of it. The senior championship will need to be played off over dferent weekends to intermediate and junior. This would be a stumbling block as it stands, with so much tied up in the leagues. Under this new concept, leagues would be totally dferent from championship. Leagues of  with a two up two down relegation, would be devised with one thing in mind – getting as many games as possible. The CCC would allocate rounds on the weekends the NFL is on. Club games are on Friday or Saturday night, with the county taking place on Sunday. The county manager names his starting  and anyone outside of that, who didnt see any meaningful game time in previous round, is eligible for club football. It would need checked with the county physio, buta player is going to be of any benefit, they need competition in the legs. The advantage is having more games on a more regular basis, with more room to balance the club championship commitments. It would help avoid loggerheads at a time of year when it really matters, it would help get rid of the alarming drop-off rate from players being caught between two stools. A situation where nobody wins and in the case of Derry, it leaves a situation that stles any continuity. ON THE DRAW Last week, Liam Tunneyrandomly picked  numbers and the draw was populated as you see below. It has some mouthwatering ties. North Derrys clash with a Dungiven side clambering their way back to their decline is the tie of the round, with the late Sunday night billing at Owenbeg. The appointment of former Dungiven manager Michael OKane and Darren McShane as managers of North Derry will add a bit of spice along the sideline. South Derrys debut in the championship see them up against a ravenous Slaughtneil, who have aim to win back the John McLaughlin Cup after a two year absence and have the astute Paul Bradley at the helm. In the opposition dugout is Ronan Rocks who will know the intermediate scene well and has an handle on the up and coming minor talent from his time with Derry Us. He is joined in the South Derry management team by Hugh Mulholland, who never misses a club championship game and will know Slaughtneil inside out. Foyle Oaks, under the management of Michael McLaughlin and Joe Gray, come up against Loup, with Paddy Bradley in his first season in charge. Lavey and Coleraine renew their  final rivalries.

At the end of the season, two from the first teams eliminated will meet in a play-off to stay in the senior championship. From the last five years, form will be assessed for wins, draws and defeats, as well as scoring totals to pick the two lowest performing teams, who will play in a relegation play-off. The loser will drop to intermediate, with the intermediate winners promoted to the senior grade.

Of their seven titles, Fergal Moore was involved in five, while Conrad McGuigan, their  winning captain, has six winners medals. Michael McMullan spoke to them about their memories. ***If you build it, they will come. The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

The ghostly words inspired Ray Kinsella to build a field of dreams in the middle of his Iowa corn field in Kevin Costners  film of the same name. Craigbane also built for the future. A sharp left turn off the Slieveboy road and Gerry Crossan Park edges into view at the foot of Glenrandel brae. A state-of-the-art hall and gym. A fully floodlit pitch and one with training lights. A running track and a windmill spinning in the background. Its well used, worth every penny and the hours of planning. googletag.cmd.push Gavin Conwell, Ulster winning captain in , is the clubs Youth Officer and is passing on his knowledge to the next crop. Alfie Dallas, George Sharkey and Brian Conway also used the hall to the max. The future is in safe hands. Former senior manager Kevin Moore and Kieran McElhinney manage the minors. Ryan McDaid is involved with the Us. John Oacuteg Donaghy is Chairman. Former goalkeepers Paul McLaughlin and Gerard McLaughlin are on the committee. Its their turn to put a dferent stamp on the club. Next month, Craigbane will continue their rebuilding process in the unfamiliar surroundings of junior, almost  years since they were fingertips away from knocking Ballinderry out of the  Derry championship. The same season the Shamrocks ended as All-Ireland champions. googletag.cmd.push The last decade ravaged Craigbanes senior team of physicality and experience. Year by year, the youth has been thrown in. Now, theyre finding their feet. St Columbs Derry and Cathair Dhoire school teams have emerged with a Craigbane imprint. When St Patricks and St Brigids Claudy school team, under the guidance of current senior player Brian Rainey, there was also a strong Craigbane core.  Craigbanes  U championship winning team All coming from their U championship winning team of , when they beat a fancied Kilrea. “We, as a club, needed it,” manager Conrad McGuigan said after the game. “At the start of the year they beat us by  or  points, but I saw something in our boys in the second half – they didn’t lie down.” By September, they overturned the Pearses to land the silver. *** After early signs of football in the area during the s, St Josephs Craigbane wasnt founded until  and after a Division Three title, the  reserve success was their first championship. “We were starting to get to finals at that time,” Conrad McGuigan remembers of the beginning. “In , it was the th year of the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was our first final and we won it.” McGuigan, not yet , was beginning to cut his teeth in the senior team. After an appearance in the semi-final, he didnt play in the final against Loup. “The team included more of the older hands, it was a very settled team,” McGuigan outlines, before rattling off some of the names. “Noel Moore, Gerard McLaughlin, Shane Lynch, Harry Roe McLaughlin, Paddy Cartin, George Sharkey, Dermot Gormley and Damian OKane. “There were four Gormley brothers, Peter, God rest him, Colm, Leo and Brendan,” he adds. With the clash of green, Loup played in Ballinderry colours and Craigbane purchased a set of Down jersies for the game. “I also remember Loup taking home Martin OBrien from England for the game,” Conrad recalls. “He was a big player for them and that was the worry. Loup were favourites, but it worked out okay for us in the end.” With a first championship in the bag, McGuigan also hails Paul Dixon as being a huge influence on the team. He had ed from a stint with Burnley and was playing with Glentoran at the time. In , it took a replay to get over reigning junior champions Greenlough in the semi-final. Injury to Peter Gormley and his brother Colms sending off robbed them of their midfield pairing, remembers goalkeeper Gerard McLaughlin. Gerry McElhinney came home from England to answer the call. Craigbane found themselves seven points down in the latter stages of the final to Claudy. Earlier in the game, Dixon missed a penalty and turned down the chance to take Craigbanes second penalty. Nobody  fancied it and up stepped McGuigan and his goal sparked their comeback.  The Craigbane team pictured before the  replay win over Claudy Still Claudy held the upper hand and it look a last throw of the dice, Conrad remembers. “There was about two minutes left and I put a ball into the square, it was more of a Hail Mary and hepunched it into the net. The goal earned a replay, which Craigbane won, - to - and retained their title, leading to a four-year stint in the senior championship. Away from the clubscene, McGuigan played in St Marys Belfasts  Sigerson Cup win over UCC. He was also playing with Derry Us and Tommy Diamond had called him into the senior , where he saw some initial action. While success followed his career path, so too did injury. If two leg breaks werent enough, a dislocated elbow and putting out his shoulder a few times added to the woe. *** Tyrone has played a central part in Fergal Moores le. As a corner forward, he played up front with Geoffrey McGonigle on the Derry minor team, beaten by the Red Hands at Omagh in . Married and living close to Errigal Ciarans home in Dunmoyle for the last  years, saw him faced with a  milejourney to train and play with Craigbane. Despite being approached by the Tyrone giants to transfer and the lure of senior championship football, he stuck with his roots. “We wouldve been training twice a week and maybe three times coming up to championship,” Moore outlines. “I was asked to joinbut I never really thought about it. If Craigbane didnt have a game, I would go and watch Errigal.” Loyalty to home club was too much, though he has helped coach his daughter Michealas ladies team. “I have been at Tyronegames, but I have just been shouting her name,” he jokes. “Youll not get me cheering come on Tyrone or anything like that.” After starting on the Craigbane senior team as an U in , it was  before he made his championship debut, coming on as a sub in the final against Magilligan. “It was easy enough in the finish,” he outlines of Craigbanes win. Through the minors, he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era. An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s. “Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers. “A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain. “Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.” Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience. “The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace. At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the county a good game for it,” McGuigan stresses. By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won. Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground. The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final. First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss. “It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states. Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites. The cream against the second ision team. “There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal. A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds. After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane  In the league, Banagher had won close games between the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendance of nearly , flocked to Drum for the final. “We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues. “We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along. Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose. “Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer. Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in. “It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.” Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed. Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.  Paddy Cassidy and Maurice McElhinney help Gavin Conwell from the pitch during the  final Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory. “It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds. Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four. “I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game. “Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.” “The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls. “It wouldve have been the main place,. The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds. There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights. *** The  chapter was dferent. Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point. In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay. By , Craigbane were top dogs again. After securing the Dr Kerlin Cup, it was like a fair day in Farahs. The story at the time was about the situation at Drumcree and local police resources were stretched. The bar was buzzing and it was the daylight hours before revellers spilled out on their way home. There was an interesting angle in the championship final that season. Alfie Dallas, Craigbanes  winning manager, was now in charge of Claudy. Low and behold, they met Craigbane in the final, with his son, Alfie junior, in fine fettle with seven points to his name in a comfortable win. “I have more memories of beating Banagher, because it meant more to us and we had already beaten Claudy,” Conrad McGuigan commented of the  success.  Sean Crossan, Shane Lynch, Gergal Moore and Gavin Conwell look on as Conrad McGuigan lts the  championship It was  before the next championship title, again under Deeney and McElhinney. They needed a stroke of luck in the last minute against Slaughtmanus in a topsy turvy round one game. The sides were level when Sean Currans shot hit the crossbar and came out, only to be greeted by the final whistle. “We shouldve been out,” Fergal Moore admits. “They were straight through,it had went over the bar, we were out.” A suspension kept Gavin Conwell out of most of the championship. A re-fixed semi-final to a Friday night, hours before his ban ended, ruled him out of the win over Claudy. Fergal Crossans alsofor the final, after a summer in Chicago that saw him win North American Player of the Year and later a call to the Derry senior team. Victory over Newbridge in the final, who had just dropped down from senior, took Craigbane to six on the roll of honour. Before the official Ulster championship, Clontibret ran Ulster tournament and this was Craigbanes first venture following delay because of foot and mouth. “I remember us going over the border and having to go across a sheep-dip type thing, where everything had to be washed,” McGuigan remembers. It was new ground, new teams, food on the way and a bus journey to the game. With every round, they grew as a team. “We beat Belcoo, Termon, Beragh and Inniskeen,” came the list of the teams rolling off Fergal Moores tongue, of their passage to glory. “Inniskeen was a right hard game,” he remembers of their - to - win. “We beat Beragh - to five or six points. The Tyrone teams were always good and Beragh werent long down from senior...it was probably the easiest game we played.” Fergal retired five years ago from reserve football at the age of , having picked up a fth medal and a second Ulster in , as part of a  managed by his brother Kevin and containing nephews Lee, Ryan and Rory. Conrad finished up in , aged , but after having a great innings, he has a regret not to have hung on longer for the clubs seventh championship. “I had played a bit of reserve football. The legs were starting to go, my game was based on pace. I was so lucky and looking back it was the right time for me to stop. I wouldnt have been playing , but just to be part of it and missing the the buzz of being involved when the club is on a run.” Now, it is all about the next generation and McGuigan, like many around the club, is confident. If they can avoid a swathe of emigration, the future is bright. “There is enough talent within our club,we can get over the next few years, to win something at another level, whatever grade that might be.” When Gavin Conwell lted the Ulster Cup on a magical  night in Omagh, he called for a gathering the next day in the clubhouse. So all the young weans could see all the cups. It sounded impulsive, but it wasnt. It was time to strike when the iron was hot. A decade on, those youngsters are now the tools to build Craigbanes next team to challenge for a championship.

Through the minors,he was corner forward, but after Leo Gormley hung up the number three senior jersey, Moore stepped into the berth he would hold during Craigbanes golden era.An influx of young players came through, inspired by the teams of the s.“Everybody came in around the same age and everybody was battling for places then.” Fergal remembers.“A lot of the young boys in thephotographs, or that were mascots were now breaking into the senior team,” adds Conrad McGuigan, who was named as  senior captain.“Boys were saying I want to play with our senior team and it was a spur for the parish.”Gerard McLaughlin, Conrad McGuigan, Kieran and Eddie McElhinney, Kevin and Fergal Moore gave a solid spine of experience.“The boys who came in, Alfie Dallas, Jude Dooley , Damien and Gary McLaughlin, they all had pace.At that stage, we wouldve given anybody in the countya good game for it,” McGuigan stresses.By the end of the decade and up in senior football, they clapped county champions Bellaghy on the pitch before drawing a game they couldve won.Later that year, only for uncharacteristic slip from Kieran McElhinney on a wet night, to allow a  to slip to the net, they had Ballinderry beaten before their   All-Ireland campaign even got off the ground.The whirlwind story began against Banagher in the  final.First of all, they needed to survive a storming Limavady comeback in the semi-final and Craigbane were lucky to hang on for a replay, which they navigated without any fuss.“It was a wake up call for us going into the final,” McGuigan states.Banagher had only been relegated from the first ision, and were billed as favourites.The cream against the second ision team.“There were families with cousins involved in both clubs and the rivalry was unreal.A lot of us grew up in Craigbane and had moved back into the new housing developments in Park,” he adds.After the influx, it raised the contentious issue...was Park in Banagher or in Craigbane In the league, Banagher had won close gamesbetween the clubs and it was little surprise when an attendanceof nearly , flocked to Drum for the final.“We knew it would take a good display from them to beat us,” Conrad continues.“We were a hard team to beat when the championship came along.Self belief was starting to seep into the team and you felt you were never going to lose.“Another influence at the time was Paddy Cassidy, who wouldve been Derry Citys fitness trainer.Francie Deeney, who was managed the team with Eddie McElhinney, got him in.“It was a new voice and it was a more dedicated approach to training and it all just started to gel.”Within minutes of the throw-in, Gavin Conwell had blood gushing out of his nose and Craigbane had a penalty, which McGuigan missed.Eddie McElhinney, who came on for Conwell, slipped home a th minute goal to put them in the driving seat.Banagher lost Patrick ODonnell to a shoulder injury and when McGuigan tagged on three points, Craigbane were on track for victory.“It was close in the end, but it didnt reflect our superiority,” McGuigan adds.Banagher grabbed a late goal, but Craigbane held on for a - to - win and title number four.“I just remember the supporters going mad and streaming onto the pitch after the game,” was Fergal Moores memory of winning the game.“Going into those games, at that time, there was excitement, you knew there wasnt going to be much in it and everything was left on the pitch.”“The boys went over to Farahsafter the game and probably drunk the place dry,” McGuigan recalls.“It wouldve have been the main place,.The craic was great and there was always a Monday club,” Fergal Moore adds.There were no trips back to Tyrone on county final nights.*** DROP CAPITAL ***The  chapter was dferent.Craigbane were in five finals and lost all five by a point.In the same week of the Dr Kerlin Cup defeat to Banagher, they overturned the result to beat them in the championship, before going down to Faughanvale in a replay.

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

Manager John McEvoy has stated he will respect the club window and is happy his players will be getting three or four games, to help their preparation for a showdown with Down. Feargal McGill. Director of Club, Player and Games Administration, told the County Derry Post of their plans for the unplayed league games. “It is definitely our intention to finish the leagues, the league finals in hurling and the remaining two rounds in football,” he commented. Derry hurlers are unbeaten so far this season, thanks to a late Conor Kelly point in their - to - draw against Kildare on Sunday, March . They will play Down in the Division B promotion final, hoping to go one better than last years defeat to Wicklow. googletag.cmd.push In football, Rory Gallaghers senior squad would need results to all fall for themthey were to gain promotion from Division . Derry, on five points, are two points behind Down and Longford. They would need Paddy Tallys men to lose both games to bottom of the table Leitrim and Louth. Derry hurling boss McEvoy also admitted that preparations after the lay-off will be a challenge. “We had a decent league and we were happy with the progress. We brought seven new guys into the setup. They added a lot to it,” he told the County Derry Post. McEvoy also felt that the break gave injured quartet Paddy Kelly, Mark Craig, Eamonn McGill and Darragh McCloskey time to recover, while he hopes they can get through the -week club championship period unscathed. googletag.cmd.push “We are going to respect the club window,” he stressed. ”All the players are going to be playing a lot of matches. Thankfully they are going to be getting three or four matches each, before they get into semi-finals and finals. “We have to look at this as a positive, they will be back hurling and their club managers will be working with them in terms of hand to eyeand doing lots of ball work. “When we get the green light in mid-September, well start back working with them and looking forward to that. It will be a short lead into the league final but there is nothing we can do with it.” This weeks release is also expected to have dates for the ious championships, including the Christy Ring Cup. “Im hearing dferent things about Joe McDonagh and Christy Ring, that they are going knock-out,” McEvoy stated. “Given the window, that wouldnt surprise you and that can go with you or against you. “I think they would play the threematches and thats what wed prefer, but at this stage I just dont know.” RELATED- Derry hope to make championship draws this weekMore...

With handsanitiserat the door to every store, one-way systems, contactlesspayment, and limits on customernumbers, the new normal might take a while to get used to. Around half the shops in Foyleside Shopping Centre were open on Tuesday morning, with Dunnes Stores attracting the biggest crowds. Staff in Marks and Spencers and Boots, which have remained open throughout the pandemic, were glad to see a bit more hustle and bustle in the centre And with sales on in Debenhams, Dunnes and Marks and Spencer, many shoppers remarked on how happy they were to be out spendingagain. googletag.cmd.push But while the shops are open, cafes and coffee shops in the shopping centres remain closed for now. Mary McLaughlin, who hasnt been shopping in the city centrein over three months, said shewas glad to be back. This is my first day back up the town and Im all hyper with it, she said. I havent been up thetown since way beforeSt Patricks Day Its been awful not being able toget up the town, butas long as we are all healthy thats the main thing. Its just great to get out again. Ive been looking forward to it. Self-confessed shopaholic Geraldine Deery has been yearning for the social side of shopping. googletag.cmd.push Im ashopaholic and its been drivingme crazy, she said. I missed going up the town and meeting people and having a chat. And I really miss going in for a cup of coffee with my sister. Ive gone abit crazy buying things, Im making up for losttime of the weeks I missed. The management at Foyleside, The Richmond Centre and Debenhams have clearly put a lot of timeand effortinto establishingand marking out one-way systems and there are plenty of signs in place reminding people to keep to the two metre social distance rule. You do be a bit nervous because youre looking at the floor, trying to make sure you are going the right way, said Mrs McLaughlin. Everything is well spaced out and the floors are all marked out. Although Im glad I came out early because its quiet at the minute. Derrys small independent retailers are also slowly getting back to business after getting the go ahead this week, David Thomas, whose jewellery shop and workshop Thomas Goldsmith has operated from Pump Street for over  years, has been surprised that some of his fellow small traders havent reopned yet.  Ive just been for a walk round and Ive noticed that a large number of small independents arent openat the minute. This is the second dayinto it and they are taking their time to get back to work. Maybe thats their own choice. It surprisedme because to rebuild businessagain is important. For a lot of them who have furloughed staff and who are self employed as it were and are receiving payments they are thinking I wont risk it because theres a safety net there. But obviously that safety net is going to start disappearing. Business has been quite slow this week, but MrThomas is hopeful that shoppers will be back. We arecompleting the work we werent able to complete in March after the guillotine came down and we werent able to finish. And then we were hit by problems in the supply chain but that has started to ease up. In the last two weeks it has relaxed and things are filtering thoughnow. Were now able to complete things we should have done in March so weve stillgot that momentum from then, but in terms of work coming through its going to be a bit slow. There are a lot of people are being made redundant or who havent been able to claim grants and things like that. But on the other hand there are people who were furloughed and had to stay at home and werent able to spend money and they should have a fairly healthy bank account and they are desperate to get out and buy stuff. Mr Thomas has made changes to the way the shop operates in order to comply with the new regulations. Only one customer is admitted at a time, staff are usingfacemasks and hand sanitiser, and jewellery that has been tried on is being cleaned before it goes back on th shelf. People are understanding and respectful, remarked Mr Thomas. He feels that lockdown has given people time to reflect on their work le balance and lestyle. People are saying it will never be the same, he said. We were all chasing our tails a bit, workingvery hard. Does it have to be like that  Can we take things a bit easier  Do we have to be rushing off to Portugal on cheap flights  It has been strangeto sit at home in the garden and look up and see the skies totally clear. Many of Derrys charity shops have also reopened their doors, with Oxfam, Kinship Care, the Red Cross and Cancer Focus back in businessearlier this week. However, the three month closure has meant some stores are struggling with low stock levels. Deborah Tracey is the manager at Cancer Focus on Shipquay Street, which opened in May .  The shop reopened last Friday after a week of cleaning and preparation and have been busy ever since. Inside there is hand sanitiser at thedoor and a one-waysystem in place. Most people have been using the hand sanitiser before they come in, said Ms Tracey. We have been busy with people bringing stuff in and buying stuff too. People seem to feel confident coming out to shop now and theyare glad toget back to a bit of normality. Cancer Focus has amanager and deputy manager but all the other staff are volunteers. Some of our volunteers have been worried about coming back because they are older and more at risk, said MsTracy. So weare lookingfor newvolunteers now. We provide everyonewith shields, masks and gloves for their safety. Cancer Focus has also launched an appeal for donations. Any donations to the shop must be quarantined for  hours when we receive them, said Ms Tracy. We are looking for donations of clothes, bric-a-brac, shoes, bags and books. If you would like to make a donation to Cancer Focus or to enquire about becoming a volunteer telephone .

At present, hospitality businesses have to adhere to strict licensing laws in terms of serving outdoors. However, local councils have been encouraged by the Northern Ireland Executive to take a flexible approach to the situation to support the sector as it emerges from the coronavirus lockdown. Derry City and Strabane District Council is currently looking at ways it can help local businesses. They have launched a short survey asking for peoples opinions on the matter. The survey can be filled in here -https:bit.ly eohTnm googletag.cmd.push A council spokesperson said: The hospitality and retail industries have been some of the hardest hit in terms of lost revenue during COVID-. They will also be one of the last to fully emerge from the lockdown. With the impact of the pandemic and the resulting social distancing measures that must continue when businesses reopen it is essential that we start to reimagine how theservice industries can adapt and operate in the current circumstances.New business models and taking hospitality and trade outdoors will play a signicant part in the survival of the service industry locally. Using private and public spaces such as pavements, car parking spaces and events spaces such as Guildhall Square, Waterloo Place and the Canal Basin in Strabane could be part of the solution. googletag.cmd.push To achieve this, Council and key stakeholders including Department for Infrastructure and the Department for Communities will be adopting a flexible approach that seeks to facilitate innovation - whilst ensuring appropriate controls such as Insurance, disability access, enforcement and public health are in place.

Baby Michael MacHugh shocked his mum Sara and dad Conall in January of this year by arriving  weeks early. His parents were told that he had a % chance of survival. Michael ended up having to spend  weeks in hospital. During this time, Tinyle, a charity which supports families of premature babies, was a vital help to Sara and Conall. Michael is now at home and doing well but his family were keen to raise money for Tinyle. googletag.cmd.push Michael’s uncle Caolan , his dads identical twin, agreed to shave off his fair to support the charity.  Caolans friend, Owen Brady, also agreed to so the same thing, and, between them, the two men have managed to raise more than pound, for the charity. Michaels mum said it had been dficult time for their family. “Michael was born on th January  at  weeks + days gestation,  weeks early, weighing just lb oz. “He is now over lb at  weeks old. “His due date was th of April . Michael was born in Altnagelvin at .am and transferred to The Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast at pm that same day. googletag.cmd.push “He spent five and a half weeks in the Royal where he received four of his five blood transfusions and spent the last seven and a half weeks back in Altnagelvin, where he got his last blood transfusion. “During this hospital stay I was also told that a baby born at  weeks has a % survival rate, defying all the odds Michael is with us now, thankfully a happy healthy  week old. “He is smaller than other babies his age and developmentally has some catching up to do but he is a little fighter.” Sara said Tinyle had been a great support to them. “During our stay in hospital TinyLe were a huge support and continue to be there for us, by way of thanks we wanted to raise funds for the charity and so lockdown presented the perfect opportunity. “As lockdown has rolled on Michael’s uncle Caolan, his dads identical twin became increasingly in need of a visit to the barbers, we used this to our advantage and challenged Caolan to a head shave. “Caolan’s friend Owen Brady also braved the shave,” she added. “Our family and friends rallied their support and I’m delighted to say we have raised over pound, for for TinyLe.” Valerie Cromie, Head of Fundraising for TinyLe , said the funds raised would be put to good use. “We are greatly indebted to the MacHugh family for their generosity and to Caolan and Owen who were brave enough to take on the head shave challenge. “Funds raised will ensure families who experience the birth of a premature baby receive the practical and emotional support they need.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Patricia McCallion, who shot to fame on dating show Pretty Single, said she has used her unexpected down time to reboot and put the finishing touches to her first hair care range. I really enjoyed having that time to myselfand spendingtime with my daughter, but now that we can reopen Im very excitedto get back to work, she said. Pretty Single brought togethersix gorgeous single women who agreed to be stripped of their make-up before going on a series of blind dates. googletag.cmd.push  Patricia won the public over on the show with her bubbly personality and natural good looks and although she didnt manage to find love she says she has found friends for le. I still chat to my final two fellas on the show but its on a friendship basis, she said. I did go on a second and thirddate with Martin the barber, but I realised we are more like friends. I talk to the girls every single day though. Theres notmany times you get a group of girls togetherand everyone justgets on so well. Everybody is buying each othercards and presents on their birthdays- its lovely. googletag.cmd.push Since taking part in the show, Patricia has embraced a more natural look. I think Ive found lovely new friends and Ive found myself too, she said. I havent worn make-up in three weeks. I wouldnthave gone out the door before without running a make-up brushover my face. Itwas just the norm, like brushing my teeth. So its been very liberating. Earlier this month, Patriciafulfilled her lelong dream of launching her own hair care products, which are named Glam after her salon in Waterloo Street. It features two luxurious ranges SOS and Peyton, named after her  -year-old daughter. I started hairdressing at  and after Peyton was born working and being successfulwas all for her, she explained. I wanted her to be proud. Patricia was able to use lockdown to put the finishing touches to the range and she is delighted with the finished products. Getting to make the products was so educational but there was so much work involved in it, she admitted. Im so thankful that I had that time to properly work on it because I never thought it would be that stressful. I was nervous about it, but I have learnt to trust in myself. My clients trust that when I bring out a product I will have trialled it and tested it on myself and I have been doing hairdressing so long that I know what works.

Dean O’Neill, from Drumsurn, died suddenly last week and mourners at his funeral yesterday heard how the news had left the community in shock. “The church would be absolutely packed todaythings were normal,” said Fr Seamus Kelly, officiating at the funeral. “The tragic news that spread throughout the area on Thursday morning stunned the whole community. “He was one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge in Drumsurn in recent years and it was lovely to see all the young people with their shirts on as his remains were being carried in.” googletag.cmd.push  Dean, known around the community as ‘Floater’, excelled on the sports field and Fr Kelly described him as ‘one of the most gted sportsmen to emerge from Drumsurn in recent years’. In the colours of St Patrick’s College, Dungiven, he was outstanding and won a Derry vocational schools’ All-Star award in . He represented St Matthew’s GAC and Kevin Lynch Hurling Club and carried his talent with modesty. Fr Kelly recalled how he deflected praise after a notable victory at minor level. “He covered every blade of grass in defence and attack but didn’t want any great glory,” he told the congregation. googletag.cmd.push “When Drumsurn and Drum amalgamated as St Patrick’s at minor level a few years ago, he gave an exhibition of football as he dragged his team back into contention and eventually saw them defeat Glenullin having been nine points down at half time. “He declared humbly, ‘sure Micheacuteal Archibald deserves praise more than me’. He loved sport and played Gaelic, soccer, hurling and basketball with distinction for the school.”  Dean in the colours of Kevin Lynch Hurling Club. Off the pitch, Fr Kelly told mourners how Dean had a great sense of fun and spoke of his great love for his family and friends. “He tortured friends and relations with pranks and jokes. He was very close to all his cousins and friends and kept in touch with them,” he said. “When his brother, Justin, go married, he was best man for him and was godfather to their first child, Taylor. He absolutely doted on her, as indeed he did on all his nephews and nieces. “I know how proud Justin and Jordan were of their brother Dean, but they all have wonderful memories as have Gertie, Rory and wider family and friends. “He met a lovely girl in Amber and it looked like they would settle down for good. Of course, he was not known as Dean, it was just ‘Floater’ to all his friends who loved him so much. “In recent times, he had settled a lot and went to live in Dungiven, although, he always insisted, he was a Drumsurn man.” Fr Kelly spoke of the great sadness within the community following his passing. “I’m well aware that Drumsurn is in a state of mourning, as Dean was so well-known and loved here,” he said. “However, we have a promise that death is not the end, but another step on the journey to eternal le. “Everyone who knew him, or even met him, loved him. He had an amazing personality that endeared him to all and had a relentless sense of fun. “To young and old, he was a legend. It has been the most common remark uttered over the past few days. What a character.”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The funding is part of the Departments Major Capital Works Programme which will see nine schools in total benefit from improvements to their sites. St Patricks College, Maghera, and St Conors College, Kilrea and Clady are the two County Derry schools who will receive funding. Speaking today in the Assembly, Education Minister Peter Weir said the investment showed the Department was planning for the future. Improving the schools’ estate is one of my priorities and in the current unprecedented and dficult times, he said. googletag.cmd.push I hope this will send a strong signal to the local construction industry and local communities that the Department of Education is planning for the future and is committed to supporting the local economy and the wider community through the delivery of our capital programme. My Department’s capital programme aims to ensure that all our young people are educated in school facilities which are safe, secure and fit-for-purpose, enabling them to receive the quality education experience required to help them to fulfil their potential. St Conors College had been operating over two sites, in Kilrea and Clady, and principal Aine Bradley says the funding will help the transition to one site. googletag.cmd.push Our school community is thriving - since September  we have been living, learning and excelling together in the classroom and on the sports field, she said. Coming together in one building will give our school community even greater opportunity and a common goal. Our pupils will finally have access to the state of the art facilities and resources they deserve. I want to say thank you to the Governors, Staff, Pupils and School Communities in Kilrea and Clady for your patience, support and steadfast belief that we could achieve greatness together. Mid Ulster MLA Patsy McGlone welcomed the inclusion of St Patricks College, Maghera in the Departments plans. I have been in regular contact with St Patricks College, Maghera on the need for improvements to the school estate over recent years. I have had visits with Department officials, the school principal, the chair of the board of governors and Councillor Martin Kearney on site to see the school facilities. While the major capital works projects for St Patrick’s College will now progress to the design stage, work will not likely commence until the   financial year. When completed, pupils and staff at St Patrick’s College will benefit from the provision of modern, fit-for-purpose facilities.

Castledawson man Joe O’Kane posted a photograph online last week revealing a message his son had discovered while working on his aunt’s house in the Ballymena area. The message, decoratively presented in a sketched scroll, read: “Papered by Jack Kerr, King St Magherafelt. Painted by Joe Hughes of Moneyglass. The message also states that the named final member of the decorating crew done sweet f**k all! Jack Kerr was a painter who lived in King Street in the town and worked at the time for Seamus Keenan of Castledawson. He also ran a shop for a period on the street where he lived. googletag.cmd.push  Jack Kerrs shop on King St in Magherafelt. His brother, Dermot, said the practice of leaving a message was common. “That was a favourite thing to do down the years,” he told the County Derry Post. “I mind working in the Rectory in Magherafelt when I was at the painting too away in ’. Reverend McGonagle was coming in. “I came on a boy’s name from Aghagaskin, Surgenor I think it was, and it was written way before the turn of the century.” The practice led to Dermot making a remarkable discovery of coincidence as he peeled back some wallpaper in the late s. googletag.cmd.push “I was working on a job near the Loup – they were doing repairs and I was doing the painting for it. I started digging off the wallpaper in the hall of this farmhouse,” he said. “It was big, respectable farmhouse, about  acres. I wasn’t there an hour until I came across names on the ceiling, under the ceiling paper. “It was my father’s name. I was doing the job on Monday, May  in  and I came on my father’s name from May , .” Jack Kerr, second from the right in this  ODonovan Rossa Old Crocks team. The Kerrs were also a musical family, with one particular instrument appealing to the brothers. “Jack played the trumpet and saxophone and his brother Desmond played the saxophone and clarinet. Another brother, Albert, in Castledawson, played the saxophone too,” said Dermot. “Jack played in the Northern Swing Orchestra and they were always on that pantomime in the town, but it stopped in  when Fr Owen died. “I started with the brass band when I was  in the town, an independent brass band, but then I started to play football and forgot about the brass band.” Dermot Kerr was also able to shed some light on the identity of his brother’s colleagues and said Leslie Hepburn did a little more than the pencilled message suggests. Joe Hughes was originally from Moneyglass but now lives in Dunloy, County Antrim, and told us about the process of leaving their mark. “You went in and stripped the wall and before you papered it, you put a scroll on it and wrote the names on it,” he said. “I would have worked with Jack at the time, but It was Seamus Keenan we worked for and that was our trademark when we were in doing them up. It’s many a house you would see that on!”  If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Reverend Katie McAteer’s appointment to the Chapter of the Cathedral Church of St Columb is one of two announced today by the Bishop of Derry and Raphoe, Rt Reverend Andrew Forster. Reverend Robert Boyd, the Rector of Glendermott and Newbuildings Parish, has also been appointed a Canon.By happy coincidence, today - the Feast Day of St John the Baptist - is the anniversary of both new canons’ ordinations. Rev Boyd and Rev McAteer will fill the positions left vacant following the departure of the Ferry brothers – Rev Canon David, who has retired, and Rev Malcolm, who has become the Rector of Agherton Parish in Portstewart. googletag.cmd.push Rev McAteer, who is the Pastoral Director of the Christ Church, Culmore, Muff and St Peter’s Group of Parishes, said she was humbled and honoured by the appointment.“When Bishop Andrew first asked me, I was totally taken aback,” Rev McAteer said. “It was never on my radar, never in a million years – or even  years – would I have expected the Bishop to ask me to accept this appointment. “St Columb’s Cathedral, probably more than any other cathedral, has been a history-maker – the first cathedral built in these islands after the Reformationplaying a leading role as a place of reconciliation – and now another brick is being laid in its rich history. googletag.cmd.push “I still keep thinking, ‘No, not me. It can’t be me.’ It’s exciting. It’s quite daunting.

I’m hoping that this is at God’s direction I can only do this in God’s strength.” While this isnew territory for Rev McAteer, the second new canon is on familiar ground. Rev Boyd, was a Canon of St Patrick’s Cathedral in Armagh until three years ago, a position he relinquished when he was appointed incumbent of the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings. He has since taken up the role of Diocesan Director of Ordinands for Derry and Raphoe. “I feel very privileged and very honoured by the appointment,” Rev Boydsaid.  “I’m extremely grateful to Bishop Andrew for having the confidence in me to appoint me to this role and for thinking me worthy of it. I think it’s an honour, too, for the Parish of Glendermott and Newbuildings, so I’m very pleased that our parishioners are also being acknowledged and recognised by the Bishop.” The installation of a new canon is a signicant and joyful occasion for any cathedral but given its uniqueness, the forthcoming Service of Installation in St Columb’s – with its historical first – will arouse considerable interest within the Church of Ireland and beyond. A date has yet to be fixed for the Service but it is hoped it will take place in the early autumn.

His book has been described in The Independent as ldquoone of the finest pieces of modern nature writing in recent years. In this extract the autistic teenager shares his joy of the natural world on a day out to Murlough with his sister and brother.OUR garden is thrumming with birds today: coal, blue and great tits, blackbird, thrush, magpie, jackdaw, rook, all of them revelling on the grass, pecking at the feeders.I could happily watch them all day but rain is coming from the east, so we decide to go west to the coast at Murlough to stay in the sunshine. I usually despise being in the sun. I find its light too bright, its heat too hot, and it can make me feel astherersquos nowhere to hide. But with this rain coming, I feel like being on the dunes at Murlough, pressed by warmth and sea breezes.The ancient dune system here is six thousand years old, fragile and spectacular. The unusually high dunes were formed in the late th and th centuries by massive storms, and were used by people in the Middle Ages as rabbit warrens to provide them with meat and pelts.Grazing rabbits encouraged the grassy heathland here, but when myxomatosis first broke out in the s, as it did in other parts of Ireland and Britain, the population was almost wiped out. With fewer rabbits, sea buckthorn and sycamore could grow, turning heath to scrubland. Now the National Trust have intervened at Murlough, managing the landscape so it reverts back to heath mdash and judging from the copious pings, it looks like the rabbits are thriving again, too.The day is sparkling, the wind is shaking and shaping the clouds. Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid want to swim, so I stroll along the beach with my binoculars. Shapes out at sea stop me: a trinity of torpedoing gannets. They swoop, wheel and suddenly drop, spiralling until the last second when they transform into arrows before hitting the water.Swallows are overhead ndash I can see their small bodies so clearly, weightless and constantly moving. I feel myself rising with them.My dark, knotted thoughts seem to be staying away at the moment. I feel as free as the gannets and swallows. If they can live their lives, shouldnrsquot I do the same  Can I breathe and live and also fight  The natural world mdash which includes us mdash is facing such enormous challenges that itrsquos easy to become overwhelmed and depressed. But we must fix them, andIrsquom no longer here, alive, I canrsquot be part of the solution.What is it thatrsquos holding me back  Anxiety  Depression  Autism  These are the shackles. Surely, I can break free. Or at least I can accept these things as part of me. I have no answers, but the lightness of these thoughts and these days weave my body and mind with everything around me. The only thing that I am really bound to is nature ndash as we all are.Lorcan and Blaacutethnaid are running towards me, and I run to them, and then we run together, exultant. We slow down in unison, all feeling the same pull of the large peculiar shells dotted around the beach. We each pick one up and hold them outstretched, delicate porcelain in our hands.They look like pale planets, pockmarked with symmetrical lines. I rattle mine, listening to the whisper of sand and the past. These are sea potatoes mdash a type of sand-burrowing sea urchin mdash with pocks that once held spines and a bleached calcium carbonate shell that could so easily shatter on land or at sea. Each one is a miracle. So many miracles washed up at once.We start to collect them and Lorcan decides to name three of the best specimens Sandy, Sam and Sandra. He holds a conversation with them, three sea potatoes, which makes us laugh so hard that tears well up and almost flow, and wersquore still laughing as a warm rain starts to fall on us.Under dark skies, I feel completely unburdened of any doubts in my own abilities to help our planet. Instead, I feel energised and ready. Sopping wet and cold and with chattering teeth, still giggling madly, I feel hope pouring in the rain. Being myself is enough.Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Tollerand can be bought online, or at No Alibis bookshop in Belfast..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"A lifetime of capturing Ireland’s scenic beauty  ","story":"AMATEUR photographer Chris Laverty spent a letime capturing Irelandrsquos scenic beauty.The former Queenrsquos University computer centre manager travelled extensively, always with his camera, and always with an eye for the magic of the countryside around him.

As we work to do so, our absolute priority will be to keep our patients, service users and staff safe. the statement adds.The health trustrsquos insistence that emergency services will be restored at the Downe comes ahead of a meeting with a Sinn Fein delegation to discuss the issue.Spearheaded by South Down MP, Chris Hazzard, the delegation will be seeking assurances that all services will be restored to their previous level.Ahead of the meeting, Mr Hazzard said that due to the pandemic, the local community was left without access to vital services at the Downe due to the health systemrsquos response to coronavirus which ldquorequired what amounted to extraordinary measures for an extraordinary time.The MP said the Downe was left ldquounrecognisable as emergency and outpatient services, amongst others, closed from the end of March.ldquoWhere required, all available staff and equipment from these units was also requisitioned for use in other parts of the South Eastern Trust area, he continued.ldquoIn agreeing to the radical reconfiguration of the Downe, the community made a big sacrice in order to accommodate the unprecedented demands made by both health trusts in the fight against Covid-.Insisting that it was the right thing to do at the right time, Mr Hazzard said there is now an onus on trust management to respond in kind to the community.He said the recently published recovery plans have delayed the restoration of vital services to the community, causing signicant concern amongst many who fear that ldquotemporary closure might inevitably mean permanent removal.Mr Hazzard said the Sinn Fein delegation will be calling for the full restoration of services at the Downe and will also be meeting with the chief executive of the Southern Trust to call for services removed from Newryrsquos Daisy Hill hospital to be reinstated.Rowallane DUP councillors are also demanding the full restoration of services at the Downe Hospital, highlighting the importance of reopening the emergency department as soon as possible.Cllr Billy Walker said it was ironic that within hours of confirmation that the Downpatrick ED would not reopen at this stage, the South Eastern Trust revealed via social media that the Ulster Hospitalrsquos emergency department was extremely busy.ldquoThis is nothing new, he declared. ldquoThere is a clear need for the Downersquos emergency department to reopen now. Having this facility available can help ease the pressure on other EDs and we cannot understand why there is not increased investment in Downpatrick.ldquoWe all understood the temporary closure of services at the Downe to allow health chiefs to respond to the global pandemic, but the time for those services to be reinstated is now.

However, bearing in mind the scheme is all but shovel ready, this should be a simple case of signing the commencement orders with construction starting as soon as possible.Mr Hazzard said the roads minister has a capital budget of more than poundm to be spent this year, suggesting that very few projects are as advanced as the Ballynahinch bypass.ldquoThere is no logical reason why this long overdue project canrsquot get the green light for construction as a matter of priority, he said.The MP added: ldquoIn light of the severe economic impact of Covid- and the ongoing Brexit uncertainty, the commencement of this scheme would be a welcome step towards improving both our local economy and the wellbeing of our community..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Darragh Cross residents bring cheer to local residential home  ","story":"RESIDENTS from Oakland Court in Darragh Cross made the most of the lockdown by having socially distanced nights of entertainment while helping the residents of a nearby residential home.From hosting fun events such as bingo and discos, they raised pound for Willowview Residential Home in Saintfield.Oakland Court residents would like to thank Darragh Crossrsquo Vivo shop for its donation of prize hampers and everyone who donated prizes and gts.In turn, all residents and staff of Willowview Residential Home would like to say pay their gratitude to to all the residents of Oakland Court and Darragh Cross Vivo for their kindness and thoughtfulness..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"DNA testing on dog dirt  ","story":"SENIOR Newry, Mourne and Down Council officers say they will need time to research the issue of using DNA testing on dog dirt in a bid to trace animals which are allowed to use public areas as open air toilets.Members of the local authorityrsquos Neighbourhood Services Committee will discuss the issue at their virtual meeting later today.A motion on the issue tabled by Rowallane councillor Patrick Brown at the March meeting of the full council was referred to the local authority committee for discussion.Dog dirt poses a major health risk, especially to children, who could potentially lose their sight as a result of coming into contact with it.Cllr Brown said there was a need to consider innovative ways of tackling the issue which has been raised on a regular basis by elected representatives across the local authorityrsquos seven DEAs.He is keen for the local authority to investigate the viability of using DNA testing in a bid to identy offenders and aid enforcement officers to dish out fines.Cllr Brown is also eager for council officials to draw upon best practice from other councils who have introduced such a scheme in a bid to crack down on the dog fouling issue.In addition, he wants the local authority to roll out what he has described as an ldquoenhanced public awareness campaign focusing on the dangers of dog fouling.Ahead of tonightrsquos council meeting, officers are recommending that Cllr Brownrsquos motion is agreed to allow them time to research similar schemes which have been introduced where.In addition, officers say that they will need to understand the time and resources required to implement such a scheme locally beforereporting back to the council committee.Politicians, who have previously asked for more enforcement staff to be deployed across the district to deal with the dog fouling problem, say the highly contentious issue is one of the single most complained about problems in the area.They say that despite valiant efforts over recent years by council officials and others, the issue has not been adequately addressed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Drive in assembly at Crossgar primary school  ","story":"CEDAR Integrated Primary School in Crossgar has said farewell to its P pupils.Staff held a drive-in leavers ceremony for the outgoing P class last Friday.Parents and carers were invited to park in the playground and watch the  pupils receive folders of their work from their time at Cedar.They also received a survival kit for lsquobig schoolrsquo, as well as trophies for sports, arts and ICT,.

However, all facilities will close at pm.Within the next two weeks, additional council toilet facilities will reopen at three locations in Newcastle mdash Castle Park, Central Promenade and South Promenade, with council-owned toilets at Spelga Dam also set to reopen.The council says it is reopening toilet blocks between am and pm as part of a ldquophased approach balancing service provision, resources and the health and safety of the public and local authority staff.The organisation says that reopening public toilets will increase the districtrsquos tourist offering, confirming that work is underway to open additional toilet blocks on a phased basis with the hope to have as many as possible open at the height of the summer.But a warning has been issued that the reopening plan depends upon available resources to ensure that all facilities are serviced to the standard required.ldquoIt is vital to provide facilities that are maintained to a level that mitigates the risk of cross-contamination and possible transfer of Covid- among members of the public, said a council spokesman.Council officials say the measures taken to reopen public conveniences include increased frequency of cleansing and inspection, social distancing and hand washing signage and hand sanitisers provided outside each facility.In addition, the local authority says that its plan to reopen all public conveniences across the district will be continually reviewed..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Removal of statue is ‘ridiculous’  ","story":"CALLS for the removal of a statue in west London in honour of one of Killyleaghrsquos most famous sons have been branded ldquoridiculous by a local politician.The statue of Sir Hans Sloane is included on a list of monuments that should be removed over his perceived links to slavery.Activists from the Black Lives Matter movement want the statue in honour of Sir Hans removed, while a campaign has been launched to replace it with a tribute to former Cha footballers Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Eidur Gudjohnsen.It is Sloanersquos marriage to Elizabeth Rose mdash the daughter of a wealthy slave planter in Jamaica ndash bringing him a one-third share of the net profits from her fatherrsquos vast plantations, which has put him on the list of Black Lives Matters campaigners.In addition, campaigners want to rename streets named after Sir Hans in the highly fashionable Knightsbridge area such as Sloan Square because he derived part of his wealth from his slave owner father-in-law who owned plantations in Jamaica.The collections of Sir Hans Sloane helped found the first museum in the world - the British Museum - and he was personal physician to three dferent English monarchs. He was also famous for discovering milk chocolate.Born in Killyleagh on April , , Sir Hans died in Cha in , aged  and described as the worldrsquos greatest collector who, from his earliest years, catalogued and carefully encased every artefact that he found.Over the years he accumulated nearly , items many of which today are on display in the British Museum.Close to the picturesque harbour in Killyleagh stands a copy of the London statue in honour of Sir Hans with a local councillor branding the campaign to take down the statues in the capital as ldquoridiculousCllr Billy Walker insists that the pioneering physician was not a slave trader and that the clamour for many statues to be taken down was becoming ldquosilly, urging the Government to show some backbone on the matter.He said Sir Hans was ldquorevered in his home town where people were proud to have a copy of the statue to a man who did so much for the world.Cllr Walker continued: ldquoSir Hans gave us the concept of free museums, found a cure for smallpox and pioneered science and medicine to do away with magic for treating illness.ldquoHe also promoted the use of quinine against malaria, discovered milk chocolate and was the first man to lead both Royal Colleges. Sir Hans also treated the poor for free and was no slave trader.Cllr Walker said Sir Hans left Killyleagh for London when he was  where he studied chemistry, before deciding on a career in medicine, qualying in France and ing to London.He was subsequently appointed as the personal physician to the governor of Jamaica and it was there that he discovered drinking chocolate.When he ed to England, Sir Hans was able to market his find and Cadburyrsquos promoted this drink for many years.Cllr Walker said that Sir Hans, who has a centre named after him in his home town, encouraged inoculation against ious diseases and for  years was President of the Royal College of Surgeons and a Fellow and hard working secretary of the Royal Society for many years.ldquoWe in Killyleagh are rightly very proud of Sir Hans and his links with our town, he continued.The councillor added: ldquoI hope that his statue in London will remain in place as he was a man of great distinction which is evidenced by the fact that there is now a centre dedicated to him in his home town. Killyleagh is fiercely proud of Sir Hans and his achievements..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Restoration of emergency services at Downe must be top priority  ","story":"THERE is substantial disquiet within our community concerning the future of the emergency department at Downe Hospital.The time is now long overdue for the South Eastern Trust to confirm that its intention is to restore our emergency department service to its pre-Covid- level and to provide a firm indication of the date on which it believes that that will happen.Clearly, that date cannot be far into the future.Downe Hospital has played a crucial role in the emergency response to the Covid- pandemic. In addition to the services directly provided at our local hospital mdash the peoplersquos hospital mdash Downe staff were redeployed to other healthcare facilities andcontributed enormously to the NHS effort.When the emergency planning was taking effect, it was the clear understanding of many local political and community representatives, that the emergency department service would be restored immediately upon the conclusion of the pandemic.Whilst there is clearly a signicant possibility of a so-called second surge in infections mdash and we are all aware as to just how serious such a second surge could be mdash at the same time there is increased normalisation of health provision across the North.The restoration of the urgent care service previously provided at the Downe must be a top priority as part of this normalisation. It should have been included in the June action plan, published by the health trust last week.Just last week, as attendances were increasing at the remaining emergency departments, including at the Ulster Hospital, it was apparent that existing facilities are and will be unable to cope with demand.During the Covid emergency planning, decisions were taken to temporarily close the emergency departments at the Downe, Daisy Hill and the Mater hospitals.Just last week, trade union representatives received categorical assurances from the Southern Trust about the re-opening of about Daisy Hill Hospital. Similar assurances are now required about the Downe.There is also a signicant impetus gathering now for the implementation of restructuring of healthcare services generally, and of urgent care in particular, across Northern Ireland.Decisions about the future of healthcare, particularly urgent care, afford an excellent opportunity to redress health inequalities that have arisen and been perpetuated by the historic under investment in the health service by successive governments and by the pursuit of centralisation policies.Many people believe that those centralisation policies played a crucial role in leaving us facing into a pandemic with insufficient hospital beds, insufficient intensive care beds, insufficient ambulance cover, insufficient ventilators and insufficient healthcare workers.Any change to emergency and urgent care provision is only permissible where it happens with the consent of the people.In the final analysis, decisions about the allocation of healthcare resources are political decisions taken by politicians, elected by the people and not by bureaucrats. Tiers and levels of bureaucracy make no dference to where ultimate responsibility lies.I have a great deal of sympathy for the recently appointed health minister, Robin Swann, who within a few weeks of his appointment, found himself facing the biggest public health emergency in the history of the National Health Service.I would respectfully suggest that Mr Swann should insist upon the criteria for change stated by Michelle OrsquoNeill when she was Health Minister.The now Deputy First Minister stated in November  that local people should be at the centre of decision-making processes in designing and delivering services. The , people who marched through Downpatrick in support of the Downe Hospitalin the Love the Downe Rally on February , , would certainly agree with that.As far back as , Dr Michael McBride, speaking at the sod cutting ceremony for the new Downe Hospital, said that ldquothe emphasis would be on making the health system respond to the patient rather than the patient to the system. I concur with that.In the Down Recorder of November , , after the publication of the Bengoa Report, Michelle OrsquoNeill was quoted as saying: ldquoWe will deliver care and support in the most appropriate settings, ideally in peoplersquos homes and communities.Again, I would concur with that.If there is to be a change in urgent care provision across Northern Ireland, no one can expect to be immune from that change. At the same time, change would only be possible or acceptableit is to create a better service for all of the people and a fair and equitable distribution of services.Many people in this area believe that we have had a very raw deal for over  years from the health service and some politicians.It sometimes seems to be forgotten that the National Health Service is free at the point of use, but it is certainly not without cost. It is the people who pay for it.Rural communities have particular characteristics and needs that must be addressed, in terms of at the most basic, accessibility to services. Like everyone , they have rights.Access to healthcare is a right, not a privilege.If it is to be the case that urgent care is being restructured, citizens in rural areas which, for this purpose, includes virtually anyone outside the Greater Belfast area, cannot be expected to forego services so that Belfast can continue to enjoy a proleration of emergency services, with not one but two Type  emergency departments on the scale of that at the Ulster Hospital, on its overdeveloped and cramped site, the Royal Victoria Hospital and the Mater, with the Type  unit at the Lagan Valley hospital, just seven miles from Belfast, a similar distance to that travelled by the people of Ardglass to the Downe hospital.Of course, Type  emergency departments are also to be found at Antrim and Craigavon, neither of which are far from Belfast and are linked by the best possible road infrastructure.Logically, it would seem, that the existence of two Type  units in Belfast is not sustainable, given the apparent massive pressure on services.We were told by the Department of Health at the time of the January  public meeting in Downpatrick Cricket Club that the purpose of that meeting was to enable local people to ldquofundamentally shape, inform and influence the criteria to be used to deliver services in the future.We hope that is still the case and await meaningful engagement with the community before change is implemented.The then deputy permanent secretary was quoted as having said that the then Minister would want to see ldquoongoing engagement in redesigning services. I am sure that the current Health Minister has the same views.The challenge for the Health Minister in the future must surely be to develop a fair and equitable distribution of services that would end discrimination against rural communities and ensure that all services, including ambulance services, are readily accessible to all of the people.It is worth remembering as well, that there was actually a .%in the attendances at emergency departments in Northern Ireland between December  and December . In the same period, attendances at the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department rose signicantly.Decisions about change in the health service are political decisions. All of the major parties form the Northern Ireland Executive, which is collectively accountable for the program for government and all that it delivers or fails to deliver for the people.It is imperative that any attempt to change or restructure healthcare provision in Northern Ireland is done so in full consultation with the end users of the services, who are also the paymasters for it. This will be very dficult, as history has created a deep mistrust between substantial elements in our community and the Department of Health.Our community has suffered greatly from repeated cuts to services and the ruthless pursuit of a centralisation agenda a pursuit that has continued even in recent years when the NHS in England and Wales has been investing in and supporting smaller hospitals, recognising their crucial roles at the heart of local communities and using technological advances to support them.If it appears that Covid- is being used as a cover to implement long-standing Department of Health policy, then any changes would be resented by the community and in fact rejected by it. This would lead to an irreparable breach of trust between the people and the State.If an attempt is made to in any way reduce the services that are currently on offer at the Downe Hospital, this community, as it has done before, will rise up in righteous indignation.Twenty five thousand people took to the streets of Downpatrick in February . If our emergency department is not restored within a reasonable timescale mdash a matter of weeks mdash it is very likely that this area will see an unprecedented display of anger, with , plus people on the street, with legal challenges about any perceived abuse of process and a community-wide campaign, a cross-community campaign and political upheaval at the highest level of government.The people of East and South Down have had enough. They have reluctantly sacriced local services, as a temporary measure in the short term, but their resolve should not be underestimated.The people of Newcastle, Ballynahinch, Castlewellan, Ardglass, Killough, Clough, Downpatrick, Strangford, Crossgar, Lower Mourne and the vast surrounding rural hinterland need these services.Farmers, fishermen and builders need emergency care as much as ever, so too do the tourists who flock into our area every year and probably will do so in even greater numbers this year.It is time to restore the Downe Hospitalrsquos emergency department and it is time to concentrate investment in local services, delivering for the people who need the services, where they need those services.The NHS must serve the people from ldquocradle to grave. It is a part of the social contract between the people and those who govern them.Politicians and administrators come and go. The Downe hospital must live on, developing all the time the range of services it offers.Equality demands nothing less..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Revered servant of local cricket  ","story":"Robin Walsh remembers Alfie Linehan, the distinguished Downpatrick cricket stalwart who died last yearTHE great paradox of Alfie Linehan was to be found in his disposition on the cricket field and off it.At the crease, his was a belligerent style, hitting the ball farther than anyone , compiling his runs in a manner that kept the scorers busy. Beyond the boundary!Yet this domineering, almost bullying, approach belied one of Irish cricketrsquos truest gentlemen off it: soft-spoken, never a word that offended, never a word against him.In one of the most distinguished legacies to the local game, the late Downpatrick farmer captained the Ireland team before turning to administration in the roles of chairman and president of the Northern Cricket Union and president of the Irish Cricket Union.Yet it was where it mattered most, at the grassroots of the game, that Alfie left his indelible mark.His devotion to the Downpatrick club and its famous international ground The Meadow was boundless and le-long, from underage player to captain of the club, coach and ultimately chairman and president.He either played or captained Downpatrick in five NCU Senior League, three Senior Cup-winning sides and an Irish Senior Cup triumph along with his older brother Hugh, another talented batsman whose death at the age of  dealt a terrible blow to Alfie.In later years it was a source of great pride that Hughrsquos son, Paul, was to captain the club and daughter Anne played for Ireland.His wersquos nephew, James Cunningham, also captained the club.Alfiersquos hard-hitting ways over four decades from the s took him to  Irish appearances mdash six of them as captain mdash in the days when international caps were much less liberally awarded, and his contribution to the success of NCU representative cricket has rarely been equalled.Administration was an endless labour of love at local, provincial and national level. Such was his accommodating nature that he chaired countless committees ranging from solving an umpire shortage in the NCU to raising funds at ICU golf days.His contribution to his local community extended far beyond the boundaries of the cricket club.In his day he was a member of the NI Sports Council, a director of his local hospital trust and president of Ardglass Golf Club.Alfiersquos friends were legion, none more close than Cecil Walker, that leading light of the Lisburn club.Their playing days over, they travelled the world with their wives watching international cricket and storing delightful memories of new friendships, whether tales of the Bodyline era over tea with Harold Larwood at his home in Sydney, or a fond mention by David lsquoBumblersquo Lloyd from the commentary box.Of all thatrsquos been written down the years about Alfie Linehan, one game has been overlooked and yet it speaks more than any of his commitment to Downpatrick.It was Saturday, August , , and Downpatrick were due to play Lurgan. It was also the day of Alfiersquos wedding to his beloved Mary. No problem: wedding in the morning, cricket in the afternoon, reception in the evening, off on honeymoon the next day.Of all the tributes paid to Alfie none has been more signicant than that on BBC Televisionrsquos Sports Personality of the Year programme last December.He was included in the prestigious roll of honour of international sports personalities who had died during . The programme called them ldquospecial people.My own personal memory of Alfie will always be the toast he iniably delivered at the end of an eveningrsquos conviviality, of which there were many:ldquoMay you always walk in sunshineSlumber warm when night winds blowMay you always live with laughterFor a smile becomes you soThis article was first published on the CricketEurope website as part of a series paying tribute to those who have made signicant contributions to Irish cricket..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Traffic calming measures are needed at Castlewellan road  ","story":"TWO local Sinn Fein representatives have voiced their concern over speeding traffic on a Castlewellan road.MLA Emma Rogan and Cllr Roacuteisiacuten Howell say residents in the Burrenwood Road area have contacted them over the speed of some of the vehicles.However, they are both disappointed with the responsive their queries received from the Department of Infrastructure.Cllr Howell said that while the road met the criteria for traffic calming measures to be introduced and had been earmarked as a priority, the Department was unable to carry out the work at present.She remarked: ldquoWhile both myself and the local community welcome that Burrenwood Road has been recognised as a priority, it is extremely frustrating that due to an oversubscribed waiting list the work will not be carried out.ldquoItrsquos very annoying for us to hear the road now meets criteria but wonrsquot be completed due to it not sitting high enough on a waiting list.Cllr Howell added: ldquoThis is a disappointing response and I understand the frustration of residents.Ms Rogan said she would be contacting the Infrastructure minister to ascertain when the work will be carried out.She added: ldquoThe safety of pedestrians especially young children must be paramount..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/9th June 2020 Brexit.jpg","title":"Virtual meeting to support businesses affected by virus  ","story":"PLANS have been unveiled for a virtual meeting to help businesses across the district which have been severely hit by the coronavirus pandemic.South Down MLA Colin McGrath and Downpatrick councillor John Trainor are organising a so-called lsquotown hallrsquo event designed to offer solutions for business operations post Covid-.The event mdash which takes place next Wednesday evening on Zoom at pm ndash will feature expert advice from a number of leading figures from the business world.They include Glyn Roberts of Retail Northern Ireland and Colin Neill of Hospitality NI, who will be joined by Tourism NIrsquos chief executive, John McGrillen.Mr McGrath and Cllr Trainor want as many businesses as possible to join the June  video conference event and ask the questions that matter to them.The Assemblyman believes that itrsquos incumbent on politicians, Northern Ireland Executive ministers and MPs to fight for businesses and help develop strategies that will benefit them post-coronavirus.ldquoNext weekrsquos virtual meeting is deigned to provide these businesses with key advice so that when they all reopen, they will continue providing the first class service they have been offering, in some instances, for decades, said Mr McGrath.ldquoI have been working with our local council SDLP team in establishing a video conference call with expert figures from this sector.Mr McGrath said next weekrsquos event will outline his partyrsquos plans for how it will work with local business as everyone prepares to exit lockdown.He added: ldquoI would encourage as many businesses as possible to get in touch and wersquoll get you connected with this quickly evolving network of local business support and advice.Cllr Trainor said while the financial support offered by the NI Executive to many businesses to help them cope with the challenges of coronavirus was welcome, his party was keen to explore what would happen post Covid- and what support would be required.He added: As a result of the initial shock and upheaval caused by the pandemic, businesses have lost a great deal and some have had to shut up shop entirely.ldquoThere is much fear and concern over what will happen to the businesses that are still operating, in particular, those in the retail, hospitality and tourism sectors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11494433.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...Belfast Bank branch managers were advised in an official circular - “It is not the intention to merge the Northern Bank with the Belfast Banking Company, but as opportunities occur in the future it will be possible to effect some rationalisation to the advantage of all concerned.”Late  saw the arrival into both banks of a team from Midland Bank with the aim of bringing their systems into line with each other.On November , , staff were informed of the creation of ‘United Northern Banks Limited’ to later complete the integration of the two banks.Press advertising started the following week.On November ,  newspaper ads appeared promoting the name of ‘United Northern Banks Limited’ as ‘the big new name in Irish banking’.This holding company, registered in Northern Ireland, was to promote a gradual harmonising of methods and services, thus fostering closer co-operation between the two banks.At that stage there were  offices of both the Belfast Banking Company Limited and Northern Bank Limited.It would take until late  for their directors to decide on the name of the future organisation.A process of legal changes involving Acts of Parliament on both sides of the border would be required and then there was thenote-issuing rights that dated back to Victorian times.A separate rd company would not be able to retain the note-issuing powers currently held by both banks.A Private Bill was to be enacted in the Parliament of Northern Ireland that would allow the merger of the two banks on July ,  without the use of the third company.The Belfast Bank Executor  Trustee Company would also be merged into the Northern Bank Executor  Trustee Company at the same time. When enacted, the Bill would see the Belfast Bank branches known as ‘Northern Bank Limited, Belfast Bank Branch.’ Branch managers were advised on June  that July ,  ‘will be a happy and memorable day for all of us’.All Managers, Sub-Managers, Pro-Managers and Cashiers were to wear red carnations as ‘something eventful is happening in our bank’. An anonymous slip of paper arrived in branches and departments with the circulars the next day announcing, ‘black ties should be worn’.Northern Bank continued to trade in the whole of Ireland.Parts of Belfast and many of the towns and villages throughout Northern Ireland ended up with Northern Bank branches, sometimes beside each other!Rationalisation of branches took place over many years in areas such as AntrimBallyclareShankill Roadand Holywoodto name but a few.Branches would be merged into one site or even a brand-new site to create modern branch offices.During a financial crisis of its own the Midland Bank eventually sold the Northern Bank to the National Australia Bank, which later transferred ownership to Danske Bank.Thenote-issuing rights would again come into play. Once again, a Private Bill was considered to transfer the rights to Danske Bank but that was considered to be too expensive a plan.The decision was taken by the Directors’ to create a trading name of Danske Bank. Thus, the current bank is now known legally, and on their banknotes, as ‘Northern Bank Limited trading as Danske Bank’. Shortly after this, all the branches and offices were rebranded as Danske Bank.Many of the former Belfast Bank buildings have been sold on to other businesses. However, the name of ‘Belfast Bank’ continues to adorn a few of these old buildings, such as in Portrush, Rathfriland and Warrenpoint.Some other branches have been demolished and only photographs remain, for instance the Lisburn and Duncairn Gardens branches. And the name remains on a brass plaque, still displayed in the Royal Victoria Hospital. Marking their bank’s centenary in , staff raised £ to name a bed in perpetuity in the RVH - ‘The Belfast Bank Bed-’. In a main article headlined ‘A Notable Anniversary’ the Newsletter described the bank’s -year celebrations as “a note-worthy occasion in the history of an organisation whose fortunes have been largely bound up with the development of Belfast from a town of very moderate size to its present eminence as a great industrial port and one of the capitals of the British Empire.”\"\"Get the latest news on the CoronavirusWe have launched a daily public interest bulletin to deliver all the updates and vital information to your inboxSign Up Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportIrish League FootballWhats OnLestyleFarming LeMore from the News LetterAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsNewsletterArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policy News you can trust since Sign in\"Edit AccountSign OutSubscribeNews\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessFarmingEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoNightleRetroLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessCoronavirusFollow us \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues.

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

rescues people caught out by Bristol Channel tideOn Friday, Mr Drakeford was questioned about his governments position on non-medical coverings after a trade union representing doctors in Wales said bringing in rules would help control the spread of Covid- and save lives.Mr Drakeford told the Governments daily press briefing in Cardf: \"The context for face coverings has changed because of an announcement made yesterday in England about mandatory use of face masks on public transport.\"That will not come in until June , and that gives us a short number of days in order to consider the position here in Wales recognising that changed context.\"Mr Drakeford said a \"definitive statement\" on the issue would be made in the first part of next week, and that detailed questions about Englands new rules would be explored with ministers and officials in Westminster.But he said the UK Government had not discussed or given advanced notice of the decision with Wales, and questioned whether England was concerned with \"making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards\".\"I wish that wed had a chance to explore this with the UK Government before they made the announcements,\" he said.\"That would have allowed us to have some answers to the questions that I raised today before the event rather than after the event.\"But while on the bulk of issues we continue to be able to have discussion and co-operation in advance of decision making, in a small number of cases we hear about it only after the decision has been made.\"He added: \"Were going to have to use the time we now have to find out from them the extent to which they have got answers to these questions in advance of making the decision, or whether its a matter of making the headline, and then worrying about the detail afterwards.\"Mr Drakeford said the advice from the chief medical officer for Wales remained that wearing face masks gave people \"some marginal extra protection\" but was not sufficient to make it mandatory.\"The chief medical officer has expressed his anxieties that people might do more risky things because they think a face mask offers them protection, which it doesnt,\" Mr Drakeford said.\"But context changes because in England it is mandatory to use face masks while on public transport.\"Trains and roads between north and south Wales weave in and out of the border all the time and in a sheer practical sense, we have to think through whether having separate regimes is a possibility when you can leave on a train that starts in Wales, goes into England, comes back into Wales, goes back into England, comes back into Wales.\"Earlier on Friday the British Medical AssociationWales called on the Welsh Government to change its stance on non-medical face coverings, and ensure a supply are available to the public.The trade unions council chair for Wales, Dr David Bailey, said: \"BMA Cymru Wales advocates the wearing of face coverings by the public in areas where they cannot socially distance.\"There still remains a considerable risk of infection, and emerging evidence has shown thatmouths and noses are covered when people are in areas where they cannot socially distance, it may help in controlling the spread of infection of Covid- and therefore save lives.\"BMA Cymru Wales is calling on the Welsh Government to change their position immediately, to lessen the risk of the public spreading the virus.\"Wales main train operator, Transport for Wales, said it would \"work collaboratively\" with partners to ensure passengers were kept safe travelling across borders.A spokesman said: \"The cross-border nature of our network means that we will continue to work collaboratively with industry partners to ensure customers understand how they can travel safely as they travel between Wales and England.\"The safety of our colleagues and customers is our top priority and wed like to reinforce the message to stay local and only use public

to coronavirus crisisPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownThe campaign by the Save Dinas Powys Woods and Protect Homes from Flooding group was launched in March  after the Woodland Trust said NRW was proposing to build a dam within its site of Cwm George and Casehill Woods.The group said the proposals would involve cutting down  square metres of trees including  square metres of ancient trees and regular flooding upstream during high rainfall would result in further destruction of ancient trees, hedgerows, wildle, and plants.Dormice and other protected species like bats were at risk, the group said.The woods, much-loved by the community, attracts visitors from other areas and is the Woodland Trustrsquos most visited site in Wales with more than ,

favour of a natural flood management programmein the Cadoxton River and Eastbrook catchments, plus improved channel maintenance andrequired local hard defences, rather than an environmentally

support.Community councillor, Chris Franks said NRW must not now ignore any problems.ldquoClearly over the years there has been reduced spending on maintenance of the stream through Dinas Powys and

has spoken of the plight of rural communities during lockdown in Uganda.Three months ago, Jenipher Wetaka Sambazi, a Fairtrade coffee farmer from the Mt Elgon region in Uganda, was sharing her experiences of the benefit of Fairtrade in Penarthrsquos Tabernacle Baptist Church.More NewsVictory in campaign to save Dinas Powys ancient woodland as dam plan is abandonedVale nurse developed coronavirus symptoms after sitting with patient, inquest toldPenarth RNLI station marks  years despite current coronavirus lockdownNow she and her family, like communities around the world, are under lockdown.In March, campaigners, businesses, supporters, and students from around Wales heard Jenipherrsquos story, face to face.Now she is unable to travel or even meet with her neighbours.This means the coffee picked at the end of the last harvest remains on the mountain and Jenipher and her fellow farmers are prohibited from travelling to gather it for processing under the current lockdown rules.There are currently several hundred known cases of covid- in Uganda, but none in the Mount Elgon region and no fatalities in Uganda as yet.Farmers want to keep it this way, but lockdown is causing other concerns such as limiting access to food and healthcare.This is the time of year when there is the least amount of food available, and the closing of markets and freedom to travel for farmers to source food and water means that times are exceptionally hard.Jenipher as vice-chairwoman of a Fairtrade coffee cooperative, is responsible for many who rely on the cooperative for work.The expert hand-sorters who are seasonal workers and rely on this part of the coffee chain to feed their family at this time, have no coffee to sort.While they may have some spare eggs, vegetables or matoke to trade, the threat of soldiers prohibiting them from doing so is too much for them.Farmer co-operatives, an essential element of Fairtrade, enable and encourage communities to work together.Fairtrade also requires an extra amount of money, the Fairtrade premium, to be paid to producers.Fairtrade farmers like Jenipher are struggling, but they have the benefits of a strong local community as well as the backup of the Fairtrade premium.Fairtrade International have announced a .m euro Fairtrade Producer Relief fund targeting the immediate needs and Resilience Fund to help producers rebuild their businesses after Covid-.Jenipher Wettaka Sambazi said: ldquoLe is hard.ldquoThe markets are shut so there is nowhere to sell or earn money, or to buy food and basic essentials.ldquoLocal health centres have been shut to reduce the chance of spreading the virus, but since all transport is banned, those who need operations, treatment or antenatal care need to walk  km to the nearest hospital.ldquoTwo women and their unborn babies have died on the way.\"Roger Casey, who attends Tabernacle Baptist Church said: ldquoIt was wonderful to meet Jenipher and hear her story.ldquoWe get through a lot of coffee in our office and meeting a real coffee farmer from Uganda makes you think about the real people and real lives behind that Fairtrade logo.Vale MS Jane Hutt said: ldquoMeeting Jenipher during her visit to Wales earlier this year was inspiring.ldquoThe increasing dficulties facing rural farming communities because of the pandemic has shown how important Fairtrade cooperatives continue to be and I am glad that leaders like Jenipher continue to promote the benefits of Fairtrade and to support communities.National co-ordinator of Fair Trade Wales, Aileen Burmeister added: ldquoFair Trade producers are being impacted by covid- restrictions.ldquoGlobal stock markets are falling, meaning that farmers and workers are receiving far less for their produce.\"It is in these times that we can really see how important the Fairtrade minimum price is. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey

These include:Communication of health information, and how effective it isCultural issues relating to the suitability of health and social services for BAME communitiesIncome and employment insecurity, which is experienced disproportionately by BAME communitiesPoor quality of ethnicity data, which is preventing accurate analysisHousing overcrowding and environmentThe financial burden created by migration statusThe role of structural and systemic racism and disadvantage.The report is by the BAME Covid- expert advisory group, set up by First Minister Mark Drakeford to look at the reasons why people from BAME communities were more likely to be adversely affected by coronavirus.:One of its two sub-groups was tasked with examining the socio-economic factors, chaired by Professor Emmanuel Ogbonna, professor of management and organization at Cardf Business School, Cardf University.\"Therersquos an overall theme running through our research for this report. It centres on long-standing racism and disadvantage, and the lack of BAME representation within decision-making processes,\" said Professor Ogbonna, who is also a trustee and vice-chair of Race Council Wales.ldquoThe coronavirus pandemic is, in some respects, revealing the consequences of a lack of action on race equality.ldquoMany of the issues wersquove highlighted have been identied and discussed previously, but they havenrsquot been addressed in any systematic and sustained way.Analysis of Covid- related deaths across England and Wales by ethnicity showed that people from a black ethnic background are at a greater risk of death involving COVID- than all other ethnic groups.The Office for National Statistics study showe that the risk for black males has been more than three times higher than white males, and nearly two-and-a-half times higher for black females than white.Adjusting for socio-economic factors and geographical location partly explains the increased risk, but there remains twice the risk for black males and around one-and-a-half times for black females. Signicant dferences also remain for Bangladeshi, Pakistani and Indian men. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Despite the fact she admits she hated running, she decided to undertake a huge challenge when the lockdown started – km in  days.The -year-old wanted to do something to motivate herself, improve her emotional wellbeing and remind people that the service centre was still there for children even during the lockdown. Importantly, it would also raise much needed funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland’s Childhood Day.The service centre where Michelle works, is based at Carn Drive in Craigavon and delivers NSPCC’s Letting The Future In and Turn the Page services.Letting the Future In focuses on helping children and young people recover from the traumatic and negative effects of sexual abuse and to rebuild their lives, while Turn the Page helps children and young people overcome the experiences and feelings that have led tothem displaying harmful sexual behaviour towards others. Covid- has caused huge dficulties for the team in Craigavon because it is vital to maintain contact and the all-important relationship between the treatment workers and the young people but face-to-face contact wasn’t possible because of the lockdown. The centre has adapted to the situation by keeping in touch with appropriate apps and video calls which offer young people an opportunity to access support in their own environment but still maintain relationships with their workers.Michelle also has her own personal reasons for wanting to raise funds for NSPCC Northern Ireland.She said: “As a survivor of sexual abuse myself, I realise that the lockdown is a particularly dficult time because it can trigger traumas from the past such as the feelings of powerlessness, fear of threat to le and being ‘held captive’ by the virus through isolation and reduced connection to other people.“It can be hard to get motivated during such strange times so I decided to do something positive that would improve my overall emotional wellbeing whilst also raising money for NSPCC Northern Ireland and creating awareness of some of the work we do.“As a child I benefited from support from The NSPCC at a time when no one  believed in me and this has given me a real passion for the work I do now. It is so important that children who have been affected by child sexual abuse get all the help and support they need to help them recover and I can see that the staff at NSPCC still carry the same belief that children can and do survive the trauma of sexual abuse.”Michelle’s event has been a huge success.She said: “I have to admit, it has been tougher than I thought initially. As someone who hates running and has done very little, I think I underestimated it! However I have noticed a big improvement in my emotional wellbeing and sleep since beginning the challenge. I have definitely felt motivated by the support and all the generous donations and this has really spurred me on.“Above all, I just wanted to give something back to NSPCC as I believe I wouldn’t be where I am today without their support in the past. I also wanted to raise awareness about the taboo in our society surrounding sexual abuse and topromote our belief that children can and do recover with the right support.“Joanne McMaster, Supporter Fundraising Manager for Northern Ireland, added: “We are hugely grateful to Michelle for undertaking this wonderful fundraising initiative for NSPCC’s Childhood Day. “This is NSPCC Northern Ireland’s third Childhood Day and is taking place on June  and in the run up to the day, we are asking peopleto stand with us and support our work - there are lots of fun and simple ways toget involved. “This year, Childhood Day is encouraging the peopleto ‘Be a big kid’ and raise money to help us be here for children. This could include organising a childhood themed quiz night, getting sponsored to dress up for the day or holding a mini sports day in your back garden but in all cases, remembering to follow the latest social distancing rules. There are lots more ideas on how to get involved and suggestions for fun events on our website www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday“Funds raised by the day could not come at a better time because we are growing increasingly concerned about the number of children who will experience abuse or neglect due to the impact of coronavirus, with families struggling with lockdown, job losses and school closures. By supporting Childhood Day you are raising awareness and crucial funds to enable us to keep children and young people safe.”If you would like to contribute to Michelle’s fundraising, go to www.justgiving fundraising Michelle-Duffy For further information on how you can get support NSPCC’s Childhood Day, visit www.nspcc.org.uk childhoodday or contact the NSPCC Northern Ireland Team at northernirelandappeals@nspcc.org.uk or   .--A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

","story":"Health Minister Robin Swann has announced plans to pause the shielding advice that was issued to people ahead of the Covid- peak in Northern Ireland. From  July, subject to the rate of community transmission continuing to be low, people will no longer need to shield and should instead follow the same guidance and precautions as those considered to be generally vulnerable. That involves taking particular care when out and about - and strictly maintaining social distancing.Letters will be issued in the coming days to all those covered by shielding informing them of the planned change.Mr Swann stated: “I have been clear that shielding would not last one minute longer than it needed to. We have now reached the point where,the current trends continue, there will be no need for anyone to shield after  July. “I have listened to many of you and to the challenges you have faced during this period. I am in no doubt as to the dficulties shielding has presented for a great many people.“It is unrealistic to think these dficulties will just vanish because the need to shield has ended. That is why the letters we issue will provide details of the support which will continue to be available up to and after  July.“While my announcement today will be welcome news for many who are shielding, some will view the prospect of an end to shielding with great anxiety. I want to assure them that they should decide what to do at their own pace. Everyone will approach this situation dferently.“As is so often the case at present, this will be about weighing up the options and making informed choices. Going outside can bring some degree of potential risk but this can be mitigated and minimised by strict social distancing. Staying indoors indefinitely is not good for anyone’s mental or physical health.“Finally, I would ask everyone to be considerate as people end their periods of shielding.We should all continue to social distance, but in the coming weeks I want you to be particularly understanding of the fact you might be encountering someone who has had to stay at home for many weeks. Please be aware of this, show respect and kindness to all and keep your distance.”  addthis, Leave your commentTyrone Constitution- High Street, OmaghBT BDTel:     , ,, , ,  .jsp, , ,   , ,success:  ,  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" Order your photos n n n \" Advertise with us n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_efcbbcfbbd   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html  n n nHome n n nNews n n nCommunity Lestyle n n nNews n n nGallery n n n n nSport n n nFootball n n nGAA n n nRugby n n nGolf n n nMotor Sports n n nOther n n n n nMotors n n n \" Jobs n n n \" Classieds n n n \" Book an ad n n n \" View an ad n n n n n \" Announcements n n n \" Book an announcement n n n \" View an announcement n n n n nGallery n n nOther titles n n n \" Antrim  n n n \" Ballycastle Chronicle n n n \" Ballymena  n n n \" Ballymoney Chronicle n n n \" Coleraine Chronicle n n n \" County Down Outlook n n n \" Limavady Northern Constitution n n n \" Newry Democrat n n n \" Strabane Weekly News n n n \" Tyrone Courier n n n \" Ulster Gazette n n n n nHome Delivery n n nDigital Paper n n n n n n bannerbox_dbdbcebacfcb   n n. n n n n .remove n n n n n n n\" .html.html .  ,.vc_most_readMost Popular Stories.   , ]]  []js  d js.id  idjs.src  \"connect.facebook.net en_US #xfbmlversionv.\"fjs[],p ^http: .test http:httpsjs+: fjspo  text javascript   truepo.src  https:apis.google js plusone.js s  document[] s"}]
