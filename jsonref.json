Donald Trump? Who cared? He was just The Apprentice then,\u0027  photographer Keith Munyan, one of her close friends, said.Trump has always denied having sex with Daniels whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. At the time of their alleged encounter, he had been married to the first lady for a year. Last week, his long serving lawyer flipped on him and admitted paying Daniels $130,000 to keep her allegations to herself ahead of the 2016 election. Cohen admitted making a similar arrangement with former playmate Karen McDougal.   \u0027It was just normal person sex,\u0027 Daniels said of her alleged tryst with the president in 2006. Trump (pictured together at the Lake Tahoe golf tournament were they met) denies they ever slept togetherFor months, Trump said he did not know about the payments. In his plea, Cohen claimed the opposite and said he acted under Trump\u0027s instruction. Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign finance violations in doing so, among other criminal charges, and is now facing jail time. Daniels gloated on Twitter after his plea. She later told Vogue: \u0027Michael and I are vindicated, and we look forward to the apologies from the people who claimed we were wrong.\u0027 Her in-person interview  was completed months earlier when her fight against the president and his lawyer was still uncertain but others interviewed for it said they all knew about the payment and laughed at Daniels for not taking more money.\u0027We made fun of her because she took so little money,\u0027 Kelli Roberts who worked with Daniels in the porn industry, said. Roberts later said Daniels \u0027stood out\u0027 from others when she was in charge of porn shoots in the 1990s because she would \u0027rent mansions for the day\u0027 and \u0027bring bottled water and doughnuts to make the girls feel comfortable.\u0027 Daniel complained that she was living like a \u0027fugitive\u0027 with paparazzi camped outside her home in Texas if she ever stayed put for long enough. \u0027We’ve been in a couple car chases. We’ve had people put notes under the door, which means they know what hotel I’m in, which means we\u0027ve had to change hotels in the middle of the night,\u0027 she said, referring to herself and her lawyer Michael Avenatti.                             My fan base is completely different. It\u0027s pretty much these packs of women and they\u0027re like, You\u0027re going to save the world.                         \u0027We’ve been at restaurants when we order food and it’s taken too long or somebody was watching and we’ve had to leave—like that. That\u0027s why I\u0027m so skinny,\u0027 she went on. Avenatti was also photographed by Leibowitz for the interview. The pair jokingly referred to themselves as Thelma and Louise at one stage.\u0027Do you want to be Thelma or Louise, Michael?\u0027 she asked.  Avenatti replied: \u0027Who\u0027s driving the car?\u0027 Their exchange went on with Daniels asking, \u0027Yeah, who decided to go off the cliff?\u0027 When the Vogue writer interjected that it had been Thelma, Avenatti carried on: \u0027But was she driving?\u0027 After being told that she wasn\u0027t, he said: \u0027I want to be Louise.\u0027 Daniels, at that, said: \u0027Which one of us gets Brad Pitt?\u0027 Elsewhere, Avenatti described her as \u0027really f****** smart\u0027. After Cohen\u0027s plea last week, he told the magazine in an email: \u0027Trump is in a lot of trouble. His habit of disloyalty and stepping on people is about to catch up to him.\u0027 The interview also happened before Daniels was arrested in Ohio during one of her strip shows. She was accused of inappropriately touching patrons by slapping their faces with her bare breasts. Avenatti fought the charges successfully and they were dropped. Since she began her Make America Horny Again tour of strip clubs, Daniels said she has been faced with an unexpected outpouring of admiration from women who are pinning their hopes for a \u0027revolution\u0027 on her, their unlikely leader. \u0027My fan base is completely different. It’s pretty much these packs of women, and they are angry. People come up and they’re so emotional and they put so much on me. They’re like, You’re going to save the world, you’re a patriot, you’re a hero. \u0027When I started this, I just wanted to save my own a**. Not everybody else\u0027s,\u0027 she said.She also touched on her estranged relationship from her mother which had been well documented in previous interviews and said her upbringing was \u0027neglectful\u0027.  \u0027I haven’t talked to my mom in over ten years and I haven’t talked to my dad in 22 years,\u0027 she said, adding that she grew up in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, convinced that she had been adopted from a rich family because she felt so out of place with her own relatives.                             She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine                        \u0027My mom lives in a house that has a boat in the front yard that hasn’t seen water since 1982, and she’s content to just sit there and chain-smoke, and I just couldn’t be like that,\u0027 she said. She later said: \u0027I learned all my early life skills from the strippers at that first club I worked.\u0027 After her Ohio arrest, Daniels\u0027 third husband filed for orce and asked for full custody of their seven-year-old daughter. In the Vogue interview, she spoke candidly about her child and how much she knows about her battle with the president. \u0027She knows that people date and do this and that, and she knows that Trump is somebody I hung out with or knew three years before I even met her dad, so that’s all fine. \u0027The problem is they keep using the words, porn star, and she doesn’t know what a porn star is, because she doesn’t know what sex is, and I’m not quite ready to have that conversation,\u0027 she said. Her daughter has been with her father over the last several months while she tours the country. The pair have limited contact and Daniels must wait for her to call her because the child gets too upset whenever she gets in touch unexpectedly, she said. \u0027If I contact her, it makes her sad, so I just kind of have to wait until she wants to talk to me,\u0027 she said. She was forced to pull her daughter out of school and hire a private tutor when a man tried to take a photograph of her near campus, she said.  "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/28/20/4F787F0B00000578-0-image-a-18_1535484112290.jpg","title":"Inside Harrys Eton bedroom England flag Lynx photos women portrait mother","story":"    Harry posing at his desk: two bikini-clad women are seen on his wall, as well as a framed black and white portrait of his late mother Princess Diana (far left).

According to The Balance, Diana’s estate consisted of stocks in addition to her £17 million orce settlement.It also included jewellery, dresses and other personal belongings that were valued at approximately £21 million on the day that she died and netted her heirs £13 million, after taxes. But who did she leave her possessions to?She signed her last will and testament on June 1, 1993, but modified the will with a codicil on February 1, 1996. The will stated that her estate would be left in equal shares in trust to her sons until they became 25, with her mother, Frances Ruth Shand Kydd and her sister, Lady Elizabeth Sarah Lavinia McCorquodale, to act as co-executors and co-trustees.The codicil changed the trustees from her mother and her personal secretary, Commander Patrick Desmond Christian Jermy Jephson, to her mother and sister.However, it was reported that because her mother and sister did not like the provisions of the will, months after Diana’s death, they were able to distribute her estate differently after obtaining a secret variation order from the High Court of Justice.In addition to £50,000 that was left to her butler, Paul Burrell and ‘chattels’, or ‘personal effects’ which were left to her 17 godchildren, a Discretionary Fund was formed for Prince William, Prince Harry, their spouses, their descendants and charities, selected by the co-trustees.          Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer pose following the announcement of engagementThe Balance reported: ‘The Discretionary Fund received the following assets of the estate: intellectual property rights, all wearing apparel, £100,000, and accumulated income earned by the fund\u0027s assets.‘The Discretionary Fund is to be held for a Perpetuity Period which will last until 21 years after the death of the last surviving descendant of his late Majesty King George VI who was living on the date of Princess Diana\u0027s death.‘King George VI was the father of Queen Elizabeth II, grandfather of Prince Charles, great-grandfather of Prince William and Prince Harry, and the subject of the 2010 movie, The King\u0027s Speech.‘The income earned by the fund is to be distributed among the fund\u0027s beneficiaries during the Perpetuity Period as the trustees see fit. Anything left in the fund when it expires will go to the then living descendants of Prince William and Prince Harry.’What is referred to as the Residuary Estate was left in equal shares to William and Harry and the shares were held in trust until each Prince reached the age of 30. However, when they turned 25, they were given access to all the income and also, the power to change the final disposition of his trust if anything should remain at the time of his death.At the time of each Prince’s 30th birthday, their Residuary Estate shares were worth £10 million each.          Kate Middleton wears engagement ring of Diana, Princess of Wales, as she poses for the mediaWhat Kate Middleton inherited from Princess DianaAccording to The Telegraph, Diana’s Letter of Wishes stated: ‘But I would like you to allocate all my jewelry to the share to be held by my sons, so that their wives may, in due course, have it or use it. I leave the exact ision of the jewelry to your discretion.’After Prince William’s marriage to Kate Middleton, she has been repeatedly compared to Princess Diana and has also been spotted wearing her late mother-in-law’s jewellery. As reported in Good Housekeeping, the first piece that was given to Kate was her engagement ring.While rumours emerged that Harry had picked out the ring originally, after seeing William’s love for Kate, he traded the sapphire gem for his mother’s Cartier watch. William carried the ring with him for three weeks while they were on holiday in Mount Kenya in 2010 and eventually proposed.When the engagement was announced, the Duke of Cambridge said: ‘It’s my mother’s engagement ring, and it’s very special to me, as Kate is very special to me now as well. It was only right the two were put together. It was my way of making sure mother didn’t miss out on today and the excitement.’As mentioned above, Kate has also been seen wearing the Lover’s Knot Tiara, which was made in 1914 with diamonds and pearls. It was given to Princess Diana by The Queen as a wedding present and once Kate married into the Royal Family, she inherited the piece.The Duchess of Cambridge also inherited a pair of sapphire earrings from Diana in 2010, but they have since been updated to a drop style. Alongside this, Kate was also seen wearing a pearl bracelet, by Nigel Milne in 1988. While it wasn’t as iconic as the other pieces, the Duchess chose to wear it at a reception in Berlin.          Meghan Markle is seen here wearing an emerald-cut aquamarine ring which belonged to DianaWhat will Kate inherit from Diana when the Queen dies?Kate Middleton could also reportedly inherit Princess Diana’s title of Princess of Wales when The Queen passes away and Prince Charles becomes King, according to Elle. Prince William will become William, Prince of Wales and Kate, the title of Princess of Wales.The People’s Princess was the last person to hold this title after Camilla, Charles’ second wife declined taking up the title out of respect for her husband’s first wife.Michael Jackson miniseries based on Frank Cascio\u0027s book in the worksBlackpool Illuminations 2018: What is it, when is it and when are the lights switched on? Prayoon Yomyiam: Google Doodle remembers the Thai singer on what would have been her 85th birthday National Lottery results: Lotto numbers for Wednesday, August 29Meek Mill and his Dream Chasers team to give 6,000 backpacks to Philadelphia school studentsWhen is the Bachelor in Paradise finale and who gets dumped?Who is Tobias Menzies?

Following attempts to negotiate with the man, a Taser was discharged and the man was detained under the Mental Health Act.\u0027No officers were injured.          Officers were called to the sports centre at 7.53am this morning, following reports of a man exposing himself\u0027The man did not suffer any injuries but he has been taken to hospital as a precaution.\u0027 The suspect is a 34-year old man who had reportedly jumped into the pool and threatened to harm officers and members of the public. All members of the public were evacuated from the pool and no one suffered any injuries.As the commotion continued, Danny John-Jules found himself inadvertently caught up in the situation, as the man locked himself in the centre.The Red Dwarf star was on his way to use the gym just before 11am this morning when he came across the situation, where at least ten police cars had surrounded the sports centre.He tweeted a video, showing the police presence outside the centre and said: \u0027So I just turned up to go to the gym and this is what I was greeted with..\u0027\u0027You know what I mean. What\u0027s going on? So apparently there\u0027s a geezer or someone hold up in the gym and there\u0027s a hostage negotiator being called for.  The Strictly star was caught up in the drama as he attended Willesden Sports Centre for a training session\u0027So welcome to north west London.\u0027The bemused actor went on: \u0027So my Strictly prep has been thwarted by a man who has stripped off in the swimming pool.

I thought I was at Notting Hill Carnival!\u0027However, he has now hit back at newspapers at the scene who he has slammed for \u0027never contacting me for a story about me\u0027.Speaking at the scene he said: \u0027All these newspapers have just used my video without my permission.          No officers were injured during the incident. Police cars took over the majority of the Willesden Sports Centre car park (pictured above)\u0027They\u0027ve never once contacted me for a story about me. But now when it suits them they all want to talk.\u0027The actor was apparently fuming that some papers had unearthed Twitter rants he had made about Strictly in the past.The 57-year-old said: \u0027They\u0027ve dug up things I said about Strictly on Twitter years ago, out of a dustbin, and put it on the front page.   Following the incident the suspect has been taken to hospital and has been detained under the Mental Health Act \u0027Now they\u0027re taking my video about this story about a madman in a swimming pool - don\u0027t you think that\u0027s a bit hypocritical?\u0027Brent Council have issued a statement on Twitter which states that the pool will now be closed for the rest of the day.‘Following an incident earlier today Willesden Sport Centre\u0027s pool remains closed. But the gym, sports hall \u0026amp sauna are now all open as normal. The pool is expected to be open tomorrow.

Witnesses said the man could be heard banging on the police van when he was being taken away\u0027I didn\u0027t see him swimming just strolling around the pool naked. Very naked.

The eye of the storm was just 50 miles from their position meaning the duo faced giant waves, rain and thunderstorms and had to lock themselves in the tube-like cabin for 36 hours.In one terrifying incident Steve says he was also swept overboard, saved only by the fact he was tethered to the boat all the time.  Steve Sparkes, left, and Mick Dawson, right, initially expected to complete their trip in around 55 days, but weather delays meant the pair spent more than 80 days at sea          Following the storm, the pair were offered a tow for the remaining few miles into Hawaii, but decided it was important for them to complete their amazing journey greatestThe pair were offered a tow back to the finish line but turned down the offer, wanting to complete what they started under their own steam.Steve, of South Brent, Devon, said that despite all the challenges he was thrilled to be back on dry land and was met with a flask of tea after having no gas to make hot food or drinks for the last few days.          The pair of intrepid rowers celebrated upon their arrival on Hawaii after their 3,000-mile tripHe said: \u0027It feels amazing - I am buzzing right now.\u0027It is great to be back on dry land and I will have such good memories. To be greeted the way we were in Hawaii was just the icing on the cake. There were so many people there and the reaction we got was amazing.\u0027It is just a feeling of relief at having finally conquered the trip.The welcome was fantastic and all the pain just went out the door.\u0027Of course I am very proud to have done it and become the first visually impaired person to.\u0027Hopefully people with similar problems in life, both physical and mental, can look at it and maybe think \u0027I can give it a go.\u0027\u0027The rewards having achieved it far outweigh any downside and has made me feel exceptionally boosted. I am sure that feeling will last a long time.\u0027          Changing currents and adverse weather forced the pair to travel an extra 600 miles           The pair were just 120 miles from safety when they found their path was blocked by a hurricaneWhile the direct route is 2,400 miles, weather conditions and changing currents means Steve and Mick, 54, rowed closer to 3,000 miles.The row has been completely unaided and the pair carried their own food and supplies, as well as equipment for turning seawater into fresh drinking water.During the journey the pair suffered several other setbacks - including breaking two oars in rough conditions.Due to his lack of vision, Steve also slipped on the deck of the boat, nicknamed \u0027Bojangles\u0027, injuring his face and head, and he also suffered a knee injury which made the journey slower.He added: \u0027I make no bones out it - I found it incredibly gruelling from the word go. We didn\u0027t have the best of weather and from day one it was choppy and it just got worse.\u0027It did not go as predicted and we started by looking at 55 days but in the end it took us 82.\u0027There were very rough seas and one turned us over and I ended up in the sea. That was a shock to the system and a real eye opener at what the Pacific can throw at you.\u0027You just never knew what was around the corner. 120 miles out we were blocked by Hurricane Lane which was right on top of us.\u0027That was an horrendous experience.\u0027The whole trip was full of ups and downs but I am just thrilled that we cracked it. I still think \u0027crickey - how did we do it?\u0027Part of me wants to do it again so can enjoy the rowing a bit more in calmer conditions.\u0027The pair took it in turns rowing for two hours and spending two hours resting and coped through bouncing off each other.Steve added: \u0027There are always times when you doubt yourself but you just have to pick each other up. Mick is an accomplished ocean rower and kicked me when I needed to be kicked.\u0027We just bounced off each other to keep us motivated.\u0027Mick added: \u0027It is very easy to lose the will to live out there but there was nothing we could not make a joke about and that was how we coped.\u0027The hurricane was right on top of us.

On arrival at 8pm the children went to play whilst the parents got the room ready and started unpacking bags. \u0027The girls went down to play with the cats just outside the door of the room they were staying in, in the hallway area.          Adam Saleem has been ordered to sign the sex offenders register and will be sentenced next month, but has been warned a by a judge a jail sentence is \u0027inevitable\u0027\u0027All three girls were playing together. They were outside the private living accommodation of the defendant and their father said they had been quite loud, when all of a sudden they became very quiet.\u0027Their father didn\u0027t want them to disturb their neighbours during the course of their playing, so when he went out to look for them, he figured they would be in the defendant\u0027s room, so he knocked on the door of the defendant.\u0027He walked into his bedroom, that the prosecution say was unlocked, and he said the defendant was lying on the bed. \u0027He got the girls outside of the room, the family went to bed at 9.30 in the evening. \u0027The following morning, they left and got taken by taxi and went to the airport and went on their holiday.\u0027During the holiday and afterward the parents noticed a change in their daughter and described her as being very emotional and clingy and didn\u0027t speak about their holiday upon their return. They were quite concerned about her.\u0027In November 2017, the father watched a film which had an impact on him about a child that had gone missing. He spoke to his daughters, alongside his wife and said if they were ever worried about anything, they could talk to him.A REAL Freeway of Love!

The girl then demonstrated how the defendant touching her.\u0027Police quizzed the older girl but the four year old was too young to be interviewed. In her statement the older girl said: \u0027He\u0027s got three cats so we went into his room, my older sister and my little sister and me, we went into the room and he offered if we wanted to see the cats so we went in and my older sister, she went to stroke the cats on the other side of the room and then he started to touch us.\u0027I felt too scared to say anything but then my dad came in. He didn\u0027t know what happened. \u0027The man was touching us with his hands under our knickers. It went on for around 50 seconds. He just kept doing it and doing it. I was thinking: \u0027Get off me.\u0027\u0027I was about to whack his hand away but I felt too scared. I didn\u0027t say anything to him. I was just scared and he did the same thing to my sister.\u0027She had no idea what was going on. We were chasing the cats and he offered if we wanted to come into his room as he had a lot of cats. He closed the door when we went in.\u0027My dad came in after and said: \u0027Bed\u0027s ready, come out girls.\u0027 I didn\u0027t tell anyone. I had been thinking about it every night. I was upset and I just felt weird afterwards. I just felt uncomfortable.\u0027Saleem denied wrongdoing. He told the jury: \u0027The parents were sorting out their room and I left my room open in case they needed something.\u0027I dozed off and I became aware of the children had come into my room and were stroking the cats. \u0027A few moments later their father came into the room and apologised to me for them disturbing me and he took the children out. I did not touch the children in any way,\u0027I have no sexual interest in children - I find it distasteful. I am completely innocent - I am completely shocked.\u0027"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/29/13/4F7EF62700000578-0-image-m-62_1535547099574.jpg","title":"Facebook apologizes removing Anne Frank Centers post promoting Holocaust education","story":"    Facebook appeared to censor the Anne Frank Center\u0027s post promoting Holocaust educationThe results showed almost a third of Americans believe that substantially fewer than six million Jews were killed in the Holocaust and that 45 per cent of Americans cannot name a single concentration camp. The Anne Frank Center had shared the article, adding in a caption: \u0027These numbers are alarming, but this is why we do what we do.\u0027We have a problem with political ersity\u0027: Facebook...Founder of the \u0027original\u0027 Facebook claims Mark Zuckerberg\u0027s...Share this article\u0027Currently only 10 states mandate Holocaust and Genocide Education.

The species is now protected. Hvalur hf, owned by multi-millionaire Kristján Loftsson, caused uproar mid-July, when it was revealed it had killed a pregnant blue-fin whale hybrid, reportedly by mistake.

Chatham Historic Dockyard: The Dockyard is the backdrop for many historical dramas. This location is famously used for Call The Midwife. The Historic Dockyard Chatham s 80 acres, has over 100 buildings and structures dating from the Georgian and Victorian periods to the present day, making it an attractive location for period filming          British soldiers (pictured) helping a wounded comrade in one of the Waterloo scenes which took five days to shoot In fact, 50 trained Spanish horses were used for the five-day shoot. ‘These horses are actors,’ says production designer Anna Pritchard.‘They could rear, stumble and fall on command, they were taught amazingly well.’Finding the right location to recreate the battle proved difficult. The field needed a slope, which the Duke of Wellington used to hide some of his troops, and an elm tree, which he stood under as he watched the battle. ‘We searched high and low for the right field with the right trees and the right type of slope,’ says Anna. ‘We found one near Reading.’Four hundred supporting artists went through a Napoleonic war boot camp learning how to march, use a bayonet, hold a rifle and fire a cannon. For the actors, it was an experience they won’t ever forget. ‘It was one of the most exciting weeks I’ve ever had,’ says Charlie Rowe, whose character George Osborne is in the thick of it. ‘We were lying flat on the ground as this army of Napoleonic soldiers walked through the smoke towards us.

His grandson, also called Francis, engaged Robert Adam from 1761 to remodel and transform Osterley into the ‘palace of palaces’ that you see today          Fitzroy Square, Fitzrovia: The square was a speculative development intended to provide London residences for aristocratic families, and was built in four stages.

That feels very relevant to what\u0027s going on today. It\u0027s a universal story that feels more pertinent than ever before.\u0027     The story takes us on a 17-year journey starting in 1813, encompassing wealth, poverty, love and death.Vanity Fair has been adapted many times, most recently by the BBC in 1998 with Natasha Little as the scheming heroine and in a 2004 film with Reese Witherspoon.This new version is made by Mammoth Screen, the production company behind Poldark.           Chatham Historic Dockyard: The Dockyard is the backdrop for many historical dramas. This location is famously used for Call The Midwife. The Historic Dockyard Chatham s 80 acres, has over 100 buildings and structures dating from the Georgian and Victorian periods to the present day, making it an attractive location for period filming          British soldiers (pictured) helping a wounded comrade in one of the Waterloo scenes which took five days to shoot In fact, 50 trained Spanish horses were used for the five-day shoot. ‘These horses are actors,’ says production designer Anna Pritchard.‘They could rear, stumble and fall on command, they were taught amazingly well.’Finding the right location to recreate the battle proved difficult. The field needed a slope, which the Duke of Wellington used to hide some of his troops, and an elm tree, which he stood under as he watched the battle. ‘We searched high and low for the right field with the right trees and the right type of slope,’ says Anna. ‘We found one near Reading.’Four hundred supporting artists went through a Napoleonic war boot camp learning how to march, use a bayonet, hold a rifle and fire a cannon. For the actors, it was an experience they won’t ever forget. ‘It was one of the most exciting weeks I’ve ever had,’ says Charlie Rowe, whose character George Osborne is in the thick of it. ‘We were lying flat on the ground as this army of Napoleonic soldiers walked through the smoke towards us. It was completely terrifying. You can only imagine what it would’ve been like for real.’Horses were used in other scenes too, and Martin Clunes, who plays Sir Pitt Crawley, relished taking the reins. ‘I have Clydesdale horses and I drive them, so the producers were happy for me to drive the carriages. \u0027It’s completely fired me up – I’ve ordered a state-of-the-art new wagonette from Germany.’                                                    "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/08/22/12/4F4D339000000578-0-image-a-48_1534937640917.jpg","title":"Tesco stuns shoppers UK supermarket Christmas tree","story":"    The 25ft Christmas tree was being put in place in the car park of a Tesco store in CambridgeOne shopper, who asked not to be named, said: \u0027It was just while we were popping into Tesco and took a photo otherwise people wouldn\u0027t believe us.\u0027We were thinking more on the lines of what is the world coming to when it\u0027s Christmas in August in the Tesco car park.\u0027I mean I know the shops are bringing Christmas stuff in earlier and earlier but a Christmas tree in August is just odd.\u0027Rob James, who also spotted the tree whilst shopping at Tesco, wrote on Twitter: \u0027Just seen a Christmas tree getting decoreted (sic) in the car park of Newmarket Road @Tesco.Panic at London school as gunman opens fire on car causing...Share this article\u0027It\u0027s bonkers!

Bowe said he was trying to find “the colour and beauty in the urban, the light in the grey”.A double portrait of two unnamed shoppers in central London is the shortlisted work of the London-born photographer Max Barstow, from his series Londoners. Barstow said his aim had been to “make unposed portraits with the intensity of images made by great studio photographers such as Richard Avedon and Irving Penn”. The photograph was taken in the middle of a crowd, he said, freezing a pair of friends shopping in the busy flow of a summer Sunday afternoon.Alice Mann, a South African photographer based in London, is shortlisted for a portrait of Keisha Ncube, a drum majorette, from her series Drummies, shot in South Africa’s Western Cape.“For these girls, involvement in ‘drummies’ becomes a vehicle for them to excel, and the distinctive uniforms serve as a visual marker of perceived success and represents emancipation from their surroundings,” Mann said.The fourth photographer shortlisted is Joey Lawrence, born in Canada and based in Brooklyn, for his Portrait of “Strong” Joe Smart. The image is from a series commissioned by WaterAid, shot in Tombohuaun (Tombo’s wound) – a remote village in the jungle of Sierra Leone’s Eastern Province that struggles with waterborne illnesses.“Rather than just creating images that underscored Tombohuaun’s plight, WaterAid and I envisioned a portrait study of the community that would highlight its resilience, its fraternity, its highly organised structure and its work ethic,” Lawrence said.All four images will be part of the annual photographic prize exhibition, with the winner, who will receive £15,000, announced on 16 October."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/80106951faf2aa01e14b3e3614f0151be33ee561/0_511_7349_4408/master/7349.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1e2aab3c39f23f3daaf57139296d0450","title":"portrait of britain today british journal of photography","story":"Annual photography exhibition Portrait of Britain features 100 portraits selected by the British Journal of Photography from an open-call competition.

The alternative Nobel follows the same schedule as the original award, but rather than a secretive and small panel selecting the winner, the New Academy – made up of more than 100 Swedish cultural figures – asked Sweden’s librarians for nominations.The 47 names put forward were opened up to a public vote, with an expert jury, chaired by editor and independent publisher Ann Pålsson, set to consider the final four authors before announcing a winner in October.Announcing their finalists, the New Academy said Gaiman, whose works range from the seminal graphic novel Sandman to the award-winning children’s title The Graveyard Book, was “a true superstar in the fantasy community”.Gaiman tweeted that he was “thrilled” to be on the shortlist. “Winning would not make me any happier than being on that list makes me. So I don’t think of it as being up against opponents, just as being in glorious and honoured company,” he wrote.Murakami, frequently a frontrunner for the Nobel prize for literature, is “one of our most celebrated authors and translators”, said the New Academy, whose work, which includes the novels Norwegian Wood and The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, “fuses pop culture with a fierce magic realism”.The shortlist is completed with two female writers. The novelist Maryse Condé, whose works include Desirada and Segu, is “one of the Caribbean’s most outstanding authors”, according to the New Academy, writing about “how colonialism has changed the world and how those affected take back their heritage”. Kim Thúy, who was born in Saigon and grew up in Canada, is the final nominee. “Her stories paint the colours of Vietnam and the scents and flavours too, as well as the perils of exile and search for identity,” said the New Academy.The New Academy prize seeks to reward a writer who tells the story of “humans in the world”, in comparison with the Swedish Academy members, who select the Nobel winner producing “the most outstanding work in an ideal direction”.“The New Academy was founded to warrant that an international literary prize will be awarded in 2018, but also as a reminder that literature should be associated with democracy, openness, empathy and respect,” said the New Academy, which will be dissolved in December, once the prize has been presented.“In a time when human values are increasingly being called into question, literature becomes the counterforce of oppression and a code of silence. It is now more important than ever that the world’s greatest literary prize should be awarded.”No Nobel prize for literature will be awarded in 2018, with the Swedish Academy tentatively planning to announce two winners in 2019."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e47ec8605d280d6ad097f543588965cc9331bede/0_294_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fbf848d0697d403a1c3eb729e4dc9389","title":"ban sale energy drinks to children uk government combat obesity","story":"Move follows health concerns about heavily caffeinated and sugared drinks Ministers will ban the sale of Red Bull, Monster Energy and other energy drinks to children in England amid growing concern about the impact that the high-caffeine, high-sugar drinks are having on young people’s health.A consultation on how to implement the proposed ban will be unveiled on Thursday, with Downing Street indicating that the principal question to be determined is whether the purchasing restrictions will apply at the age of 16 or 18.Theresa May said the consultation was linked to the government’s childhood obesity strategy and said it was necessary to examine the consumption of energy drinks “often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks”.If you’re a parent, what have been your concerns with your children and energy drinks?

The principal justification for the ban is the high level of caffeine in the energy drinks, which has been linked to a string of health problems for children, including head and stomach aches, as well as hyperactivity and sleep problems.A 250ml can of Red Bull contains about 80mg of caffeine, roughly the same as a similarly sized cup of coffee, but three times the level of Coca-Cola. Monster Energy, which is often sold in larger cans of 500ml, contains 160mg of caffeine.Jamie Oliver, the celebrity chef and food health campaigner, said he welcomed the prospect of a ban on energy drink sales because “too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast” and “teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted because of these drinks, packed with stimulants”.Two-thirds of children aged 10 to 17 and a quarter of six to nine-year-olds consume energy drinks, according to the government announcement.Steve Brine, the public health minister, complained that “in some outlets it is possible to buy four 250ml cans of energy drink for £1”. The 12-week consultation proposes that a ban would apply to drinks that contain more than 150mg of caffeine per litre.A Downing Street source added that introducing a ban was all but certain, saying: “It’s a question not of whether we do it, but how.”The move is the latest step in an increasingly interventionist approach being pursued by the Conservatives in relation to childhood obesity and health. When he was the chancellor, George Osborne introduced a tax on sugary drinks.Drink brands such as Red Bull, Relentless, Monster Energy and Rockstar have become increasingly popular. Children and teenagers drink them more than adults, even though industry labelling guidelines state that any soft drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre must carry a warning about its content and state that it is not recommended for children.The compulsory health warnings read: “High caffeine content. Not recommended for children or pregnant or breastfeeding women or persons sensitive to caffeine.”Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said: “There is no evidence that energy drinks have any nutritional value or place in the diet of children and young people. That’s why we’re pleased to see the government take action on this and other measures to tackle childhood obesity and improve children’s health.”The proposed ban only applies to England, but Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland can all follow suit if their administrations wish. In March, several major supermarket chains announced that they would ban the sale of energy drinks to children under 16.The teachers’ union NASUWT called last year for the sale of the drinks to under-16s to be banned by all retailers. Its national official for education, Darren Northcott, described the beverages as “legal highs” that helped to fuel bad behaviour in schools."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/766dbeb8f9ed09ef894baeed5e384d4b4f711655/0_117_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f213a6dddebd3f6df8d7d97011333b89","title":"wonga payday lender stops offering new loans","story":"Firm held emergency talks with FCA over impact of collapse on existing customersWonga has stopped taking new loan applications as the struggling payday lender teeters on the brink of collapse.The news comes days after it emerged that the company had lined up Grant Thornton to act as administrator in case the lender’s board decides it cannot be rescued.A statement on its website read: “While it continues to assess its options Wonga has decided to stop taking loan applications.“If you are an existing customer you can continue to use our services to manage your loan.”If you are a customer, have recently left, or applied for compensation from Wonga we’d like to hear from you.

The only comparable downturn is the 1930s Great Depression in the US. However, then US real GDP was back to its pre-crisis peak after seven years. Here is a Q\u0026ampA on what Wonga’s collapse would mean for its customers:Jonathan Reynolds, Labour MP and shadow economic secretary to the Treasury, has responded to the news that payday lender Wonga has stopped taking new loan applications:We need urgent action from the government to change this broken model and review the way lending is regulated.I cannot mourn the demise of Wonga. Its business model was exploitative and immoral. Wonga had become a testament to so much that is wrong with our economy - too many people stuck in insecure employment reliant on short term debt just to keep their heads above water.That is why the next Labour government will lift living standards and tackle the persistent debt spiral that many working families have become trapped in by capping exploitative lending, increasing real wages, and ending austerity.With equity markets across Europe still falling and US futures down, Connor Campbell at Spread Ex considers why investors are in a glum mood: The sentiment in Europe remained sour, with all the major indices catching a serious case of the blues.It is hard to pinpoint the exact reason for the downturn. A lack of distraction arguably puts Brexit and the US-China trade war at the forefront of investors’ minds, though on both fronts there has been slight progress, with Barnier’s bullish comments in relation to the former, and the US-Mexico trade deal (admittedly a tenuous positive) in regards to the latter. Regardless of the reason, the Dow Jones is set to join the end of August malaise after the bell rings on Wall Street, with the futures pointing to a 90 points drop when the US session gets underway. Craig Erlam, senior market analyst at currency firm Oanda, says the more positive tone on Brexit struck by the EU could be the first step towards taking a no deal scenario off the table, which would be supportive of the pound.The pound is paring gains but continues to trade around four week highs against the dollar, with the currency having been buoyed on Wednesday by comments from Michel Barnier who claimed to be open to the idea of a bespoke Brexit deal for the UK, something the EU had appeared averse to previously.The apparent softening in the language, combined with French President Emmanuel Macron’s desire to maintain close ties, come at a time when a no deal Brexit was looking increasingly likely.The latest comments suggest there is a strong desire within the EU to find a solution and avoid a no deal Brexit which is understandably good for the UK and the pound. Sterling had come under pressure in recent months as the prospect of no deal became more of a possibility but this is hopefully the first step towards it not becoming a reality. We’ve seen a small relief rally but we’ll need to see many more positive steps before traders get carried away."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f8186656cda805b3291f13e5eaa9c52be127a10f/0_206_2664_1598/master/2664.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0ab35f7e4c1f0ba2ef7d28e69ba81aaf","title":"john ruskin artists victorian social critic","story":"He believed life should be beautiful, inequality was an outrage and that capitalism leads to aesthetic degradation. No wonder the quintessential Victorian speaks so powerfully to our timesIt is a familiar tableau of urban Britain. Labourers dig a tunnel, a porter delivers goods, a man swigs beer, there are young children and dogs, police and aristocrats look on there is dirt and beauty and life all thrown together. Ford Madox Brown’s pre-Raphaelite painting Work (c 1852-63) has been reworked many times. In the latest effort, the comic artist Hunt Emerson gives it a knockabout cartoon feel, but with a distinctly current edge: the cast is multicultural, the tools more hi-tech and there are allusions to social dysfunction, the gig economy and the housing crisis.Emerson’s update also alludes to the social critiques of Brown’s contemporary and friend, John Ruskin: a writer, artist, social critic, polymath and aesthete. Emerson’s illustration is the central image of A World of ... Work, an exhibition at Brantwood, Ruskin’s former home in Cumbria. It also figures in How to Work, a comic made in collaboration with writer Kevin Jackson, and one of three in their recent collection , Bloke’s Progress, a playful re-examining of Ruskin’s ideas through the eyes of a modern everyman, Darren Bloke.Ruskin was born in London in 1819 to a wealthy Scottish wine-merchant father and a strict Evangelical mother. Having graduated from Oxford University in 1842, he came to public prominence with his defence of JMW Turner, published in the first volume of his acclaimed treatise on art, Modern Painters. He gained fame as a public intellectual – writing, teaching and delivering lectures on art, architecture and other subjects, all in his eccentric style. Ruskin’s art criticism and advocacy was a particular inspiration to the pre-Raphaelites.In the 1860s, he turned his attention to politics and society against the backdrop of the inequality and rampant poverty many suffered in the industrial capitalist age. He railed against the exploitation of the poor and the self-interest of the wealthy. Ruskin proposed reform, and carried out practical projects – such as getting his students to work on widening roads in Oxford – which provided a hands-on social parable for his beliefs. While much of his thinking was considered radical, and could be considered a precursor to socialism, he adhered to an older conservative tradition that believed in hierarchy and the established authority it also suggested that those who naturally held power had a duty to serve and protect the poor. By the mid-20th century, some of his ideas had filtered into the perceived wisdom of the British welfare state.“In some ways, Ruskin seems like the most Victorian of the Victorians, so not applicable to our lives now,” says David Russell, associate professor of English at Corpus Christi College Oxford. “People get hung up on how eccentric some of his ideas were, but the core of his claims remains relevant and important. That is to say: our aesthetic experience, our experience of beauty in ordinary life, must be central to thinking about any good life and society. It’s not just decoration or luxury for the few. If you are taught how to see the world properly through an understanding of aesthetics, then you’ll see society properly.”Ruskin, who died in Brantwood in 1900, has been cited as an influence on William Morris and Gandhi, the arts and craft movement, ecological thinking and the foundations of the welfare state. His most searing social critique is contained in his 1860-62 essays, Unto This Last, in which he takes a scythe to Victorian capitalist values: “the art of establishing maximum inequality in our own favour … the rash and absurd assumption that such inequalities are necessarily advantageous, lies at the root of most of the popular fallacies on the subject of political economy”.In his conclusion, Ruskin states baldly: “Luxury is indeed possible in the future – innocent and exquisite luxury for all, and by the help of all but luxury at present can only be enjoyed by the ignorant the cruellest man living could not sit at his feast, unless he sat blindfolded.”A central line of thinking for Ruskin, cutting across his art criticism and political writing, is that a society founded on structures that are embroiled in heartlessness – in brutal treatment of people and the environment around them – is indifferent to beauty. As we see the growth of vast inequalities today, such billionaire tech firms employing precarious workers with diminished rights and pervasive environmental ruin, it is not hard to see parallels in our current moment.This year, David Zwirner Books published the long out-of-print Giotto and His Works in Padua, Ruskin’s consideration of the Italian painter’s 12th-century fresco cycle at the Arena Chapel in northern Italy. Even here, when contemplating the beauty of early Renaissance art, Ruskin writes: “As long as it can bear to see misery and squalor in its streets, it can neither invent nor accept human beauty in its pictures.” As Robert Hewison adds in an introduction to the new edition: “Is this 1860, or 2018?”Whether Ruskin remains an influence on the left, however, is another matter. “There is an important echo in contemporary radicalism,” says Jeremy Gilbert, a member of the founding national committee of Momentum and a professor of cultural and political theory at the University of East London. “Ruskin is not really much of a presence in contemporary left culture, but there are definitely resonances, especially in the popularisation of post-work politics.”Ruskin’s criticism of the alienating nature of work and the aesthetic impoverishment of industrial capitalism chimes with current arguments about inequality and the despoiling of the environment. But, for Gilbert, “it’s never clear with Ruskin what the strategy was meant to be politically to resolve the problem.”Where Ruskin’s continuing political influence is concerned, Gilbert says he remains central to an ethical-socialist radical tradition, a belief-system embraced by Tony Benn and even Jeremy Corbyn, whose “own vision of the world is a moral one: it’s not really about class struggles, so much as it is about wanting a moral and ethical society”. While Ruskin is not widely cited by the left today, this concept is something he espoused. Gilbert suggests that the strongest link between Ruskin and contemporary discourse lies in the possibility that automation might be a liberation – allowing people to lead more creative and and aesthetically fulfilled lives because they don’t have to do boring work anymore. In Unto This Last, Ruskin offers, in his elaborate style, exhortations: “The equality of wages, then, being the first object towards which we have to discover the directest available road, the second is … that of maintaining constant numbers of workmen in employment.”There are also provocations: “Whereas it has long been known and declared that the poor have no right to the property of the rich, I wish it also to be known and declared that the rich have no right to property of the poor.”And there are dramatic paeans to what might be possible. “There is no wealth but life. Life including all its powers of love, of joy, and of admiration,” he writes. “That country is richest which nourishes the greatest number of noble and happy human beings.”When Ruskin did publish his social criticism, there was a backlash from his audience: the wealthy, educated elite. The essays that became Unto This Last were originally published in Cornhill magazine but he had to end the series because his editor, William Thackeray, along with much of the readership, were horrified, Russell explains. The economic establishment were contemptuous and said he had no practical business insight to draw on. The World of Work exhibition in Brantwood, which runs until this weekend, considers how artists have responded to human labour, and is underpinned by Ruskin’s writing on the laissez-faire capitalism of the Victorian industrial age. Alongside Emerson’s update of Work, there is a very broad interpretation: George Mason’s rural idyll The Harvest Moon, John Cassidy’s sculpture The Ship Canal Digger and AS Finlayson’s paintings of an aero-engine production line offer optimistic and noble visions of work. Set against these are stark visions in paintings like Peasant Woman with a Pitchfork by James Pelham and Graham Sutherland’s Press for Making Shells. The exhibition runs into the present day, with images including Jonathan Ive’s design for the iPhone.The David Zwirner Books edition of Ruskin’s writing about Giotto is part of the gallery and publisher’s Ekphrasis series – reissuing largely out-of-print writing on visual arts by the likes of Vernon Lee, Marcel Proust, Alice Michel and Paul Gauguin. “When I was in university, I don’t think I was ever taught Ruskin,” says Lucas Zwirner, the managing editor of the imprint. “In his lifetime he was a celebrity. And then he was totally out of fashion. There’s such richness there that I think there are cycles of engagement – maybe we’re entering a place where people want a different kind of writing about visual art.”Zwirner says he was introduced to the Victorian due to his somewhat unlikely influence on the punk and counter-culture infused drawings of Raymond Pettibon – former Tate director Nicholas Serota also encouraged him to publish the Ruskin work. Ruskin is referenced directly in the title of The Ethics of Dust, a series by the artist, architect and preservationist Jorge Otero-Pailos. Here installations are created out of minute dirt, dust and matter that has accumulated over years at old buildings, including Westminster and Doge’s Palace in Venice. “It’s a really important part of the radical tradition to be able to say that one of the things wrong with capitalism in general is that it produces a certain kind of aesthetic degradation,” says Gilbert. “And that does speak to something that really intuitively, people recognise – not just aesthetes, not just intellectuals. Most people have a sense of the way in which corporate culture cannot produce beauty. It can appropriate it and sell access to it, but it can’t produce it.”There is a banner in the Brantwood exhibition that simply reads: “To Do Good Work”. It is by the Sheffield-based art partnership Poly-Technic, which uses words as polemic in its art, riffing on trade union banners and other types of sloganeering, as well as creating collective community projects that take messages out in public. “That was something Ruskin was doing,” says Howard Hull, the director of the Ruskin Foundation and Brantwood Trust. “He was making actions and finding words or concepts which could be taken out and used.“Famously, the first bit of writing that Ruskin ever did was three lines long: a little sermon that his mother got him to preach in the home on a Sunday, in which he stood up and proclaimed: ‘People be good’.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f0356b0ad9c4059425d56713ffcb6b759f00844f/0_78_4896_2938/master/4896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6d6278d3a2ede9e57c23b1d958975400","title":"salary supplements could halt teacher shortages in england","story":"Supplements could address shortage of teachers in subjects such as maths and science, report saysSalary supplements such as bonuses should be given to teachers in some subjects to help deal with a growing recruitment and retention crisis, according to a report.A new study by the Education Policy Institute (EPI) says England is struggling to find and keep enough teachers, particularly in science and maths.The education secretary, Damian Hinds, has said that making teaching an attractive profession is his top priority.“Exit rates” – the numbers leaving the profession – have also increased, the report says, particularly for those in the early stages of their career.The report says: “The overall teacher labour market in England is in trouble. The squeeze on teacher pay probably had little effect when private sector earnings were also squeezed.“However, the recent recovery in private sector earnings is making teaching a less attractive financial option for young graduates and is probably behind the negative trends in recruitment and retention in recent years.“Moreover, the projected growth in pupil numbers means teacher numbers will need to rise in order to prevent class sizes from rising further, rather than staying steady as they have done in recent years.”These are both subjects where there are “significant recruitment and retention problems”, the study says, and graduates in these fields can expect higher average pay in other jobs.The report says: “The teacher shortage problem appears worse in subjects where graduates can earn most outside of teaching, with persistent problems recruiting and retaining sufficient numbers of physics, maths, chemistry and languages teachers.“This appears to translate into differences in teacher quality in such subjects, with fewer teachers possessing a relevant degree in the subject they teach.”The study also notes that shortages of teachers with relevant degrees are worse in deprived areas.“More generous bonuses (around $20,000-$25,000) have been found to be effective in incentivising existing teachers to move to high-poverty areas,” it adds.“Schools in England already have the freedom to make such salary supplements, but have been rarely making use of them to date. This is probably because schools would have to self-fund them at a time when school budgets are already severely squeezed.“We believe that there is a good case for introducing salary supplements in shortage subjects for all early career teachers. To be effective, such a policy would need central funding and direction.”Report author Luke Sibieta said: “The teacher labour market is suffering from a number of severe shortages, especially with graduates, who are often able to earn much more in other roles.“Many priority subjects such as maths and science are failing to attract enough highly-qualified professionals. Our research finds that in some parts of England, just one in five physics teachers have a relevant degree.“There is strong evidence that these pressures can be alleviated by targeted salary supplements. Policy-makers have begun to consider this potential solution, yet so far proposals have been far too modest, and exclude many of the areas most in need.“The government should therefore roll out a more ambitious scheme, which offers incentives to teachers in a greater number of shortage subjects, covering more areas. This is critical if we are to relieve some of the growing strains in the workforce, and protect pupil outcomes.”A Department for Education spokeswoman said: “The education secretary has been clear that there are no great schools without great teachers and his top priority is to make sure teaching remains an attractive and fulfilling profession.“There are still more than 450,000 teachers in our classrooms, 11,900 more than in 2010, and increasing numbers are returning to the profession.“We recently announced a fully-funded pay rise for classroom teachers and we are working with school leaders and unions on a strategy to drive recruitment and boost retention of teachers and strip away unnecessary workload.“This is on top of the range of financial incentives we already offer to help attract the brightest and best into our classrooms.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6f6fa94a4e72a1b91d10b21cf02c45fb958945eb/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=61c9ed13e044375852cbbb2cba8a6f3e","title":"clashes expected over japans bid to resume commercial whaling","story":"Japanese government expected to propose reforms to the International Whaling Commission allowing them to circumvent the current banAttempts by Japan to resume commercial whaling are likely to raise controversy at the International Whaling Commission meeting, as opponents decry the country’s suggested reforms as a covert way to revive the banned practice.The Japanese government is tabling proposals that would allow members of the IWC to circumvent some of its key decisions, such as ending the killing of whales for consumption of their meat.Japan, which holds the chairmanship of this year’s IWC meeting in Brazil which starts on Tuesday, has continued to kill some whales at sea for many years, but has been able to do so to a limited extent under the IWC provisions for scientific research, which many experts regard as a pretext.Japanese officials have said reform of the international body, set up in 1946 as the dangers to whale stocks became clear, is necessary because of its slow decision-making processes, the result of frequent disagreements between pro and anti whaling states.The global consensus on conserving whale stocks has come under attack from Japan before. The moratorium on whaling, signed in 1982 and confirmed four years later after intense pressure from conservationists, still stands, but loopholes allow meat from whales killed for scientific purposes to be sold on the open market.Norway and Iceland continue to support small minke whaling fleets, despite the moratorium, as they have registered objections or reservations. Russia has also registered an objection to the moratorium, but does not exercise it. Japan takes minke whales under the scientific research provision, but the meat has only a small market.A few indigenous populations, such as Inuit people, who traditionally eat whale meat, are permitted a small amount of subsistence whale-hunting under the ban.Japan is likely to face stiff opposition from countries such as Australia and New Zealand at the two-week meeting in Brazil that starts next week.Earlier this year, the Icelandic company Hvalur announced it would resume hunting fin whales, which are classed as endangered. The last time fin whaling took place in Iceland was 2015, when 155 were hunted, mostly for the Japanese market. Minke whales are also hunted in Iceland, though usually far fewer than the government-allocated quota.Patrick Ramage, marine conservation programme director at the International Fund for Animal Welfare, said whaling was “outdated and uneconomic”. He advocated “responsible whale watching, rather than whale killing” and said the global movement for whale conservation had far more support than whaling."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/57bc2659c4e65878b47b9902829851df0eaaaf93/173_162_1325_795/master/1325.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=eadd87342176e7c6706a736e6bf3f8c8","title":"where the animals go wildlife tracking secrets revealed","story":"Award-winning geographer Dr James Cheshire and designer Oliver Uberti take us to the forefront of the animal tracking revolution, mapping the movements of animals on land, sky and sea – from Peru’s elusive jaguars to ant activity in a colonyThe elephants who crossed the railroadIn March 2016, Save the Elephants and the Kenya Wildlife Service collared 10 elephants to assess how the animals were adapting to a new railway bisecting Tsavo national park. They wanted to see if the elephants would use a series of underpasses that the construction company had been persuaded to include. Within 30 days, half of them had. Highly adaptable iniduals have even been recorded passing through drainage culverts as small as three metres wide.Source: Save the ElephantsBetween breeding seasons, grey-headed albatrosses take sabbaticals. Tracking data from light loggers has revealed three distinct behaviours: “residents” stay near their breeding area in the southwest Atlantic “shorter-distance migrants” fly to the Indian Ocean and back and “circumpolar migrants” round the entire Southern Ocean, sometimes twice. By the time a migrant reaches the Kerguelen Islands, strong tailwinds make it easier to continue circling Antarctica than to turn back and fly into the wind.About 20 years ago, scientists began using motion-activated camera traps to spot the elusive cats in study areas the size of Manhattan. From these sightings, they derived population estimates. Then in 2011, a GPS-collared jaguar in Peru showed that jaguars can have ranges 10 times the size of Manhattan. That meant prior camera-trap studies likely overestimated jaguar densities because their coverage areas were too small. In 2014, researchers installed 89 cameras across 650 square kilometres of Peruvian Amazon to get the full picture.The seals who map the Southern Ocean  Remote sensing tells us not only where animals go, it can also tell us about the environment an animal is moving through. To date, GPS-tagged elephant seals – with foraging es as deep as 1,500m – have collected more than 500,000 measurements of sea temperature and ocean salinity around Antarctica and under ice shelves. Their continual data streams keep oceanographers up-to-date on the changing climate, while educating us about their daily lives.Sources: Mike Fedak and Clint Blight, University Of St AndrewsBecause large birds are less able to sustain flapping flight, vultures must find sources of warm, rising air to make their extended daily searches for food. Wearing devices known as “daily diaries” that record location, air pressure, humidity, temperature, light level, speed, acceleration, and bearing, griffon vultures are teaching us how they stay aloft. Here we show just 3.5 minutes of flight above a village in southern France.Sources: Emily Shepard, Swansea University  Olivier Duriez, University of Montpellier Le Rocher Des Aigles Falconry CentreHow baboons move as oneWhen baboons disagree on where to forage, they don’t split up with leopards around, it is safer to stick together. So how does a troop settle a dispute? To find out, researchers in Kenya fitted 25 olive baboons with GPS collars set to record one position every second for four weeks. From more than 20m data points, they found a pattern. When the angle of disagreement between paths is small, the troop compromises and follows a middle path. If the angle is large, majority rules.

It had not been difficult or challenging to find more films directed by women, she said.“While we all want to move towards parity, we don’t want to set quotas for ourselves. We are trying to serve audiences and serve the programme and that is always at the heart of our curatorial process.The gender representation at London is in stark contrast to that at Europe’s other big film festivals. At Venice, only one of the 21 films in competition is directed by a woman, The Nightingale by Jennifer Kent. At Cannes this year it was only slightly better, with three out of 20 film-makers female.At the Baftas this year, for the fifth year running, no woman was included in the best director category. At the Oscars, Greta Gerwig became only the fifth woman to be nominated for best director.The London festival is a major event in the film calendar, although not quite on the level of Cannes, Venice and Toronto, which together hoover up the world premieres of films which are seen as likely award-season contenders.There will be 21 world premieres in London and 29 European premieres, including Steve McQueen’s Widows, adapted from the Lynda La Plante TV series, and Jason Reitman’s The Front Runner, chronicling the rise and fall of the would-be 1988 Democrat presidential candidate Gary Hart.Other films in the programme include the Coen brothers’ new film The Ballad of Buster Scruggs, an anthology of six mini-westerns and Alfonso Cuarón’s black and white Roma, described by Tuttle as “a love letter to the women who raised him and a real delight”.Tuttle said it was striking how many films this year were based on true stories. They include David Mackenzie’s Robert the Bruce biopic for Netflix, Outlaw King Matthew Heineman’s A Private War, starring Rosamund Pike as Sunday Times foreign correspondent Marie Colvin and Marielle Heller’s Can You Ever Forgive Me? the true story of celebrity biographer and letter forger Lee Israel, starring Melissa McCarthy.Tuttle, standing in for Clare Stewart, who is on a year-long sabbatical, said championing female talent and British films were a priority for her. “I love British film,” she said. “I’m a North Carolinian by birth but I’ve been here for 20 years and it always struck me when I came to this country how, at that time, the UK didn’t understand what an incredible film industry there was.”One film to watch out for this year, she said, is Wild Rose, written by Nicole Taylor and directed by Tom Harper. It tells the story of a Glasgow singer and single mum (played by Jessie Buckley) who dreams of becoming a country star in Nashville. “I think it is going to be a film that gets audiences really excited this year.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea10cc2eeb3e54690d97eaf896303fb7e0ed1934/0_0_5472_3283/master/5472.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=157bcf766064d9e24ecf318f19c32e04","title":"champions league draw clubs pots format when happening","story":"Liverpool will be on the harder side of Thursday’s draw after Benfica won a play-off, with Manchester City, Manchester United and Tottenham the other Premier League clubs involvedLiverpool, runners-up in the Champions League last season, will be in pot three in Thursday afternoon’s group-stage draw after Benfica saw off Paok Thessaloniki in the play-offs.Had Benfica lost then Liverpool would have joined Manchester United and Tottenham in pot two.

He will take up the space filled in Russia by the experienced Gary Cahill, who announced this week he wished to take a “step back” from England commitments as he seeks to regain a place in Chelsea’s lineup.“We’re obviously coming off the back of a successful summer, so I think there’s a good foundation for us to build on,” Southgate said. “With us only being three games into the season, I felt some continuity was important so those who were with us in the summer deserve the right to go again. Others haven’t really had the opportunity to force themselves ahead of those guys.“From here we have a two-year lead into the European Championships, so I want us to try and capture what we had this summer and why they felt it went well – but, once we’re through this camp, there’s going to be competition from others.

The goalkeeper, uncapped but called up by Roy Hodgson in 2013 and Sam Allardyce in 2016, has earned a recall ahead of Joe Hart, who is gaining regular playing time after moving to Burnley.

But for services to the field of unnecessarily inflammatory quotation, deliberately incendiary riffing and consequence‑disregarding button‑pressing, Mou is the spiritual love child of Mahatma Gandhi and bed-in era John Lennon when compared with Bob Lord.On Sunday, Mourinho takes his side to Burnley, Lord’s old fiefdom, for a fixture that 60 years ago sparked wild scenes. In 1958, Lord, a wholesale butcher, was midway through the process of turning Burnley into one of the most successful clubs in the country. As chairman, he oversaw the construction of a modern training ground, implemented a successful youth development programme and appointed Harry Potts as manager. Potts would lead Burnley to the title in 1960, while Lord would go on to commission a couple of shiny stands at Turf Moor, both opened by his pal Edward Heath. An admirable body of work Lord was an extraordinary man.But his intense focus sometimes led to his missing the bigger picture. Quite literally when he made the myopic decision to chase the BBC cameras away during the 60s, when Match of the Day was busy turning players into stars and local clubs into nationally beloved institutions. That decision was mainly based on a misreading of the eternal importance of gate receipts, though Lord – a bluff, tell-it-as-I-see-it Lancastrian straight from central casting – was also wary of “a move to get soccer on the cheap by the Jews who run TV”.That observation caused a mass walkout from the Variety Club dinner at which he was the guest of honour. Small mercies but at least he apologised later. No such mea culpa was forthcoming before Burnley’s match against United in March 1958, which in retrospect was always going to kick off thanks to Lord’s old-school approach to grief management. Following the Munich tragedy, the world of football had rallied round. Liverpool were straight on the phone offering help Aston Villa’s manager Eric Houghton drove Stan Crowther to Old Trafford and insisted his striker sign to ease the crisis. But when United inquired about the possible purchase of Burnley’s winger Brian Pilkington and striker Albert Cheesebrough, Lord’s response was short and not altogether sweet.“I am just sick and tired of the whole business,” he boomed, 10 days after the disaster. “United may be in a jam but if they think they are coming to Burnley to pick roses off the tree, they better have second thoughts. When clubs offered to help it was with players sufficient to keep them ticking over, not to supply them with the cream of the country’s footballers. They’ll just have to fight their way out of it. They went into this of their own accord.”Little surprise that when United rocked up at Turf Moor, they were ready to roll. Mark Pearson, the young left‑back, was sent packing for scything down the Burnley striker Les Shannon. Crowther picked up a booking, then went in for a finisher on the put-upon Shannon and was extremely lucky not to walk too. Harry Gregg responded to a penalty-area scramble by adopting a boxer’s stance and threatening to warm Alan Shackleton’s lugs Shackleton fell backwards in surprise and was pinned to the floor by the fuming keeper.At one point United’s stand-in manager, Jimmy Murphy, refused to return the ball from the dugout and was accordingly reprimanded by the referee. After the match he stormed into the Burnley dressing room to trade ideas and opinions with Shannon over a tackle on Bobby Charlton. Drinks sent to the United dressing room came whistling back in the saloon-bar style. Incidentally, the score was 3-0 to Burnley.Lord doubled down on his earlier pronouncements, accusing United of “running around like Teddy Boys. It looks as if they don’t like losing. If United continue to play like this, they’ll lose the sympathy the public have for them”. Murphy pointed out that defeat was not really the issue, as they had been expecting to lose every match after the crash anyway. Aggrieved, he described Lord’s views as “shocking and disgraceful”.The United-minded were in lockstep: the famous Times correspondent Geoffrey Green, who had fallen hard for the Babes and would later pen United’s official centenary history, delivered his verdict: “Matt Busby once said: ‘I aim to make footballers of my boys.’ They had better remember that … or tarnish a fine name. There is a limit to sympathy.”Eye-opening analysis by today’s mores. Post‑traumatic stress was almost certainly an issue Gregg, only 37 days before his donnybrook with Shackleton, was saving lives on the Munich runway. Then again, this was only 13 years after the second world war and generations had become inured to tragedy, the widespread loss of young life and the harsh necessity of carrying on regardless. In that context, Lord’s comments are perhaps easier to understand if not necessarily forgive. Either way, any post-match controversy generated on Sunday will have nothing on this."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/aec7209a3b0ba7b42b35bd0c54a3802ac64b5d89/0_266_4500_2700/master/4500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=69358d2d23c04764ca9ddd5ece186700","title":"dogs v posties is no joke day with royal mail","story":"The postal worker being chased by a snarling mutt is a comedy cliche, but it’s no joke for those at the sharp end: last year saw six dog attacks a day.

(The others are Defend, Inform, Observe and Value Yourself, that latter of which sounds quite spiritual, but basically means don’t enter a garden with an unchained cockapoo in it.)Meeting dogs is one of the top five reasons I like to imagine being a postal worker. Isn’t the eternal rivalry between pooch and postie cute? Somehow very British?“This Dennis the Menace idea, that a dog hanging off the seat of your pants is an occupational hazard – I have a problem with that,” says Shaun Davis, global safety director at Royal Mail. “It’s like saying: ‘If you don’t want to get held up by a bank robber, don’t work in a bank.’” It turns out that dog attacks are one of the top five threats to postal staff. Fingers and thumbs have been bitten off, even a nose. Injuries to calves, buttocks and testicles are common. In 2017, there were more than six attacks a day. It’s a country-wide problem: last year, Sheffield saw the highest number of incidents, this year it was Taunton. As Davis describes the life-changing injuries that mean some postal staff are unable to return to their routes, and\u0026nbsprequire much mental health support afterwards, I realise that I\u0026nbsphave been naive.“I don’t use postal pegs they can’t\u0026nbsptake any weight,” says Charlie, dismissing the tongs staff are encouraged to use to deliver mail through letterboxes. Perry looks sad, because this is not a very on-message thing to say. (Thirteen per cent of dog attacks on postal staff\u0026nbspare of the fingers-in-letterbox variety.)Charlie is exactly what I like to imagine postal workers are like: an unnaturally fast mover, nipping over walls, earbuds hanging over one ear, trying to beat his personal best time for the round. Posties talk a bit like rappers: I ask Charlie where he is from, and he replies: “W7, but we’re in W12 now.” At just 20, he is one of the youngest in the game and, by his\u0026nbspcalculation, won’t see a good (ie\u0026nbspeasy) route until he is 40. He is also the least concerned person I have ever met. Inside a terrifying death-trap lift on an estate, he mildly observes that it often breaks down. He steps into the road the way\u0026nbspAchilles stepped into battle. “If\u0026nbspI\u0026nbspwaited, nothing would get delivered,” he says over his shoulder as a Ford Focus supplicates before him. Is he concerned about dog bites? He smiles, which I take to mean he is not.“The ‘young and invincible’ mindset is one of our challenges,” acknowledges Davis. It is why the company has developed a new virtual reality experience, to teach its frontline employees Avoid strategies. It is short and interactive, to better engage staff, who will have been pulled off the sorting floor for the training. I have a go myself later, at Royal Mail’s head office, in a swivel chair with a VR headset on. It’s fun – you get to follow a new postal worker, Mel, on her round, looking for signs of dogs and advising her what to do. I stare at poos hidden in the virtual garden, urine-faded grass, hung up leads and cutesy warning notices, while the program registers that I have clocked them. Occasionally, I misdirect Mel: telling her to feed a begging terrier, or not to bother reporting a new dog on her walk log. Then I am called into the office and reprimanded by a virtual manager. Royal Mail’s dog-awareness campaign has been a success. It’s not anti-dog it simply advocates for responsible dog ownership, and the\u0026nbsppublic have responded. Simple tips – such as securing excitable dogs\u0026nbspin other rooms at delivery hour,\u0026nbspand fitting letterbox cages or external post boxes, have halved the\u0026nbsp5,000 annual dog attacks of just five years ago. Approaching the end of the round, which I have slowed down immeasurably, I figure the time is now. Swallowing nervously, I ask if I\u0026nbspcan put one in.“Put one … what in?” asks Charlie, breaking stride for the first time. I\u0026nbspexplain that one of my lifelong ambitions has been to become a postie and deliver the mail. Charlie shrugs and hands me a bundle.“That’s definitely against USO guidelines,” Perry shouts, but he’s too far behind, and too late. It’s happening. I shove in a Boden catalogue, a penalty charge notification and some final demands. It’s a little underwhelming, to be honest. Post has got less interesting since the internet. Still, it\u0026nbspis satisfying to tick off the bucket list now all I need is to try becoming a town crier, and go hang-gliding. And get a dog."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e99a9e826aeffec849c36e11947a87090c950641/0_275_4288_2573/master/4288.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99599bdbb96e77c30df1c18375c002f5","title":"paw outcome new zealand council proposes banning all cats","story":"Under ‘pest plan’ Omaui residents will not be allowed to replace cats when they dieA regional council in New Zealand has proposed banning all domestic cats in an attempt to protect native animals.Environment Southland’s “pest plan” calls for all domestic cats in the region to be neutered, microchipped and registered. Then, when a cat dies, residents would not be permitted to have another.“We’re not cat haters,” John Collins, of the Omaui Landcare Trust told Newshub. “But we’d like to see responsible pet ownership and this really isn’t the place for cats.”Ali Meade, the council’s biosecurity operations manager, said that if the move was approved the improvement for the environment and bird life would be vast.Submissions on the pest management plan close at the end of October. However, not all members of the community are happy with the idea.Omaui resident Nico Jarvis told the Otago Daily Times that she was shocked and planned a petition against the plan. She said that her three cats were the only way to combat a rodent problem in the area. “If I cannot have a cat, it almost becomes unhealthy for me to live in my house,” she said.Jarvis likened the plan to living in a “police state … It’s not even regulating people’s ability to have a cat. It’s saying you can’t have a cat.”The move comes as New Zealand works on an ambitious goal to become predator-free by 2050. That plan is devoted to wiping out introduced species of rats, stoats and possums.The plan, announced in 2016, says that the government estimates the cost of introduced species to the New Zealand economy and primary sector to be NZ$3.3bn (£1.76bn) a year.Cats have also come under the spotlight for their tendency to target native birds.Kapiti Island’s Kotuku Parks subision has a no-cat rule and Auckland council is also looking at a plan to euthanise any cat caught in an “ecologically significant site” without a microchip.Economist turned parliamentary candidate Gareth Morgan has long proposed wiping out cats from New Zealand as a way to protect native species from what he called “natural born killers”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9ca86a04bf5c98fc6961001a54f0414dfad51653/0_0_5568_3342/master/5568.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=aa623452cbb98ea6136b071321dc3e8f","title":"profiteering viagogo called to face mps after earlier refusal","story":"Controversial ticketing firm expected to send deputy to speak for publicity shy founderThe controversial ticket resale website Viagogo has been called to appear before a parliamentary inquiry, a year after it outraged MPs by refusing to turn up to a previous evidence session.The secondary ticketing site, already the subject of multiple investigations for alleged transgressions including breaches of consumer law, is expected to send an executive to a hearing on 5 September.Miller is a long-time lieutenant of Viagogo’s publicity-shy founder-owner Eric Baker, having worked with him at StubHub in the US before the pair brought their secondary ticketing business model to Europe.With just days to go before the hearing, Viagogo risked further antagonising MPs as it was condemned by a cancer charity for seeking to profit from a benefit gig by the comedian Russell Howard.The website is allowing touts to advertise tickets for up to £132 for the show at Manchester Academy 1, staged by arts and music therapy charity Future Perfect in aid of the cancer hospital Christie.“It is indefensible that tickets are being touted for several times their face value,” said Linda Wyatt, founder of Future Perfect.“We strongly condemn anyone attempting to profiteer from what is a charitable event,” she said.Labour MP Sharon Hodgson said: “Yet again we see the depths Viagogo will go to in order to profiteer, this time off the back of a fundraiser to support a cancer unit.“Hoping they or the touts they facilitate will do the decent thing just doesn’t work. We need to get this practice of reselling charity tickets banned.”The company did not return a request for comment.Skiddle, the company managing the box office for the event, said it was using mobile phone ticketing to combat touts, adding that seats were still available at face value.Viagogo has previously been accused of “moral repugnance” and “callous profiteering” for selling tickets to charity events featuring Ed Sheeran and comedian Peter Kay.The website, which is used by some of the UK’s most powerful ticket touts to sell tickets harvested in bulk, often at vast mark-ups, has also faced criticism for selling tickets that see buyers denied entry and leaving fans out of pocket by withholding refunds.Margot James, minister for digital and the creative industries, urged consumers to boycott the company earlier this year.The firm is facing multiple investigations by UK regulators including the Competition and Markets Authority, which has threatened it with legal action for suspected breaches of consumer law.The Advertising Standards Authority referred Viagogo to National Trading Standards earlier this year over “misleading” pricing information.Switzerland’s secretariat for economic affairs launched civil proceedings against Viagogo over suspected unfair business practices last year, while Fifa lodged a criminal complaint against the company over unauthorised sale of tickets for the 2018 World Cup in Russia.A  investigation revealed earlier this year that the company was allowing touts to resell football tickets, which is against the law.

By  Bethany McLeanThis remarkable transformation was brought about by American entrepreneurs who figured out how to literally force open rocks often more than a mile below the surface of the earth, to produce gas, and then oil. Those rocks – called shale, source rock or tight rock, and once thought to be impermeable – were opened by combining two technologies: horizontal drilling, in which the drill bit can travel more than two miles horizontally, and hydraulic fracturing, in which fluid is pumped into the earth at a high enough pressure to crack open hydrocarbon-bearing rocks, while a so-called proppant, usually sand, holds the rocks open a sliver of an inch so the hydrocarbons can flow. A fracking entrepreneur likens the process to creating hallways in an office building that has none – and then calling a fire drill.In November 2017, US production topped the 10m barrel-a-day record set in 1970, back in the last gasp of the legendary oil boom. This year, it is expected to reach almost 11m barrels a day, according to the US Energy Information Administration. The Marcellus Shale, which stretches through northern Appalachia, could be the second-largest natural gas field in the world, according to geologists at Penn State. Shale gas now accounts for more than half of total US production, according to the EIA, up from almost nothing a decade ago.The apparent new era of American energy abundance has already had a profound impact around the world. Economies that were dependent on the high price of oil, from Russia to Saudi Arabia, have begun to struggle. The situation would have been unthinkable in the pre-2014 world of $100-a-barrel oil, and is playing out in strange and unpredictable ways.Since the 1970s, US presidents from Gerald Ford to both Bushes emphasised the importance of “energy independence”, although the country had in fact become more and more dependent, particularly on the Middle East. Under the Trump administration, the longstanding dream of America’s energy independence has taken a grander, more muscular turn. Secretary of the interior Ryan Zinke talks about opening more federal lands, including national parks, to drilling in order to ensure “energy dominance”.“We’ve got underneath us more oil than anybody, and nobody knew it until five years ago,” Trump told the press aboard Air Force One in the summer of 2017. “And I want to use it. And I don’t want that taken away by the Paris accord. I don’t want them to say all of that wealth that the United States has under its feet, but that China doesn’t have and that other countries don’t have, we can’t use.”But the shale success story nearly became a disaster. While to date, most of the complaints about fracking have focused on environmental concerns, there’s a bigger and far less well known reason to doubt the most breathless predictions about America’s future as an oil and gas giant. The fracking of oil, in particular, rests on a financial foundation that is far less secure than most people realise.Because so few fracking companies actually make money, the most vital ingredient in fracking isn’t chemicals, but capital, with companies relying on Wall Street’s willingness to fund them. If it weren’t for historically low interest rates, it’s not clear there would even have been a fracking boom at all.‘You can make an argument that the Federal Reserve is entirely responsible for the fracking boom,” one private-equity titan told me. That view is echoed by Amir Azar, a fellow at Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. “The real catalyst of the shale revolution was the 2008 financial crisis and the era of unprecedentedly low interest rates it ushered in,” he wrote in a recent report. Another investor put it this way: “If companies were forced to live within the cash flow they produce, US oil would not be a factor in the rest of the world, and would have grown at a quarter to half the rate that it has.”Worries about the financial fragility of the fracking revolution have simmered for some time. John Hempton, who runs the Australia-based hedge fund Bronte Capital, recalls having debates with his partner as the boom was just getting going. “The oil and gas are real,” his partner would say. “Yes,” Hempton would respond, “but the economics don’t work.”Thus far, the fracking industry has been more resilient than anyone would have dreamed. But questions about the sustainability of the boom are no longer limited to a small set of skeptics. Those doubts now extend to the boardrooms of some big investors, as well as to the executive suites of at least a few of the fracking companies themselves. The fracking boom has been fuelled mostly by overheated investment capital, not by cash flow.If the story of the fracking boom has a central character, it’s Aubrey McClendon, the founder of Chesapeake Energy, a startup that grew into a colossus. For a brief moment in history, he most represented US fracking to the world. No one was more right and more wrong, no one bolder in his predictions or more spectacular in his failures, no one more willing to risk other people’s money and his own, than McClendon or, as one banker who knew McClendon well put it: “The world moves when people who like risk take action.”“He was the good face of the industry – the passion, the creativity, the daring,” another former investment banker told me. “But he was also the bad face.” And that duality makes him a perfect personification of the US fracking revolution.In the fall of 2008, Forbes had ranked McClendon No 134 on its list of the 400 richest Americans, with an estimated net worth of more than $3bn. But because he borrowed so much money and secured business loans with personal guarantees, lawyers were still wrangling over the remains of his estate two years after his death, trying to figure out which debts would be paid – from the $500,000 he owed the Boy Scouts of America to the $465m he owed a group of Wall Street creditors, including Goldman Sachs. Wall Street’s vultures – the hedge funds that invest in distressed debt – had descended, buying the debt for less than 50 cents on the dollar, essentially rendering a judgment that the claims wouldn’t be paid in full. If McClendon did die broke, it wouldn’t have been out of character. During his years as an oil and gas tycoon, he fed on risk, and was as fearless as he was reckless. He built an empire that at one point produced more gas than any American company except ExxonMobil. Once, when an investor asked on a conference call, “When is enough?”, McClendon answered bluntly: “I can’t get enough.”Many think that without McClendon’s salesmanship and his astonishing ability to woo investors, the world would be a far different place today. Stories abound about how, at industry conferences, executives from oil majors like Exxon would find themselves speaking to mostly empty seats, while people literally fought for space in the room where McClendon was holding forth. “In retrospect, it was kind of like Camelot,” said Henry Hood, Chesapeake’s former general counsel, who worked at the company, initially as a consultant, from 1993 until the spring of 2013. “There was a period of time that will never be duplicated, with a company that will never be duplicated.”“America’s Most Reckless Billionaire,” Forbes once called McClendon, and for many in the industry, that headline defined the man. But if it was a con, he was conning himself, too. Because he believed. He was, in many ways, the embodiment of a transformation that has changed the face of not just the oil and gas industries, but of geopolitics as well.In the darkest days of the collapse of oil prices in the mid-1980s, McClendon, as ever undeterred, saw an opportunity in assembling packages of drilling rights – for gas, not oil – either to be sold to bigger companies or to be drilled. In the mere existence of that opportunity, America is almost unique, because it is one of the few countries where private citizens, rather than governments, own the mineral rights under their properties. In order to drill, you just have to persuade someone to give you a lease. McClendon became what’s known in the oil and gas business as a “land man” – the person who negotiates the leases that allow for drilling. That, it turned out, would make him the perfect person for the new world of fracking, which is not so much about finding the single gusher as it is about assembling the rights to drill multiple wells. “Landmen were always the stepchild of the industry,” he later told Rolling Stone. “Geologists and engineers were the important guys – but it dawned on me pretty early that all their fancy ideas aren’t worth very much if we don’t have a lease. If you’ve got the lease and I don’t, you win.”In 1983, when McClendon was just 24 years old, he went into partnership with another Oklahoman named Tom Ward, “doing deals for scraps of land in Oklahoma, faxing each other in the middle of the night,” Ward said to Rolling Stone. Six years later, the two formed Chesapeake Energy, which was named after the beloved bay where McClendon’s family vacationed. They seeded it with a $50,000 investment.Neither Ward nor McClendon were technological pioneers. That distinction, most people agree, goes to a man named George Mitchell, who drew on research done by the government to experiment on the Barnett Shale, an area of tight rock in the Fort Worth basin of North Texas. Using a combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, Mitchell’s team cracked the code for getting gas out of rock that was thought to be impermeable.“As oxygen is to life, capital is to the oil and gas business,” said Andrew Wilmot, a Dallas-based mergers and acquisitions adviser to the oil and gas industry at Purposed Ventures. “This industry needs capital to fire on all cylinders, and the founder and father of raising capital for shale in the US is Aubrey McClendon.”“To be able to borrow money for 10 years and ride out boom-and-bust cycles was almost as important an insight as horizontal drilling,” McClendon, with typical immodesty, said to Rolling Stone.On 12 February 1993 – a day McClendon would later describe as the best of his career – he and Ward took Chesapeake public. They did so despite the fact that their accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, had issued a “going concern” warning, meaning its bean-counters worried that Chesapeake might go out of business. So McClendon and Ward simply switched accounting firms. “Tom and I were 33-year-old landmen at the time, and most people didn’t think we had a clue what we were doing, and probably in hindsight they were at least partially right,” McClendon told an interviewer in 2006.In the decade before 2004, Chesapeake spent around $6bn acquiring properties, companies and leases. McClendon, who would later call these years the “the great North American land grab”, developed a reputation among his peers for overpaying. His aggressiveness didn’t endear him to the old-time oil men. “Everyone in Midland hated Chesapeake,” one said. “They came out here when land was leasing for $200-$300 an acre. All of a sudden, Chesapeake was paying $2,000-$3,000. They got in some good places because they shut everyone else out. Their attitude was: ‘We are Chesapeake, get out of our way.’”McClendon went on a corporate spending spree that would have put today’s Silicon Valley chieftains to shame. “Asking me what to do with extra cash is like asking a fraternity boy what to do with the beer,” McClendon told Natural Gas Intelligence in 2005. Nor was he frugal when it came to his personal life. He acquired multimillion-dollar mansions and resorts in Oklahoma, Bermuda, Maui, Vail, on Lake Michigan, and even in Minnesota. He had one of the best wine collections in the world.To Wall Street investors, McClendon was delivering on what they wanted most: consistency and growth. His pitch was that fracking had transformed the production of gas from a hit-or-miss proposition to one that operated with an on and off switch. It was manufacturing, not wildcatting. He became a flag-waver for natural gas – “Mr Gas”, as Fortune magazine once called him.“Aubrey was the first one to say, ‘Let’s create demand,’” Chesapeake’s Henry Hood said.Back in 2003, when McClendon was just getting started, the consensus view had been that the US was running out of natural gas. It became a fixation for Alan Green, the once-revered chair of the Federal Reserve, who warned Congress during a rare appearance that the shortage and rising cost of gas could hurt the American economy. Green recommended that the US build terminals to accept deliveries of liquefied natural gas from other countries. “We see a storm brewing on the horizon,” said Billy Tauzin, a Republican representative from Louisiana and the then-chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. Such fears eventually helped push through the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which exempted natural gas drillers from having to disclose the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, thus averting costly regulatory oversight.McClendon’s bullish view on prices became the conventional wisdom in energy markets. In 2007, the supposedly smartest investors in the world – among them Goldman Sachs and the takeover titan KKR – structured their massive $45bn buyout of a utility called TXU in a way that was essentially a bet that natural gas prices, then around $7, were set to rise significantly.At the same time, Vladimir Putin was making similar bets. In an attempt to set up a cartel for gas, the Russian premier hosted a group of gas-producing countries, including Algeria, Iran, and Venezuela, in Moscow. The US was not among them. “Costs of exploration, gas production and transportation are going up,” Putin said. “It means the industry’s development costs will skyrocket. The time of cheap energy resources, cheap gas, is surely coming to an end.”When the going got rough, McClendon had always survived by borrowing yet more money to acquire more properties. “Simply put, low prices cure low prices as consumers are motivated to consume more and producers are compelled to produce less,” he wrote in Chesapeake’s 1998 annual report. But he had forgotten the flipside of that industry truism. Time and again, in commodity markets, high prices encourage more producers to produce, creating a surplus, that then crushes prices – and producers. “He was right that shale changed the world,” said one longtime gas man. “He should have listened to himself.”The price of natural gas began to plunge in 2012, and in 2014, the price of oil followed suit. Falling prices quickly exposed the weak underbelly of US shale – its high costs and ravenous need for capital. Once-booming US production hit the skids. The so-called rig count – the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas at a given time – fell from 1,920 rigs in late 2014 to a low of 480 in early 2016. “We think it likely that to find a lower level of activity would require going back to the 1860s, the early part of the Pennsylvania oil boom,” Paul Hornsell, head of commodities research for Standard Chartered bank, wrote in a research note. By mid-2016, US oil production had declined by 1m barrels a day.One after another, debt-laden companies began to declare bankruptcy, with some 200 of them eventually going bust. In a report released in the fall of 2016, credit rating agency Moody’s called the corporate casualties “catastrophic”. “When all the data is in, including 2016 bankruptcies, it may very well turn out that this oil and gas industry crisis has created a segment-wide bust of historic proportions,” said David Keisman, a Moody’s senior vice-president.Some of those who had bought assets from McClendon and others in the heyday also began to write down the value of what they had purchased. Statoil, the Norwegian energy giant, wrote down the value of its shale and Canadian oil sands assets by $4bn Royal Dutch Shell reported a write-down of more than $8bn. Most prominent was Australia’s BHP Billiton, which had spent $5bn investing with Chesapeake in the Fayetteville shale and ploughed another $15bn into the purchase of Houston-based Petrohawk. BHP put all the assets on the block in the fall of 2014, but found no buyers, and eventually wrote off more than $7bn – which begat the phrase “pulling a BHP”.As one investor put it: “All of the acquisitions of shale assets done by the majors and by international companies have been disasters. The wildcatters made a lot of money, but the companies haven’t.”The shale boom towns suddenly resembled their California counterparts after the gold rush. In the Cline shale east of Midland in Texas, Devon Energy decreased its rig activity and let its leases expire, citing “a lot of variability” in the formation. In the town of Sweetwater, “ambitions are fading fast as the plummeting price of oil causes investors to pull back, cutting off the projects that were supposed to pay for a bright new future,” wrote the Associated Press in early 2015. “Now the town of 11,000 awaits layoffs and budget cuts and defers its dreams.”Surveying the carnage in the spring of 2016, then ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson told a gathering of analysts that due to the huge amount of debt most companies in the industry had accumulated, he couldn’t even find anything worth buying.When Aubrey McClendon died in his car, colliding with a concrete wall supporting an overpass at 90mph, it was hard not to see his death as the punctuation marking the end of an era. As the Australian hedge fund manager John Hempton asked: “Is Chesapeake the model for this business? It changes the world, but it ends in tears?”  This is an edited extract from Saudi America by Bethany McLean, which will be published by Columbia Global Reports on 12 September.

But it is worth looking at some facts – not always the highest-value commodity in the Brexit debate.Traders interpreted this to be an opening to Theresa May’s Chequers proposals, under which the UK would benefit from something akin to single market access for its traders in agricultural and industrial goods, and a friction-free customs border. But Barnier last uttered these words on 2 August during a press conference in Brussels in which he forensically tore apart the prime minister’s white paper, warning that its ideas on a new customs arrangement and trade in goods represented a threat to the integrity of the EU.Handily, Barnier himself explained a little better in an interview aired on Thursday with the German radio station Deutschlandfunk. “We have been willing to form a strong relationship from the beginning,” Barnier told the station. “Twenty-seven heads of state and government, including Angela Merkel and the French president and other heads of state, have proposed a unique partnership with the United Kingdom.”The deal was, he said, unprecedented in that it went further than mere agreement on tariff-free trade, taking in areas from “aviation to university and research cooperation, to internal and external security and foreign policy”. Barnier said of the EU’s offer: “It cannot be built to the detriment of who we are. The internal market, the home market, is indeed our most important asset ... We respect all the red lines of the United Kingdom. They do not want to abide by the rules of the court of justice, they do not want to follow our legal framework, they do not want to pay, they do not want freedom of movement. All of these are the cornerstones of the single market and the EU. So we have to preserve and protect what makes us.”The Chequers proposal is dead, the zombie white paper just doesn’t know it yet. So what to make of the suggestion in the Times (paywall) that because the French president, Emmanuel Macron, has a vision of a Europe of “concentric circles”, with the EU and the euro at its core and Britain in a second ring, there is reason to believe that Paris is softening to May’s proposals? The idea of a multi-speed Europe has done the rounds before. Macron raised it last September in a major speech outlining his plans for a “profound transformation” of Europe. But where does the UK really fit in? Again, handily, Macron gave a speech on Monday to French ambassadors gathered from around the world in which he spelled out what he actually thinks. It offered Downing Street little succour. Brexit, he said, was akin to the elevation of Donald Trump to the White House: an example of the “extremism” that prospers from the rage of those who feel they have lost to globalisation, and to which the French president has set himself in opposition. Of the deal that might be struck with the UK, the door to Chequers was firmly shut. “Brexit is a sovereign choice which must be respected, but it is a choice which cannot be made at the expense of the European Union’s integrity,” Macron told his diplomats. “It is what the British people have chosen for themselves, not for others, and France would like to maintain a strong, special relationship with London, but not at the cost of the European Union breaking up.”It was certainly London’s right to champion the benefits of Brexit, the French president said. That “is one thing ... but we have to defend the integrity of our values, of our foundations and of the European Union”. To echo the British prime minister’s words during her disastrous general election campaign, this time really nothing has changed."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3a8d6027b1a3ee1335c8febac8751c4722a5ec40/0_45_1731_1039/master/1731.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b6ccf1943b5b7344bb826edcfdd3579f","title":"feline hungry an expert guide to feeding cats","story":"Your cat may act like it can look after itself but, like a teenager, it’s definitely underselling how much it needs you – especially when it comes to nutrition. Here’s how to get it rightCats are masters of being able to wind their owners around their little claws, and as a result they make us believe they are desperately in need of feeding when in fact, they’re not. Despite what we think, cats have no social aspect to eating. In other words, they don’t love us for it.Portion sizes should be followed according to the type of food you are feeding (most feeds have a guide for portion sizes on the pack, or offer a nutritional advice helpline) and according to the breed, build, age and activity level of your cat. A rough guide would be an urban outdoor cat that weighs about 4kg would need about 300kcal a day. If your cat is an indoor-only animal of about the same weight, this would reduce to 200kcal a day.The type of cat you have will affect what they need to eat to stay fit and healthy. Long-haired cats benefit from a different food to their shorter haired cousins, while bigger breeds such as Maine coons have a larger skeleton, so benefit from more joint support than others.The shape of the cat’s jaw can determine how and if they eat a kibble, which is why different breeds benefit from a specific shape. Cat jaws are designed to move up and down, not side to side, so they can tear at food rather than chew – and you’ll find cats eat in one of three different ways:Cats are very fussy about how food feels in their mouth and texture is very important to cats – more so, in fact, than taste, as they have relatively few taste buds compared with humans. They also need fresh drinking water at all times.SiameseThese animals are long, lean and athletic, and benefit from a diet to support muscle tone – one that has more protein and less fat. Their jaw is a specific triangular shape, so they need a kibble that works with their natural eating action, encouraging them to crunch their food.Bengal An athletic breed that benefits from a higher level of protein but also fat to fuel their activity. A diet that will help maintain its very distinctive coat is also desirable containing specific amino acids, vitamins and omega fats aimed specifically at skin and coat health.Maine coon Maine coon owners should have an awareness of the heart health issues associated with this large, heavy breed. Make sure its diet has the right energy density so that you’re not encouraging weight gain.Norwegian forest catLike other cats with longer coats, the Norwegian forest cat often needs a food that contains specific fibres such as psyllium, which help to naturally move hair swallowed during grooming through the digestive tract – as without the right care and nutrition, hairballs can be an issue.SphynxThese hairless cats are covered with a light down, but they can struggle to maintain their body temperature and so benefit from a food with a higher fat content to provide extra energy for their active metabolism. Keeping their skin healthy is also a priority. RagdollAnother long-haired cat with a broad jaw, these benefit from a pyramid-shaped kibble that is easy to grasp and encourage crunching. As with other heavier cats, they benefit from food with additional health nutrients, such as glucosamine and chondroitin to support joint health.Whatever the breed, Royal Canin offer a wide variety of wet and dry foods tailored to your cat’s inidual nutrition needs.

There’s no purrrfect answer, but the Celia Hammond Sanctuary manages to care for almost 300 if that’s a guide. Here’s how, plus an FAQ for every multi-cat householdThere is a place deep in the Sussex countryside where the four-legged residents reign supreme. They’re dozing in flowerpots, stretching in shady spots and exploring local woodlands at first glance, it seems like 100 acres of feline paradise. But the path to the Celia Hammond Rehoming Centre and Sanctuary has not been easy for the 120 cats who now roam free across the grounds, rescued as they were from often appalling conditions.“It all started during my modelling career, when a group of houses near us were threatened with demolition,” explains founder Celia Hammond, who graced the covers of Vogue during the 1960s. “There were cats inside, so obviously we had to do something. Some friends and I got some equipment together and saved them. Then people started calling me about other rescues, first every week and then every day, until it really started overtaking my work.”Celia first had the idea for a cat-friendly country house when she needed to move – accompanied by the rescue animals she had accumulated. It took her two years to find it: “We needed somewhere that was totally on its own. And then I found this place.”As the number of cats grew, Celia started looking for somewhere they could truly make themselves at home. Aptly known as Greenacres, the site took two years to find and includes stables, ancient and replanted woodland, a range of local wildlife including foxes and badgers, and (perhaps surprisingly) a wide variety of birds. At its heart is the 40-pen cattery, which currently holds around 150 cats waiting to become someone’s pet, and the main house, which live-in staff share with as many of the feral and semi-feral residents as want to join them – this central section is enclosed by a fence, designed to let cats through but keep other animals out.“The bulk of our work goes on in the rehoming centre,” explains Carolyn McBeath, the assistant manager at Greenacres. “That’s always our goal. It’s only when cats have multiple or chronic conditions and we haven’t been able to find the right place for them that they might get released into the sanctuary.” This is done slowly, first by housing a bonded group of cats in their own special “chalet” then setting them free once they’ve acclimatised.So what’s the secret to keeping the peace among this furry legion? “Primarily it’s only having cats here who are used to other cats, and using our intuition and expertise to know which ones will suit this environment,” says McBeath. “But another key consideration is space, so if they want to go off on their own and not see anyone they can. I think we all have days like that.” Neutering reduces their impulse to fight, and having adequate resources such as feeding stations, scratching posts and resting places ensures there’s nothing to fight over.There are those who believe cats are naturally solitary animals but, from its years of rescuing and rehoming family groups, the Celia Hammond Animal Trust has developed its own point of view. “All we can say is that our experience is very different,” says McBeath. “And while you can never generalise, we do find that most cats would like the opportunity of a mum or sibling playmate.”One such group is a young family brought in by their owner, who was facing eviction and unable to keep them. “The little ginger baby is just besotted with his dad and his dad is besotted with the mum, and they’re just so gregarious and happy and normal. We couldn’t split them up: we’re looking for a very special home that is able to love all three.”Clinical animal behaviourist Helen Greenley and Royal Canin scientific communications manager Vikki Anderson share their advice for a harmonious feline household.Are cats naturally sociable?“Research has found that cats will choose solitary or group living depending on availability of resources in their environment,” says Greenley. “In this way, the cat has become an amazingly adaptable and successful species – a sort of Bear Grylls among domestic animals.”How can I tell if my cats have bonded?“The group scent is the glue that bonds cats together and helps them feel relaxed in each other’s presence. This is transferred by touch against one another, so you may see them grooming or sleeping next to each other,” says Greenley. “Other affiliative behaviours include a chirruped greeting, bunting (bumping faces) and twining their tails together.”And how can I tell if they haven’t?“Non-bonded cats can live together in apparent harmony, but if you look closely, they do not display any of the scent-sharing behaviours. They have learned to tolerate each other – not ideal and can be a potential source of chronic, low level stress,” says Greenley.What’s the best way to manage feeding time?“It’s important to realise that in most group situations cats are not comfortable having to share water stations, food and litter trays, so it’s essential to have enough for each cat,” says Anderson. “It might be tempting to have their bowls in a neat row in the kitchen, but they should be an absolute minimum of one metre between them. Different rooms are even better.”What if one of my cats is eating all the food?“It can help to understand natural cat feeding patterns,” says Anderson. “They are natural grazers, eating lots of small meals throughout the day, but having multiple cats in the household can lead them to eat as much as possible in a sitting, leading to weight gain. To remedy this, activity feeders are great for encouraging cats’ natural grazing habits while meeting their need to play and hunt, making sure cats’ feeding stations are in low-traffic, possibly raised areas allows them to relax and eat their own food undisturbed.”Whether you’re the proud owner of a single pet or a burgeoning cattery, Royal Canin offers tailor-made breed-, age- and lifestyle-specific cat food, in wet and dry form, for optimum feline health.

Here’s what your cat’s age really means – and how to handle the changes that come with itOnce kittens pass the newborn phase, where they should be with their mothers, and begin to grow and engage with the outside world, they will discover play. Kitten play mimics moves that would be used for hunting such as stalking, ambushing and pawing. Help your kitten hone these skills, which also keep them active, by making time to play with them using age- and size-appropriate toys.TrainingToilet training should start using a size-appropriate litter tray as soon as your kitten comes home. Gentle grooming and recall training can start now too, use treats to encourage them to respond to their name when called, or use a clicker just before you feed them so they associate that with reward.FeedingWeaned kittens do not need any kind of cat or kitten milk, but they do need a good quality protein-rich food. “Kittens have immature digestive systems and so need an easily digestible food, and once they have stopped feeding from their mother they need to build up their own immunity, so food must have the right nutrients, such as an antioxidant complex, to help bridge the gap while they are developing their own systems,” explains Hannah Poile, scientific communications manager at Royal Canin.Kittens go from sucking, to licking to crunching a kibble, so food that is hydratable is desirable. “A growth formula with calcium and phosphorous in the right levels to promote skeletal growth is also best for them at this stage,” says Poile.Between three and six months your kitten is headed towards sexual maturity, so it’s best to have your kitty neutered (and microchipped). Liaise with your vet around exact timings. After neutering it’s best to change to a specific neutered kitten diet, this will ensure they’re still getting all the nutrients they need for healthy growth, but will take into account the specific needs following this procedure.Your kitten should be fully grown by 12 months, unless it is a larger breed such as a Maine coon, which may not reach its adult size until around 15 months. During this phase – you could refer to it as the equivalent of teenage years in humans – your cat will become more demanding of both their owner and the world they live in. Keep them entertained by making sure there is plenty to stimulate them mentally and physically.Continue with grooming and introduce ear and teeth checks, perhaps follow this up with attention and affection rather than treats to prevent any issues with weight.FeedingAn appropriate older kitten food that will give the right level of nutrition for this second growth phase is best, along with food that specifically promotes balance in their intestinal flora is also recommended.This is prime time for your cat: they should be physically fit and well, with a glossy coat, bright eyes and plenty of get up and go. They will be hunting regularly (if they have access to outside spaces) or play hunting if an indoor cat.At this stage, your cat will respond well to games, so keep their toys varied and available, especially for indoor cats keep their weight monitored, teeth clean and stay up to date with worming, flea treatments and annual boosters.FeedingAged 12 months it’s time to transition your cat from kitten to adult food. “Make sure you are feeding it an activity-appropriate diet. Are they an indoor or an outdoor cat?” says Poile. “Indoor cats are generally less active and, if not fed a diet with the right level of calories, can easily gain weight.”“Naturally, cats eat little and often – they are grazers and will have up to 15 sittings a day. If you are supporting the species as it would eat naturally you would have food down for them so they can go back to it when they want it, activity feeders are great for encouraging natural feeding habits.”By the age of seven your cat will start to experience the early and often invisible changes that come with ageing. They may be more prone to weight gain, dental problems and joint issues. Help by making sure they keep active through play and monitor any changes in their coat, behaviour or feeding pattern. Encourage activity with a variety of mixed toys. Make sure they have to work a bit to get their food – they enjoy seeking it out.FeedingHelp to support your cat as they start to face the first signs of ageing with a diet adapted to this life stage containing targeted nutrients, such as vitamins and green tea polyphenols, to help maintain their vitality. Don’t forget to keep checking your cat’s body condition score and adapt their feeding amounts to keep them at a healthy bodyweight.At this age, your cat is likely to start to experience age-related health issues such as joint pain, a reduction in kidney function, weight loss and a decline in activity. They can also become fussy about food and may be less able to adapt to changes in their environment, so it’s best not to introduce any major changes to their routine or domestic life. Your cat may begin to show signs of cognitive dysfunction towards the older end of this life stage, monitor their behaviour for signs of confusion, which should be discussed with your vet.Feeding“A senior diet is very important for this age group,” says Poile. “Just as with kittens, older cats need food that supports their changing appetites, many older cats become fussier about their diet and may appreciate an adapted kibble or wet food. Kidney health is also a concern as cats age and it is important for regular checkups at the vet, as well as to feed a diet with an adapted level of phosphorous.”The elderly cat can struggle with regulating body temperature and have fairly extensive dental issues – oral disease or tooth loss can make eating difficult. So, it’s important to provide a palatable and digestible diet.Your cat may lose weight for no obvious reason, monitor their condition, coat and overall behaviour. Any concerns should be raised with your vet. They may struggle to groom regularly as they become less flexible, so maintain regular grooming sessions with them.Your cat is likely to sleep more and can be prone to senile changes. They can seem to be lost, unable to find their food or water or usual sleeping place, so be there to care for them.FeedingAs cats age, their bodies are less able to process and get nutrients from their food, so weight loss can occur. Be sure to feed them an age-appropriate food that has a high palatability and increased calorie content. Older cats can have issues with their sense of smell so a food with a rich aroma can help.All kittens should be fed according to the size they will become as an adult cat.

Rarely has a season offered such opportunity for those bold enough to reach out and seize it: a World Cup is on the horizon and a can-do attitude could yet transform the careers of players who put their best foot forward.What the English Premiership, now backed by the American insurance broker Gallagher, lacks in terms of healthy annual profits will not bother the warriors strapping on their body armour. By common consent the league is more cut-throat than ever, with no certainties beyond the fact Saracens and Exeter will again be near the top of the pile. Those embracing this liberating sense of possibility stand a better chance of success than those clinging to past\u0026nbspglories.Because, as the Sale director of rugby, Steve Diamond, pithily observed this week, this is shaping up to be a campaign unlike any of its predecessors. “I think it’s different to how it’s ever been. There are two teams head and shoulders above the rest – Saracens and Exeter – and then there is a pack of 10. I don’t think we can say who’s going to struggle with the same clarity we’ve always had.” Spot-on.Many are nominating Worcester as the favourites for the drop, even though they won at Sandy Park and had too much for Gloucester, Newcastle and Harlequins in the second half of last season. If anyone should be nervous it is surely Quins, beaten in their concluding five games of 2017-18 and just starting out under new management. Having rejected the high-class services of Ben Ryan and Shaun Edwards, the club’s hierarchy will be praying Paul Gustard proves a wise choice as John Kingston’s\u0026nbspsuccessor.In that regard the first three weeks will be hugely instructive, not least Bristol’s sparkly opener under lights against Bath at Ashton Gate on Friday. In their last Premiership incarnation two seasons ago Bristol did not register a victory until Boxing Day. This time the newly styled and beefed-up Bears have no intention of being prematurely stuffed, with their inspirational coach, Pat Lam, aiming for the top six. In that event, there will be some seriously displeased club owners in the table’s bottom half.Along with Bath, already without the injured Anthony Watson and Jonathan Joseph, even Wasps and Leicester have a battle on their hands to guarantee European qualification. Like it or not Wasps will miss Danny Cipriani’s wrists of gold, and Jimmy Gopperth’s season-ruining knee injury is extremely untimely. Leicester find themselves in even less familiar territory, having failed to reach the play-offs last season for the first time since 2004. A fit and firing Manu Tuilagi would help but the big man’s career now has an element of Waiting for Godot attached.Gloucester, on the other hand, are a side with the fresh artillery to surprise a few. Jaco Kriel and Franco Mostert will stiffen their pack, as will their fellow South Africans Franco Marais, Gerbrandt Grobler and Ruan Dreyer. Biltong sales in the Cotswolds could shortly soar and so, too, will Cipriani’s stock if he succeeds in putting his recent cameo role in Bergerac behind him.Newcomers to the world’s most unpredictable league such as Northampton’s Chris Boyd will find it a relentless experience, with last season’s pacesetters still out in front. The received wisdom that Exeter need to find a tactical plan B fails to reflect the certainty that Rob Baxter and his coaches will locate one. Stand by, too, for the sight of Matt Kvesic reminding everyone what an influential player he can be.Which leaves Saracens, title winners last season despite a string of injuries. In a league that could yet see a resurgence in specialist breakdown predators – Kvesic, Kriel, Tom Curry, Sam Underhill, Thomas Young, Lewis Ludlow, Heinrich Brüssow – keep an eye on young Ben Earl who, alongside a fit-again Michael Rhodes and Billy Vunipola, has the ability to propel Saracens to further silverware. The 2019 World Cup, for the moment, can wait.

There are fewer still where you can reach out and touch the fabric on which this tradition has been built. The past is still very much in evidence but at this weekend’s Italian Grand Prix, for Ferrari and for Monza, the future is very much the most immediate concern.Walk the grounds inside the track and its grand history is clear. It is being maintained and developed as a sort of automotive listed building. Here is the swathe of banking from the 1950s and inside it one of the original cobbled turns from its incarnation in 1922. They sit amid trees and bushes, majestic reminders of just how long the Parco di Monza has gloried in motor racing.For Ferrari, the honour in winning here matters more than anywhere. They are favourites to do so on Sunday with Sebastian Vettel, who may well be in the process of writing his name alongside Ferrari’s greats.The Scuderia have not won at Monza since Fernando Alonso did so in 2010 and have not won a drivers’ championship since Kimi Räikkönen took the crown in 2007. Their fans are anxious both droughts be ended and historically home wins have heralded further glories.In 1979 Jody Scheckter took his only win at the track and in doing so the title for Ferrari, who also secured the constructors’ championship. In 1964 John Surtees, who had been nicknamed figlio del vento – son of the wind – lived up to it, matching his wins on motorcycles at Monza with one on four wheels. The title was his two races later in Mexico City.Vettel is a keen student of the sport and will know these moments but perhaps be most conversant with just how much it meant when Michael Schumacher took the title for Ferrari, 21 years after Scheckter. In 2000 his win at Monza was crucial. The victory over Mika Häkkinen took him to within two points of the Finn. Two races later he was champion in Japan.It had taken Schumacher five seasons to deliver for Ferrari. Vettel is now in his fourth but in the best possible position to emulate his great countryman. The Ferrari’s pace advantage should serve them well and he trails Lewis Hamilton by only 17 points. For Vettel, adding his name to Ferrari folklore with a home win is only half the job done. He will want to ride the wave from Monza to the title.Should he do so, the tifosi will take to him all the more, which it has to be hoped is good for Monza, a circuit which like so many others is feeling the weight of the financial burden of hosting fees agreed with Bernie Ecclestone. The circuit’s deal with F1 ends after next year and this month Angelo Sticchi Damiani, the president of the Automobile Club d’Italia, warned that as things stand there is no guarantee it could continue to host the race. “We closed last year’s race with a strong loss and the 2018 budget will not be different either,” he told Gazzetta dello Sport. “It is clear such a situation is not sustainable in the long term. The ACI is ready to do its part but not under any conditions.”In the short term Damiani would like a Ferrari victory on Sunday in memory of Sergio Marchionne, the team’s former chief executive who died in July. “A victory in Monza would be the best way to honour his memory,” he said and it will be an emotional moment for that reason alone should the team deliver. But in the long term there are reasons to be optimistic Monza will reach a compromise with F1’s owners Liberty Media.Spa recently renewed their deal, with what is understood to be far more generous terms in hosting fees and Hockenheim was reported to have done a deal for next year’s race having also agreed a lower fee. Liberty do not like negotiating in public but it does engage in constructive negotiation and is aware some of its venues bring a history, passion and tradition that cannot be bought.As Derek Bell, who made his F1 debut for Ferrari at Monza, told motorsport. “If it is the only race you are going to do in your life it has to be Monza. It is something different. It is the high speed, the atmosphere, the history, the oval, all the things that are part of that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/acf34e0c2fb2cdf50691ad55bbfb61372177a58f/0_68_2100_1260/master/2100.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c0473ff103b20b5206fdb636d89f161a","title":"us open tennis heatwave new york","story":"As temperatures soar in New York, we take a look at how the players and fans deal with the hot conditions at the US Open, where it was described as “dangerous” as five men had to retire from their first-round matches on Tuesday alone "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/075538f32d7903715f8e6504008df9ea68983e69/54_194_3019_1811/master/3019.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=97cc7f82fa6fa9c1067dba56d7db4896","title":"county cricket lancashire v worcestershire surrey v notts and more live","story":"Notts in trouble: 263.

Three quick wickets for Chris Rushworth.A wicket at Southport -nightwatchman Lester caught by Twohig off a super ball from Tongue for 8.Eeek, a wicket in the third over at the Ageas where Jennings, who Lancashire would love to have here, is lbw without playing a shot (the Lancashire disease?!)And that’s a fifth wicket for Jack Brooks as Jamie Overton edges to the slips. Somerset 3759Apologies in advance about today’s sporadic posting - wifi still a bit iffy. Just entertain yourselves btl (which is what you’ re here for anyway!). Lovely crowd pottering in , pensioners, kids, lots of slim-legged men in their seventies with backpacks and cagouls. County cricket fans do seem mostly thin. The nerves? The despair?England win the toss and will bat, as will Essex.Hello again from Southport where the players are warming up in the middle in woolly hats - late season fast becoming a mirror image of early.England and India (unchanged for the first time in 41 Tests) resume hostilities at the Ageas Bowl, Pope really has been released now, and equally interesting things are afoot in the County Championship.Lancashire are in trouble here after late-evening shenaningans against Worcestershire, while Surrey wriggle into their usual position of dominance at The Oval, with Mark Stoneman just a run away from his first century of the season - good luck there old chap. Somerset grind, grind Yorkshire into the dust (374-8) and the sun is shining at Chelmsford. In Division two, cross your fingers for Ian Bell magic at Colwyn Bay after Glamorgan rallied to make a game of it against Warwickshire  Daniel Bell-Drummond is 41 not out at The County Ground, where Kent are batting like a dream against Derby. Sixteen wickets fell at Chester-le-Street - that one could be over today - and 16 more at Lord’s. Still time to call the go-slow at Bristol."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/911607106650264ef945f04fb56b48a92e91595f/0_154_3658_2195/master/3658.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c973033fc27f1cca04e246cb990c48cc","title":"england v india fourth test day one live","story":"Ben Stokes’s dogged 79-ball innings is over. He played around a good delivery from Shami, who had just switched around the wicket, and was given out by Bruce Oxenford. Stokes reviewed, more in hope than expectation, but Hawkeye showed three reds. England lose their sixth wicket and their final review.34th over: England 85-5 (Stokes 23, Ali 4) Shami puts some ice on his bowling hand between overs. Stokes and Moeen pick up a single each in a quiet over from Sharma. His figures are outstanding: 10-6-9-1. 33rd over: England 83-5 (Stokes 22, Ali 3) Stokes is beaten by the most beautiful delivery from Shami, on a full length and zipping away off the seam. A straight drive from Stokes, played on the walk, is fielded painfully in his follow through by Shami. It’s his bowling hand but he’s okay to finish the over. Stokes is playing with a lot of determination, discpline and intelliegnce he has 22 from 72 balls. “I disagree with John Starbuck’s implication that bowlers make better captains than batsmen,” says Steve Hudson. “There have been many fewer specialist bowler captains, which reflects the fact that bowlers, especially the quicker ones, have too much think about when bowling to captain a side, and are often too drained by their efforts afterwards to remain fully engaged with the game. Specialist bowlers who have captained the England Test team? Willis, and very few others. Willis actually used to delegate the captaincy to other players while he was actually bowling.”Yes, good point about fast bowlers. It’s yet another reason why Imran Khan is possibly the most underrated cricketer to play the game. 32nd over: England 82-5 (Stokes 21, Ali 3) Moeen, like Stokes, is playing his unnatural game, trying to hang around until things get easier. I’m not sure they’re going to get easier. A beautiful outswinger from Sharma finds Moeen’s edge and lands short of the slip cordon. It’s another maiden. Sharma has now received an official warning for running on the danger area in his follow through.“Yes, South Africa lost the first Test of the 20078 home series against the West Indies in Port Elizabeth,” says Andrew Gladwin. “But they did win the next two and the series. And less than a year later they became the first team in 16 years to beat Australia in Australia. Thinking about why they did so well overseas and less well at home, I’m wondering whether the big hostile crowds in England, Australia and India fired them up, while the poor home crowds especially in Durban and Port Elizabeth may have deflated them. Would also explain why they did best in Cape Town which always has good Test crowds.”31st over: England 82-5 (Stokes 21, Ali 3) Shami’s eighth over goes for 11 - but it almost includes the wicket of Ben Stokes. Ali pushed three through gully, Stokes clipped four through square leg and then a loose delivery flew away for four byes. The last ball found Stokes’s edge and landed this far short of gully.“Dear Rob, says Abhyudaya Tyagi. “Can i just say that the Indian Test Team between the 2007 World Cup and the 2011 World Cup remains severely underrated. Defeated everyone (except for South Africa- whom they drew with) at home. Meanwhile beat England, New Zealand, West Indies in series away from home while drawing with South Africa’s greatest ever side in 2011. India only lost two series in that period - 2-1 in Australia (cough Steve Bucknor cough) and 2-1 to Sri Lanka in that crazy MuraliMendis series. Arguably a better team than Ganguly’s India.”Yes, that’s a fair point. They won in Perth, which was a huge deal, and the series in South Africa was immense. It’s strange that they were so pathetic in England in 2011. Maybe, and I know how unpalatable this is for those of who accentuate the negative, England just played spectacularly good cricket. 30th over: England 71-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 0) Sharma is staying around the wicket to Stokes - I’m surprised he didn’t start there - and is still getting some dangerous outswing. Stokes softens his hands to ensure an edge drops well short of slip. He has become England’s best defensive batsman. It’s an admirable development, especially as it does not come at all naturally. 29th over: England 71-5 (Stokes 17, Ali 0) “On plumb LBWs, has anyone mentioned dear old Nasser getting out to a filthy Carl Hooper shooter?” says Tim Sorrell. “He was unimpressed, as I recall. Carl Hooper!”There’s a lovely story, I think it’s in Nasser’s autobiography, about that wicket. He had all kinds of bad luck at the start of that tour - I think in one game he was out to the seventh ball of an over, and he had to bat on that deathtrap in Jamaica. After the Hooper dismissal, he was ranting and raving in the dressing-room and he looked over to see his captain, Mike Atherton, desperately trying to suppress a fit of the giggles. 28th over: England 69-5 (Stokes 16, Ali 0) If the ball swings like this all day, it might benefit England to be out by tea. Because if they struggle to 180 in 80 overs, and return tomorrow to find the ball doing nothing, Virat Kohli could lap them on his own.With Moeen Ali at the crease, Ishant Sharma replaces Ravichandran Ashwin. Stokes, who is again playing very responsibly, offers no stroke to a series of outswingers from over the wicket. Sharma moves around the wicket for the last ball of the over and beats Stokes with what looks like a slower cutter. Stokes has 16 from 53 balls.“Re: over six,” begins Andrew Gladwin. “I’m biased but I do agree Graeme Smith’s South Africa were was the outstanding test team in the 2007-2014 period. That away record was a magnificent achievement – even better than the Aussies in their early 2000s prime. The thing that stopped them being permanently ahead in the rankings was a slightly iffy home record, especially in Durban for reasons that are not completely clear.”Didn’t they lose a Test at home to the West Indies? How’s that even possible? 27th over: England 69-5 (Stokes 16, Ali 0) ... And then he said England were 2-1 up in the series!Gone! Buttler chases yet another tempting outswinger from Shami and edges a drive towards third slip, where Kohli takes a very sharp two-handed catch to his right. Buttler will know that was a poor stroke.26th over: England 65-4 (Stokes 16, Buttler 17) Ravichandran Ashwin comes into the attack for the first time, a slight surprise given how much the ball has swung. He does have an excellent record against Ben Stokes, while Buttler has struggled against offspin in his short Test career. Stokes defends the first five deliveries and thumps the sixth down the ground for four.“Jeremy Smith (14th over) has some nerve in suggesting Dermot Reeve for obvious LBWs,” says Richard Jansz-Moore. “One of my earliest cricketing memories was seeing him in the 1995 NatWest Trophy being as plumb as possible to Anil Kumble, only to be turned down by Dickie bloody Bird. I’m still furious at the decision 20+ years later. Sadly I can’t find a video of it so you’ll just have to believe me that literally nothing has never been more plumb.”25th over: England 61-4 (Stokes 12, Buttler 17) Come on then, let’s get this over with. Mohammed Shami continues after lunch with some seductive outswing to Buttler, who leaves the first four deliveries and edges the next through the vacant gully area for four at catchable height. Buttler was aiming to leg, a dangerous shot in these conditions, and the ball swung to take the edge.“It was, once upon a time, that the Dr Who theme would have me rushing for safety behind the sofa,” says Charles Sheldrick. “Now I only have to hear the first few bars of Soul Limbo and I am ing for cover...”I know Geoffrey’s back in the box today but that’s a bit much surely.“Choosing the best batsman to skipper a side is bound to be counter-productive,” says John Starbuck. “Responsibility for the bulk of runs will weigh the player down, if there are not enough good bats to take up any slack. Also, there’s no guarantee that a good batsman is necessarily the best one to rotate bowlers, manipulate the field and generally be a leader. Top batters tend to be selfish by nature, and hence have less empathy too much masculinity is a drawback.”I agree the principle is flawed - did we learn nothing from Sachin - but I don’t agree it’s bound to be counter-productive. It has empowered a lot of batsmen to reach greater heights, including those who were eventually worn down by it (Atherton, Hussain, Strauss, Cook).24th over: England 57-4 (Stokes 12, Buttler 13) Stokes survives an LBW shout from Bumrah, with the ball pitching miles outside leg stump. That’s the end of a distressing morning session for England, whose makeshift top order was demolished by some spectacular swing bowling from Jasprit Bumrah and Ishant Sharma. India were brilliant England were not. Batting should get easier as the day progresses, but for who?23rd over: England 56-4 (Stokes 12, Buttler 12) Buttler is dropped by the wicketkeeper Pant! It was a strange incident. Buttler attempted to leave one from Shami and bottom-edged the ball towards Pant, who was on the way up and couldn’t change direction quickly enough to hold on to a very difficult low chance. An eventful over ends with a storming outswinger that beats Stokes all ends up. I really don’t think England have done that much wrong this morning. India have been all over them. “Matt Dony asked when was the last time England had a captain who wasn¹t at some stage accused of allowing the captaincy to affect his run-scoring,” says Tim Brosnan. “Bob Willis?”22nd over: England 53-4 (Stokes 10, Buttler 11) Bumrah returns for an over or two before lunch. Hardik and Shami have not been as threatening as the new-ball pair, even though Hardik dismissed Cook, and Bumrah reminds us of his superior threat by zipping two deliveries past Stokes’s outside edge. 21st over: England 53-4 (Stokes 10, Buttler 11) “Re: plumb LBWs: A special commendation for Courtney Walsh’s slower ball against Graham Thorpe,” says Jon Taylor. “The way Thorpe lost the flight of the looping ball, ducked, jumped, adjusted his feet and still had time to land and hold the pose a short while before being hit on the back foot three inches in front of middle. Beautiful.”20th over: England 50-4 (Stokes 8, Buttler 11) Buttler hits consecutive boundaries off Hardik, with a confident cover drive followed by a bread-and-butter flick off the pads.“Hello Rob,” says Aditi Prabhudesai. “Don’t you think a series loss here at home, after being 2-0 up is just the sort of thing that ought to shake up English cricket. Australia made drastic changes after losing to South Africa at home. England needs just that sort of clearing of the Augean stables. It’s frustrating to watch them make the same mistakes again and again.”I agree. But I’d probably see if it happens first before having a shake-up.19th over: England 42-4 (Stokes 8, Buttler 3) Shami appeals unsuccessfully for a catch down the leg side against Stokes. India decide not to review, and there is no spike on Ultra-Edge.“When was the last time England had a captain who wasn’t at some stage accused of allowing the captaincy to affect his run-scoring?” asks Matt Dony. “The conversation just goes on and on. Seems to me there are two issues. Firstly, every cricketer, every sportsman, heck, every person, has peaks and troughs. (Even me! I know!) No matter how talented and able they are, they’ll have spells where runs dry up. There are so many factors, it’s unhelpful to jump straight to ‘The Captaincy broke him!’ Secondly, even amongst elite players, the kind of mental strength and ability to compartmentalise needed to deal with both is rare. Most players will naturally find that a butt-load of extra responsibility will play on their minds and affect their day job in some way. So, again, it’s unhelpful to jump straight to ‘The Captaincy broke him!’ If it’s felt that the sacrifice is unacceptable, then don’t make your best batsman captain. Otherwise, make sure he’s getting the support he needs, and appreciate that he’s performing two high-pressure roles.”The last man who was captain for a long time without losing form was Graham Gooch. I do think it’s a much bigger problem in England than elsewhere, but I have no idea why. Might have something to do with the media, or even - mememe - the crisis in masculinuity!18th over: England 40-4 (Stokes 6, Buttler 3) That was a weird shot from Cook, whose concentration had been so good until then. England are in quite the predicament here. But this batting performance has been nowhere near as bad as the first innings at Trent Bridge. India have been sensational. I don’t believe this. Cook dabs absentmindedly at a short, wide delivery from Hardik and top-edges it towards third slip, where Kohli takes a brilliant low catch between his legs.17th over: England 36-3 (Cook 17, Stokes 6) Bumrah takes a break after an electric spell of 8-1-20-2. He’s replaced by Mohammed Shami, a darn good second change bowler. Stokes mistimes a short ball through the covers for two. At the risk of tempting fate, batting looks less uncomfortable than it did half an hour ago.This is a good spot from our own Tim de Lisle. “That four by Stokes off Hardik is the first this morning not played by Cook - not a good sign when the Chef is the strokemaker-in-chief.” 16th over: England 34-3 (Cook 17, Stokes 4) Hardik strays onto the pads of Stokes, who puts him away through midwicket for four. Good shot. Stokes is a key player today because he has shown he has the discpline to bat time. England just need to hang in there until mid afternoon. There’s a strangled shout for LBW when Stokes plays around his front pad. It was going down the leg side.We were talking about plumb LBWs earlier. Richard Liddle has spoken for you all by sending in this link.15th over: England 29-3 (Cook 17, Stokes 0) Bumrah was supposed to be a white-ball specialist. His fledgling Test record would suggest otherwise: he has 23 wickets at 22, including 10 at 16 in this series. India look so much more dangerous with him in the team. He can bowl long spells, too. This is his eighth over, and he throws his hands up in frustration when Cook leaves a ball that just misses the stumps. In fairness, I think that was a good leave from Cook, who looks so determined to tough this out. “Hello Rob,” says Som Bandyopadhyay. “Why don’t you guys (you and Andy Bull in particular) get bored doing this OBO thing? I know you guys are OBOing since 200405 (perhaps earlier even) - and that’s a fairly long period of time considering the job description) to watch (or pretend to) and write what you see (and what you do not), and randomly copy-paste emails from random people who wish to see their name published. I mean - what’s there for you? Vic Marks at least goes to the stadium! Cheers!”I’ll give you a clue.14th over: England 29-3 (Cook 17, Stokes 0) Hardik replaces the superb Ishant Sharma (6-3-7-1) and starts with a quiet over, a bit of filler between Bumrahs.13th over: England 28-3 (Cook 16, Stokes 0) “Jennings’ wicket got me thinking: what is the most plumb lbw ever?” writes Jeremy Smith. “Neil Lenham here is one candidate. There’s also Simon Jones vs Brett Lee at Edgbaston in 2005...”Haha. If we’re talking about plumb LBWs that weren’t given…Well this is going well. Bairstow pushes outside off stump at an excellent delivery from Bumrah and snicks through to Pant. He had to play at that - it was angled in and held its line to take the edge.12th over: England 26-2 (Cook 15, Bairstow 5) Cook squirts a Sharma outswinger just short of the ing Rahane, placed deliberately in a kind of short backward point position. He is fighting so hard to survive until lunch, and he’s halfway there. After an exhilarating first hour, it’s time for drinks.“Over the summer, I’m edging towards two rather depressing conclusions,” says Jonathan Wood. “First, the captaincy appears to be adversely affecting Root’s immense cricketing talent. Can we keep on saying his upturn is just around the corner? Secondly, there’s nothing we can do about it. Taking the captaincy away from him, against his own wishes, would be a massive kick in the swingers which could bring other negative impacts. Plus, there’s no one to replace him. Everyone else is either (a) too long in the tooth (b) too green (c) not sure of their own place in the team or (d) Ben Stokes. There’s Bairstow, I suppose, but no. Can you cheer me up on either point, Rob?”All things being equal, Jos Buttler will be the next England captain, but then not many things are equal at the moment. I’m still not sure I would necessarily blame Root’s form on the captaincy though – he averages a very respectable 46 since he took over from Alastair Cook. He was having problems converting fifties long before he became captain, and now he’s just out of nick.11th over: England 25-2 (Cook 15, Bairstow 4) Cook is beaten twice in Bumrah’s over, both from short deliveries outside off stump, and then blocks a yorker.“Pitches wouldn’t be doctored because you would alternate the election to bat or bowl, not just to bat first,” says Jon Howard.Yes but you could still doctor them – flat pitches when the away team have the toss and either green mambas or raging Bunsens when the home team get to choose.10th over: England 21-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 1) Bairstow just manages to repel another booming inswinger from Sharma. As has been noted all summer, Bairstow has changed his technique to open up the off side since returning to the ODI team. That makes him pretty vulnerable when the ball swings back into him. The fifth ball of the over is a monstrous inswinger that cuts Bairstow in half, bounces over middle stump and is spectacularly taken by the keeper Pant, ing high to his left. Bairstow is struggling here. “Given Root’s relative struggles this summer, hopefully we can put to bed the parroting of this ‘Always bat your best batsman at three’ nonsense’,” says Richard Gardham. “It comes from Australia where the Kookaburra ball doesn’t swing as much, and I don’t have the time to list the number of truly great batsmen who’ve tended not to bat at three (but they include the opposition skipper today). England are at their best when they have a nuggety batsman at three: Robin Smith, Nasser Hussain, Jonathan Trott. Sticking the captain there because of a nonsense statement that has little to back it up is poor management.” Yes, I’ve never liked Root at No3. People talk about doing what’s best for the team, but what’s best for the team is Root being happy and scoring runs. I would put him at No4 and fill in the team around him - even if it does mean needing two or even three new batsmen in the top three. I suspect that, from the winter onwards, Root will bat No4 for as long as he is captain. (By the way, Smith didn’t bat at No3 that often No4 was his bestpreferred position.)9th over: England 21-2 (Cook 14, Bairstow 1) What England would give for an ugly, five-hour 88 from Cook. He squeezes a wide yorker to third man for four, and I missed the rest of the over because it’s all frantic this morning. Nothing happened. “If Bumrah is indeed Mr Tickle, as Daniel Harris suggests, then I guess that makes Jennings Mr Jelly on the basis of that remarkable dismissal?” says Brian Withington. “In passing one of my few claims to fame was playing poker with the nephew of the Mr Men author Roger Hargreaves ...”8th over: England 17-2 (Cook 10, Bairstow 1) The new batsman is Jonny Bairstow, in another new role. This has been a spectacular start from India. They lost what looked a vital toss, but instead of feeling sorry for themselves they have roared at England with skill, brains and a murderous purpose. England could be gone by mid-afternoon here because the ball is swinging prodigiously. It’s exhilarating to watch.On the subject of the toss, a few of you have suggested alternating from game to game. A nice idea in theory, but the home side could then doctor pitches accordingly and make home advantage even greater.England are in the malodorous stuff. It was a brilliant delivery from Sharma, which came back a long way to trap Root in front. You can understand why he reviewed but that was pretty plumb.Root is given out LBW to a huge inswinger from Sharma. The only thing that can save him is that he might be outside the line, but I reckon he’s gone.7th over: England 15-1 (Cook 9, Root 4) Bumrah’s new danger ball, the inswinger to the left-hander, is clipped fine for four by Cook. That was slightly too straight.“Hi Rob,” says Graham O’Reilly. “Well done for transmogrifying the debate about home advantage into the crisis of masculinity. Respect!”Whatever the subject, I can always bring the conversation back to myself.6th over: England 10-1 (Cook 5, Root 4) A sizzling yorker from Sharma is dug out by Cook, who is getting a serious working over here. He could do with a single to get down the other end. In the circumstances he’ll take anything, and he squirts an uppish drive behind square for four. This is terrific cricket.“Regarding the toss and teams struggling away, isn’t it just that for two and half decades (1980 to roughly the mid noughties), there were two fantastic, dominant teams who basically won everywhere?” says Phil Harrison. “Since the Aussies came back into the pack post WarneMcGrath et al, there hasn’t been a single outstanding side. England, SA, Pakistan and now India have all had a spell at the top. And when everyone is more evenly matched, there’ll be fewer away wins. Or am I missing something?”I would give more credit to Graeme Smith’s South Africa, who had an outrageously good record overseas. I also think the second tier of teams achieved much more overseas – for example Ganguly’s India, Strauss’s England and Cronje’s South Africa. But you’re right about the overall stats being affected by the lack of one all-time-great team. India could begin to change that in the next eight months, though it’s a sizeable ask.5th over: England 6-1 (Cook 1, Root 4) It was a brilliant delivery from Bumrah, which roared back off the seam to hit the pad. Replays confirm Root would have been out but for the no-ball. Bumrah’s return from injury has had a dramatic impact on this series. “I thought it was bowlers who got the yips,” says Gary Naylor in reference to Jennings’ dismissal. It looked worse than it was, I think – as the chaps on Sky have stressed, Bumrah never usually swings the ball back into the left-handers and that really startled Jennings. But bloody hell, it looked awful.It’s a no-ball from Bumrah! Oh my. We still don’t know whether it was hitting the stumps but it looked seriously close. I reckon it would have been out.This looks very close, an appeal from LBW from Bumrah. This is a huge moment in the series.4th over: England 3-1 (Cook 1, Root 2) Cook is trying to do what he does best - leave the ball. It’s a nice battle of wills, with Sharma trying to tempt him with full outswingers around off stump. Cook is beaten by one delivery but otherwise shows immaculate judgement, and it’s a maiden.3rd over: England 3-1 (Cook 1, Root 2) Joe Root is beaten by another cracking delivery from Bumrah. If England want to prove they can score ugly runs, they have a great opportunity this morning. Bumrah and Sharma have started brilliantly. Root gets off the mark with a clip for two.“Rob,” says Matt Turland. “I agree about the toss thing. All teams have been rotten away from home for a while now but not because of favourable pitches – which have been in abundance since the dawn of time. But why has travelling become so difficult? We could probably blame Twenty20 in some way but it can’t be just because of that, surely? However, I also agree that an away series win should be a big ask of any team. Home advantage has to mean something and we should be neutralising that advantage in the hope of making every series super tight.”Yes, it doesn’t make much sense given globalisation, neutral umpires and the rest. I think there are a few factors – lack of preparation, the crisis of masculinity, the reduced percentage of draws and more cynical pitch preparation. And some others I haven’t thought of, no doubt. What a remarkable dismissal. Keaton Jennings shapes to leave a ball that swings back dramatically to trap him plumb LBW. He was barely halfway through the attempted leave by the time the ball thudded into the pad. It looked hideous, and a startled Jennings almost fell over when it hit the pad. He looked like somebody who slipped on a beer-soaked dancefloor and just managed to retain their balance and their dignity - but not, in this case, their wicket.2nd over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Jennings 0) Ishant Sharma, the left-hander’s nemesis, shares the new ball. His second ball is a stunning outswinger from around the wicket that beats Cook’s nervous push. This is a fine start from India, who know that Cook and Jennings are fighting for their Test careers.In other news, the peerless Tanya Aldred is hosting our county blog, so please pop over. We don’t believe in blogonogamy round these parts.1st over: England 1-0 (Cook 1, Jennings 0) Whatever happened to the loosener? Jasprit Bumrah’s first ball of the match is a cracker that seams and bounces past Cook’s outside edge, and his fourth does likewise to Jennings. This, to coin a phrase, is a big first session because you would expect the ball to do a bit. “As loath as I am to lock horns with a man who bandies the word ‘transmogrify’ around with such ease and confidence, I would take issue with you pitting a love of Test cricket against loving Queen and country,” says Felix Wood. “Loving Test cricket is exactly how I love Queen and country. Any other way is a bit much, frankly. Also, Joe Root would be right to demand R E S P E C T, given that in the last Test, in the parlance of our time, tactically we won, strategically we won.”You see these three fingers? That’s how many times we’ve been bowled out in a session in the last two years. RESPECT. To toss or not to toss“Morning Rob,” says Oliver Smiddy. “I can’t help thinking that the best thing for Test cricket would be to abandon the toss altogether. The visiting captain should automatically be given the choice to bat or bowl first. You would then have groundsmen preparing much more ‘even’ pitches which would offer less of a clear advantage to the side batting first, and you’d help to address the massive disadvantage visiting teams face in Test cricket (borne out by the woeful record of visiting teams in recent years). As per Simon Hughes’ point, India are now up against it without a ball being bowled, which to my mind doesn’t make for a very fair contest.”I’m not sure about this idea – it feels like an overreaction to a new problem of teams being useless away from home. It should be damn hard to win away from home, and it’s performances overseas that separate the great from the very good. I would look at the schedulepreparation first.Here’s the Test Match Special link for overseas readersBefore we start please read this charity appeal on behalf of an incredibly brave young girl. The annual Dan Lucas memorial match took place last month. We all miss Dan terribly, on the OBO and in the office. It sounds like it was a lovely day, full of goodwill and back cricket, and Dan’s girlfriend Elizabeth Aubrey has written in to say thanks.We raised £2050 at the cricket match. So many of the OBO readers donated and quite a few came along on the day. Please say a huge thank you for Dan’s family and me. It was really lovely to chat to so many of the OBO readers. The link with the final totals is here - £800 in raffle ticket salescash donations on the day and £1250 in online donations as well. Brilliant result I think, especially considering we had so much rain on the day!Virat Kohli laughs at his inability to influence probability: he’s lost all four tosses in this series. India pick the same XI for the first time since the Lord’s Test of 2014. Kohli looks very relaxed as he jokes with Mike Atherton about the unchanged XI. Jeez, he’s magnificent. Though the pitch has a tinge of green, my flabber will be aghast should either captain decide to bowl first. Both teams are susceptible to scoreboard pressure, England in particular, and the pitch may transmogrify into a Bunsen come days four and five. Bat first and, more importantly, bat well.I can’t tell you how high I get from using the word ‘transmogrify’ in a published article.Hello. I found out a fascinating fact this morning: apparently England lead India 2-1 in their ongoing Test series. You wouldn’t know it from the build up to the fourth Test at the Ageas Bowl. While Joe Root did not march out of yesterday’s press conference demanding R-E-S-P-E-C-T, there is a mood of uncertainty and insecurity around England.If you’re into the whole momentum thing, you’ll agree it is India’s 12th man in this match. Despite being 2-1 down, they look settled and confident after that masterful performance at Trent Bridge. They may even name an unchanged XI for the first time since 2014. England have made two largely enforced changes: Moeen Ali and Sam Curran come in for Ollie Pope and the injured Chris Woakes.

Pericles can be one of Shakespeare’s more difficult plays, notoriously uneven and elusive, but this musical adaptation is a joy. It is the first production in the National Theatre’s Public Acts scheme, and boasts a community chorus of about 200 amateur actors, dancers and musicians. But what might have been a total mess turns out to be mesmerising: a giddy celebration of humanity and our endless capacity for warmth, togetherness and love.The huge ensemble cast floods Fly Davis’s elegantly sweeping set with performers of all ages, abilities and ethnicities. Emily Lim has corralled the chorus brilliantly but she hasn’t polished the life out of them. Nervous smiles flash towards the audience and Shakespeare’s play feels so much more authentic and touching for it.The swirling company is supported by six professional actors and spearheaded by Ashley Zhangazha’s richly voiced Pericles, who begins his seafaring adventures in glittering gold but ends them black-cloaked in grief. Chris Bush’s adaptation is streamlined (it runs at under two hours), family friendly (no sex-slaves or incest, thank you) and consistently entertaining, with the emphasis firmly on Shakespeare the storyteller rather than Shakespeare the legend.Jim Fortune’s original score is catchy, confident and eclectic, with Latin pop, folk and Bollywood influences as well as soaring romantic ballads. His music is complemented by cameo appearances from a range of London-based groups, whose performances are brilliantly varied and deeply soulful. No more so than when Pericles bids farewell to his daughter with a mournful lullaby, and a soloist from the London Bulgarian Choir lets rip with a haunting lament.

Google Assistant sorts voice commands, controls and questions exactly the same as Google’s smaller smart speaker offerings, but the way it sounds couldn’t be more different.The Home Max is relatively large box speaker, by smart speaker standards, with a white or black smooth plastic body and grey or charcoal coloured fabric front. In white and grey it’s simple fabric front and rounded corners make the Home Max look a bit bland up next to a Sonos Play:5 or an Apple HomePod, but it might be easier to blend in with soft home furnishings. It is about the size of a large bookcase speaker, but weighs over 5kg.White dots in the centre of the fabric front show when the Home Max is actively listening to you, when it’s working on a query or speaking to you, or shows the volume level when you adjust it.It can be stood up vertically or placed horizontally with a little rubber foot that attaches to the bottom magnetically. When horizontal the hidden touch strip on top acts as a pause-play button and a volume slider, both of which work well.A mute switch on the back allows you to turn off the microphones if you would like a little privacy from Google Assistant’s listening out for its wake words, which are either “Hey Google” or the older “Okay, Google”. When the mute switch is flicked the dots light up red until you turn the mics back on.An analogue 3.5mm line-in socket and USB-C port round out the back, alongside the figure-of-eight power cable. There’s also Bluetooth for streaming your music directly from a phone, tablet or computer if you need to.Setting up the Home Max is super easy, but requires an Android or iOS device. Just plug it in, open the Google Home app on your smartphone or tablet, tap the button to set up a new device and follow the instructions. It took about five minutes to get the speaker out of the box and playing music.Google Assistant is the same on the Home Max as it is on any other Google Home smart speaker. Since the original Home launched in May 2017, Assistant has become smarter answering more and more questions, and is impressively able to not only recognise the words you’re saying but also what you’re trying to say – when you butcher a question, Assistant will still be able to work out what you want, more often than not.Assistant also has the ability to recognise inidual voices using Google’s Voice Match – a feature still not available for Amazon’s Alexa in the UK – so when you ask for an update on your calendar or music from your library you get your stuff, rather than stuff belonging to someone else who lives in your house.Google has also continually added to Assistants smart home device control, which now rivals Amazon’s Alexa in most categories.But it is Assistant’s ability to control a wider range of music services, including Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music and Deezer – combined with the best voice recognition – which has made it the one to beat.The Home Max certainly produces a big, aggressive sound and is loud enough as a single unit to fill even large rooms. It’s front-facing two 4.5in woofers and two tweeters produce fairly direct sound, making the Home Max a speaker to put at the end of a room rather than in the middle of it like Apple’s HomePod or the cheaper Amazon Echo. It doesn’t really have a sweet spot, however, sounding pretty uniform no matter where you sit in front of it.It has an intelligent audio tweaking system called Smart Sound, which uses the mics and AI to adjust the music as you play to a account for location, noise sources, track and even the time of day. Apple’s HomePod has a similar system built in, but Sonos’s Play:5 and others require an iPhone or iPad to tune the speakers each time you move them.The Home Max sounds punchy, producing music with lots of attack in the mids and deep bass. If you like big booming bass, you will love the Home Max, but I found the bass a bit loose in some tracks, missing some subtlety – turning the bass down in the equaliser helped a little.Rap tracks such as Dr Dre’s Still DRE, Forgot About Dre or The Next Episode sounded really aggressive and great. Jazz tracks such as Moanin’ by Art Blakey sounded warm and punchy, and it even did a fairly good job with Holst’s Jupiter performed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra.It seemed most at home with pop tracks such as In My Feelings by Drake or Anywhere by Rita Ora. But playing tracks such as Do I Wanna Know? by the Arctic Monkeys, where the intro drum beats lost a bit of their alternating rhythm, or a live version of Hotel California by the Eagles, which lost clarity and separation between inidual notes and vocals, showed the Home Max’s weakness.It has a big, powerful sound, but it lacks the sparkle and subtlety something like the Sonos Play:5 or Apple’s HomePod brings, which allows you to discover new parts of your favourite tracks you might not have been able to hear before.The Smart Sound tuning improves over time, and I found that the sound was a little more room dependent than others, sounding better in the longer, more open kitchen than the living room.Volume consistency between tracks on Spotify was also weak, with some tracks drastically louder than the previous. Dynamic range is great, but feeling like you have to jockey the volume between tracks isn’t. I also found thedirect, aggressive nature of the sound a little wearing over extended listening sessions compared to some more immersive rivals.The Home Max can also play in multi-room audio groups with other Google Home or Chromecast devices, which makes filling your whole house with the same music easy. Stereo pairing is also available, but I did not have two to test.The Google Home Max costs £399 and comes in two colours: chalk or charcoal.For comparison, the Google Home costs £99, the Home Mini costs £39. Apple’s HomePod costs £319, the Sonos One costs £199 and the Sonos Play:5 costs £499.The Google Home Max is one big sound upgrade for Google Assistant, producing powerful, room-filling sound and booming bass.While Google Assistant is the best voice assistant available right now, with the widest range of music services and most capable voice recognition and understanding, the Home Max doesn’t quite match the exquisite audio produced by the likes of the Apple HomePod or Sonos Play:5.If you want a speaker to blast out music at a party or in the kitchen, the Home Max is brilliant. If you want a top-end living room listening experience to replace a great hi-fi, then at £400 this isn’t quite there yet.Pros: Google Assistant is great, multi orientation, loud and punchy, can always hear you, Bluetooth and analogue in, native Spotify and multiple other music services, adaptive sound, granular volume control via percentage, good touch controlsCons: variable volume in playlists, not much good for a non-Google user, smart speaker privacy concerns, better for some music genres than others, expensive"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dabbc26b55415263acbebbe4fdbf110c0fc76d84/0_539_5164_3098/master/5164.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=332ec8d8ba8ab339e4263f4a54e4e83d","title":"whats the best laptop for university under 600","story":"Linda’s history-studying son needs a portable computer. Which model would deliver value for money on a budget?My son is off to university and needs a laptop for his history course. His needs are coursework, watching movies, listening to music and gaming. Our needs are best value for money on a budget of £600 or less. What do you think of reconditioned laptops? We are not a poor household, but we are going to have to make a few sacrifices to get him through university. LindaIt’s always a good idea to see if the university andor department have any recommendations, discount deals or special requirements. This can be important for courses that use professional software, though I don’t expect history needs anything that won’t run on most laptops.In fact, any mainstream machine should suffice for most undergraduate purposes. Just make sure it has at least 4GB of memory and a 128GB SSD or larger hard drive, with 64GB of eMMC storage being the minimum. Also, aim for a processor that scores at least 2,000 on PassMark’s list of CPU benchmarks.More is better. If possible, double all those numbers. Don’t halve them.A fast PC could be considered a luxury for a student, but it saves time – and the extra cost per week is relatively small over a three- or four-year course.However, gaming could still be a problem. A £600 laptop will run games, but it won’t run AAA games at high frame-rates with all the graphical effects. In student flats, the best answer is usually a communal Xbox One or PlayStation 4.Traditionally, students have used mainstream laptops with 15.6in screens. They are cheap and do the job. However, they are too bulky to carry around all the time, and tend to have poor battery life.If your offspring wants to take a laptop to classes, it would be better to buy an ultraportable, or a convertible machine that doubles as a laptop and a tablet. There are plenty of cheap 2-in-1s and convertibles around but the powerful ones tend to be expensive.Microsoft Surface Pros are good for students because they are very robustly made and work with pen input: you can take handwritten notes and annotate things. However, they are beyond your budget, and there’s no point in paying for extra functionality if your son wouldn’t use it. Lenovo Yoga and HP x360 laptops are more affordable alternatives.You can also do quite a lot with a 6in smartphone and a small Bluetooth keyboard. Indeed, Android speech recognition is now so good that you don’t always need the keyboard. The smartphone also works as a note-taking camera, voice recorder and music player.Refurbished laptops are a good option for students and may look less nickable than shiny new ones. Ideally, buy direct from the original equipment manufacturer, such as Dell Outlet, or from refurbishers such as Tier1Online, which sells ex-corporate business laptops. These are built to a higher standard than consumer designs. However, you won’t save much unless you buy quite an old machine. A third-generation ThinkPad X1 Carbon from 2015 could still bust your budget.I often suggest Tier1Online because the company will upgrade most laptops. You can usually get 8GB or more memory or swap a hard drive for an SSD at extra cost. It also guarantees laptops for up to three years for a small fee.In general, you should look at refurbished ThinkPads, particularly the X and T ranges. Dell Latitude and HP EliteBook laptops are also worth considering.For more tips, see my earlier answer to the question: would a cheap refurbished laptop run Photoshop?The best support option is a next-business-day on-site service from a supplier such as Dell or Lenovo. My son went through university with Dell’s on-site service and they came and fixed it both at home and at university. However, the cost varies. It can be cheap on desktops but expensive on cheap laptops that are more likely to break.Lenovo’s IdeaPad 3xx machines have recently been good choices, being better than the entry-level 1xx versions and cheaper than the more upmarket 5xx models. Today it looks as though the popular 320 and 320S are making way for the 330 and 330S so you may get an older one for less. Prices vary depending on the processor, memory, storage and screen size, but most fall within your price range.Check the screen and keyboard quality in store and try other retailers – such as John Lewis, Argos and local shops – for possible alternatives. The HP Pavilion and Envy, Acer Swift and Asus ZenBook ranges may have laptops with your target specs.Have you got a question?

He is attacking everything we believe in in New York. He has to be stopped. I’m going to fight with him,” Cuomo declared.“When it comes to opposing Donald Trump in New York state, we already have a corrupt corporate Republican in the White House. We don’t need a corrupt corporate Democrat in Albany as his main opposition,” she said.Nixon, Broadway actor and former Sex and the City TV star, and Cuomo, son of the former New York Democratic governor Mario Cuomo, got into sharp spats at their debate on Wednesday evening.At one point Cuomo barked: “Can you stop interrupting?” at Nixon, who snapped back: “Can you stop lying?”Polls suggest the governor has a more than 30 percentage point lead over his opponent, who also trails substantially in fundraising.But Nixon has garnered plenty of attention with her famous name and audacious challenge upon high office. And, rwith her leftwing platform of education reform and social and economic equalityshe taking advantage of a populist wave of candidates assailing establishment figures with challenges from the left.As a political ingenue who has not held office at any level before, she represents an audacious, if outside, threat to establishment figure Cuomo who has powerful standing in the party.Her campaign impertinent campaign finally drew Cuomo into a live debate at Hofstra University on Long Island. Nixon went after Cuomo early in the exchange, calling him corrupt and a liar and saying experience doesn’t matter if a politician is ineffective.“I’m not an Albany insider like Governor Cuomo, but experience doesn’t mean that much if you’re not actually good at governing,” she said, referring to the seat of New York government in the state capital.Cuomo responded that Nixon did not understand the challenges of leading the nation’s fourth largest state and lived in a “world of fiction”, while he resided in the real world where you don’t just “snap your fingers” and change happens.“That’s the art of government. I can get it done,” he said.The Democratic primary winner will face the Republican Marc Molinaro and independent Stephanie Miner in November."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d448156d60a5683c21ab62dec5e7151c5743314b/203_863_4477_2686/master/4477.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=771328ef940afa6ef08a77928ca62dad","title":"south korea bans coffee from every school","story":"Action follows reports of students suffering palpitations as they go through high-pressure education systemSouth Korea is set to ban the sale of coffee in schools in an effort to promote healthier choices among pupils and teachers.All vending machines and snack kiosks in primary and secondary schools will stop selling all coffee products by 14 September, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.“The revision aims to create healthy eating habits among children and teenagers,” a ministry official said, according to a report in the Korea Times. “We will make sure coffee is banned at schools without fail.”The ban in schools is part of a wider campaign by officials to discourage consumption of food and drink high in calories or caffeine, and follows media reports of some students suffering heart palpitations after drinking coffee. Authorities cited dizziness, increased heartbeat, sleep disorders and nervousness as other symptoms. Many students consume coffee or energy drinks to stay alert to study in an effort to excel in South Korea’s highly competitive and demanding education system. South Koreans drink an average of 181 cups of coffee a year, by far the most in Asia, according to market research firm Euromonitor. That is more that the 151 consumed per person in the UK but less than the average of 266 cups in the US.Packets of sugary, milky instant coffee became popular in the 1950s, coinciding with the arrival of thousands of US troops, and in recent years trendy cafes have opened on nearly every street. Seoul, the capital and largest city, had more than 18,000 coffee shops at the end of 2016, surpassing the number of convenience store, an already ubiquitous sight.The ban on coffee in schools follows a restriction on energy drinks earlier this year.

File photograph: Nick BradshawThe Hundreds of smear tests performed on women in the CervicalCheck screening programme could not be read this year due to delays in processing them, new figures show.The sharp rise in expired samples is linked to a surge in women seeking repeat smears following controversy over the programme since Vicky Phelan settled her court case last April.Ms Phelan, a mother-of-two from Co Limerick, settled a High Court action against a US laboratory for €2.5 million over a 2011 smear test, which wrongly gave a negative result for cancer. She was diagnosed with cancer in 2014 and told of the false negative in the smear test only in September 2017.New figures show that in the aftermath of this controversy, the number of smears performed in CervicalCheck jumped by more than 50 per cent between July 2017 and July 2018.In July this year, more than 27,200 smears were taken via the programme, compared to 18,700 in the same month in 2017.The Government reached a deal with the Irish Medical Organisation (IMO) in May facilitating repeat smears for women concerned about their cervical health.Due to the rise in patients undergoing smear tests, the backlog in receiving test results has doubled, going from six-eight weeks to up to 13 weeks in some cases.These delays are likely to persist until the new year, the IMO has told its GP members.The data compiled by CervicalCheck on August 22nd reveals that 110 smear tests taken in July 2018 could not be read, as the samples had expired, a four-fold rise compared to the 27 expired samples recorded in July 2017.Of the 110 tests, 87 had expired because they were not processed by a laboratory in a timely fashion. The remainder were expired vials from GPs.Samples expire when they are not processed within six weeks by the laboratory, while the vials expire in cases where GPs failed to send smear tests to the laboratory quickly enough.Between April and July this year, 330 samples and vials expired compared to 242 in 2017, representing a rise of 36 per cent.The HSE said women and GPs are always informed if a screening sample or vial has expired.Patients must leave a minimum of a three-month gap between smears.Since July 30th this year, a new system is in place in CervicalCheck whereby all samples are transferred to slides to prevent tests from expiring. The slide might not be read for quite some time, but once the sample is on a slide it cannot expire.The new system aims to dramatically reduce the number of expired samples in the future and to ensure confidence in the programme.Any repeat smears required by patients over 25 years of age whose original tests cannot be read will be paid for.Correspondence from the IMO to its members earlier this week states: “CervicalCheck are working towards having a restoration of normal reporting times as soon as is feasible but this is likely to be into the new year.“The agreement with the State on repeat smears and consultations remains in place until 31 December 2018. The agreed consultation rate is €50 and the repeat smear is paid at the normal rate of €49.10.”"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Judges at Special Criminal Court said all strands of evidence pointed towards his guiltChild and Family Agency launches \u0026euro10m childcare database to replace 17 separate systems across the StateTwo children have been charged over death of Kildare schoolgirl (14) in MayWoman from Co Antrim was refused benefit after her partner of 23 years died from cancer in 2014Store in Tallaght suffered significant damage when looters used excavator to access storeThe latest potential candidate is a Jaguar-driving US-based businessman from DerryDisadvantaged areas set to receive higher priority following Wesley grant controversyAhead of planned closures, Naughten says An Post will not be withdrawing contractsTemperatures are set to reach 20 degrees during a period of warm, settled weatherDragons\u0026rsquo Den investor becomes 11th potential candidateNew Horizons aims to rendezvous with Kuiper-Belt object on New Year\u0026rsquos Day 2019Why is a proven, sustainable, environmentally friendly system not being used widely?Ireland faces huge challenges to meet binding 2020 EU targets, says MinisterRise in expired smears follows controversy over CervicalCheck since Vicky Phelan caseAim is to encourage \u0026lsquogreat communication\u0026rsquo from researchers tackling global challengesOpposition outcry as An Post announces 159 closures, with west of Ireland hardest hitEvent marks 30th anniversary of UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate ChangeIsland\u0026rsquos 150-year-old national school still searching for second teacher"},{"url":null,"title":"sorrys and selfies the highs and lows of the pope s ireland visit","story":"  August 27, 2018Hugely anticipated visit of Pope Francis to Ireland did not attract the expected numbers   August 28, 2018Rite\u0026ampReason: Parishes are shifting as communal force and should be bedrock of lay-led identity   August 28, 2018Opinion poll shows just one in three think pope\u0026rsquos comments sufficient   August 29, 2018This was the pope\u0026rsquos first speech on his arrival in Ireland on Saturday, August 25th, 2018 "},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612583.1535631243!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"unmarried mother siobhan mclaughlin wins right to widow s allowance","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFile photo of Siobhan McLaughlin (centre) with two of her children Billy and Rebecca Adams. Photograph: Liam McBurneyPA An unmarried mother from Northern Ireland has won a British Supreme Court battle to access a widowed parent’s allowance for her bereaved children.Siobhan McLaughlin (46) was refused the benefit after her partner John Adams died from cancer in January 2014 because the couple, who had four children and were together for 23 years, were not married or in a civil partnership.Ms McLaughlin is a special needs classroom assistant from Armoy, Co Antrim. The late Mr Adams was a groundsman. Their children are Rebecca (15), Billy (16), Lisa (21) and Stuart (23).Following Mr Adams’s death, Ms McLaughlin had to take on an evening job after being refused widowed parent’s allowance by the Northern Ireland Department for Communities.She initially won a case after claiming unlawful discrimination based on her marital status, but that ruling was later overturned by the British Court of Appeal.But, by a majority of four justices to one, the British Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that the current law on the allowance is “incompatible” with Human Rights legislation.Giving the lead judgment, the court’s President Lady Hale said: “The allowance exists because of the responsibilities of the deceased and the survivor towards their children.“Those responsibilities are the same whether or not they are married to or in a civil partnership with one another.“The purpose of the allowance is to diminish the financial loss caused to families with children by the death of a parent.“That loss is the same whether or not the parents are married or in a civil partnership with one another.”However, Lady Hale said not every case where an unmarried parent is denied the allowance after the death of their partner will be unlawful.The court also said it is up to the British Government to decide whether or how to change the law.Speaking outside court after the April hearing in the Supreme Court, which sat in Northern Ireland for the first time, Ms McLaughlin thanked supporters.Attending with two of her children, she said: “This case was never about me. I would love to be recognised as a widow but I accept in the eyes of the law and the Government that I am not.“What I wasn’t prepared to accept was how the Government viewed my children — how they could treat my grieving, bereaved children as insignificant.“I am such a private person but to sit and accept that this is how it is made me say, ‘No, this is wrong’.“I want to look my children in the eye and say it is the Government at fault here, not you, and because of this I have tried to rectify this for you.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612611.1535632667!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"sinn f%C3%A9in calls for cash for ash scheme to be scrapped","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tSinn Féin’s Conor Murphy (left) and Mártín Ó Muilleoir at a press conference setting out the  party’s response to a public consultation on the future of the Renewable Heat Incentive scheme. Photograph: Brian LawlessPA Wire.Sinn Féin has called for a scheme which aimed to reduce carbon emissions in Northern Ireland but ended up collapsing powersharing at Stormont, to be scrapped.Newry and Armagh MLA Conor Murphy described the Renewable Heat Incentive (RHI) scheme as a “sorry episode”. The scheme hit the headlines in 2016 amid concerns over a potential overspend running into the hundreds of millions due to flaws which meant applicants ultimately received more money than they spent buying fuel. This created an impetus on participants to “burn to earn” and led to the scheme being dubbed “cash for ash”.The fallout from the botched scheme saw Sinn Féin apportion blame to the DUP, whose leader Arlene Foster was minister at the Department of Enterprise when the scheme was introduced.The then deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned from his position in January of last year in protest at the DUP’s “handling” of the scheme, effectively collapsing the Stormont administration. The North has been without a functioning administration since. Mr Murphy said the funding for the RHI scheme should be redirected into another scheme that would be more effective in cutting carbon emissions.“RHI is not a good scheme that went wrong, it was a bad scheme that was made even worse,” Mr Murphy said.“We are now aware that before the RHI scheme was set up, a report commissioned by the department showed that compared to an alternative scheme, this scheme was less effective in reducing carbon emissions and nearly £200 million more expensive.“Despite this evidence the minister then responsible, Arlene Foster, opted for the less effective, more expensive option of RHI. The original error of establishing RHI was then compounded by incompetent design.”An independent inquiry into how the scheme went so wrong is ongoing and the RHI scheme continues to run but with more cost controls in place.The Department of the Economy ran a public consultation in June over the future of the scheme. Sinn Féin said in its response that the scheme should not continue in any form as it is not effective in reducing carbon emissions.Mr Murphy said his party believes there is a risk that the scheme could be abused in the future if it continues and should simply be shut down.“Spending more public money on a scheme that is at best ineffective, and at worst counter productive to the goal of carbon reduction, cannot in our view be justified,” he said.When asked when Stormont might resume, Mr Murphy said his party intends to have ministers in place by April 1st next, the start of the new financial year.“Our intention is to have ministers in place by April 1st, our intention is not to sit back here and allow the timetable of drift to be dictated by the British government and the DUP in terms of their own Brexit interests,” he said. - PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3612425.1535622103!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"so who is presidential hopeful peter casey","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Peter Casey: “I had to buy a Jaguar as they are owned by my largest client, Tata.” \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            Peter Casey: “I had to buy a Jaguar as they are owned by my largest client, Tata.” Probably best known for his role in RTÉ’s Dragon’s Den series, Peter Casey is the founder and chief executive officer of a global recruitment business. He set up Claddagh Resources, which is focused on consulting and IT firms, in Atlanta, Georgia in the US in 1995. Claddagh operates from five locations worldwide and its European base is outside Buncrana in Co Donegal.He previously established business interests in Australia and Ireland. Mr Casey was named by Irish America Magazine as one the leading Irish American businessmen for 2007.Mr Casey is from Derry. His mother was a primary school teacher and he was one of nine children.His wife, Helen, is from Crumlin in Dublin and they have five children. He is a graduate in business and politics from Aston University in Birmingham, England.He considered standing as a general election candidate in Donegal, but said he wanted his youngest child to finish her schooling in the US. He attempted to secure a seat in Seanad Éireann in 2016 after getting the nomination of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (Ibec) as a candidate on the Seanad’s Industrial and Commercial Panel.Outlining his agenda at his campaign launch in Dublin in March 2016, he said he intended to support foreign direct investment, indigenous business development and job creation.He has called for a refocus on rural Ireland and spoken about the need to address the concentration of commercial activity and the administration in central Dublin.In recent years, he bought a home in Donegal.In 2016 he revealed in an interview with The  that he had bought a farm in Derry a decade previously for €1.4 million. He said the most expensive thing he owned was his car, a Jaguar XJL Supercharged Supersport. “I had to buy a Jaguar as they are owned by my largest client, Tata,” he added. He said he had bought and lost a lot of money in Apple shares. Asked if he had ever lost money he said: “Loads of times. I made many bad investments, but I have selective amnesia.” He has also bought houses in Derry before they were repossessed by banks and leased them back to the occupants. In January 2015, he said he held 16 such properties.“We basically buy them before the banks foreclose and we enter into a long-term lease with the tenants,” he said at the time.“It’s a win-win. It means people are able to stay in the property. I get a much better return than what I was getting on money sitting in the bank and I’ve got an appreciating asset.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3611674.1535566439!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"uk says no deal brexit the only alternative to chequers plan","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBritain’s Brexit secretary Dominic Raab at the parliamentary committee on Wednesday. “You have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said.  Photograph: AFPGetty ImagesBritain has warned the European Union that a no-deal Brexit is the only alternative to Theresa May’s proposal for partial membership of the single market. Cabinet secretary David Lidington, Ms May’s de facto deputy, told a French business conference that it was too late to come up with alternative proposals for a future economic relationship.“With exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission, or the risk of there being no deal,” he said.“The alternative models do not meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered. So, we need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.”Ms May’s proposal, agreed at Chequers last month, would keep Britain in the single market for goods and agricultural products but not for services. Britain would follow EU regulations for goods but would not offer free movement to EU citizens and would leave the customs union.The EU’s chief negotiator Michel Barnier said on Wednesday that the EU was prepared to offer Britain a partnership “such as has never been with any other third country”. But he stressed that Britain must respect the EU’s core structures, saying that “single market means single market”, before adding that “this is not negotiable”.Brexit secretary Dominic Raab dismissed reports that Mr Barnier was not making himself available for negotiations and expressed confidence that a deal can be agreed. He acknowledged that the issue of a backstop to guarantee no return to a hard Border remained the biggest stumbling block in the negotiations.“The prime minister has been clear . . . that the EU’s proposals are unacceptable, mainly because of the effect they would have on the UK common market and the constitutional integrity of the UK,” he said.Mr Raab told the House of Lords EU committee that Britain continued to insist that the backstop must be time-limited and he suggested that EU law might also require it to be temporary.“As a matter of law under article 50 there are constraints on the period of time for which a backstop could last. Obviously, ultimately that has to be tested,” he said.The Brexit secretary said that votes in the House of Commons on amendments to Brexit-related legislation demonstrated that opposition parties shared the government’s determination to reject any backstop that could undermine Northern Ireland’s place within the UK.\u0026nbsp“It was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don’t just have a Conservative and unionist government, but we also have a unionist parliament. On all the amendments that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border in the Irish Sea, parliament clearly supported the government’s position. So you have a unionist parliament as well as a Conservative and unionist government,” he said."},{"url":null,"title":"introducing telegraph new way get news","story":"Head of Digital PublishingMedia and Telecoms industryWe’ve made it even easier for you to get the news you want, when you want it. Introducing My , a new way to get the news.When you login to your  account you can now follow your favourite  writers and the subjects you’re most interested in to create a feed of news that’s just for you.Whether you want the wisdom of Charles Moore, want post-match insight from Paul Hayward or need straight-talking lifestyle advice from Bryony Gordon, the My Feed feature gives you a truly personalised experience of The .The first time you use My , we\u0027ll present a selection of popular subjects and writers to get you started.

The collection has been given an estimated value of £24,000. A letter, dated June 2, 1986, sent to the Emmanuels by Diana\u0027s lady-in-waiting, Anne Beckwith-Smith, outlined the strict requirements for her garments during the tour.She wrote: Certain special requirements concerning dress need to be observed and I am writing to ask if it would be possible to submit to The Princess of Wales a few sketches for day and evening wear from which Her Royal Highness could select items for this tour.Their Royal highnesses will be visiting Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. In all cases modesty is the order of the day.An invoice for the dresses also features in the sale revealing they cost between £275 and £450 each. The collection has been consigned for sale by a private collector and it is believed that this is the first time it has emerged on the market.A letter to Princess Diana\u0026#39s wedding dress maker Elizabeth EmanuelBobby Livingston, executive vice president of RR Auctions, said: Princess Diana tried to conform to local customs by wearing concealing clothes, but still exposed her neck and left her head uncovered.At evening banquets, she appeared in the long sleeved demure dresses made especially for the tour. She did not have to wear the \u0027reserve outfit\u0027 burka depicted in this archive.It\u0027s a remarkable, comprehensive archive from the famously stylish royal.Princess Diana, centre, with David and Elizabeth Emanuel, looking through outfit designs for her visit to Saudi ArabiaDiana and Charles made a whistlestop six-day tour of Oman, Qatar, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia in November 1986.In Saudi Arabia, she was invited to King Fahd\u0027s palace, a rare honour for a woman, although she was not allowed to dine with the men.The Emanuels designed more than 100 outfits for Diana for special occasions and for when she travelled abroad.The sale takes place on September 25.Please review our commenting policyItaly wants EU to rotate ports that take in migrants rescue ships to share burdenIndia \u0026#39black\u0026#39 currency purge that led to riots and dozens of deaths was pointless, bank study findsBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Aung San Suu Kyi should have resigned over Rohingya crisis, says UN human rights chiefParking fine dropped after driver writes poem to local councilSpeedboat owner convicted of killing date launches appeal despite being on the runClassical music on video games prompts huge rise in millennial listeners, Classic FM saysHistoric Italian atelier that pleated dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch fights closureHow popular is Donald Trump?

I would love to be recognised as a widow but I accept in the eyes of the law and the Government that I am not.What I wasn\u0027t prepared to accept was how the Government viewed my children - how they could treat my grieving, bereaved children as insignificant.I am such a private person but to sit and accept that this is how it is made me say, \u0027No, this is wrong\u0027.I want to look my children in the eye and say it is the Government at fault here, not you, and because of this I have tried to rectify this for you.Law and orderPlease review our commenting policyItaly wants EU to rotate ports that take in migrants rescue ships to share burdenIndia \u0026#39black\u0026#39 currency purge that led to riots and dozens of deaths was pointless, bank study findsBest independent schools in 2018: Full league table for A-Level results Aung San Suu Kyi should have resigned over Rohingya crisis, says UN human rights chiefPrincess Diana considered wearing a burka in Saudi Arabia, sketches revealParking fine dropped after driver writes poem to local councilSpeedboat owner convicted of killing date launches appeal despite being on the runClassical music on video games prompts huge rise in millennial listeners, Classic FM saysHistoric Italian atelier that pleated dress worn by Marilyn Monroe in The Seven Year Itch fights closureHow popular is Donald Trump?

Sterling fell by as much as 0.3 per cent against the dollar\u0026nbspafter the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in a German radio interview that the bloc is prepared for a no-deal Brexit. “After the sterling bounce yesterday,\u0026nbspBarnier has used a German radio interview this morning to remind the market that the EU is also planning for a no-deal scenario,” Jeremy Stretch at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, told Bloomberg.“This suggests they are not intent on a deal at all costs and that sterling gains may prove tough to hold onto.”The pound was boosted on Tuesday, rising 1.2 per cent against the dollar, and 1 per cent against the euro, after Mr Barnier said the EU is “prepared to offer a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country. His positive remarks came as Brexit secretary Dominic Raab told the Lords EU committee that he was “confident a deal is within our sights”“We\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal,” he said. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said many investors would be wondering whether Mr Barnier’s positive statement on Wednesday could be a turning point for the pound. “Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline,” he said.The pound remained up against the euro, trading up 0.02 per cent at €1.1128 by mid-morning.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/10/rts1we9x.jpg","title":"sse npower merger competition watchdog cma approval","story":"Created with Sketch.Watchdog found the companies do not compete on standard variable tariffsClick to followThe IndependentThe merger will mean the UK\u0027s Big Six energy providers are reduced by oneThe proposed merger of SSE’s household energy business with Npower has been provisionally approved by the competition watchdog. The firms announced plans to merge their UK operations in November last year, with the aim of creating the country’s second biggest energy provider after British Gas.The Competition and Markets Authority launched an inquiry into how the merger would affect UK households earlier this year, focusing on concerns about the potential impact on standard variable tariffs (SVTs).On Wednesday, the CMA said it had decided to clear the deal after finding that SSE and Npower do not compete closely on SVT prices.Anne Lambert, chair of the inquiry group, said: “It is vital that householders have a range of energy suppliers to choose from so they can find the best deal for them. With more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.“But many people don’t shop around for their energy. So, we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard variable prices.“Our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.”Ms Lambert added that Ofgem’s price cap should also protect SVT customers.Under new rules, Ofgem must cap prices on SVTs offered by the UK’s Big Six energy firms - which will become the Big Five if the SSENpower merger goes ahead. SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies, said he is “confident” that the deal will be completed by the end of the financial year. “The scale and pace of change in the GB energy market continues to be significant and requires us to evolve to stay relevant, competitive and sustainable,” he said. “The planned transaction presents a great opportunity to create a more agile, innovative and efficient company that really delivers for customers and the energy market as a whole.SSE profits hit by energy price cap and loss of 430,000 customersSSE-Npower merger faces full investigation by competition watchdogNpower and SSE merger could push up energy bills, says watchdogGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “SSE and npower’s merger is, in many way, a response to the challenges facing the sector. Pressure is mounting from politicians from all major parties, and increases in wholesale energy prices are starting to squeeze margins. “All the while, the rise of price comparison websites means customers are more likely to switch suppliers. In an industry where stability has been a key attraction for investors over the years, to say the cat is among the pigeons is something of an understatement.”SSE is seeking safety in numbers with this deal, Mr Salmon said, as the merger will mean cost savings and will provide a boost in scale following years of declining customer numbers. However, he added: “It’s not quite so straightforward. The government is due to announce a new cap on the maximum possible charge for standard variable tariffs soon. These tariffs are suppliers’ default offerings and often come with the highest bills. npower’s charges are particularly punitive, and SSE has a huge percentage of customers on such deals. “That means there’s plenty at stake for the new company. Should the cap be more severe than expected, the new business would face a fresh headwind from day one.” \u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/09/24/14/Grindr-REX_0.jpg  width= 1024  height= 768  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/09/24/14/Grindr-REX_0.jpg","title":"grindr stock market listing gay dating app kunlun group ipo china","story":"Created with Sketch.Funds raised by the IPO\u0026nbspwill help the dating app expand, its owner saidClick to followThe IndependentGrindr is planning to float after being bought by Kunlun earlier this yearGrindr planning stock market listing as Chinese owner gives approval for floatGay dating app Grindr is planning to go public after gaining approval from parent company Kunlun Group for an overseas listing.

Some deaths are even connected to them.The move was welcomed by campaigners including Jamie Oliver, but there will be a backlash from manufacturers and even some ministers who see it as “nanny-statism”.Speaking during her trip to Africa, the prime minister said: “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children. \u0026nbsp“It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life.”She launched a consultation on exactly how the ban should work, though the intention is it will apply to drinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre.\u0026nbspConfirming the measure will now be pushed through, one government insider said: “It is a question of how, not whether we do it.”\u0026nbspOne 250ml can of Red Bull contains around 80mg of caffeine – the equivalent of nearly three cans of cola.Some energy drinks also contain exceptionally high levels of sugar, with on average 60 per cent more calories and 65 per cent more sugar than other regular soft drinks.\u0026nbspWith more than two-thirds of 10 to 17-year-olds and a quarter of six to nine-year-olds consuming energy drinks, they are likely contributing to both obesity and tooth decay.Officials argue that excessive consumption has already been linked to health issues in children, from headaches and sleep problems to stomach aches and hyperactivity.The death of Irish 18-year-old Ross Cooney in 2000, after he drank four cans during a basketball match, led to calls for more research.Health news in pictures152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms.

Death certificates from England and Wales show that malnutrition was listed as the primary cause in a total of 66 deaths in 2016.1552 Fertility \u0027breakthrough\u0027 as human eggs grown in lab for first timeHuman eggs with the potential to become fertilised embryos have been grown in a laboratory for the first time in a breakthrough that could unlock future fertility treatments. 1652 Cannabis extract could provide ‘new class of treatment’ for psychosisCBD has a broadly opposite effect to delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main active component  in cannabis and the substance that causes paranoia and anxiety.1752 Babies\u0027 health suffers from being born near fracking sites, finds major studyMothers living within a kilometre of a fracking site were 25 per cent more likely to have a child born at low birth weight, which increase their chances of asthma, ADHD and other issues1852 Over 75,000 sign petition calling for Richard Branson\u0027s Virgin Care to hand settlement money back to NHSMr Branson’s company sued the NHS last year after it lost out on an £82m contract to provide children’s health services across Surrey, citing concerns over “serious flaws” in the way the contract was awarded1952 More than 700 fewer nurses training in England in first year after NHS bursary scrappedThe numbers of people accepted to study nursing in England fell 3 per cent in 2017, while the numbers accepted in Wales and Scotland, where the bursaries were kept, increased 8.4 per cent and 8 per cent respectively2052 Landmark study links Tory austerity to 120,000 deathsThe paper found that there were 45,000 more deaths in the first four years of Tory-led efficiencies than would have been expected if funding had stayed at pre-election levels.Hours of commuting may be mind-numbingly dull, but new research shows that it might also be having an adverse effect on both your health and performance at work.  Longer commutes also appear to have a significant impact on mental wellbeing, with those commuting longer 33 per cent more likely to suffer from depression2252 You cannot be fit and fatIt is not possible to be overweight and healthy, a major new study has concluded. The study of 3.5 million Britons found that even “metabolically healthy” obese people are still at a higher risk of heart disease or a stroke than those with a normal weight rangeWhen you feel particularly exhausted, it can definitely feel like you are also lacking in brain capacity. Now, a new study has suggested this could be because chronic sleep deprivation can actually cause the brain to eat itselfDavid Lloyd Gyms have launched a new health and fitness class which is essentially a bunch of people taking a nap for 45 minutes. The fitness group was spurred to launch the ‘napercise’ class after research revealed 86 per cent of parents said they were fatigued. The class is therefore predominantly aimed at parents but you actually do not have to have children to take part2552 \u0027Fundamental right to health\u0027 to be axed after Brexit, lawyers warnTobacco and alcohol companies could win more easily in court cases such as the recent battle over plain cigarette packaging if the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is abandoned, a barrister and public health professor have said.2652 \u0027Thousands dying\u0027 due to fear over non-existent statin side-effectsA major new study into the side effects of the cholesterol-lowering medicine suggests common symptoms such as muscle pain and weakness are not caused by the drugs themselves2752 Babies born to fathers aged under 25 have higher risk of autismNew research has found that babies born to fathers under the age of 25 or over 51 are at higher risk of developing autism and other social disorders. The study, conducted by the Seaver Autism Center for Research and Treatment at Mount Sinai, found that these children are actually more advanced than their peers as infants, but then fall behind by the time they hit their teenage years.2852 Cycling to work ‘could halve risk of cancer and heart disease’Commuters who swap their car or bus pass for a bike could cut their risk of developing heart disease and cancer by almost half, new research suggests – but campaigners have warned there is still an “urgent need” to improve road conditions for cyclists.2952 Ketamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors sayKetamine helps patients with severe depression ‘when nothing else works’ doctors say3052 Playing Tetris in hospital after a traumatic incident could prevent PTSDScientists conducted the research on 71 car crash victims as they were waiting for treatment at one hospital’s accident and emergency department. They asked half of the patients to briefly recall the incident and then play the classic computer game, the others were given a written activity to complete. The researchers, from Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the University of Oxford, found that the patients who had played Tetris reported fewer intrusive memories, commonly known as flashbacks, in the week that followed3152 Measles outbreak spreads across Europe as parents shun vaccinations, WHO warnsMajor measles outbreaks are spreading across Europe despite the availability of a safe, effective vaccine, the World Health Organisation has warned.3252 Vaping backed as healthier nicotine alternative to cigarettes after latest studyVaping has been given an emphatic thumbs up by health experts after the first long-term study of its effects in ex-smokers.3352 Common method of cooking rice can leave traces of arsenic in food, scientists warnMillions of people are putting themselves at risk by cooking their rice incorrectly, scientists have warned.3452 Contraceptive gel that creates ‘reversible vasectomy’ shown to be effective in monkeysAn injectable contraceptive gel that acts as a ‘reversible vasectomy’ is a step closer to being offered to men following successful trials on monkeys.3552 Shift work and heavy lifting may reduce women’s fertility, study findsWomen who work at night or do irregular shifts may experience a decline in fertility, a new study has found.3652 Breakfast cereals targeted at children contain \u0027steadily high\u0027 sugar levels since 1992 despite producer claimsA major pressure group has issued a fresh warning about perilously high amounts of sugar in breakfast cereals, specifically those designed for children, and has said that levels have barely been cut at all in the last two and a half decadesScientists have made a “monumental leap forward” in the treatment of pancreatic cancer after discovering using two drugs together dramatically improved patients’ chances of living more than five years after diagnosis.3852 Japanese government tells people to stop overworkingThe Japanese government has announced measures to limit the amount of overtime employees can do – in an attempt to stop people literally working themselves to death.3952 Over-cooked potatoes and burnt toast ‘could cause cancer’The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has issued a public warning over the risks of acrylamide - a chemical compound that forms in some foods when they are cooked at high temperatures (above 120C).4052 Cervical cancer screening attendance hits 19 year lowCervical screening tests are a vital method of preventing cancer through the detection and treatment of abnormalities in the cervix, but new research shows that the number of women using this service has dropped to a 19 year low.4152 High blood pressure may protect over 80s from dementiaThe ConversationIt is well known that high blood pressure is a risk factor for dementia, so the results of a new study from the University of California, Irvine, are quite surprising. The researchers found that people who developed high blood pressure between the ages of 80-89 are less likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease (the most common form of dementia) over the next three years than people of the same age with normal blood pressure.4252 Most child antidepressants are ineffective and can lead to suicidal thoughtsThe majority of antidepressants are ineffective and may be unsafe, for children and teenager with major depression, experts have warned. In what is the most comprehensive comparison of 14 commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs to date, researchers found that only one brand was more effective at relieving symptoms of depression than a placebo. Another popular drug, venlafaxine, was shown increase the risk users engaging in suicidal thoughts and attempts at suicide4352 \u0027Universal cancer vaccine’ breakthrough claimed by expertsScientists have taken a “very positive step” towards creating a universal vaccine against cancer that makes the body’s immune system attack tumours as if they were a virus, experts have said. Writing in Nature, an international team of researchers described how they had taken pieces of cancer’s genetic RNA code, put them into tiny nanoparticles of fat and then injected the mixture into the bloodstreams of three patients in the advanced stages of the disease. The patients\u0027 immune systems responded by producing killer T-cells designed to attack cancer. The vaccine was also found to be effective in fighting “aggressively growing” tumours in mice, according to researchers, who were led by Professor Ugur Sahin from Johannes Gutenberg University in Germany4452 Green tea could be used to treat brain issues caused by Down’s SyndromeA compound found in green tea could improve the cognitive abilities of those with Down’s syndrome, a team of scientists has discovered. Researchers found epigallocatechin gallate – which is especially present in green tea but can also be found in white and black teas – combined with cognitive stimulation, improved visual memory and led to more adaptive behaviour. Dr Rafael de la Torre, who led the year-long clinical trial along with Dr Mara Dierrssen, said: “The results suggest that iniduals who received treatment with the green tea compound, together with the cognitive stimulation protocol, had better scores in their cognitive capacities”4552 Taking antidepressants in pregnancy ‘could double the risk of autism in toddlers’Taking antidepressants during pregnancy could almost double the risk of a child being diagnosed with autism in the first years of life, a major study of nearly 150,000 pregnancies has suggested. Researchers have found a link between women in the later stages of pregnancy who were prescribed one of the most common types of antidepressant drugs, and autism diagnosed in children under seven years of ageParents have been warned that giving children paracetamol-based medicines such as Calpol and Disprol too often could lead to serious health issues later in life. Leading paediatrician and professor of general paediatrics at University College London, Alastair Sutcliffe, said parents were overusing paracetamol to treat mild fevers. As a result, the risk of developing asthma, as well as kidney, heart and liver damage is heightened4752 Connections between brain cells destroyed in early stages of Alzheimer’s diseaseScientists have pinpointed how connections in the brain are destroyed in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, in a study which it is hoped will help in the development of treatments for the debilitating condition. At the early stages of the development of Alzheimer’s disease the synapses – which connect the neurons in the brain – are destroyed, according to researchers at the University of New South Wales, Australia. The synapses are vital for brain function, particularly learning and forming memories4852 A prosthetic hand that lets people actually feel throughThe technology lets paralysed people feel actual sensations when touching objects — including light taps on the mechanical finger — and could be a huge breakthrough for prosthetics, according to its makers. The tool was used to let a 28-year-old man who has been paralysed for more than a decade. While prosthetics have previously been able to be controlled directly from the brain, it is the first time that signals have been successfully sent the other way4952 Research shows that diabetes drug can be used to stop first signs of Parkinson’sScientists in a new study show that the first signs of Parkinson’s can be stopped. The UCL study is still in its research period but the team are ‘excited’. Today’s Parkinson’s drugs manage the symptoms of the disease but ultimately do not stop its progression in the brain.5052 Drinking alcohol could reduce risk of diabetesA new study shows that drinking alcohol three to four days a week could reduce the risk of diabetes. Wine was found to be most effective in reducing the risk due to the chemical compounds that balance blood sugar levels. 5152 NHS agree, after loosing legal battle, to fund HIV prevention drugHaving lost the legal battle over who was to pay for the drug the NHS have finally agreed to fund the HIV prevention treatment. National Aids Trust, whom Princess Diana supported, said that it was a ‘pivotal moment’.Scientists have discovered that the switch is controlled in the hypothalamus area of the brain. The switch acts on insulin receptors and involves the protein TCPTP. Scientists have discovered the switch in mice and are hopeful but yet to find out if the switch would be the same in humans.152 Vaping could lead to cancer, US study findsA study by the University of Minnesota\u0027s Masonic Cancer Centre has found that the carcinogenic chemicals formaldehyde, acrolein, and methylglyoxal are present in the saliva of E-cigarette users252 More children are obese and diabetic352 Gay, lesbian and bisexual adults at higher risk of heart disease, study claimsResearchers at the Baptist Health South Florida Clinic in Miami  focused on seven areas of controllable heart health and found these minority groups were particularly likely to be smokers and to have poorly controlled blood sugarNew guidance by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), the body which determines what treatment the NHS should fund, said lax road repairs and car-dominated streets were contributing to the obesity epidemic by preventing members of the public from keeping active552 New menopause drugs offer women relief from \u0027debilitating\u0027 hot flushesA new class of treatments for women going through the menopause is able to reduce numbers of debilitating hot flushes by as much as three quarters in a matter of days, a trial has found.652 Doctors should prescribe more antidepressants for people with mental health problems, study findsResearch from Oxford University found that more than one million extra people suffering from mental health problems would benefit from being prescribed drugs and criticised “ideological” reasons doctors use to avoid doing so.752 Student dies of flu after NHS advice to stay at home and avoid A\u0026ampEThe family of a teenager who died from flu has urged people not to delay going to A\u0026ampE if they are worried about their symptoms. Melissa Whiteley, an 18-year-old engineering student from Hanford in Stoke-on-Trent, fell ill at Christmas and died in hospital a month later.852 Government to review thousands of harmful vaginal mesh implantsThe Government has pledged to review tens of thousands of cases where women have been given harmful vaginal mesh implants.952 Jeremy Hunt announces \u0027zero suicides ambition\u0027 for the NHSThe NHS will be asked to go further to prevent the deaths of patients in its care as part of a “zero suicide ambition” being launched today.1052 Human trials start with cancer treatment that primes immune system to kill off tumoursHuman trials have begun with a new cancer therapy that can prime the immune system to eradicate tumours. The treatment, that works similarly to a vaccine, is a combination of two existing drugs, of which tiny amounts are injected into the solid bulk of a tumour. 1152 NHS reviewing thousands of cervical cancer smear tests after women wrongly given all-clearThousands of cervical cancer screening results are under review after failings at a laboratory meant some women were incorrectly given the all-clear. A number of women have already been told to contact their doctors following the identification of “procedural issues” in the service provided by Pathology First Laboratory.1252 Potential key to halting breast cancer\u0027s spread discovered by scientistsMost breast cancer patients do not die from their initial tumour, but from secondary malignant growths (metastases), where cancer cells are able to enter the blood and survive to invade new sites. Asparagine, a molecule named after asparagus where it was first identified in high quantities, has now been shown to be an essential ingredient for tumour cells to gain these migratory properties.1352 NHS nursing vacancies at record high with more than 34,000 roles advertisedA record number of nursing and midwifery positions are currently being advertised by the NHS, with more than 34,000 positions currently vacant, according to the latest data.

They even say ‘not for children’ on the labels.”Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics, and Public Health England chief executive Duncan Selbie also backed the ban.But Ms May is likely to face push back from the drinks industry already subject to sugar restrictions. \u0026nbspOne senior minister also hit out last night that government policy has been reduced to “a ban a day”.The frontbencher fumed: Every day, something else banned. It\u0027s just so depressing.The consultation launches on Thursday lasting 12 weeks and invites views on the age from which restrictions on buying energy drinks should apply – either 18 years old or 16 years old as options.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/26/09/Housing-market.jpg  width= 2048  height= 1536  layout= responsive  srcset= https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2015/02/26/09/Housing-market.jpg","title":"london house prices no deal brexit latest housing market","story":"Created with Sketch.One expert\u0026nbsppredicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent in the event of a disruptive exit from the EUClick to followThe IndependentUK asking prices fell by £7,000 in August, recent figures showedHouse prices in London are set to fall this year and next, and could crash if a no-deal Brexit\u0026nbspoccurs, according to a Reuters poll of property experts and analysts. Respondents predicted prices in the capital will fall 1.6 per cent this year\u0026nbspand 0.1 per cent in 2019, although for the UK in general they are set to rise 2 per cent this year and next, and 2.3 per cent in 2020. The national average price for a property was £301,973 in August, and in London it rose to £609,205. “The weight of evidence suggests that housing is overvalued once more,” said Hansen Lu at Capital Economics.Experts said there was a one in three chance of a “significant correction” in the London market. When asked what effect a disorderly Brexit would have on prices, answers ranged from “short term fall” to “damaging” to “disaster”. When asked about the likelihood of a significant correction in London’s housing market before the end of 2019, the specialists gave a relatively high median of 29 per cent, with the highest response 75 per cent.One respondent predicted house prices could fall by as much as 40 per cent. “We see little upward or downward pressure on house prices at current near-zero interest rates.

Sterling fell by as much as 0.3 per cent against the dollar\u0026nbspafter the EU’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, said in a German radio interview that the bloc is prepared for a no-deal Brexit. “After the sterling bounce yesterday,\u0026nbspBarnier has used a German radio interview this morning to remind the market that the EU is also planning for a no-deal scenario,” Jeremy Stretch at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, told Bloomberg.“This suggests they are not intent on a deal at all costs and that sterling gains may prove tough to hold onto.”The pound was boosted on Tuesday, rising 1.2 per cent against the dollar, and 1 per cent against the euro, after Mr Barnier said the EU is “prepared to offer a partnership with Britain such as has never been with any other third country. His positive remarks came as Brexit secretary Dominic Raab told the Lords EU committee that he was “confident a deal is within our sights”“We\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal,” he said. Hussein Sayed, chief market strategist at FXTM, said many investors would be wondering whether Mr Barnier’s positive statement on Wednesday could be a turning point for the pound. “Although many issues related to trade and the Irish border are far from being resolved, it currently seems that negotiations may begin moving in the right direction. However, expect volatility to surge in the coming weeks as we get closer to the Brexit deadline,” he said.The pound remained up against the euro, trading up 0.02 per cent at €1.1128 by mid-morning.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/08/11/queen.jpg","title":"queen of the world itv documentary royal family commonwealth meghan markle prince harry","story":"Created with Sketch.The series promises to be an \u0027up close and behind the scenes\u0027 look at Her MajestyClick to followThe Independent CultureA new programme will give viewers a behind-the-scenes glimpse of how the Queen passes on her knowledge and experience to younger members of the royal family.Queen Of The World will focus on the monarch’s role as head of the Commonwealth and contains exclusive footage of her interacting with other global leaders as well as the Prince of Wales, the Duke of Cambridge and the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.Filmed over the course of a year for ITV, the two hour-long series will also draw from the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh’s private film archives.Executive producer Nicolas Kent said: “The Queen is the most well-travelled monarch in history and it’s been fascinating to see how she has passed on her experience to the younger generations of the royal family.“With the Duke and Duchess of Sussex about to embark on their first Commonwealth Tour to Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific exactly 65 years after the Queen’s first Commonwealth Tour, this series could not be more timely.”ITV controller of factual Jo Clinton-Davis added: “The Queen is a unique figure on the world stage, with a huge depth of experience having met more global leaders than any previous British monarch and serving longer than all of them.“This film is a rare opportunity to see Her Majesty up close and behind the scenes in this role, which means so much to her and has been so significant for Britain and the Commonwealth.”ITV previously broadcast the royal documentary The Queen’s Green Planet, which saw Her Majesty joined by David Attenborough to discuss conservation.Earlier this year, it was announced that the Prince of Wales will succeed the Queen as leader of Commonwealth.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/11/prehistoric-rat-babies.jpg","title":"jurassic fossil rat egg laying arizona discovered reptiles mammals evolution","story":"Created with Sketch.Discovery of trilodont with 38 hatched and unhatched offspring indicates\u0026nbspcritical step in the evolution of mammals was trading big litters for big brains, study saysClick to followThe IndependentA figure representing the 38 Kayentatherium babies found with an adult specimen. They are the only known fossils of babies from an extinct mammal relative that lived during the early Jurassic periodA “rarest of the rare” fossil of an enormous fanged rat-like animal surrounded by a litter of 38 hatched and unhatched offspring has been unearthed in Arizona, offering new insight into the transition between reptiles and mammals during the Jurassic period.Mammals are today distinguished by their means of reproduction in which they produce relatively few, live young. In comparison, reptiles lay large clutches of eggs. The discovery of a baby snake fossil offers a clue on their evolutionDinosaurs are much weirder than we ever thoughtHow did birds survive the dinosaur-killing asteroid?Birds ‘had to learn to fly again’ after meteor killed dinosaursThe creature, named Kayentatherium wellesi, and which was a forerunner to modern mammals and belonged to a group known as the tritylodonts, was about the size of a small dog, and had large fangs on both its upper and lower jaw. \u0026nbspDespite its appearance, it was herbivorous, and would have lived alongside dinosaurs about 185 million years ago.The remarkable discovery of the animal’s offspring comes a full 18 years after the initial mother’s remains were found, when palaeontologists re-examined the sediment sample and carried out CT scans to reveal the huge litter. “Looking at the CT scans I was able to discover baby after baby after baby,” said study leader Eva Hoffman, who led the research as a graduate student in geosciences at the University of Texas at Austin.“These babies are from a really important point in the evolutionary tree,” she added. “They had a lot of features similar to modern mammals, features that are relevant in understanding mammalian evolution.”Kayentatherium. It is about 1 centimetre long (Eva Hoffman  The University of Texas at Austin)Zhe-Xi Luo, a palaeontologist and professor at The University of Chicago, described the discovery as “stunning” and said\u0026nbspthey would\u0026nbspprovide scientists valuable insight into mammal evolution.“These great fossils really gave us a rare glimpse of how early mammals evolved from their ancestors,” he said.The highly detailed scans allowed Ms Hoffman to examine the shape of the offsprings’ skulls, which appear as “scaled down replicas” a tenth of the size of the adult and with all features in proportion - a trait typically seen in reptile offspring. In modern mammals, young are born with shortened faces and bulbous heads to account for big brains.The discovery that Kayentatherium had a tiny brain and many babies, despite otherwise having much in common with mammals, suggests a critical step in the evolution of mammals was trading big litters for big brains, and that this step happened later in mammalian evolution, the study said.Ms Hoffman co-authored the study with her graduate adviser, Jackson School Professor Timothy Rowe, who unearthed the fossil in 2000. Sebastian Egberts, a former graduate student and fossil preparator at the Jackson School, spotted the first sign of the babies years later when a grain-sized speck of tooth enamel caught his eye in 2009 as he was unpacking the fossil.“It didn’t look like a pointy fish tooth or a small tooth from a primitive reptile,” said Mr Egberts, who is now an instructor of anatomy at the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine. “It looked more like a molariform tooth (molar-like tooth) — and that got me very excited.”Kayentatherium was a forerunner to modern mammals (Eva Hoffman  The University of Texas at Austin)A CT scan of the fossil undertaken in 2009 revealed a handful of bones inside the rock. But it took advances in CT-imaging technology during the next seven years, the expertise of technicians at UT Austin’s High-Resolution X-ray Computed Tomography Facility (UTCT), and extensive digital processing by Ms Hoffman to reveal the rest of the offspring - not just their jaws and teeth, but complete skulls and partial skeletons - the University of Texas said in a statement.Dinosaurs in the Wild Dinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildPair of QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildChronotex X90 with an AlamosaurusDinosaurs in the WildTyrannosaurus and geyserDinosaurs in the WildDinosaurs in the WildTimebase 67 and a QuetzalcoatlusDinosaurs in the Wildriceratops with a Chronotex X90Dinosaurs in the WildDinosarus in the Wild“There are additional deep stories on the evolution of development, and the evolution of mammalian intelligence and behaviour and physiology that can be squeezed out of a remarkable fossil like this now that we have the technology to study it,” Professor Rowe said.To find so many offspring together from the Jurassic period is unprecedented as young animals would tend to have been destroyed or eaten in the event they had not made it to adulthood.University of TexasEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/14/snapchat-new-york-jewtropolis-snap-map.jpg","title":"snapchat new york jewtropolis snap map","story":"Created with Sketch.Snapchat users reported that New York had been renamed to Jewtropolis on Snap MapSnacpchat blamed third party mapping data from its partner MapboxClick to followThe Independent TechNew York has been renamed Jewtropolis within Snapchat\u0027s Snap Map feature, after online vandals were apparently able to take it over.Snap Map is designed to allow users to discover content within specific regions across the world, such as Snaps of sporting events, celebrations and breaking news.It uses software provided by\u0026nbspMapbox, a separate company that provides custom maps for applications including Foursquare and Lonely Planet.

The firms announced plans to merge their UK operations in November last year, with the aim of creating the country’s second biggest energy provider after British Gas.The Competition and Markets Authority launched an inquiry into how the merger would affect UK households earlier this year, focusing on concerns about the potential impact on standard variable tariffs (SVTs).On Wednesday, the CMA said it had decided to clear the deal after finding that SSE and Npower do not compete closely on SVT prices.Anne Lambert, chair of the inquiry group, said: “It is vital that householders have a range of energy suppliers to choose from so they can find the best deal for them. With more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.“But many people don’t shop around for their energy. So, we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard variable prices.“Our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.”Ms Lambert added that Ofgem’s price cap should also protect SVT customers.Under new rules, Ofgem must cap prices on SVTs offered by the UK’s Big Six energy firms - which will become the Big Five if the SSENpower merger goes ahead. SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies, said he is “confident” that the deal will be completed by the end of the financial year. “The scale and pace of change in the GB energy market continues to be significant and requires us to evolve to stay relevant, competitive and sustainable,” he said. “The planned transaction presents a great opportunity to create a more agile, innovative and efficient company that really delivers for customers and the energy market as a whole.SSE profits hit by energy price cap and loss of 430,000 customersSSE-Npower merger faces full investigation by competition watchdogNpower and SSE merger could push up energy bills, says watchdogGeorge Salmon, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: “SSE and npower’s merger is, in many way, a response to the challenges facing the sector. Pressure is mounting from politicians from all major parties, and increases in wholesale energy prices are starting to squeeze margins. “All the while, the rise of price comparison websites means customers are more likely to switch suppliers. In an industry where stability has been a key attraction for investors over the years, to say the cat is among the pigeons is something of an understatement.”SSE is seeking safety in numbers with this deal, Mr Salmon said, as the merger will mean cost savings and will provide a boost in scale following years of declining customer numbers. However, he added: “It’s not quite so straightforward. The government is due to announce a new cap on the maximum possible charge for standard variable tariffs soon. These tariffs are suppliers’ default offerings and often come with the highest bills. npower’s charges are particularly punitive, and SSE has a huge percentage of customers on such deals. “That means there’s plenty at stake for the new company. Should the cap be more severe than expected, the new business would face a fresh headwind from day one.” \u0026nbspEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":null,"title":"subscribe to the daily edition our newspaper for your tablet","story":"For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript...Please follow the instructions in the link below.Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience."},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/30/09/gettyimages-187243543.jpg","title":"twitter unfollow account app delete non followers tool","story":"Created with Sketch.Twitter carried out a trial recommending users to unfollow accounts they don\u0027t usually interact with\u0027You don\u0027t need to follow everyone to know what\u0027s happening,\u0027\u0026nbspTwitter told usersClick to followThe Independent TechAfter more than a decade of suggesting accounts for its users to follow, Twitter is now testing a feature that suggests which accounts someone might want to unfollow.Some Twitter users have begun reporting a notification from the social media firm that offered the chance to control what\u0027s happening on their news feed.You don\u0027t need to follow everyone to know what\u0027s happening, one notification read.

The EU has refused to give British banks passporting rights to trade within the EU, dashing hopes of a special City deal.However, any agreement that keeps Britain closely tied to the EU will be strongly opposed by Tory Brexiteers, who insist that Britain must have a clean break from the bloc.President Macron is expected to use the European Council meeting in Salzburg on 20 September to stress the need for the EU to maintain a strong relationship with the UK, although council president Donald Tusk is said to have not yet agreed to the French president\u0027s request to present his plan.It comes after weeks of lobbying by UK ministers of their French counterparts as the government attempts to build European support for its Chequers plan.Ms May travelled to Mr Macron\u0027s holiday home earlier this month, while her de facto deputy, David Lidington, yesterday warned French business leaders that the proposals were the only alternative to a no-deal Brexit.Speaking at the Mouvement des Entreprises de France conference, Mr Lidington said: We face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission or no deal.“This is a time when Europe — Europe inside the EU and Europe outside the EU — needs to pull together to embrace the spirit of unity and co-operation that has been the cause of our success for more than half a century. The Independent has launched its #FinalSay campaign to demand that voters are given a voice on the final Brexit deal.Sign our petition hereEnter your email addressFill out this fieldregister with your social account or click here to log inAre you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Are you sure you want to delete this comment?"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/styles/story_large/public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/29/23/Aung-San-Suu-Kyi.jpg","title":"aung san suu kyi nobel peace prize myanmar rohingya genocide","story":"Created with Sketch.Leader of Myanmar government criticised for failing to speak out against military crackdownClick to followThe IndependentAung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracyAung\u0026nbspSan Suu Kyi\u0026nbspwill not be stripped of her Nobel Peace Prize despite a United Nations report which said Myanmar’s military carried out an act of genocide against Rohingya\u0026nbspMuslims.UN investigators said Myanmar’s military took part in mass killings and gang rapes and its top generals should be prosecuted for war crimes and crimes against humanity.Ms\u0026nbspSuu Kyi, who leads the government of Myanmar and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for campaigning for democracy, has been criticised for failing to speak out against the military crackdown in Rakhine\u0026nbspstate.Myanmar rejects UN investigators’ report on Rohingya genocideUN investigators call for Myanmar generals to be tried for genocideMeet the Rohingya who had parents gunned down before their eyesRohingya children\u0027s drawings show horrific violence they sufferedBut the Norwegian Nobel Committee said her prize would not be withdrawn.“It’s important to remember that a Nobel Prize, whether in Physics, Literature or Peace, is awarded for some prize-worthy effort or achievement of the past,” said Olav Njoelstad, the secretary of the committee.“Aung San Suu Kyi won the Nobel Peace Prize for her fight for democracy and freedom up until 1991, the year she was awarded the prize,” he said.The rules regulating the Nobel Prizes do not allow for a prize to be withdrawn, he added.\u0026nbspLast year, the head of the committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen, also said it would not strip the award after previous criticism of Ms\u0026nbspSuu Kyi’s role in the Rohingya crisis.“We don’t do it.

Project Fear forecast dramatic downturns in the economy if the people were so unwise as to vote for Brexit. Wrong again.Since then, we have had record levels of employment, huge investments from the likes of Google, Microsoft, SoftBank and a long list of other companies.They demonstrated their confidence in the future of this great country in the best way possible — with their money.This time round the wise insight came from Andy Haldane, the best economist at the Bank of England.Ruefully he said “economic forecasting is having a Michael Fish moment”.Michael Fish was the weather forecaster who completely mispredicted the huge 1987 storm that struck Britain.If only economic forecasters were even as good as weather forecasters, we would be a lot better off. But they are not, and they are at it again.This week Chancellor Philip Hammond predicted the Treasury would need to raise an extra £80billion in 15 years’ time in the event of a no-deal Brexit.And yet the Chancellor insists on ­trotting out yet another bogus forecast, on the very day that my successor as Brexit Secretary, Dominic Raab, is ­presenting the first set of preparation for no deal.Coincidence? I do not think so.The great departments of state are very careful about what they put in the public domain, and exactly when.For nobody is this more true than the Treasury, which has to judge the public perception of everything it does, if only because of its effect on the markets. So this was either spectacularly incompetent, or deliberate. I know what I think.And even more disgraceful, by doing so it will undermine the Government’s hand in striking a deal with the EU.If they do not think we dare walk away, then they will give us the worst deal they can think of. Bear in mind that the Chequers deal already concedes enormous amounts to the EU.It would not be long before our world-leading position in life sciences, gene technology, artificial intelligence, self-driving cars and a whole range of other modern industries would be being actively undermined by the Europeans.As for being out of reach of the ­European Court, pull the other one.But now the Treasury is beginning to fear that even these spectacular concessions the Government has made in the Chequers deal will not deliver agreement from the European Commission — or if it does, the Commons will turn it down.In that event you can expect attempts by the Remainers in Parliament to try to scupper our departure by delaying it beyond the General Election, or offer some other enormous raft of concessions to give back control of the EU.Hence the ridiculous suggestion that the Army would be used to move food around the country.Why? What conceivable aspect of European policy would handicap British hauliers moving British products from Kent to Cumbria?None of course, but it was just the bogus nonsense some of our Remainer media is only too happy to carry ­completely uncritically. Similarly, we have heard suggestions of all sorts of shortages, based it seems mostly on the idea that the French might impede the flow of goods between Calais and Dover.It would not be the first time we had dealt with such issues. We had about 30 days of such delays in 2015. I remember queues of lorries, but I do not remember shortages of food or medicines.And on other issues, are the Europeans really going to pick a fight on data with the biggest IT power on the continent, on banking are they going to refuse to cooperate with the greatest financial ­centre in the world?Are the Greeks, Italians and Spaniards going to disadvantage the UK residents on whom many of their local economies depend? Or stop tourism? I think not.I suspect we are quite likely to have the odd hiccup when we leave the EU, but we will be able to cope, which is what Dominic Raab was demonstrating this week. And any problems we have will be over in months not years.So in 15 years’ time, far from worrying about Mr Hammond’s £80billion bill, the country will have trouble remembering what all the fuss was about.The biggest question will be whether we have made the most of the opportunities created by Brexit.And that is what we should worry about today, creating the circumstances where this great country can take its proper place in the world. We will only be able to do that if we allow ourselves the freedoms a clean Brexit will deliver.So my advice to all my old colleagues in Cabinet is simple: Ignore the misery merchants of the Treasury, stop fearing things that will never happen, and start planning for the real opportunities that this great country can grasp when it sets its mind to it.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Contact your energy firm as soon as you can and discuss your situation.It has to help you reach a solution, likely through a payment plan.This is where you pay a fixed-amount which you can afford over a set period of time.The plan will cover the debt you owe and the energy you are using now.If you cant reach an agreement, your supplier might insist on installing a pre-payment meter but this is only as a last resort.A government spokesperson said: “We spend £24bn a year on housing benefit each year. And since April we’ve provided additional, targeted housing support for low-income households by increasing more than 200 local housing allowance rates.“Since 2011, we have provided a further £1bn in discretionary housing payment for local authorities to support vulnerable claimants with their housing costs.“We have also delivered over 378,000 new affordable properties since 2010 and we are investing a further £9bn in affordable homes to buy and rent.”"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429566713.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"jehovahs witnesses","story":"While for most of us our knowledge of Jehovahs Witnesses is their frequent door-knocking to try and convert you, a surprising number of celebs - including Serenas sister Venus and model Naomi Campbell - are followers or were raised in the faith.And there are unusual rules members have to follow: they cant have life-saving blood transfusions, are unable to vote or date without chaperones being present - and are forbidden from having oral sex both in and out of marriage.Serena and sister Venus were raised as Jehovahs Witnesses by their mother Oracene Price, who converted to the religion in the 1980s.Serena has been more outspoken about the religion - which was started in the 1870s in the US - constantly thanking Jehovah God for her success as a tennis player.In a recent Vogue interview she also said: Being a Jehovah’s Witness is important to me, but I’ve never really practiced it and have been wanting to get into it.Alexis [Serenas husband] didn’t grow up going to any church, but he’s really receptive and even takes the lead. He puts my needs first.”Legendary singer Prince, who passed away in April 2016, converted to the faith in 2001 following the death of his mother.He described his conversion as: a realisation. Its like Morpheus and Neo in The Matrix.A committed Jehovahs Witness to the end, a memorial for the star took place at the Kingdom Hall of Jehovahs Witnesses near his Minnesota home to commemorate his life.Canadian model Coco Rocha has opened up about her life as a devout Jehovahs Witness saying: faith is everything and despite her fame, she still preaches door-to-door.The whole purpose is to inform people. Some people think we’re a pushy religion, but if you’re not interested, just say so, she explained to luxury magazine Dujour.Naomi Campbells mum Valerie is also a follower, telling Vogue: I brought up Naomi as a Jehovahs Witness, but she must choose her faith for herself. I do give her literature on the subject though when she asks for it.However, the model has not followed in her mothers footsteps by becoming a believer.Other A-list celebs, including Janet Jackson, Ja Rule and actress Michelle Rodriguez were raised in the faith as children, but no longer practise it.Members follow their own version of the Bible called the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures.They say our world now belongs to Satan, and because of this God  - who they call Jehovah - will end it very soon in order to create a new kingdom.Jehovahs Witnesses are not meant to make friends with people of other faiths, as non-believers are considered to belong to Satans world - although this isnt always strict as their celebrity followers show.Many followers say there is a a sense of community that can come with being a Jehovahs Witness - as they are tight-knit and have respect for each other.The easy-to-follow belief system is also a big draw for people interested in the faith, and the organisation has a lot of literature providing what they believe to be the answers to lifes big questions.  Jehovahs Witnesses are barred from having blood transfusions - which makes operations like  Caesarean sections - that often require them- more difficult to complete, as blood products are linked to immorality.As one Jehovahs Witness told the New Yorker: It’s as much a sin to take a blood transfusion as to have an extramarital affair.This has led to several deaths - and ious court battles between Jehovahs Witnesses and doctors seeking to treat them.Last Autumn, a 27-year-old Canadian new mother, Éloïse Dupuis, died a week after giving birth due to haemorrhaging - but despite doctors pleas for her to have a blood transfusion she refused.Jehovahs Witnesses dont believe in sex before marriage - and dating isnt condoned unless they bring along a chaperone as well.So its likely that the first person you choose to date will be the person you marry.And after marriage, theres still restrictions on sex - namely anal and oral sex which are strictly forbidden, something that is also frowned upon in religions such as Islam and other forms of Christianity.Followers are peaceful - even refusing military service - but are suffering from persecution in some countries.Earlier this year, they were declared as an extremist group in Russia with raids on their churches and several arrests - its thought hundreds have fled the country and applied for asylum in Finland since.Other things they are prohibited from doing include being patriotic, as it is seen as worshipping an idol, or voting or canvassing for political parties as they remain politically neutral.As Jesus never celebrated his birthday, Jehovahs Witnesses dont mark theirs either, and they dont acknowledge the major Christian holidays of Christmas Day or Easter, as they believe these festivals are based on pagan customs.On the plus side, it means they probably save a lot of money due to not having to fork out for expensive gifts.Their beliefs in the end of the world have led to a series of unfulfilled prophecies.In 1975 they were told the world would end and members of the church were encouraged to preach full-time and get rid of their possessions.Thousands of them quit their jobs and sold their homes - but Armageddon didnt come leading to a drop in membership, something which has remained in decline ever since.Armageddon was also promised before the start of the Millennium, but again never materialised.There has also been other controversies: the Charity Commission are currently investigating claims that some followers were abused as children by fellow members of the faith.Members are known for their recruitment drives: previously, they would go door-to-door to try and recruit new converts, handing out literature that explains their beliefs.However, people who have left the church have described this as being exhausting.One said: I barely got any sleep when I was a Witness...I needed the weekends to catch up on my sleep debt, but instead I had to get up at the crack of dawn to go out preaching.Followers of the religion are now more commonly found preaching outside train stations across the UK, and in London alone their volunteers give out an estimated 100,000 magazines every month.The publication, Awake!, has been running since 1919, and with a global circulation of 65 million they show no sign of stopping recruiting any time soon. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

In return, they must respect what we are.Single market means single market ... There is no single market a la carte.In response to Mr Barnier’s change in stance, sterling rallied sharply against both the dollar and the euro this afternoon as the markets reacted to the decreasing chance of there being a “no deal” Brexit.His comments came just as the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab was appearing in front of Lords Committee to answer questions about how the EU negotiations were going.He rejected suggestions from a Labour peer that Theresa May’s Chequers agreement amounted to “begging for a deal, saying: “I don’t beg.”And he said he was prepared to play hardball with Brussels over our £39billion “divorce payment”, suggesting the UK could choose to withhold some of it if a long-term agreement cannot be agreed.The Cabinet minister added: Im confident that a deal is within our sights. Were bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.There was a light-hearted moment when Lord Liddle’s mobile phone went off in the committee room and Mr Raab joked: Its probably someone from Brussels trying to check in on the money.He had been speaking about the UK’s plans for providing the EU with a the financial settlement, saying a “no-deal” scenario could affect arrangements over payments to the EU.Mr Raab said: The financial settlement, as its calibrated in the withdrawal agreement, reflects a whole range of considerations not just the strict legal obligations.“And if we left with no deal then not only would there be a question around quite what the shape of those financial obligations were as a matter of strict law, but secondly on the timing.Remember that the timing of payments is actually - we overlook it on our side - rather important on the EU side because of the way money is distributed.“But I dont think it could be safely assumed on anyones side that the financial settlement as has been agreed by the withdrawal agreement would then just be paid in precisely the same shape or speed or rate if there was no deal.As I said that would be a peculiar position for the UK to take because we view the package as a whole.It comes as Mr Barnier was accused of avoiding having more Brexit talks with Mr Raab because of diary issues - while also posting pictures from his holidayHe previously said he is available 24-7 for discussions with the Brexit Secretary – but the minister has complained his requests for discussions have been knocked back by Brussels.Earlier this month the pair vowed to speed up the drawn-out process of debating Theresa May’s Chequers plan with the autumn deadline for a deal looming.They said they would have “continuous talks” from then on, but today there are reports UK officials are “tearing their hair out” at the EU’s failure to live up to this promise.The two sides were due to spend this week locked in negotiations, but Mr Barnier only offered Mr Raab a three-hour slot this Friday because of his schedule commitments.It came after he tweeted an image of himself in the sunshine in eastern France on Sunday.The  reported that after complaints from the British side that has been extended to five hours, but it says diplomats have raised this issue several times.The newspaper reports that the EU commission’s claim, repeated by a spokesman on Tuesday, that Mr Barnier was available day or night has been proved to be false.Mr Raab hinted at his frustration when at a press conference last week he expressed hope for a longer meeting this week.And he also suggested a deal would require “energy on both sides”, as they admitted the October deadline for hammering out a deal had slipped to the end of the year.In response an EU official said: “The commission is working for a deal. Negotiation agendas, including meetings between principals, are decided jointly.“The aim of the meetings between the principals is to take stock of progress made at technical and coordinator level.”The Department for Exiting the European Union said: “Both the secretary of state and Michel Barnier are committed to weekly discussions to ensure that both sides get a good deal.”Responding to todays story Mr Raab said: I shall be over in Brussels tomorrow evening for a long, substantive meeting on Friday, I hope that gives you the facts directly with Michel Barnier.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Let them form their own party, we will work with them, and we’ll try and do it together.Top Tory Jacob Rees-Mogg told The Sun the plotters reminded him of the Japanese officer who continued fighting WW2 until 1974.He said: They want to turn the heroic mistake of the Japanese soldier Hiroo Onoda into public policy.He spent 29 years in the jungle before recognising defeat - perhaps the Lib Dems and their friends will be in the wilderness for longer."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429208376.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"inside north korea pictures everyday life","story":"A country shrouded in secrecy, emerging sporadically from its inward-looking society to take over our headlines with aggression and absurdity.Admittance to the country is difficult and often impossible, but from time-to-time Western photographers are allowed in.Earlier this month Getty photographer Carl Court was granted permission to document the Communist state, following its citizens at work and at play.Families relaxing at arcades, kids swimming in water parks, women spending time at the beach and a bloke getting his haircut are just some of the intriguing snaps.Whether it is news of its relentless pursuit of nuclear weapons capability or its leader Kim Jong-Uns to-and-fros with US President Donald Trump, North Korea remains fascinating.Their unknown way of life, reports of poverty and prison camps, international hostages and hostile borders make it a country that is truly unique.Even the date in North Korea is unique: it is 106, not 2018, with the country basing its calendar on Kim Il-Sungs date of birth, 15th April 1912.The country is considered the worlds only necrocracy, with North Koreans claiming they are governed by someone who is dead - Kim Il-sung himself.It is also home to the worlds biggest sport and events stadium, boasting a capacity of more 114,000. "},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT0004225921841.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"pm bans sale of energy drinks kids","story":"The sweeping ban will also cover higher caffeine drinks like Monster that have been blamed for suicides and will apply to all retailers.The crackdown comes after supermarket regulations prohibiting under-16s from consuming the dangerous cans was branded a failure by health chiefs.Almost a third of teens have consumed the drinks - with a quarter of 6 to 9-year-olds admitting to buying the high-sugar beverages.The government is to launch at 12-week consultation on whether to set the ban at 16 or 18.Speaking during her Africa tour, the Prime Minister Theresa May said: “With thousands of young people regularly consuming energy drinks, often because they are sold at cheaper prices than soft drinks, we will consult on banning the sale of energy drinks to children.“It is vital that we do all we can to make sure children have the best start in life and I encourage everyone to put forward their views.”A Downing Street source added that on the ban that “it is a question of how, not whether we do it.”Existing industry labelling guidelines require any high caffeine drinks to carry a warning and state it is not recommended for children.But now the sale of any drink with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre is to be put under similar restrictions used to protect kids from fireworks and cigarettes in shops.Red Bull has more than 80mg of caffeine in a single 250ml can - putting it well within in the scope of the ban.Monster Energy which comes in 440ml cans has 140mg caffeine per serving.Ministers claim that excessive consumption of these drinks has already been linked to health issues in children like headaches, sleep problems, stomach aches and hyperactivity.And teachers claim the drinks lead to bad behaviour in the classrooms - with British adolescents consuming 50 per cent more cans than European school kids.Public Health Minister Steve Brine said: “We all have a responsibility to protect children from products that are damaging to their health and education, and we know that drinks packed to the brim with caffeine, and often sugar, are becoming a common fixture of their diet.Chief Executive of Public Health England Duncan Selbie added: “Children do not need energy drinks to get through the day – they offer nothing more than unnecessary sugar“Restricting the sale of these drinks is another bold step needed to turn the tide on childhood obesity.”The measure comes in the next wave of the Childhood Obesity Strategy, but last night sparked an angry backlash from some in Government.One senior Minister hit out last night that government policy has been reduced to “a ban a day” after electric shock dog collars and clampdowns on single use plastic.They fumed: Every day, something else banned. Its just so depressing.However the move was welcomed by Jamie Oliver who said: “We have a massive problem with kids and energy drinks.The campaigning TV chef added: “Too many children are regularly using them to replace breakfast.“Teachers from across the country have told me how their lessons are disrupted in classrooms because of these drinks, packed with stimulants.He added: “It’s really great news that the government is announcing their intention to stop selling these drinks to kids.“I’m sure parents and health experts across the UK will happily tell the Government this is the right thing to do.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It was a hot, bright day.PC Evans claimed the mum was “playing it down” when she arrived on the scene and tried to lessen the time she had been away.An ambulance was called and the child was taken to an Exeter hospital.Miss Hodges said: There was no injury fortunately caused by the child being left in the vehicle.Dr Anthony Hudson, consultant in emergency medicine, said he examined the boy and “had no concerns of physical injury from this incident”.But he said there was potential for heat stroke caused by the greenhouse effect of being in a car.The mum, who lives in Croydon, denied a charge of abandoning her child in a manner likely to cause him unnecessary suffering or injury to health.We pay for your stories!

Boris... Johnson. The bicycle guy... was here.”And he took at dig at Mrs May for being the first PM to visit Kenya in decades, thanking her for coming to see how things has changed.Instead he namechecked Donald Trump and China as key investment partners alongside Britain and was luke warm about effect of Brexit on trade with the African powerhouse.Mrs May looked on stony-faced as her Tory rival once again upstaged a key moment, but later supressed a smile when the President rembered the name.Margaret Thatcher was the last British PM to tour the country back in 1988 - David Cameron was set to go in 2016 but didnt after he quit following the dramatic Brexit vote in June.Gordon Brown visited in 2005 as Chancellor.Last night Mrs May signed a new security deal with Nigeria to train thousands more troops to fight the terror group Boko Haram.And today she will announce a tie-up with Kenyan authorities to help track down British paedophiles using data from tech firms.Mrs May is giving the Kenyan President a framed map of the London marathon route made by British designer Holly Francesca.It is personalised with the Kenyan winners of Londons most famous annual race, and the historic landmarks along the way. The trip is part of efforts to build a global Britain and maximise trade links ahead of Brexit.Shes already announced £4billion worth of extra financial support for the Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, and has promised to help crack down on illegal human trafficking and Islamic extremism."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418524692.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"thai cave diver vernon unsworth elon musk paedo","story":"News of the legal move comes as the outspoken Tesla tycoon doubled down on his outrageous Twitter tirade against Mr Unsworth while saying he believes more research needs to be done into his background.His latest outburst comes after a US-based lawyer for Unsworth sent Musk a letter - by Fedex and electric mail -  notifying him of a possible lawsuit.He is being represented by well-known L.Lin Wood P.C,  of Atlanta, who are described as powerhouse libel and defamation lawyers.”Musk made his original allegations against Unsworth in mid July without any evidence, before apologising and deleting his offending tweets.However, on Tuesday, the outspoken Tesla boss seemed to reignite the paedo controversy once again using Twitter.He wrote: “You don’t think it’s strange [Mr Vernon] hasn’t sued me? He was offered free legal services.”In a tense exchange with a journalist he added: Did you investigate at all? I’m guessing answer is no. Why?Now BuzzFeed News has revealed Mr Unsworths lawyer sent Musk a letter on August 6 outlining a possible lawsuit over “false and defamatory statements.”The letter reads: “You published through three different tweets to your twenty-two million followers that Mr Unsworth engages in the sexual exploitation of Thai children, and you did so at a time when he was working to save the lives of twelve Thai children.“You did so without any basis. According to a subsequent Twitter post, you did so out of anger.I am in the process of preparing a civil complaint for libel against you. In an attempt to avoid litigation and to see the public record corrected, I invite your legal representatives to contact me.L. Lin Wood, P.C., was founded in 1983 in Atlanta by L. Lin Wood to focus on medical malpractice cases for victims.Mr. Wood soon established a reputation as a stand out trial lawyer who could win large verdicts and big settlements.His first defamation client was Richard Jewell, a security guard falsely accused over the 1996 Atlanta Olympics bombing.He then went on to representother high-profile individuals including the parents of child beauty queen JonBenét Ramsey.Since then he has established his reputation as one of the nation’s most feared and respected defamation lawyers.The firm were:Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, Unsworth said he could not comment on the issue, but added: “It’s all being dealt with, that’s all I can say.”Mr Musk’s accusation was widely criticised with Mr Unsworth admitting the public spat had upset his family.“It’s taken a bit of the pleasure out of what’s happened, what we’ve achieved, for me anyway. It’s very much upset my daughter,” he said in July.Yesterday the  Brits mother Vera Unsworth has confirmed her son is now consulting lawyers.“He’s consulted his lawyer this morning. That’s all he’s told me,” the 88-year-old said from her house in Braintree, Essex, reports the MailOnline.“I don’t know who his lawyers are or where they’re based. My son is in London on business at the moment but he’s asked me not to comment any further.”Mr Unsworth is a British expat and caver who lives near the Tham Luang tunnel network where the 12 boys and their football coach were trapped for more than two weeks.He played a key role in the rescue and first clashed with billionaire when he dismissed an offer by Musk send a mini-submarine to help in the rescue efforts.Mr Unsworth dismissed the offer as just a PR stunt and said the billionaire could stick the submarine where it hurts.Musk - worth a reported 20bn -  then hit back in a bizarre series of tweets, some of which he later deleted, suggesting the expert had exaggerated his role in the rescue.He also claimed it was suspicious the 63-year-old lived in Thailand before explicitly branding him a paedo in one post.Musk added: Never saw this British expat guy who lives in Thailand  at any point when we were in the caves.At the time, Mr Unsworth had said he was considering taking legal action against Musk for his astonishing remarks.Musk then tweeted an apology: “My words were spoken in anger after Mr. Unsworth said several untruths \u0026amp suggested I engage in a sexual act with the mini-sub, which had been built as an act of kindness \u0026amp according to specifications from the dive team leader.“Nonetheless, his actions against me do not justify my actions against him, and for that I apologize to Mr. Unsworth and to the companies I represent as leader. The fault is mine and mine alone.Shares in his company dived by around £2billion following his initial comments, which he now admits were made in anger.Last month Unsworth said: Ive been approached by British lawyers, American lawyers. I havent decided what to do next yet.I cant let it go. Theres too much out there already, Unsworth told Reuters in an interview.Asked why he thought Musk would make such a comment about him, he said: I dont know."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429867226.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"new super snake species bred florida","story":"A genetic study found cross-bred DNA in an invasive snake species currently terrorising the area.The deadly mix-breed reptile is slaughtering its way through the regions small mammals.And the new species is also adaptable to new habitats — meaning it could spread out across the states and beyond.Spawned from a mix of Burmese and Indian python snakes, the super snake exhibits the strengths of each of its parent DNA strands.Indian pythons like high, dry ground while Burmese pythons are swamp-dwellers — meaning it is suited to a vast range of environments.Both parent species can grow up to 15-18ft long and weigh as much as 11st.Researchers at the United States Geological Survey say tests show the cross-breed snakes are on the rise in the Everglades national park.Of the 400 snakes they caught in the region during their survey 13 of the reptiles had genetic markers from Indian pythons.Their study, published this week in Ecology And Evolution, adds that the snakes show a greater level of adaptability than their standard counterparts.It reads: Our finding that the Florida python population is comprised of distinct lineages suggests greater standing iation for adaptation and the potential for broader areas of suitable habitat in the invaded range.And the surprising findings are leading the worries that the snakes might spread out even further.Lead author and USGS geneticist Margaret Hunter told the Miami Herald: If the Indian pythons have a wider range, perhaps these Everglades snakes now have that capability.It is believed that several thousand pythons are now roaming the wetlands — which are thought to be the result of escaped pets.And because of the size of the population they are able to rapidly adapt.Dr Hunter added: If some animals die out because of climatic issues, there are other animals that may not die out.While it is unclear why the two species mated, one possibility is that pet owners wished to create a more colourful — or more powerful — crossbreed.And with global temperatures on the rise, scientists believe the snakes could spread north from Florida.The public are allowed to kill and remove pythons from the Everglades without a permit given their invasive nature.They pose a big threat to native animals in the region including indigenous birds, reptiles and mammals."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/NINTCHDBPICT000429829764.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"baby was left with horrific burn after reckless smoker flicked cigarette into her pram","story":"Five-week-old Sophia Harnaman was left with severe blisters on her right arm following the accident next to a bus stop in Edinburgh.Distraught Amy Harnaman, 23, grabbed her screaming daughter and ripped off her smouldering coat and raced home to douse her wound.She was then rushed to hospital and her family fear she will be scarred.Amy, a nursery worker, said: I got her out of the buggy, stripped her down out of her snowsuit and checked her arm.There was a blister starting so I got her up to the flat and stuck it under cold water -

On Monday, 6,000 far-right protesters were involved in clashes in Chemnitz in Saxony, Germany. In Italy, the right-wing League is in government with the populist Five Star movement. The far-right Sweden Democrats could hold the balance of power after elections this autumn. It is a similar story in Hungary, Austria and Slovenia. Some fear the “great peace” – the 70-plus years of co-operation and security in Western Europe – is now under threat. The rise of the far-right has co\u0026shyincided with a decline of the centre-left. Of the 28 EU states, only six – Spain, Portugal, Malta, Greece, Sweden and Slovakia – have left-wing governments. The right’s tough line on migration has played well with some of the left’s traditional supporters. Prof Matthew Goodwin, of Kent University, says: “We have centre- left parties struggling with a new agenda of terrorism, immigration and the refugee crisis.” There are fears for the future of the EU. A poll for Reuters suggests far-right parties could increase their seats in the European Parliament from 80 to 122 next year. Prof Goodwin says: “The issue of the refugee crisis is massive for the EU. If they cannot be seen to respond effectively to that issue and they cannot come up with a unified plan, that is going to cause the EU major, major problems.” So what is the current situation? HUNGARY At the vanguard of the populist surge is PM Viktor Orban. In power since 2010, he has exploited unease over immigration to whip up nationalist sentiment. He casts himself as the defender of Europe against Muslim migrants, saying “a Europe with a mixed population” has “no sense of identity”.  Hungary is now described as an “illiberal democracy” due to its suppression of free speech and political cronyism. Allies of Orban, 55, have been appointed to key positions in the courts, media and civil service. In June, a law was introduced so that anyone “facilitating illegal immigration” could face prison. Another crackdown, a swipe at billionaire philanthropist George Soros, a fierce critic of Orban, aims to curtail the activities of charities and civil rights groups. Hungary has been referred to the European Court of Justice for “non-compliance” with EU law but Brussels has done little to tackle corruption in the country and allegations that billions of euros in EU funding goes to Orban’s cronies. GERMANY The anti-immigration Alternative for Germany party entered parliament for the first time in last October’s elections, winning 12.6% of the vote and more than 90 seats. Preying on fears about immigration and Islam, one of its leading figures, Alexander Gauland, 77, has talked of fighting an “invasion of foreigners”. The party has also been accused of anti-Semitism.  Traditional Conservative parties have shifted to the right to head off the threat. Angela Merkel’s government almost collapsed this year when her coalition partners the Baian-based Christian Social Union demanded a tougher line on immigration. SWEDEN The Sweden Democrats, who are anti-immigration, are now polling a record high of 20 per cent. The party, which has roots in neo-Nazi organisations, is pushing an agenda of “Swexit”, halting migration and outsourcing the processing of asylum seekers to beyond Europe’s borders. Its focus on crime and immigration has found appeal among voters who previously supported the centre-left Social Democrats. It could hold the balance of power after next month’s election. POLAND The right-wing Law and Justice party came to power in 2015 and promotes a hardline nationalist and religious agenda. The Government has alarmed the EU by taking control of state media and granting itself powers to hire and fire the previously independent judiciary.  Exploiting unease about immigration, party leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski, 69, claimed that migrants could  cause “epidemics”.    The Government made it illegal to accuse the Polish state of complicity in the Holocaust, leading to accusations  that it is trying to cover  up collaboration with  the Nazis.  AUSTRIA The anti-immigration Freedom Party was given several key cabinet posts as part of a coalition deal with the majority People’s Party. Founded by former Nazis in the 1950s, the Freedom Party wants a tough line on asylum seekers and immigrants. Legislation before the Austrian parliament would force asylum seekers to hand over their mobile phones and surrender cash to pay for their upkeep. Other proposals include a ban on girls aged 10 and under from wearing headscarves at school. A leading party member caused controversy by demanding a law requiring permits for kosher meat. The Government had to reassure the Jewish community the suggestion was not official policy. BRITAIN There are fears that a failure to deliver the Brexit promised by the Leave campaign could fuel far-right tensions here. UKIP has made a mini-recovery in the polls off the back of its claim that PM Theresa May is “betraying” voters with her soft Brexit. Leader Gerard Batten has taken the party further to the right with anti-Muslim \u0026shyrhetoric, calling Islam a “death cult” and talking of an “explosion” of mosques in Europe.

Kira Aldcroft, 22, had a healthy pregnancy before son Leo Aldcroft was born nine days premature on August 9. The bar worker had never experienced symptoms of genital herpes apart from thrush, which she claims nurses told her was a common side effect of being pregnant, and so did not know she was harbouring the dormant virus.  But just eight days after Leo\u0027s birth, Leo was rushed to hospital with suspected sepsis after he began to bleed from his mouth.  Leo deteriorated and was placed in an induced coma before doctors discovered Kira was carrying the Herpes HSV2 virus - a type of genital herpes - which she had unwittingly passed to her son during his delivery. Kira is now speaking out to raise awareness of the deadly virus - just days after Leo died on August 19 - and is calling for herpes tests to become obligatory for all mums-to-be.  She said: I\u0027ve always wanted to be a mum so being able to bring Leo home was just a dream come true, everything was finally perfect and everyone was happy. But as Leo was laid there in hospital with doctors and nurses surrounding him, it was a mother\u0027s worst nightmare. I was physically sick when the herpes test came back positive, as I had done everything humanly possible to give my son the best start in life. I could have contracted it before or during the pregnancy, as it can be dormant for months or years so there\u0027s no way of telling. I had no knowledge I had the virus, as there were no symptoms other than thrush, and if I had been offered a test during my pregnancy all this heartache could have been avoided. I\u0027m now urging men and women to get tested. That\u0027s my message to everyone - not just pregnant women. I hope sharing Leo\u0027s story will save other lives.  Herpes has two strains, which are both dangerous to babies as their immune systems are yet to have fully developed to fight off the virus.  Type 1 can cause cold sores , while Type 2 typically causes genital herpes, and the virus can be passed onto newborn babies during vaginal delivery.  As Leo fought for his life in hospital, medics told Kira her son\u0027s odds of surviving were dropping by the minute. Unable to hold her baby boy, Kira and her mum had to look on helplessly as doctors fought to save his life. But on the Sunday morning - just hours after he was first rushed into hospital - doctors told her his liver and kidneys were failing and that they would have to put him on a dialysis machine in order to keep him alive. Leo was then moved to a private room as Kira was told it was time to get her baby boy baptised. Soon after, Kira and her mother were given the devastating news that medical staff had found a clot and swelling on Leo\u0027s brain and that all his organs were failing. It was then that Kira decided that her brave boy had suffered enough and she made the heartbreaking decision to turn off his life support machines. Kira said: As Leo lay in hospital, all I wanted to do was to hold and to kiss him and to tell him that everything would be alright.  I told my baby boy to fight and that we were all on his side, and how much I loved him and wanted to return home with him. Leo\u0027s baptism was a nice moment to know I could bless him before he passed. I wanted to get him christened at Christmas, but obviously his time came a lot sooner. The consultant then told us his condition had worsened. Once I knew the status of Leo\u0027s health, I knew it was time for me as his mother to say \u0027enough is enough\u0027. Once I\u0027d decided that, I was then allowed to be next to him and be by his side. I fell asleep with my head on his incubator and held his hand and when it was time to stop the machines, they let me hold him. It was heartbreaking, as he took his last breaths in my arms, I held his hand and held him so close, and told him how proud I was of him. The doctors then left the room, and let me and my family have our time alone and a chance to say goodbye. Despite his short life, Kira is adamant her son touched the lives of everyone he met.

Judith Kilshaw and her ex-husband Alan tried to adopt the children from their American mum after handing over \u0026pound8,200. But after British social services stepped in, the babies were returned to the US, where they have since been brought up by a loving church-going family. On Wednesday the Mirror told how Kiara and Keyara Wecker, now 18, are now starting their adult lives and studying social sciences. It was the first time Judith, 64, had heard anything about the life of the babies she had cradled all those years ago.  And in her terraced home in north Wales, she said:“I’m pleased they are doing well. That is all I have ever really wanted, for them to have a stable life, to have a good life.” But she insisted she should have been allowed to bring the girls up as her own. “I think they should have stayed with me and Alan” she said. Judith still has faded photographs of the girls from their brief time in the UK. And she admits she looks at them every now and then and wonders what might have been. “They are 18? That has gone quick. I wonder what they look like?” she said. “I wonder how they feel, the girls, I wonder if they have been told the truth of what happened. I do wonder if they know about me and Alan.  “I’m glad they have gone to university. I’m glad they are going to prosper and haven’t got pregnant at 16 or gone off the rails. “I hope they do very well, I wish them all the best.” Judith and Alan split in 2006 and three years later she married Stephen Sillett, now 51. But she remains on good terms with her ex and he even walked her down the aisle at her wedding. Alan, 63, a former a solicitor, suffers from pulmonary fibrosis and has been in hospital for the past seven months. Judith plans to care for him when he is allowed to return to his home in Shotton, north Wales. She and Stephen still live together in Rhosllanerchrugog, but when asked if they are a couple she said: “Not really, in a sense yes and in a sense no. It is a bit of a muddle.” Judith says she and Alan, who have two sons, James, 25 and Rupert, 22, often speak about the twin girls they had hoped to raise.  “It’s a shame that they aren’t going to university around here, I wished they had stayed in Britain, we have very good universities in Britain. “I would have wanted them to have made something of their life - be professional, get a good education, make good life choices.” The mum of four, who has five cats and a dog and also looks after her ex’s five cats, said: “I wanted them to go into law or the medical field, or even the veterinary field. That would have been handy, with having all these animals. “Sometimes I think about them, wonder where they are, how their life is going because it could’ve gone very wrong, they could have ended up getting involved in the gang and gun culture, I would have blamed social services if that had happened.” Judith has two daughters from an earlier relationship, Louisa, 37 and Caley, 35, but has no contact with either of them. “Caley is in Seattle, we don’t speak, we have no spoken for a long long time. And Louisa is in Edinburgh, and I don’t speak to her either.”  But she said she would love to speak to the twins Kiara and Keyara. Asked what she would say to them she said: “Look at you now, haven’t you done well. I wish you could’ve stayed but I’m glad you’ve made something of your lives.” She added: “I would like to see them again, would like to talk to them on video chat, to see how they are and how they’ve turned out. It would be nice to hear from them and explain who I am and let them know they were wanted. “Sometimes Alan and I talk about them, at times like Christmas especially, we’ve often wondered what they are doing now.” The twins were just six months old when they were caught in the centre of a transatlantic custody battle. Judith and Alan, unable to have more children of their own, had explored international adoption opportunties on the internet and travelled to the US to meet the young babies they hoped to raise as their own. It later emerged another couple in America couple had previously adopted the sisters, who were then snatched back by their birth mother Tranda Wecker, 28, and sold on to the Kilshaws for \u0026pound8,200.

Nicola Urquhart says a lack of CCTV in the hours after her son vanished means he could have walked or been driven out of the area he was last seen in. She claims new information has come to light in the case of the 23-year-old, who vanished after a night out with pals in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk. Detectives investigating Corrie\u0027s disappearance in September 2016 believe the most likely scenario is that he got into a recycling bin that was scooped up by a Biffa bin lorry from a horseshoe-shaped storage area. It is thought he was then transported to a waste site around 30 miles away.  But despite specialist search teams spending 27 weeks scouring the landfill near Cambridge last year, they found no trace of the airman\u0027s remains. Last night, Nicola, 49, posted a lengthy and emotional statement on the \u0027Find Corrie\u0027 Facebook group, saying she was simply a mum looking for her son. She listed a series of facts, as we understand them and claimed they show without reasonable doubt that Corrie was never in the bin or in landfill. She also said her son could have left the \u0027Horseshoe\u0027 area without being captured on CCTV footage - something she initially believed wasn\u0027t possible. She claimed: Initially I was told by the RAF that no one would have been able to leave this area [the Horseshoe] without being captured on this CCTV. The senior investigating officer  then confirmed this fact.  We have now been told that this is not accurate. Corrie could have left in a vehicle after 7am and could have walked out in any direction after midday. The reason for this is the CCTV was only collected in the immediate area up to midday. After 7am not one of the huge number of vehicles in the area have been identified or traced, this is why he could leave in any of these vehicles and there was no CCTV collected in this area after noon – this is why Corrie could have walked out. Following Corrie\u0027s disappearance, it was initially thought the airman, who was based at RAF Honington, may have tried to go home. A search from Bury St Edmunds to RAF Honington was carried out, but Nicola said she believes other areas need searching.  She said: “We know that when Corrie went missing there was a massive search carried out from Bury to Honington this search covered the area that if a person was to walk the police have guessed – slightly more to it than a simple guess, I am using simple terms – which would be most likely. “Suffolk MIT have drawn a line of the most direct way to walk “as the crow flies”. This area has been searched. “However, when I have been with Corrie, including the week before he disappeared he drove from Honington to Bury on each occasion by driving along the A134 and along Green Ln. “April [his partner] has also confirmed this is the way Corrie would usually drive. “The search for Corrie walking back to Honington only covers the right-hand side fields of this road with only the verge on the other side being searched. She claimed: There have been a couple of other areas searched on this side but the majority has not been searched passed the standard search when searching a road.”  The \u0026pound2million hunt for Corrie was shelved earlier this year after police said there were no realistic lines of enquiry left to pursue. Officers from Suffolk Constabulary said the young man\u0027s case would remain open and be moved to the Major Investigation Cold Case Team. Any credible new information will continue to be followed up by cops - however it may never be known what happened to Corrie. In her post, Nicola added: The entire area that had rubbish dumped on it from September 19 when Cell 22 was opened to September 30 when it was closed was searched and rubbish from Bury on the dates that Corrie went missing was found but not one single trace of Corrie or his clothes was found. “Rubbish was found in Cell 22 from the exact date Corrie went missing and could be confirmed it was from Bury. I believe this all shows without reasonable doubt that Corrie was never in this bin or landfill.” The mum also said she would be looking to have areas searched but this will take time, should I need help again with searching I will ask.  “I would beg anyone that felt they had information but due to the constant messages from the police that Corrie was in a landfill felt it wasn’t relevant to please get in touch with Suffolk police, she continued in her post. “We believe that this new information changes everything.” Suffolk Constabulary told  it stands by its previous statement. A spokesman said the most likely scenario is that Corrie unfortunately went into the bin which was emptied into the Biffa lorry and consequently ended up in the waste process. He added that the force has previously stated that unless new, realistic and credible information becomes available then the investigation is complete.  Last month, Corrie\u0027s heartbroken dad, Martin McKeague, declared his son was no longer missing and that he knew what happened to him. Taking to Facebook, Martin said his son was last tracked to near a landfill site and is now somewhere in the Suffolk waste disposal system.  He went on to say his remains are essentially irretrievable. CCTV from that evening two years ago showed Corrie staggering into the industrial \u0027Horseshoe\u0027 area at 3.25am. At the time of his disappearance, his girlfriend April Oliver was pregnant. She gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, Ellie-Louise, last year. The child\u0027s middle name is Corrie, in a touching tribute to her dad. Detective Superintendent Katie Elliott said previously: It is extremely disappointing that we have not been able to find Corrie. I can only imagine the strain Corrie’s family have been under over the past 18 months and I thank them for their patience and understanding. Whilst the investigation has drawn to a natural conclusion we will continue to work with the family to provide answers to their questions and help them understand what may have happened.

Dad Haydn Brown described the apartment they were given at Pontins Prestatyn Sands resort in Wales earlier this month as a hovel and said it was worse than a detention centre. The 38-year-old said he was then moved to another apartment which was just as filthy and claims he even had to clean up dried faeces off the floor while the bathroom was strewn with what looked like used toilet paper. Former firefighter Haydn booked the \u0026pound100 last-minute stay at the resort with carer partner Kylie Cox, 29, and children Eve, 12, Noah, 6, and one-year-old Amelia, so they could visit a sick relative living nearby.  Haydn, from Manchester, said: I\u0027ve slept in hostels all over the world and I\u0027ve stayed in some absolute hovels but this is by far the worst. I remember going to Pontins as a kid and it was always clean and tidy. It was actually a nice place to be. Not any more. The site itself was vile. There was a smell of weed blowing through the arcade and the lockers in the swimming pool area were broken. One lady was in tears saying she didn\u0027t feel safe there. We were staying for two days to visit a sick relative nearby. I\u0027d tried everywhere else but it was the only place that had spaces. We were supposed to have a ground floor apartment because of the baby but they didn\u0027t give us one of those.  The first room we went into was filthy, it was like a crack house. There were empty beer bottles, dirty nappies on the floor, takeaway containers and old cigarette packets on the sofa. I poked the takeaway packets and a load of flies came out, the smell was awful. It was really upsetting, we didn\u0027t need the stress what with visiting our poorly relative. It hadn\u0027t been professionally cleaned. We didn\u0027t even look in the other rooms, I just went straight to the manager and asked to be moved. After complaining, the family were given a different ground floor apartment but Haydn said from then on it was a \u0027comedy of errors\u0027. Haydn said: We got to that room and there was ketchup on the kitchen floor and I could actually write my name in the dirt that was on the cooker.  I went back to speak to the manager and told them the room was a mess and asked if they could send someone to clean it.    They sent a man with a dustpan and brush and a mop and bucket but no cleaning products. I asked him where his cleaning products were and he said he was going to clean it with water. I couldn\u0027t believe it, I thought it was disgraceful. We went to the restaurant and when we got back he\u0027d made a half-hearted attempt with the dust pan and brush. They didn\u0027t clean any of the kitchen, the grill pan and kettle were rusty. They told us they\u0027d cleaned it but they didn\u0027t. They cleaned the front windows and the sofa and picked up the loo roll but that was it, it was filthy. I\u0027ve spent 20 years as a firefighter and I\u0027ve come out of houses that have been on fire that have been in a better condition. Haydn said he was forced to buy his own cleaning equipment and spend four hours tackling the vile mess himself.  Haydn said: There was even a piece of old poo on the floor of the bathroom, I think it had been there a long time. I tried to scrub it up with baby wipes but it didn\u0027t work. The bedrooms were horrible. I pulled one of the beds out and you could see it had not been cleaned for a long time, there was so much dust. I even bought my own bleach and actually spent the first four hours cleaning the apartment myself. It was an absolute dump, it looked like how I expect a detention centre would. Haydn complained numerous times but said he was only given a \u0027solutions form\u0027 and told he would have to send it in the post to request a refund. Hayden said: If they would have refunded me maybe we could have found another hotel room but we had no choice but to stay there for two nights.  There were so many people in the reception area crying and getting upset. I know it\u0027s not a posh place but you expect it to be clean. One woman was saying that there was somebody else in her room, another said she couldn\u0027t stay there because she felt unsafe. She said she had a horrible time and was going to book into another hotel. None of the televisions worked. There were signs in reception saying they know there are issues with the signal and they\u0027re in the process of fixing it but you could tell those signs had been there a long time. The whole place was deteriorating.

Sarah McGill had been facing up to 15 years behind bars, but was instead given five years\u0027 probation and ordered to leave America immediately. The ruling came after she was found guilty of lewd or lascivious battery - - known as statutory rape in the UK. As the probation was terminated upon her leaving the US, her sentence was effectively deportation. The sweetheart deal with prosecutors means that the the 28-year-old hypnotherapist, from Galashiels, Selkirkshire, could be back in Scotland as soon as today, though her travel plans are unclear.  McGill\u0027s case was unexpectedly resolved on Wednesday, three days after details of her police interviews were published in which she said she felt terrible the boy was underage. She had denied lewd or lascivious battery - which is similar to statutory rape in the UK - and was due to stand trial next month. But the prospect of a long jail term left her scared, she said in a police interview, and prosecutors were apparently willing to cut her a deal.  McGill had been due to appear before Judge Marc Lubet at the Orange County courthouse in Orlando, Florida, for a pre-trial conference on Wednesday but instead she was sentenced later that day. Julio Semino, court support manager for the Ninth Judicial Circuit, said in an email: Ms. Mcgill received 5 years sex offender probation. She was adjudicated guilty as a sex offender. Her passport was ordered to be returned to her and she was directed to immediately leave the country. Her probation is to terminate upon her leaving the US. Under Florida law, when a person is adjudicated guilty by a judge they are convicted of the crime. A note in the court calendar says: Court designates the defendant a sex offender\u0027.  McGill had been arrested on April 6 after having sex with the 14-year-old in a Courtyard Marriott in Orlando. The victim had found her profile on Quora which listed her under the name ‘Sophie Belle’ and texted her to set up the liaison for which he paid her 480 . The incident came to light when the boy\u0027s father found out what he had done and went back to the hotel where he called the police. It later emerged that the boy had lost his virginity to McGill when they slept together. The arrest shone a light on McGill\u0027s bizarre double life as she claimed to be a hypnotherapist with an office in Edinburgh. In her police interview McGill admitted she had been travelling alone across the US - visiting San Francisco, New Jersey, San Diego and Tampa before Orlando - but claimed she was sightseeing. When it was put to her that she is a prostitute who is paid hundreds of dollars an hour to sleep with men, she said there is truth in that. McGill sobbed during the two hour interview and said that I swear I didn\u0027t know the boy was under 18.

The 33-year-old dad is accused of killing his wife Shanann and girls Bella, four, and Celeste, three, at their Colorado home earlier this month.  He went on TV pleading for their safe return before their bodies were found, and then claimed to police that he had caught his wife strangling the children. But detectives rejected his story and arrested him - and it is now claimed that he showed no emotion as he had his fingerprints taken, posed for a mugshot and was put in lockup.   People magazine has said it spoke to someone who is close to the investigation into the shocking triple murder and was present when Watts was processed following his August 15 arrest.  The unnamed source gave a chilling account, saying Watts “showed no emotion the entire time. The source added: “He looked like he couldn’t be bothered by the whole thing. After police learned that Mrs Watts, 34, and the girls were missing, her husband went on a local TV station on August 14 pleading for their safe return.  He was arrested on suspicion of murder the following day. Neighbours claim his behaviour was strange amid the search for the mum and daughters. Terry Witt told People: “He didn’t seem upset at all. After reviewing the TV interview, one expert claimed Watts was showing all the traits of a psychopath, including being overtly winsome and charming.   Kim Gorgens, a clinical professor of professional psychology at the University of Denver, told Fox 31: It\u0027s not a personality characteristic that you can pick out of a lineup.  It\u0027s not like someone wears a sign that says you can\u0027t trust. In fact, it\u0027s the opposite of that. Police have said Mrs Watts, who was 15 weeks pregnant with a boy, was murdered after she returned to the family\u0027s home in Frederick, Colorado, in the early hours of August 13 following a business trip to Arizona. Detectives believe the girls may have been killed before their mum came home.  Officers went to the home on August 13 after Mrs Watts, who worked in sales for the nutritional company Le-Vel, didn\u0027t answer a friend\u0027s text messages or calls, and failed to show up for a doctor\u0027s appointment. Police went to the house, but they didn\u0027t notice any obvious signs of foul play and left. But detectives dug deeper into the disappearance and Watts quickly became their prime suspect. CCTV from a neighbour\u0027s home showed him backing his truck into his garage at 5.27am on the day his wife vanished, and then driving away. Police also learned that he was having an affair with a colleague.

The 32-year-old woman - who appeared to have restraints around both of her wrists - is now safe and detectives believe she was the victim of domestic violence. Her 48-year-old boyfriend was found dead at home from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, along with a suicide note linking him to the woman seen in the video. Police had launched a desperate search for the woman after CCTV emerged showing her ringing a doorbell while partially dressed and barefoot. There are now suggestions that he was holding her against her will and she managed to escape through a window.  The video was recorded on a home surveillance camera at 3.20am on Friday in Sunrise Ranch, Montgomery, Texas. The woman can be seen walking up to the door emerging from behind a bush, ringing the bell, then walking away. She is wearing a white t-shirt and has unknown objects, which appear to be restraints, dangling around her wrists.  An anonymous neighbour told ABC News that she rang the doorbell of several different neighbours but disappeared by the time they answered their doors. The look on her face, but she was being very very quiet… she just looked distressed, one neighbour who saw the footage told the broadcaster. After police posted the video online, local residents got in touch with speculations that she may have been abducted - pointing to missing persons in the area.  But police have since confirmed that they have identified the woman and she is safe with her family. They said she wasn\u0027t missing, but they believe she was a domestic violence victim. Officers were able to confirm the woman\u0027s safety after they were called to a suspicious shooting at a home in Sunrise Ranch at 11am on Wednesday.  Police were performing a welfare check after a friend of the woman\u0027s boyfriend had received a text message from the man, who was threatening to kill himself, ABC News reported. But it was too late by the time officers arrived at the home. The man\u0027s body was found inside from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, it was reported. Police told local media they found a suicide note linking him to the woman, who they say was his girlfriend.

Klete Keller, 36, was stunned when he found two strange men on his sofa - stained with bodily fluids - at 1am with the sitter and his dog nowhere to be seen. She was having a shower and the dog, Jimbo, was locked in a bedroom, where he was terrified and sat in his own urine. But things got even more ridiculous when the sitter tried to explain, telling local media that her keys were stuck in her car and the men had helped her free them using the lube.  Mr Keller, a swimmer who has retired from competitive events, found the bizarre scene when he arrived at his home in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in the early hours of Monday. He asked the men to leave, and then noticed the things they had with them.  He told Fox 21: There was an open bottle of personal lubricant and a camcorder on the end table, so it\u0027s pretty self-explanatory what was going on.   There is also, what I can only assume, are bodily fluids on the couch. Mr Keller had used the Wag! app to find a sitter and decided on the woman because she had a rating of 4.96 out of five after more than 300 dog walks and sittings. She was having a shower in the bathroom and Jimbo was in a room with the door closed.  Mr Keller said the house was a mess and there was a foul smell inside.

The woman, who wasn\u0027t named in the report, said: To be completely honest, I didn\u0027t have WD-40 and my keys were stuck in my car, so I ended up grabbing what I had in my car, for things, that you know, I do on my personal time and I didn\u0027t think to put it back in my car.

Jackie Mary Hays was working as a support staff member at a school in Sydney, Australia, when she targeted the teenage student. Hays claimed she began taking the weight-loss drug Duromine four months before she started grooming the boy. She pleaded guilty to grooming the boy for sexual activity between April 2015 and June 2016. At Newcastle Local Court on Wednesday, Hays\u0027 Legal Aid defence lawyer Gillian Jewison asked for the case to be dealt with under the Mental Health Act.  Ms Jewison said the drug may have altered her sex drive and affected her state of the mind. The court also heard Hays suffered from a borderline personality disorder. Magistrate Robert Stone said there was no medical link between the drug and Hays\u0027 behaviour. The only evidence was from a psychological report completed by the defence in which some of Hays\u0027 friends observed she was off the planet after taking the drug.  Ms Jewison said Hays\u0027 crime was at the lower end of the scale but Mr Ogilvy disagreed and said she tried to get the boy to sneak out at night. Mr Ogilvy urged the magistrate to jail Hays given she was 47 when she started to send explicit messages to the teen. Mr Stone gave numerous reasons why the case could not be dealt with under mental health provisions. He said: The issue is whether proceedings will produce a better outcome for individual and the community.  I do not consider a dismissal is warranted because of the serious nature of offence. There is an issue of deterrence. In general terms, the community would expect better from people who work at school with children. Mr Stone also said he could not consider a non-custodial sentence. She knew it was inappropriate, she knew it was illegal to have sex with the boy, he said. I think it breaches the threshold, and she is not eligible for an intensive corrections order. Hays faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.

The Burmese-Indian python DNA snakes are swarming wetlands and forests after the Indian python and Burmese python started breeding in the last 40 years. Scientists have only now discovered the result of the crossbreeding, and found the new species is capable of both climbing trees and slithering through swamps. If some animals die out because of climatic issues, there are other animals that may not die out.  Our finding that the Florida python population is comprised of distinct lineages suggests greater standing iation for adaptation and the potential for broader areas of suitable habitat in the invaded range, the researchers of the new study said. The Burmese python is one of the largest species of snake in the world and can reach almost 20ft in length. The largest ones can eat pigs, goats and crocodiles in the wild.

Instead, residents would have special permits allowing them to drive through.Police have already said it would be unlikely the required number of officers would be available to enforce permits each day.Ron Neave, chairman of Fintry Community Council, met council officer John Berry this week to discuss the issue.Mr Neave believes that a one-way system would be effective in defusing the ongoing traffic issues.“A one-way system is still worth a trial – the road is effectively already a one-way street because it is lined with parked cars,” he said.“I was told that making a street one-way would encourage speeding – but if we put in a 20mph limit and police carried out unplanned, ad hoc enforcement it might be enough to deter people.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"csabas ability to stay clam bodes well for dundee united","story":"\t\t\t\t\tLet’s be honest, most football people are not known for their extensive reading.Other than a glance at the back pages to see what’s been written about them, those in the game don’t tend to stray too far into the world of books.And even if Csaba Laszlo does, as an ethnic Hungarian born and brought up in Romania, it’s unlikely a book of Rudyard Kipling’s poetry is the first thing he reaches for when he fancies a good read.But if he ever did glance over the first few lines of Kipling’s “If”, he might feel it could have been written with him in mind.It’s the one that starts – “If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you. If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting, too. . .”We’ll stop there because, to be honest, classic work that it is, it does drone on for a bit.And those opening lines do, pretty much, show the ability demonstrated by the Dundee United gaffer over the opening weeks of the season.As his new team struggled to get going during a difficult Betfred Cup group campaign, Csaba was as disappointed as anyone.But he remained calm, didn’t panic and showed an understanding of the criticism that came his way from a support he knows is as desperate as he is to see the Tangerines back where they feel they belong.Most important of all, he stayed firm in his belief the changes he’s been at the centre of over the last few months were both necessary and the right ones.And while that process still has a long way to go before it’s been successfully completed, after two big Championship wins over Queen of the South and Partick Thistle, now there are at least concrete signs United are heading in the right direction.The success in Dumfries just over a fortnight ago brought a first three vital league points and with them a needed boost to morale.After the toils in the Betfred Cup were followed by a hugely- disappointing home defeat at the hands of Dunfermline, that something was done to lift spirits was vitally important.Having done that, last Saturday saw United seize the opportunity to send a message to the rest of their division that they can live up to their pre-season billing as one of the promotion favourites.The 3-1 win over Partick Thistle, another side expected to challenge near the top, was as convincing as could be hoped for from a side that remains in the middle of the rebuilding process.From the moment defender Paul Watson headed the first of his two goals inside the first 10 minutes, they were in control.It did take them longer than they would have liked to seal the win via Watson’s second fine header in the 78th minute but by the end Craig Curran had added a third.Over the 90 minutes they bossed the proceedings and looked every inch serious promotion contenders.As well as having some exciting attacking talent like Fraser Aird, Yannick Loemba, Craig Curran and Pavol Safranko, the team as a whole turned in a strong display.Almost as importantly, and whether conscious or not of those words written over a century before, the manager kept his head. As was the case when he didn’t panic when things were not going so well a few weeks earlier, he was not going to get carried away by this performance.He knows there is a long way to go in this most difficult of leagues and as he poetically puts it himself, there will be more stones along this rocky road.But he will stay calm and focused and, for United fans, that has to be encouraging.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b86638d2685b-376x564.jpg ","title":"dundee council to build social let homes in place of eyesore blocks","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee City Council is to build about 35 new social let homes.Local authority architect Ray Low told a meeting of North East Local Community Planning Partnership that the new homes will be built at Murrayfield Drive and Murrayfield Terrace, close to the former Longhaugh Quarry.They will be constructed on the site of former blocks of flats, which are being demolished and were previously deemed “eyesores” by locals.Mr Low said a planning application for the “high-quality” houses and flats is likely to be submitted sometime next month.He added: “We’re looking at building 35 or 36 new houses in those two streets and we’re hoping we will be on site in the spring.“It’ll be high-quality materials for a high-quality development in Whitfield.”He promised a iety of homes to suit all sizes of household – and, as with several new developments in the city, there will be some supported accommodation run in association with Dundee Health and Social Care Partnership.The homes will be constructed to modern energy efficiency standards so they are cheap to heat and keep warm – ideal for social tenants.Mr Low added: “We will have a whole range of sizes, starting from one-bedroom flats and two, three and four-bedroom houses.“We’re also looking at supported accommodation, working with the health and social care partnership.“They will be the first in-house developed homes in Dundee for quite some time – until now we’ve always been in partnership with a housing association, such as Hillcrest.”A site investigation to assess the land is still ongoing and must be completed before the planning application can be submitted.North East Labour councillor Brian Gordon said it was “pretty exciting”that new social housing was to be built in Whitfield.He asked about the possibility of existing social tenants in the area being prioritised for the new homes as many have lived in their council properties for years.However, Mr Low said that it was unlikely as residents had not been displaced as a result of the new flats.Mr Gordon added: “These people feel they will never get out of there, and they’ve seen such nice regeneration going on around them.“They’re good houses that they live in but these people have done their time in them.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/PA-36611137-729x564.jpg ","title":"dundee united hand trials to ex leeds united and aalborg

I’ve had them before and I think they cleared in a couple of days but this one blew up double the size,” said the Liverpudlian.“I was living on the ice machine for weeks but it just wouldn’t come down. It was purely a time thing and I just had to wait. It’s still not fully healed, that’s how bad it was.“It was tough to have played all the pre-season friendlies and then get hurt in the last one. It was tough to take but it’s a long season so there will, hopefully, be plenty games for me.“Because of my injury I missed all the Betfred Cup games. That was a few competitive games, which was frustrating because I did all the work and was ready to go in them, then got the dead leg.“It was hard watching but it’s nice to be back and that was, near enough, my first full 90 minutes against Thistle so that was good.”He suffered the injury in an accidental collision in a friendly against Cowdenbeath just days before the cup action kicked off.A few other players also suffered problems around that time and it did not help the gelling process for Csaba Laszlo’s new-look squad.Curran believes that contributed to the teething problems in the opening weeks of the season but believes wins in the last two league outings have shown United are on the right path.Saturday’s 3-1 Tannadice success over the Jags was an impressive win and he reckons the team will only continue to improve in the coming weeks and months. He added: “I think it was another marker down in the league, against the side that came down with Ross County, to show where we’re at.“We obviously didn’t get off to a great start against Dunfermline in the league but you’ve seen how well we’ve bounced with two big wins in those last two games.“That’s massively important, especially at home. With the crowd and support we get it is important that we put performances on for them and get wins like this one.“I thought we controlled the game against Thistle but, look, we’re still improving and everyone has to understand that.“There are so many new players. If you look at the starting line-up on Saturday, most of them were new, apart from a couple of the boys. The fans probably still don’t know all our names there’s been so many of us coming in!“It’s important that we keep winning while we’re improving. We’ll take any win in the league, 1-0 or 4-0, but it was nice to play well against Thistle and it was good to get some goals. Everyone is gelling well and it is a good dressing-room here.”Saturday saw another recent injury victim, full-back Callum Booth, make a brief appearance near the end.With him and others returning, Curran feels the improvement will only accelerate.“It’s been some important players who have been missing. Boothy’s back now and we are still waiting on Fraser Fyvie – he is going to be a very big player for us.“Like I say, I’ve missed a large portion of the work myself and, although I’m playing again, I am still catching up with fitness and things.“The boys are heading in the right direction and we are looking for a full squad to go and get promoted.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/08/5b866304be5a0.jpg ","title":"oap seen lying on the floor taken to ninewells after collision with bus","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA 69-year-old man was taken to hospital after a teatime incident on Tuesday.The man was injured in what appeared to be an incident with a Stagecoach bus in Perth at around 5.30pm.He was seen lying in North Methven Street, near the Drumhar Health Centre, close to a bus which had part of its windscreen cracked.A motorist who came upon the incident said: “As I was driving up North Methven Street, I saw a Stagecoach bus in front of me which was stationary with its hazard warning lights on.“Suddenly, a man came running down the road waving his arms and instructing traffic to stop.“Then an ambulance came screaming past me and came to a halt in front of another Stagecoach bus which was parked in front of the one which was in front of me.“Next thing, the man who was waving his arms, waved myself and the traffic in front of me past the bus and the stricken man.

The Scottish Government later won an appeal against the decision.The current plan reduces the number of wind turbines by a third.A report on the project said: “Inch Cape will make an important contribution to Scotland’s renewable energy and climate change targets.“The expected annual CO2 emissions savings from Inch Cape could account for the equivalent of between eight and 21% of the total carbon emissions estimated for Scotland.”If approved, the new wind farm would create more than 1,000 full-time jobs during construction and up to 143 jobs after completion.It would also create up to

It changes the dynamic in the market hall. It\u0027 a great unit with fantastic windows and great visibility.The idea is to charge \u0026pound20 per hour for use of the premises.If the initiative is approved by the council\u0027 city committee, Mrs Murray promised the unit would be redecorated before it is let.Meanwhile, the market could be renamed Old Town Arcade Inverness in a major rebranding exercise.The proposal has emerged after talks between interested parties and council, which has employed consultant Tristram Woolston Design of Cannich to look at the marketing of the landmark, which has often been a focal point for city visitors from home and abroad.Mrs Murray said further talks will be held before it goes to Highland councillors for consideration.\u0026ldquoThe consultant has identified problems with the existing name, in that the building and its environment doesn\u0026rsquot strongly present Victorian qualities and it\u0027 not a \u0026lsquomarket\u0026rsquo as such, but has permanent enclosed retail units rather than changeable stalls, she said.\u0026ldquoThe vision for this historic building after refurbishment is to provide a high-quality destination with a mix of unique Highland brands and products, a place to eat and drink, and a venue for events and entertainment.\u0026ldquoOther similar destinations in the UK and abroad call themselves arcades and hence the proposed new name is Old Town Arcade Inverness.Those involved will discuss the new image for the facility in September.Inverness economist Tony Mackay said it might be better to focus on other matters.\u0026ldquoTo be honest I\u0026rsquom not sure what sort of impact changing the name will have, he said.\u0026ldquoThere needs to be improvements at the market, there are a few empty premises in the centre. It\u0027 gone downhill due to lack of investments and the decline in people shopping in the city centre.\u0026ldquoWe need to move away from the traditional shopping idea, more social activities and more attractions are what is needed.

Whether that was for the first team, boosting sport science or towards the youth development academy.“You see what we have been able to achieve with bringing the likes of James Wilson to Aberdeen in the last couple of weeks.“It is money from DNA that has gone towards that player and bringing him to Aberdeen.“James has only had a couple of minutes on the pitch against Hibs at the weekend but I think we will start to see the fruits of his labour and the efforts of DNA in the fixtures ahead.”Aberdeen chairman Stewart Milne revealed in July that AberDNA had already raised £600,000 for the first team which will be used over the course of the next 12 months.Asked if there was still DNA money to secure further signings Wicks said: “Very much so.“But it is important for people to realise that the DNA scheme is subscription based so all that money is not sitting with the club in a bank account earning interest every day.“It is subscription-based income that comes in on a monthly basis so we have to be conscious of that as things develop. We are delighted with how the scheme has rolled out and how it has been received.”Aberdeen have secured seven signings in the summer with McInnes set to add to that tally before the window shuts tomorrow.During the summer window the Reds also rejected a £3.5m bid from Celtic for Scotland international defender Scott McKenna. Did the funds generated by AberDNA put the Reds in a stronger financial position where they could knock back Celtic’s overtures?Wicks said: “To some extent.“We know Scott’s worth, we have a value in our mind.“He has demonstrated in the way he has played not only for Aberdeen but also captaining Scotland that he has an enormously bright future.“I would say it is less about DNA but more about Scott’s ability and value.“Right now he is not a player who is for sale.“The DNA funding is more there to enable us to attract players who can strengthen the squad rather than be a pot at the end of the rainbow that we can keep in reserve and knock back the likes of Celtic and anyone else who comes knocking at our door for the time being.“But we think Scott has an enormously bright future and would like to think he would be at the club for some time.”AberDNA was launched this summer with four packages that come with ious benefits – Premium , Standard , International  and Under-12 .Hearts run a similar scheme. Foundation of Hearts has more than 8,000 members and has raised more than £6.5m.Hibs Supporters’ Limited has contributed £525,000 to the football budget.Wicks said: “The manager has said how much he values the support of the fans and what they have done to secure those funds for him to use.“We look to build on that.“This is not a membership programme that is going to come and go.“It is going to grow and build.“We have only scratched the surface of number of members, particularly from an international perspective.

It comes with a vegan sausage and vegetarian friendly toppings.And coming soon there will be a “Build Your Own Hot Dog”, so customers can make their perfect meal.Find out more and choose your dog at the Real Hot Dogs website.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/08/5b8632cb4aa77-765x564.jpg ","title":"cow deep is your love north east farmer uses animal to propose to girlfriend1","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA bride-to-be is over the moo-n after her boyfriend popped the big question with the help of his bovine buddy.Farmer Chris Gospel, 30, from Strichen, and his cow, Curlytop, worked together to ask his girlfriend of three years to marry him.Eilidh Fraser, a 30-year-old lab scientist, said she was surprised when the cow turned around to display the big question: Will You Marry Me?She said: “I came home from work one day and we went round to check on the cows like we usually do.“Chris just said, ‘do you want to go check the cows?’ and I was not expecting anything.“We have this one cow, her name is Curlytop, and is an affectionate cow – she’s like a big pet.“She comes running to us and I see she has something blue on her.“Curlytop turns and it says ‘will you marry me’.

This is our annual survey.“But the most recent information showed we had vacancies running at about 1 to 1.5% in Scottish education.“So clearly where we have vacancies it is unacceptable but it is at a very, very low level compared to many of our international peers.“Obviously there’s a whole range of different measures being taken to expand the pool of teachers available.“We’ve expanded recruitment into initial teacher education, we’ve created nearly a dozen new routes to make it more practical and flexible for individuals to gain access and indeed one of those routes is very focused on the north-east of Scotland through the partnerships that exist in that respect.“I’m very focused on trying to identify how we can secure the additional teachers into the teaching profession and to work closely with local authorities in the north-east of Scotland to make sure that vacancies are filled.” 100vw, 620px\" /Councillor Leslie Dunbar, vice-convener of Aberdeen City Council’s education

tried to mitigate against teacher shortages by investing in 60 new pupil support assistants.”The Inverurie Community Campus is one of the biggest school construction projects in the country.Once

They admit to feeling this way once a month or more after scrolling through other properties on Instagram, with 25-34-year-olds feeling dissatisfied most frequently.The findings describe people having an unrealistic idea of what their home should look like, spending time worrying about flaws which would be unnoticeable to others, whilst feeling pressure to maintain a certain appearance in their home and being self-conscious of it in front of visitors. This mindset has been described by Chartered Psychologist, Dr David Lewis, as ‘Home Dysmorphic Disorder’ .energypr representative, Beth ReynoldsSir,Researchers at the University of St Andrews have shown for the first time that some of the standard measures of memory in rodents and humans are likely based on the same cognitive process which could have implications for development of treatments for memory disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.One of the most widely used memory tests for rodents is the novel object recognition test, in which animals explore two objects one of which is new and the other they have seen before.The results of new research showed that their participants object recognition scores were far more associated with their memory abilities than their preferences for newness.One of the research team, Dr James Ainge, of the School of Psychology and Neuroscience at St Andrews said: \u0026#8216This is important as it provides some of the first evidence that the standard memory tests in humans and rats are testing the same cognitive process.

The wealth of experience and knowledge of the staff cannot be replaced.I would certainly support a trust taking over the service, but firstly I would ask VisitScotland and Scottish Government to reconsider their closure plans.Councillor Robin Currie, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,I am extremely disappointed over the proposed closure of the VisitScotland iCentre in Tarbert.Michael Russel MSP, Tarbert and Skipness Community Trust and myself have had frequent discussions regarding the issue and I am hopeful that the interested parties will be able to offer a proposal that ensures continuity in the service, although perhaps in a different form.Councillor Anne Horn, Kintyre and the Islands wardSir,Deputy First Minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools. If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities. Local authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system. Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is, of course, partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We now have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew\u0026#8217s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will now play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch, Longniddry, East LothianSir,Through your newspaper I would like to thank the staff Alex, Mark and Alex  from the George Hotel in Inveraray.Two guests staying at my holiday cottage in Cairnbaan lost their car keys while on a day trip to Inveraray.

To achieve this, he worked for two years with the Beaver Colony, members aged 6 to 8, and took on a senior leadership role.In February 2018, eight young people from the group took part in a selection process to secure a place at either the World Scout Jamboree in North America in July 2019 or to join a major expedition to Malaysia in July 2019.  More than 250 young people attended the selection process with 70 places available. All members of the 19th Argyll were successful and, as far as we are aware, it was the only unit to achieve this feat.Two of the team, Martha Payne and Polly Payne, have secured places at the World Scout Jamboree, a three-week adventure at the Summit Bechtel Family National Scout Reserve in West Virginia, USA. The event is being hosted by the Boy Scouts of America, Scouts Canada and the Scout Association of Mexico.  Seventeen thousand Scouts from across the globe will attend. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity to build relationships, explore other cultures and go on life-changing adventures.Six of the team \u0026#8211 Andrew Smart, James Urquhart, Lorne Barrie, Liberty Hampton, Cameron Garrett and Anna Turner \u0026#8211 have secured places in the West Region 2019 expedition to Malaysia. The objective of this expedition is to make real change to communities. The team will be installing clean water, building a play park and working in a rainforest eco-village. At the end of the expedition, the team will get the chance to enjoy the heritage and culture of this amazing country.The young people are involved in the planning and organisation of both expeditions. In addition, these young people from the 19th Argyll have committed to raising £10,000 \u0026#8211 30 per cent of the gross cost of their adventures \u0026#8211 during 2018/19.  To date £2,000 has been raised or committed with members of the team also securing part time employment to boost funds.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"strut your funky stuff","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/08/18, 1:30 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowFord Line Dancers will soon be back strutting their stuff every Thursday.They will be back from August 30 in the newly-refurbished Ford Village Hall and welcome anyone, male or female, who is interested in joining.Line dancer Sue Grocock said: \u0026#8216It\u0026#8217s a great way to exercise, and the beauty of this type of dance is that no partner is required neither is any dancing experience necessary as we will be going back to basics.

But Alfie Briggs does plan to downsize the long-established business. Mr Briggs, 74, wants to change part of the arcade, to create a town house. And he has been granted planning consent by South Ayrshire Council. Mr Briggs says he will transform the smaller part of the arcade - next to the Harbour Bar pub - back into a house. But the larger, deeper part of the business will remain an amusement arcade. However, Mr Briggs also has consent to create a house there, should it ever be required. He said: “I was advised to do it  this way. But I’m definitely not closing the arcade.” He added: “I won’t be around forever, and maybe my children will decide it should go back to a house. “But I know I won’t do it.” Mr Briggs, who lives in Ayr, has owned Mayfair Amusements since 1984. The business was created in 1962 by the late Edwin Lawrence, a former travelling showman. He had bought the two-storey house next to the Harbour Bar pub, and converted the downstairs front into a small amusement arcade. This had originally been John Carson’s fish shop. The arcade was greatly expanded around 1970, after the acquistion of a house at No 29 Knockcushan Street. The arcade, which included a prize bingo and a shop, was run successfully by Mr Lawrence and his family, until bought by Mr Briggs. The new owner kept the name ‘Mayfair Amusements’ which was a tribute to Mr Lawrence’s wife May, as well as an affluent part of London. Alfie Briggs recalls: “There was more business for everyone back in the days when there was about five amusement arcades in Girvan. “Takings have certainly gone down, but we’re still getting by. “This conversion will allow me to rent out a house and a flat, instead of just a flat.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilGirvanAyr NewsAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"ayr united fans under starters","story":"NewsAyr United fans under starter\u0027s orders for Somerset Park charity racenight in aid of Ian McCall\u0027s player fundInternet supporters\u0027 team KaisAyr is staging the bash this Saturday night in United\u0027s Hospitality Suite.Share\u0026nbspByStuart Wilson10:56, 23 AUG 2018NewsAyr\u0027s Craig McGuffie and Alan Forrest go for a ride with mascot Pandamonium \"Get daily updates directly to your inboxSubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailThey’re under starter’s orders for a top night of action at Somerset Park this Saturday.

The ailing Kyle Centre is to lodge plans for a round the clock fitness facility. Retail chiefs want to rival Heathfield’s bid for a similar project on the outskirts of town. Both are now set to go before South Ayrshire Council in a battle for planning permission. Kyle Centre boss, Fiona Paton, said: “Lifestyles and work patterns are changing and we believe there is demand for this. “There is no escaping that we, as a centre, need to evolve and we’ve had to adapt our business model since I came here 10 years ago. “Opening a gym is part of that direction of travel and can help sustain the centre moving forward.” Energie Fitness has agreed a deal to open an 8000sq foot unit within the barren centre. And bosses claim their stalling dream to open a cinema is far from dead.  Negotiations, understood to be with screen giant Odeon, have so far failed to bear fruit. But Fiona, 48, said: “This sits separately from our plan to open the cinema, which very much remains the long term aim. “Unfortunately it has taken longer than we’d have liked but we are getting there with it. “I can understand why some people have given up on the Kyle Centre – but I wouldn’t be here unless we had a bright future. “We have private investment and our vision is very clear, it is just a matter of staying patient. “People say that our success is vital to the town and that is true. “There is a lot going on in Ayr at the moment and a prosperous Kyle Centre is key to that.” We revealed earlier this summer that retail rivals Heathfield had signed a deal with the Gym Group to open a 24 hour gym. Both plans are now subject to council approval.

and the Caribbean island of Barbados.\nFirst screened on Tuesday , Scots in Paradise features the Barbados Celtic Festival \u0026ndash a large cultural get-together held in and around the capital Bridgetown.\nAnd taking centre stage for much of the programme is Riddell Fiddles founder Sheila Sapkota.\nThe Caribbean festival takes place during the last weekend of May and features multiple collaborations between Scottish and Barbadian or \u0026ldquoBajan culture.\nMusicians, dancers, drummers and pipers all come together for a fun-filled weekend, accompanied by top chefs, serving up much loved Scottish meals with a distinct Bajan twist.\nThe now popular festival had humble beginnings in the 1990s when a Welsh men\u0026rsquos choir travelled to the island to perform in a local concert hall.\nSince then, the celebration has expanded and has featured Celtic acts from Canada, across the UK, Ireland, the USA and even Australia.\nFestival director Carol Anderson from Edinburgh said: \u0026ldquoWe have developed a unique fusion of music from both sides of the Atlantic in this growing festival through our folk and traditional music.\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a great fusion

National Piping Centre, led by Fifer Ian Lowther.\nSheila Sapkota from Selkirk\u0026rsquos Riddell Fiddle made headlines in Barbados this year when she performed with Jenni Borthwick, Robbie Sapkota and locals from the surrounding area of Hastings.\nSheila, who is from Selkirk, also performed with Barbados pupils from the Suzuki Violin School and children from St Patrick\u0027s RC Primary, playing Scottish songs taught to them by the St Patrick\u0026rsquos head teacher, Glasgow born Sister Pauline Dempsey.\nAnd several of Sheila\u0027s performances were caught on camera for the STV programme Scots in Paradise.\nThis year\u0027s Barbados Celtic Festival closed with a ceilidh, presented by local dancers from the island\u0026rsquos Scottish Dance Society, led by Scottish ex pat Ken Thomson.\nThe Celtic festival celebrates the shared history between Scots and the people of Barbados.\nAround the 1700s, Scottish and Irish immigrants were shipped all over the Caribbean to be indentured servants for the sugar industry.\nSince then, descendants of Scots can be found living across Barbados \u0026ndash sharing Scottish surnames like McCluskie, and even last names such as Glasgow.\nA small community still lives in what is known as \u0026lsquoScotland District\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash an area of the island that became home to settlers when they eventually gained their freedom.\nAny musicians interested in taking part in next year\u0026rsquos Massed Band events in May 2019 can sign up at www.barbadoscelticfestival.\nScots in Paradise will be available to watch on

report showed just five were issued in the space of a year.\nFigures revealed via a freedom of information request showed that in 2017 the local authority received 100 complaints about out of control dogs \u0026ndash but gave just six advisory notices and five dog control orders to irresponsible owners.\nHowever, following a meeting with Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale MSP Christine Grahame, the council has revealed it has handed out 15 dog control notices over the last 12 months, with two still pending.\nMs Grahame, who introduced the Control of Dogs  Act 2010 as a member\u0026rsquos bill, said: \u0026ldquoI had a very useful discussion with the representatives from Scottish Borders Council and it was important to hear first-hand how this legislation is being used in practice.\n\u0026ldquoIn the last year there have been 15 dog control notices with two pending, although there are some issues with obtaining owner details. Some owners just need to be spoken to and advised of their responsibilities.\nDog control orders allow Scottish Borders Council to impose certain conditions on dog owners. For example, a dog which frequently runs away may be required to be kept on a lead at all times, or an aggressive dog may have to be muzzled when in public spaces.\nThe control orders can also be used to compel dog owners to seek training for themselves and their pet. Failure to adhere to a dog control order could lead to a ban from keeping animals or the dog being put down.\nA Scottish Borders Council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe council is currently reviewing its responsible dog ownership strategy, which will aim to remind owners of their social and legal responsibilities.\n\u0026ldquoAs part of this strategy, the council works in partnership with local and national charities to promote responsible ownership and dog control by educating the public at ious events across the Borders.\n\u0026ldquoThe council responds to all complaints received concerning out of control dogs, but in order to assist us in investigating each complaint fully, we ideally require the dog owner\u0026rsquos details.\n\u0026ldquoMembers of the public can contact 0300 100 1800 or visit www.scotborders.gov.uk if they have a concern about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour.\nMs Grahame added: \u0026ldquoMy main concern is that members of the public may not be aware that if a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour is causing concern, for example being allowed to be out of control, they can report it to the council through this route.\n\u0026ldquoThe police, of course, deal with the most serious incidents. However I brought in my bill establishing dog control notices as a way of intervening before a dog bites or attacks and becomes dangerous.\n\u0026ldquoOnce a dog control notice is issued, the council will regularly check up to ensure it\u0026rsquos being followed.\n\u0026ldquoI would encourage anyone concerned about a dog\u0026rsquos behaviour whether in public, in its garden or indeed any other private place to get in touch with the council.

It was nailed to the stretcher rather than the modern method of stapling. At some stage a further bar of yellowed wood had to added to keep the canvas taut.Further internet research revealed a painter known as H Shapiro, who was born in 1933. Helen was born in 1946.Unfortunately for those hoping for a massive price tag, the H stands iously for Hermon or Herman.A painting with a similar style, titled Loch Long, appeared recently on eBay and was described as: ‘Oil on canvas, possibly an early work by the artist Herman  Shapiro.‘It is hand signed, lower right, with “H. Shapiro” and dated ‘52 .’A large collection of Mr Shapiro’s other work, mainly of life studies of a distinctly different style is for sale with a gallery, named Hatfield Hines in Norwich.One of the partners at the gallery said they had bought the paintings. Despite having much biographical detail the partner claimed they had no way of contacting Mr Shapiro.That gallery states that Mr Shapiro was born in London and is settled in Scotland, which fits Clachan’s picture.He studied at Camberwell School of Arts and Crafts from 1949-54 where he was apparently influenced by Bloch, Minton and Vaughan and was associated with the acclaimed Camberwell Group.By the mid 1950s he had started teaching in South Wales schools and went on to lecture at Cardiff College of Art.His paintings and sculpture are mostly based on the female figure, more recently in a domestic environment.

Despite two days and a night of rain last week the water level remains well down.The dam is crossed to reach the track to Whitehill farm, which is derelict, and on to the Ballywilline lane and the route\u0026#8217s end at the A83 pavement.In an emergency the simplest descent from the summit would be south-east, leading to a dip and due west to the Knocknan loch track and the Balegreggan waterworks.No doubt hill runners will race up Knock Scalbert but stout boots, a waterproof, picnic and a drink would make for an enjoyable walk, plus a map and compass, and the ability to use them.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter grieving for a cat","story":"In the run up to Grief Awareness Day on August 30, Cats Protection would like to let readers know that it offers a grief support service called Paws to Listen.For many, losing a cat can be a very traumatic experience and there can be a lack of understanding from family and friends about how deeply the loss can impact on a person.A survey carried out for Cats Protection earlier this month highlighted that 73 per cent of pet owners feel it can be as difficult and upsetting grieving for a pet as it is grieving for the loss of a person.Cats Protection understands just how much a cat means and what owners may be going through if their pet is missing, has had to be re-homed, nearing the end of its life or has recently passed away.Cats Protection has a large range of resources, information and support to help at this difficult time, including ways to celebrate the cat\u0026#8217s life.Anyone experiencing the loss of a cat can talk to Cats Protection on 0800 024 9494 between 9am-5pm Monday to Friday excluding bank holidays.It is a free and confidential service and our volunteer listeners can provide emotional support and practical information.To talk to someone please give the Paws to Listen service a call.We all need to be mindful of the emotional impact that losing a pet can have on a person.Stuart Sheppard,Cats Protection.\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"letter school governance reform","story":"Deputy first minister John Swinney is now requiring local authorities to devolve powers and budgets to local schools.If councils do not respond within the next year, he has vowed to legislate for improved  school governance across the country.The fear of making mistakes has led to an unwillingness to experiment and a total absence of diversity to suit individual communities.Council authorities have prevented head teachers and staff from running their schools and classes in their pupils’ true interests.Councils have failed to recognise the very significant contribution which broadly constituted and empowered school councils could make to the overall education system.Schools have had little incentive to cut back wasteful expenditure.The shortage of resources being allocated to education is of course partly to blame for the mess we are in, but it is by no means the whole story.We have an ideal opportunity to introduce governance reforms so as to ensure that policies are shaped to local circumstances otherwise we could all well end up with more direction from St Andrew’s House.Is it too much to hope that councillors and education officials in every education authority will play their part in restoring Scotland’s state schools to their once iconic world status?Angus Tulloch,Longniddry.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"nurserys outdoor play recognised","story":"Play More was set up to help deserving nurseries improve their outdoor play areas with financial support or murals.It is an initiative which was set up by nappy cream manufacturers Sudocrem to encourage parents and children to get back in touch with nature and explore the greatest playground on earth- the outdoors.As part of the campaign a survey asked 200 children, between the ages of four to eight-years-old, to identify some of the creepy crawlies in Britain.The survey revealed that nine out of 10 children were unable to recognise a butterfly even though there is an abundance of native British insects, with around 27,000 insect species calling the UK home.Moreover, 51 per cent did not know what a Bumblebee looks like.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

The move comes just 16 months after a public consultation on similar plans in which three quarters of those who took part objected to the change, leading the council to scrap the proposal.  The council said the move was part of a review of its service provision however, it has been criticised for not taking the plan back to the community before making the decision.  Brian Weddell, chairman of Prestonpans Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoIt is extremely disappointing that East Lothian Council are pressing ahead with service changes in Prestonpans that were rejected last year.  \u0026ldquoPrestonpans Community Council and other local community organisations should have been consulted on these changes rather than being presented with a fait accompli and we would ask that the council assure the local community that they will consult fully on the future proposals for Aldhammer House.  The proposal to turn the library, which was built in 1905 through funds from Scottish philanthropist Andrew Carnegie, into a shared facility and move council services from their offices in the town\u0026rsquos Aldhammer House, was first put to the public in June 2016.  At the time the community council raised concerns that merging the services would take away people\u0026rsquos views of the library as a safe and neutral area.  And at a public meeting in the town Manja Porteus, then six, whose dad Tim is a professional storyteller and Courier columnist, appealed to the council to rethink its proposals and leave the library alone.  Following a public consultation, the council announced it had scrapped the plans in March last year, stating that \u0026ldquothe majority of respondents said they wanted the two services to remain in separate buildings and did not want to see any changes to the library building.  However, last week they said that a wide range of services would move into the library from August 27.  Councillor Jim Goodfellow, cabinet spokesperson for community wellbeing, said: \u0026ldquoAs more of our customers make use of online services and library staff are readily available to help people to go online, the council has reviewed its service provision and Aldhammer House will be developed to provide complementary services which give more support to the local community.  \u0026ldquoMeanwhile, Prestonpans Library will be developed as a joint library/area office as has been done in Dunbar, North Berwick and Tranent.  \u0026ldquoThis builds on the council\u0026rsquos work to strengthen our communities and support town centres such as Prestonpans with easy access to high-quality local facilities and services.  Aldhammer House will continue to be staffed by housing service staff, as well as keeping The Pantry Foodbank, Citizens Advice Bureau and local politicians\u0026rsquo surgeries. Capital Credit Union will also continue to operate part-time there. All other services will move to the library.  The changes were welcomed by some on social media, who said it had worked in other communities.  One person said: \u0026ldquoDoes it really matter where you pay your rent or fill in forms? If the council can\u0026rsquot afford it then they can\u0026rsquot afford it.  However, there was an angry response from others.  One woman said: \u0026ldquoThis is an outrage, what can we do? Are they determined to strip Prestonpans of everything?  A council spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe changes being made differ from those proposed in 2016. Housing enquiries will continue to be dealt with at Aldhammer House, while payments for other services can be made at the library. This will in turn improve the range of services available at our improved library \u0026ndash and we are grateful for the positive feedback we have received on this from customers so far.

According to the Prestonpans proposal, the two schools would \u0026lsquoclose\u0026rsquo in February \u0026ldquoor as soon as possible thereafter, with a new non-denominational primary school then created. The town\u0026rsquos St Gabriel\u0026rsquos Primary School would be unaffected.  The merged school would continue to operate over the two sites within the existing buildings and facilities, but with a single management team.  Currently, Prestonpans Infant and Nursery School, on West Loan, has a school roll of 358 up to P3, with the primary school, on Preston Road, home to 332 pupils from P4 to P7.  The leadership of Prestonpans Early Learning and Childcare Centre, which opened last year on Kirk Street to provide additional nursery places for the town, would also transfer to the headteacher of the new single school structure if the move goes ahead.

Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet member for education and children\u0026rsquos services, said: \u0026ldquoOur first priority is to ensure that we provide the best educational experiences and outcomes for the children and young people of Prestonpans. The consultation process will focus on how we do this through an educational benefit statement.  \u0026ldquoWe have already informed the chairs of the parent councils of this proposal.  \u0026ldquoAll parents, carers and the wider school community will have the opportunity to comment on the proposal once the consultation has been published and the statutory consultation period begins on Monday.

Among the East Lothian pubs to have permanently closed during this period are the Elphinstone Arms in Elphinstone The Hub in Tranent the Bay Horse in Haddington and The Hayweights, Burgh and Mrs Forman\u0026rsquos in Musselburgh.  The figures from the Office for National Statistics  show that in 2010 there were about 55 pubs and bars in East Lothian but by 2017 that had fallen to about 45.  Michael Peters, who is behind The New Pheasant in Haddington \u0026ndash which opened this week at the site of the former Pheasant, which shut in 2009 \u0026ndash was not surprised by the figures.  He said that there were a iety of reasons for the decline in the number of pubs, including the lowering of the drink-drive limit in Scotland in 2014, issues with breweries, and the state of the economy.  Mr Peters felt that there was a real need for pubs in towns and villages and said: \u0026ldquoI am not biased but every town needs a pub.  \u0026ldquoIt is not just for drinking but socialising and the community \u0026ndash nothing would be happening. Most things that happen \u0026ndash golf trips, football, anything like that \u0026ndash it is organised when you are in the pub.  \u0026ldquoWhere do most people socialise?  Across the UK, 5,745 pubs closed over the same period, and there are 54 local authorities across the country where 30 or more shut.  Pubs have been pointing the finger of blame at the taxman for their troubles, complaining about the duty on beer, VAT levels and the cost of business rates.  Britain\u0026rsquos Beer Alliance, a group of organisations in the pub and brewing sector, has started a campaign called Long Live the Local with a petition and calls for people to write to their MP to have beer duty reduced.  The latest data from the ONS shows that between 2016 and 2017, 655 pubs and bars across the UK called time for the last time.  In East Lothian there was a slight upturn in that period, with numbers up by about five.  A change in consumer habits, with people drinking at home more often, has been blamed for fewer people visiting pubs.  There are 21 areas of the country that have bucked the decline and have more pubs now than they had in 2010. Top of the list is Hackney in East London, which had 55 more bars in 2017 than it did in 2010."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-mermaids-magic-storm","story":"  AFTER our return from a final camping trip in the midges and mist, my youngest daughter started school. She needed an early-morning shower to remove the lingering smell of wood smoke in her hair this morning before getting ready.  She protested a bit, as she said she liked the smell of wood smoke because it reminded her of camping in the Highlands. But soon she was all excited to be dressed up, smart and clean for school. She is attending Prestonpans Infant School, as her big sister did before her, and as I did when it was the primary school.  She looked so smart and business-like as she walked into class with a beaming smile. We shared this moment with many other parents, who were taking the same photos and shedding similar tears. Only the day before, Skye had climbed the side of a mountain in Glencoe as if she had once been a mountain goat and proclaimed she wanted to live by a waterfall.  Now, all dressed to conform , she has entered a formal system which in my day did its best to  beat out any original creativity that didn\u0026rsquot fit in with teachers\u0026rsquo expectations.  But as our daughter walked through the same doors I had once gone through, I was uplifted by a hopeful expectation that when we come to pick her up she will be less smart, less clean and her hair even wilder. That\u0026rsquos what school should be like for a wee girl not yet reached five. And I know she is in good hands in that respect at Prestonpans Infants.  But as I kissed her goodbye this morning, she asked: \u0026ldquoCan we have tea by a campfire in the woods? The campfire had been the communal focus during our camping trip. As darkness fell, the spirit of the fire glowed brighter and danced with our imaginations as we told stories and riddles with each other. I of course agreed, but her comment helped me think of which tale to tell this week.  Much of our summer has been spent exploring the wonders of East Lothian. We explored beaches and caves. We climbed hills and moors. We swam and paddled in rivers, climbed trees and sat under them having picnics.  But wherever we went there was one thing that we always saw, even in quite remote places: litter. Sometimes there was more, sometimes there was less, but we couldn\u0026rsquot escape it. My children notice it I suppose because I mention it. Our children pick up other people\u0026rsquos litter as we walk, so we now need an extra rucksack to carry it.  \u0026ldquoWhy do people do this? asked my nine-year-old after she had watched a family sitting in a car in a car park by a beach. They had been eating sandwiches and drinking juice, and then threw all the packaging out of the windows. The plastic juice bottles rolled about in the breeze and the sandwich packaging blew away and got caught in some sea buckthorn bushes nearby. The family then drove away, no doubt having had a nice day at the beach, but leaving their rubbish for others to enjoy.  I make no apologies for sounding angry at this. And I do not blame the children, it\u0026rsquos the adults who frame this behaviour. I understand people want to keep their cars tidy but I couldn\u0026rsquot answer my daughter\u0026rsquos question as we sat watching someone else\u0026rsquos rubbish desecrate a beauty spot. I just can\u0026rsquot understand the mindset. So all I said was: \u0026ldquoWell they just don\u0026rsquot know any better I suppose, or maybe just don\u0026rsquot care.  \u0026ldquoThat\u0026rsquos so sad, she replied, then went very quiet. Then she came up with an answer to the problem: a story:  \u0026lsquoThe king of the sea told all the mermaids not to go close to the shore because of the dangerous litter that humans pollute it with. One mermaid asked what litter was and the king replied it was many things, such as broken glass and plastic which kills sea creatures, as well as making the place humans live look ugly.  \u0026ldquoWhy do they do this? asked the mermaid. The king shrugged his shoulders, and said: \u0026ldquoThey must be less clever than the animals they kill.  But one day the mermaid disobeyed her king and swam to the shore close to the beach at North Berwick. But her tail was cut by broken glass and then she got caught in plastic bags floating on the surface. She was in trouble and a fisherman saw her.  He helped her remove the bags and gave her cream for her cut tail.  \u0026ldquoWhy do you people do this? she asked him. He felt ashamed because he also would throw litter. He promised her he would never do it again. But there was so much rubbish in the sea that they agreed they would try and collect it.  So the mermaid gathered her friends and collected the rubbish. The fisherman\u0026rsquos boat was soon so full that it nearly sank, and when he returned to the harbour people saw the mountain of rubbish he had caught. They laughed at him, thinking he was not a good fisherman because all he had caught was litter and rubbish.  \u0026ldquoLook, said the fisherman, \u0026ldquothis is what we are doing to the sea and the land. Why do we do this? But nobody cared.  \u0026ldquoThis is impossible, we can\u0026rsquot collect all of it, said the mermaid, \u0026ldquoand every day the wind blows more into the sea.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos hopeless, people will never change, said the fisherman. But the mermaid was angry: \u0026ldquoThey must change or else we will all die, including them too eventually.  Mermaids have powers to control the wind. They can whip up storms and so she decided she would make a very unusual, magic storm.  The wind blew not everywhere but where the litter lay. It blew all the rubbish thrown by the humans back into their houses and cars. People woke up with broken glass in their beds and plastic bags covering their children. Their homes were piled high with dangerous and ugly rubbish. When they tried to get rid of it, it just blew back in.  The countryside and sea became wonderfully litter free because of this magic storm, and when people littered the storm whipped up again and blew it straight into their house or car. They couldn\u0026rsquot escape from it. People were living knee-deep in the rubbish they had thrown out of windows or not recycled.  So soon they stopped littering because now they understood what it meant for the other creatures. Finally they cared, because they were the ones who suffered most. At last they got the wisdom of the animals.\u0026rsquo  This story, I think, would make the perfect start to any school day."},{"url":null,"title":"new-world-record-set-at-haddington-rugby-club","story":"  A total of 458 men, women and children took to the pitch at Neilson Park on Sunday as part of the Haddington 700 celebrations. Currently the world record for players involved in a continuous game of rugby is 442.  Now Haddington RFC president Keith Wallace is waiting for official confirmation that a new record has been set.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe day was a fantastic occasion despite the worst day of weather all summer, and we were delighted by the huge effort and support from the club and the rugby and local communities in getting past the record.  \u0026ldquoAs a celebration of the town\u0026rsquos 700 years of the Royal Charter it was a great success, with the match kicked off by Provost John McMillan, and great support from the town, with particular thanks to the boys\u0026rsquo football team who arrived late on, like the cavalry, to help get us over the line.  \u0026ldquoMore than that, though, it was brilliant to see players [aged] from five to 73 enjoying our great game, with several cases of three generations from the same family playing at the same time, including one connected family group of 18.  \u0026ldquoThis is the power of rugby. We look forward to seeing many of our record-breakers back at the club in the near future.  \u0026ldquoWe would also like to thank the Royal Bank of Scotland, sponsors of RugbyForce day of which we were one of two top prize winners, without whose support the event would not have been possible \u0026ndash in particular their many staff, including a good number from the local branch who helped massively on the day.  The match between Haddington President\u0026rsquos XV and Haddington Barbarians XV was kicked off by Provost John McMillan.  The councillor, who previously played for Murrayfield 3rds, said: \u0026ldquoIt was a real honour. I have not played rugby for well over 40 years and it was an amazing day, with a great turnout.  \u0026ldquoIt was very well-organised, despite the horrific weather. It was a great community thing and I was impressed how many people were there \u0026ndash men, women and children of all ages.  \u0026ldquoIt was a great tribute to the club but also the community.  Following their \u0026pound1,000 win for their successful application as part of the Royal Bank RugbyForce initiative, delivered in partnership with Scottish Rugby, Haddington\u0026rsquos event organisers will now submit evidence of the record for verification from Guinness World Records.  Haddington RFC will also use the prize money to contribute towards a recruitment drive to increase playing numbers at all levels and fund community engagement projects.  Haddington RFC\u0026rsquos charity partner Wooden Spoon were also in attendance on the day.  Mr Wallace, who took part in the early stages of the mammoth six-hour match, thanked current Scotland internationalists Stuart McInally, Willem Nel and Sarah Law while there was also an appearance from ex-Lions and Scotland forward Finlay Calder, who grew up in Haddington. Mr Wallace said: \u0026ldquoIt made a huge difference \u0026ndash the kids loved seeing them and they were great."},{"url":null,"title":"new-headteacher-wants-to-make-knox-academy-a-flagship-school-for-east-lothian","story":"  Susan Cook took charge at the Haddington school this week after moving from Edinburgh\u0026rsquos Trinity Academy, where she was acting headteacher.

Ms Cook, who lives in the county, previously worked in Edinburgh at a number of schools, including Drummond Community High School, Leith Academy and Tynecastle Academy.  The teacher, who has a background in physical education, started on Monday.  Two in-service days gave her the chance to meet the staff before pupils arrived.  She said: \u0026ldquoThe staff seem fantastic, a creative group of people. They really are keen for the school to engage with the challenge.  Ms Cook has also vowed not to remain in her office at the school but instead wants to get out and about and speak to the pupils and staff.

She said: \u0026ldquoI absolutely love the school.  \u0026ldquoLots of people say it about Dunbar, that it is a really special community.  \u0026ldquoThere is really something quite magical about the school and the community.  \u0026ldquoThe youngsters here are just tremendous and the friendliness you get from young people and staff \u0026ndash it is a really caring place.

More than \u0026pound10 million is being spent on the extension, which includes a new two-storey L-shaped block to the east side of the school.  It will not only be home to new classrooms but also a home economics department, new library and learning centre with a dedicated IT space, and additional PE changing rooms.

The 36-year-old, who is joined by Ed Offer and Richard Maxton as depute headteachers, as well as Suzanne Hamilton as acting depute headteacher, said staff were taking the school into a new era.  The new headteacher, who was previously a biology teacher, added staff had talked about what they could do \u0026ldquoto preserve what is really special and how we continue delivering absolutely the best education for every young person that comes through our doors.

And it takes the masterplan a stage further with more detailed ideas for each of the zones proposed in its vision, including calling for the Scottish Government to be invited to base its HQ for its proposed state company on the site, as well as suggesting offshore windfarm company Inch Cape \u0026ndash which wants to place a substation on the land to bring energy ashore from proposed turbines \u0026ndash should also be encouraged to put its Scottish base there.  The community council document comes in the wake of a brochure produced by neighbouring Prestonpans Community Council promoting its vision of a Port of Prestonpans cruise terminal at the former power station site.  That proposal sparked anger among supporters of the masterplan vision, who accused the Prestonpans group of ignoring the views of the local communities.  It led to the launch of \u0026lsquoGreenhills: delivering the Masterplan\u0026rsquo, a campaign by local groups and businesses backing the consultation document.  Now Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council has drawn up a draft brochure which sets out why it supports the plans and proposes a range of detailed ways it could be taken forward.  That includes putting head offices for Inch Cape and the Scottish Government energy interests in one part of the site, identified as its \u0026lsquoEnergy Quarter\u0026rsquo.  It also floats the idea of flooding the power station footprint to create a marina \u0026ndash as suggested by a local fisherman \u0026ndash with associated retail and leisure facilities, attracting businesses such as a film studio or 3D printing innovation to the site, or even creating a brewery.  Graeme Jeffrey, community council chairman, said: \u0026ldquoAs a community council we are promoting our vision of what we would like to see. It supports the masterplan, looking at how it could be delivered.  A Scottish Government spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoWe have set out our ambitions for a public energy company and its contribution towards tackling fuel poverty.  \u0026ldquoWe will be consulting on proposals later in the year and will make sure that Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council have an opportunity to provide their views."},{"url":null,"title":"whats-on-this-weekend-five-ideas-of-things-to-do-in-east-lothian","story":"  1.

Mother Nature has been kind and the pipe is, by and large, under sand once again \u0026ndash though there are concerns it is likely to be exposed again in future if a permanent solution is not found.

Plans lodged with East Lothian Council are split into two.  The design and access statement states: \u0026ldquoThe brief is twofold: to diversify the core business on the site with the introduction of small-scale gin and whisky distillation to enable the production of speciality spirits for sale within the business pub chain.  \u0026ldquoSecondly, in light of the increasing demand for both brewery tours and the use of the Monk\u0026rsquos Retreat as a function venue, it is felt that the facilities require being upgraded, both in terms of general amenity, improving the visitor experience and to provide for the disabled visitor with the addition of a platform lift and accessible toilet.  A spokeswoman for owners Greene King explained why they were looking to diversify at the site, on Belhaven\u0026rsquos Brewery Lane.  She said: \u0026ldquoLike any business we are always exploring options to develop our business and facilities. The recent planning application is just one of many opportunities we are considering but no decision has been made yet about whether it is an option we will pursue if planning permission is granted.  In terms of the production of gin and whisky, a still house would be created.  According to the design and access statement: \u0026ldquoThe distillery will be designed to produce 250 litres of spirit a day. It will be unique in the marketplace, making spirit from the same wurt as the beer.  \u0026ldquoThe spirit will be a mixture of Scotch whisky, gin and rum.  \u0026ldquoThis volume and complexity will mean that the brewery will need to employ an additional person to run the distillery.  \u0026ldquoIn time the site would like to re-instate a historical greenhouse within the gardens in order to grow their own botanicals to add to the gin however, this will be part of a separate application.  The new still house would mirror the mash house, which was given planning permission in January 2011, in terms of its look.  It is two storeys, with a more modern design than some of the historic buildings on-site.  If the plans were given the green light, work would also be carried out at the main building on the Belhaven site.  A museum is already in place on the ground floor of the main building, with a pub on the first floor.  Plans show a refurbishment of both floors as \u0026ldquothe existing interiors are now tired and dated and in need of a revamp.  The application, which could go before members of the council\u0026rsquos planning committee later this year, adds: \u0026ldquoConsidering the site\u0026rsquos historic importance both locally and within Scotland, it is clear that any development both internally and externally requires to be sensitive.  \u0026ldquoIt is also important to recognise the value of this development in terms of the improved visitor experience, which will impact visitor numbers to the area as a whole, and the business diversification."},{"url":null,"title":"avid-lynyrd-skynyrd-fan-pens-foreword-to-new-book-about-his-idols","story":"  Iain Monk has contributed to The Gospel According to Abraham by Paul Abraham, who was the American band\u0026rsquos road manager for a decade.  The new book is full of stories about the band, best known for hits such as Sweet Home Alabama and Free Bird.  Iain said: \u0026ldquoI became an instant fan of the band in the 1970s and was instantaneously hooked by the music, that kind of southern rock music.  \u0026ldquoMy obsession for the band just grew from there but the first time I saw them live was in 1988 in New York when I flew over to see them.  \u0026ldquoI had written to the band\u0026rsquos management to see if they could help me with tickets and I think they were impressed that I was coming from Scotland to see the band.  \u0026ldquoThat relationship grew with management, road crew and members of the band and I started following them across America.  Iain, who lives in Gullane, has spent countless hours travelling across the globe to see his idols perform at 31 shows, ranging from New York, Boston and Washington to Belgium, the Netherlands and all across the UK.  His friendship with band members and those associated with the band has even seen him spend a week at the family home of Randall Hall, who was the band\u0026rsquos guitarist, in Florida. A friendship also grew with Paul Abraham, with Iain interviewing the road manager for his Lynyrd Skynyrd blog about his intention to write a book.

Hannah\u0026rsquos world had come crashing down when she tore her ACL last April while fighting in a competition in Berlin, leaving her facing a summer on crutches.  Having binge-watched Love Island while off her feet, the 16-year-old Ross High School pupil was starstruck when Jack \u0026ndash who was already in Tranent to visit family \u0026ndash appeared at her Church Street home to wish her well.  \u0026ldquoIt was mental, Hannah told the Courier.  \u0026ldquoHe was in Tranent and my little sister [Sophie, 12] had messaged him, and I didn\u0026rsquot know.  \u0026ldquoShe told him I\u0026rsquod had surgery and was being really moody! He said he\u0026rsquod be down soon and the next minute he was at the door!  The 22-year-old came sixth with partner Laura Crane on this year\u0026rsquos season of Love Island. Having only entered the show\u0026rsquos Majorcan villa in the fourth week, he proved an immediate hit with viewers.  \u0026ldquoHe was always my favourite, said Hannah.  \u0026ldquoHe\u0026rsquos just dead nice. He has family up here so he was up visiting them.  \u0026ldquoHe stayed for about 20 minutes. He plays sport too, so he was asking about my injury and about judo.  \u0026ldquoI just asked him about Love Island, and what life was like after the villa.  \u0026ldquoHe said that he had a gut feeling he was going to leave, and that they all shared clothes and had a laugh. He said they\u0026rsquore all best friends after the villa.  But what did Hannah\u0026rsquos mum think when a 6ft 3ins-tall personal trainer from London walked in her door?  \u0026ldquoSophie told her before me but I still think she was a bit confused, Hannah laughed.  After posting news of her surprise house guest online, Hannah said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove gained 4,000 followers on Instagram and had loads of people messaging me wishing me well. My friends all said they should\u0026rsquove come round to see me!  Jack\u0026rsquos visit certainly lifted Hannah\u0026rsquos spirits as she now faces another agonising four to six months off the mat through injury.  \u0026ldquoI just fell awkwardly, she said.  \u0026ldquoI actually carried on which probably wasn\u0026rsquot a good idea, and then I got withdrawn from the European Championships.  \u0026ldquoIt was my first big selection which is why I was in denial about being injured.  Even with this bump in the road, Hannah is adamant to make it to the top.  \u0026ldquoI got into [judo] when I was five through my friends doing it, she said.  \u0026ldquoWhen I was about 12 I started doing competitions and this year I\u0026rsquove been travelling loads.  \u0026ldquoI went to Japan for a six-week training programme and trained full-time with the Japanese kids.

ICOL wants to build a substation, which will bring energy from an offshore windfarm onshore and into the National Grid, on the former power station footprint.  The application has been opposed by local community councils and the council, who believe it is not the best use of the site, which was bought by East Lothian Council from ScottishPower in March and is subject to an ongoing masterplan process for its future.  However, within weeks of the council buying the site, Scottish Ministers called-in the only lodged application for the land, from ICOL.  They said the move was because it was of \u0026ldquonational importance and denied any link to the fact that First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was on a state visit to China \u0026ndash whose state-owned company Red Rock own ICOL \u0026ndash at the time of the announcement.  The reporter appointed to investigate the application carried out a site visit at the start of this month.  Following that visit, it was announced a hearing into the plans would be held and Allison Coard was named as the appointed reporter who would oversee the hearing and report back to ministers.  Ward councillor Lachlan Bruce welcomed the announcement.  He said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom glad that there is going to be a hearing on this application.  \u0026ldquoI, of course, would prefer if members of the public could also speak at the hearing to give their views and opinions but I do think that community councils being invited is a welcome step.  \u0026ldquoOf course, this is again lengthening the process of the application out. If it had been left by the Scottish Government for East Lothian to make a decision we probably would have had an outcome by now and members of the public would also have had their chance to have a say.  \u0026ldquoI am confident that the hearing will be a further step in helping to convince the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos independent reporter that the current Inch Cape application is wrong for the site and wrong for the people of Cockenzie and Port Seton and Prestonpans.  Invitations have been sent out to Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Councils inviting them to be represented at the hearing, along with East Lothian Council and representatives of ICOL.  All four have confirmed they will be attending the hearing.  In a statement following the visit, it was announced: \u0026ldquoThe reporter considers it would be helpful to have some wider community participation at the hearing and suggests that these views might be represented by one or both of the local community councils.  A spokesperson for East Lothian Council said: \u0026ldquoThe appointed Reporter has decided that a hearing should be held on certain matters to help her consider the application, and the council has confirmed in writing that we will participate in this procedure. The council welcomes the Reporter\u0026rsquos decision to invite both Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council and Prestonpans Community Council to participate in the hearing.  A preliminary date for the start of the hearing has been announced as Tuesday, October 2, with a venue and more details of those attending to follow.  A spokesperson for ICOL said: \u0026ldquoWe welcome the announcement that a hearing will take place on the planning application for the proposed substation, in line with planning guidance for schemes of national importance. It is important that the local community has its say and we look forward to engaging with this process."},{"url":null,"title":"looking-back-when-haddington-was-underwater","story":"  John Hamilton of the Facebook page Lost Haddington got in touch with the Courier to highlight how the floods of 1948 would look in present-day Haddington.  He said: \u0026ldquoUsing the flood mark in the video-still as a reference, I got a friend who has access to a theodolite to use this and project this water level to other landmarks around the river and town centre.  \u0026ldquoRobert Byers from Haddington Camera Club then used his photo editing skills and a photoshop \u0026lsquoflood\u0026rsquo plug-in to reconstruct the photos.  In August 1948, persistent heavy rainfall saw the county face its most serious flooding in history.  Although much of East Lothian was affected, Haddington took a major hit. High Street as far west as the Town House was under several feet of water which stretched to the gates of Amisfield Park, a distance of more than half a mile.  Distillery Park, the Nungate, Peffers Place and Brewery Park were similarly devastated.  The Biel Burn also flooded, submerging all the low-lying land north and west of West Barns.  The flood occurred as the culmination of a period of truly exceptional rainfall \u0026ndash 122 mm of rain fell between August 1 and 8, followed by 153 mm in the next five days.  The saturated ground then received a huge 139 mm of rain in the next 24 hours, bringing severe flooding across the county.  The Haddingtonshire Courier reported on \u0026ldquodisastrous flooding without parallel in living memory \u0026ndash if not in history.  In the August 20, 1948 edition of the Courier, \u0026ldquoserious damage was inflicted on the banks of the River Tyne while other streams burst their banks and \u0026ldquoleft destruction in their wake.  It added: \u0026ldquoSo heavy was the flood of water that the streams made courses for themselves, with the result that many people were flooded out of house and home.  \u0026ldquoOne of the worst areas to suffer was Haddington, where a large number of people were rendered homeless, while shops and business premises were flooded to a depth of several feet.  Meanwhile at West Barns, the Biel Burn overflowed, causing serious damage to houses and shops in the village but fortunately \u0026ldquono loss of life is reported, although some people had narrow escapes, so suddenly did the water levels rise.  The floods also caused serious damage to crops on farms close to the Tyne and extensive damage was also caused to the now-demolished New County Cinema on Hardgate.  Nungate residents who had been enjoying the evening\u0026rsquos film were instructed by cinema management to return home to avoid being cut off as water levels rapidly rose.  And slightly further afield, the electricity supply in Gifford and Saltoun was interrupted, and at the Maltings in Haddington the sub-station was completely swept away. It was anticipated it would take many months for the affected areas to return to normal, and calls for assistance to help with the recovery were issued."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-the-commodore-of-haddington","story":"  TEENAGERS often get a bad press. To be sure, it\u0026rsquos a time when parents wonder what has happened to their children and feel they have lost them or gone wrong somewhere. This is because teenage years are a time of great change in terms of brain development. Quite literally the teenage brain is being remodelled and new priorities and emotions are created as a result.  It\u0026rsquos a time when peers and their approval become more important than parents or family, or almost anything else. Taking risks, or doing seemingly foolish things, are all part of this. We are familiar with the term \u0026lsquopeer pressure\u0026rsquo, but in our teenage years, approval by our peers and being included by them takes on a massive importance. It is an essential part of growing up and creating a new self-identity.  And a story from over 200 years ago shows that although the word teenager may not have been invented, and that there was no such thing as \u0026lsquoyouth culture\u0026rsquo as we now know it, behaviour was much the same.  It involves a group of young men who we would now call teenagers. They were a group of friends from Haddington. They included George Neill, John and William Haldane who were brothers, Peter Martine, Benjie Hunter and John Davie, whose nickname was \u0026lsquoLettie\u0026rsquo. They were all from Haddington, and their escapade became a story told well into their senior years. The nickname \u0026lsquoCommodore\u0026rsquo was coined for George on this day and stayed with him until he took it to his grave many years later.  Much of the tale is left to the imagination but the essentials were well told. One of the group came up with the idea of hiring a boat and heading out to Fife. These young men were not from poor backgrounds and so had the means to do this. So with the madcap plan devised, they set off as a group to the fishing village of Prestonpans.  The negotiations to hire a boat were concluded and they set off for the foreign shore of Fife, aiming for the town of Kirkcaldy. I cannot comment on their sailing abilities but they must have had some experience for they successfully navigated themselves to the shore of the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo, possibly using the Lomond hills as a marker.  They came ashore like invading Vikings, intent on mischief. No social media in those days, but each town had a drummer who would disseminate news. And so they found Kirkcaldy\u0026rsquos drummer and paid him to announce to the town that at three in the afternoon there would be a spectacular diving and swimming show at the harbour entrance. The drummer set forth announcing the news, creating an air of expectation.  The group chose Lettie to be the performer. He was the best swimmer amongst them. As 3 o\u0026rsquoclock approached, a large excited crowd assembled on the harbour walls. The Haddington lads looked at each other with wry smiles and secret sniggers. Their ruse had worked, perhaps too successfully.  \u0026ldquoShow them what ye can dae, Lettie was told by his friends. And so Lettie stood on the edge of the boat and dived into the sea, from a height of about two feet. The crowd was silent, except for a wee five-year-old girl who clapped. She was the only one impressed by the spectacle.  There were murmurings as the Kirkcaldy folk began to realise they had been duped and were being made a fool of by these young Haddington lads. The mood began to get angry, and boos were followed by threats and words I cannot print here. It was clear it was time to go.  \u0026ldquoThank ye, the lads said, bowing to the crowd and laughing, mocking them for being so gullible. Stones began to fly towards them as they set off back towards Prestonpans, gesturing to the now-furious crowd. The lads in the boat were hysterical with laughter. They had raided and fooled the \u0026lsquoLang Toun\u0026rsquo.  But then their laughter stopped. Emerging from the harbour was a boat filled with angry Kirkcaldy lads who were shouting serious threats. The prank looked as if it might end unpleasantly so the Haddington lads had no choice but to row for their lives.  George took command. His friends had nicknamed him the Commodore at the beginning of their voyage, not so much because of his nautical skills but because of his leadership qualities. They were now desperately needed.  \u0026ldquoRow lads, row, he called on them. To be truthful the Haddington lads were at a disadvantage. They were not skilled seamen and in truth they were more bookish than brawn. But fear can do mighty things to a man\u0026rsquos capabilities, and as the adrenaline pumped through their veins they found levels of strength they didn\u0026rsquot know they had. They rowed like true Vikings, heave ho, heave ho. The sea splashed at their feet, their hearts nearly burst, but they kept the pace.  Slowly they began to pull ahead from the Kirkcaldy boat. \u0026ldquoKeep rowing, lads, dinnae look back, dinnae slow doon, called George, who was himself rowing as hard as he could. The tide was strong, the night was drawing in and the weather was beginning to change. The Kirkcaldy boat turned back, but the Haddington lads dare not attempt a Fife landing. They had no choice but to cross the Firth.  Darkness fell, then a thick haar covered them in freezing mist. They rowed through the night not sure in which direction they were headed. They wondered if their parents would ever know what had happened to them if, as now seemed likely, they were lost at sea.  The morning sun slowly burned off the mist. Thankfully they were still in the Firth, and there in front of them was the smoke coming from the lums and salt works of Prestonpans. They wept with relief and summoned up their last drops of energy to row ashore. Their final few hundred metres to the stony beach was watched by village children and women drying clothes.  Some fishermen helped pull the boat to land and the Haddington lads literally collapsed out of the vessel onto the beach, utterly exhausted but elated to be still alive.  George Neill was later to become a well-respected Baillie in Haddington, a bookseller and publisher of great local repute. He outlived his friends who had shared that day of adventure and danger.  He was often asked by those who knew him less well: \u0026ldquoWhy do people call you the Commodore? He never tired of telling the tale of his teenage adventure."},{"url":null,"title":"east-lothian-secondary-schools-delighted-with-pupils-exam-results","story":"  This year saw the best pass rate in Higher exams across East Lothian for five years.  East Lothian Council said that pupils across its six secondary schools \u0026ndash Musselburgh Grammar School Knox Academy, Haddington North Berwick High School Preston Lodge High School in Prestonpans Ross High School, Tranent and Dunbar Grammar School \u0026ndash improved their performances, with the number of Highers passed going up to more than 79 per cent.  Lauren Rodger, headteacher at North Berwick High School, told the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe are absolutely delighted.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results are brilliant and we\u0026rsquore really pleased with how all the current sixth year pupils have performed.  \u0026ldquoI know schools are judged on their exam results, but for us it\u0026rsquos also about seeing the pupils develop \u0026ndash that\u0026rsquos the most pleasing part.  Similarly pleased was Paul Reynolds, the Ross High School headteacher.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are delighted with the exam results.  \u0026ldquoOur Higher results have been record-breaking and the sixth-years who have just left us have got really positive results that will allow them to hopefully go to uni or further education.  Meanwhile, Musselburgh Grammar School is celebrating record attainment levels for S5 and S6 pupils at all levels in this year\u0026rsquos exam results.  Headteacher Colin Gerrie said that there were also many \u0026ldquoexcellent results achieved by pupils in S4.  He added: \u0026ldquoThe results achieved by our students this year are exceptionally good and continue the successes of recent years, with school records broken on an annual basis.  \u0026ldquoWe do not underestimate the hard work of our pupils and the commitment of our teachers to make this happen.  His counterpart at Preston Lodge High School, Gavin Clark, also gave his thoughts.  At PL, four S5 pupils achieved six As at Higher, although the number of pupils gaining one, two, three or four Highers dropped from the last set of results.  Mr Clark added: \u0026ldquoWe expected that to happen, as a result of our regular tracking process.  \u0026ldquoThis dip in no way diminishes the achievements of those who performed so impressively in examinations.  At Knox Academy, new headteacher Susan Cook gave an update on how the school was performing.  She said: \u0026ldquoSeventy-four per cent of S4 pupils attained five or more qualifications at National 3 69 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 4 and 47 per cent achieved five or more passes at National 5 at grades A-C and 55 per cent at grades A-D.  \u0026ldquoThere were some outstanding individual performances in S4, with eight of our candidates achieving seven A passes at N5.  \u0026ldquoThese results are a really strong foundation to build S5 performance upon and I would encourage all parents/carers to continue to support their child to study at home as the transition from S4 to S5 in terms of challenge and pace moves up a few gears and much more study is required, especially at Higher level.  Meanwhile, the performance of S5 pupils in their Higher exams was down on the previous three years.  Ms Cook added: \u0026ldquoFifty-five per cent attained one or more Highers 35 per cent three or more and 16 per cent attained five or more Highers.  \u0026ldquoTwenty-two of our pupils achieved five Highers and some with straights As across all subjects.  \u0026ldquoMany other pupils achieved a mixture of Higher and National 5 awards and will build upon these in their sixth year.  Finally, there was \u0026ldquoan improving trend for S6 pupils over the last four years at Higher level, Ms Cook added.  The headteacher said: \u0026ldquoThose attaining one or more Highers was 62 per cent and then added to their results from S4 and S5  this rose to 76.22 per cent having achieved one or more Highers over S5/S6 \u0026ndash one per cent lower than last year, which in terms of statistics is not significant. However, it\u0026rsquos more than 13 per cent more than pupils attained in 2015 and 2016.  \u0026ldquoThirty per cent of the year group attained three or more Highers and the accumulate total was 66 per cent .  Finally, Claire Slowther, headteacher at Dunbar Grammar School, told the Courier that the staff at the school were \u0026ldquovery pleased with the exam results and said: \u0026ldquoAt Dunbar Grammar we are very pleased with the SQA results our students have achieved.  \u0026ldquoIt is wonderful to see the hard work of our students be rewarded with great results.  \u0026ldquoOur excellent team of teachers always work hard to support and challenge students and we were all really delighted to see them do well.  \u0026ldquoWe are incredibly proud of the achievements of our students and are looking forward to celebrating these at our awards evening, which will be held on September 12."},{"url":null,"title":"plans-for-longniddry-south-to-go-on-display","story":"  Developers Cruden Homes  and ZeroC will be displaying their proposals for development at the Longniddry Inn on Wednesday from 3pm to 8pm.

That project came about following rising safety concerns from drivers who did not feel confident using the unlit road.  Since then, driver confidence has improved by 78 per cent, with the project, which was undertaken by UK-based Clearview Intelligence in partnership with Transport Scotland and Amey, shortlisted in the Road Safety, Traffic Management and Enforcement category at the National Transport Awards, which take place in October.  Councillor Norman Hampshire, a Dunbar ward councillor and deputy leader of East Lothian Council, as well as chairman of the A1 Action Group, was one of those hailing the project as a big success.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe installation of the studs has, in my view, revolutionised the driving experience on the A1 after dark.  \u0026ldquoThe studs have improved night-time visibility beyond all recognition along certain parts of the route.  Concerns about driving conditions on the unlit road were first raised by the A1 Action Group, which comprises councillors from Scottish Borders and East Lothian Councils, transportation groups and community councils.  Transport Scotland met with the action group and, upon investigating the road, recognised that entering or exiting the A1 during the hours of darkness was a key area of concern due to a lack of visibility, junction definition and consistency in signage and road markings.  Clearview Intelligence was then appointed by Amey to make improvements to the road as part of a wider project and installed the road studs to give a visual consistency to the route by ensuring all major junctions were visible and treated similarly.  This included using white, red, amber and green studs to effectively highlight road edges, the centre of the road and junctions.  Andy Salotti, director of solutions at Clearview Intelligence, said: \u0026ldquoWe are immensely proud of the work we did to improve the driving conditions on the A1 and delighted this has been recognised at a national level. It is an honour that we have been shortlisted as one of eight finalists in this category."},{"url":null,"title":"aberlady-street-to-be-without-power-for-most-of-the-day","story":"  Scottish Power is carrying out work on the village\u0026rsquos Kirk Road, with work to take place until 6pm.

A planning application has been lodged with the local authority for \u0026ldquoalterations, extension to redundant water tank to form one house and associated works.  A planning statement submitted as part of the application for the site, reads: \u0026ldquoThe proposal is to restore and convert a redundant and roofed-over water reservoir into a residential dwelling and improve the quality of this site.  The report adds that the house would be \u0026ldquodesigned so that the proposal provides an acceptable solution, preserving and enhancing the character and appearance of the building, which is category B listed.  The application is for a two-storey house, with disabled access from the first floor and a car park on land adjacent to the ground floor.  It is proposed that the upper floor will contain an entrance hall, family  shower room, three bedrooms and an open-plan kitchen/dining room and sitting room, as well as stairs to the ground floor. On the ground floor, there will be a guest bedroom, family shower room, access to the cellar and garage and a drawing room.  The plans have been submitted by agent Tom Pyemont of Hawick-based firm Pyemont Design greenarchitecture on behalf of applicants James Barbour and Alex Dale.

The agricultural land has been earmarked by East Lothian Council for business use but Barratt claimed the council\u0026rsquos vision was financially unviable.  They said the only way to make the \u0026ldquonumbers add up was to create a mixed use site with housing and industry.  But their claims were rejected by councillors after Provost John McMillan , cabinet spokesman on economic development, insisted: \u0026ldquoIf we build it, they will come.  The quote, paraphrasing one made famous in the US baseball movie Field of Dreams starring Kevin Costner, came as he backed council officials who recommended the plans from Barratt and site owners The Co-operative be thrown out.  Jason Watt, from Barratt, told a meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos planning committee in Haddington last Tuesday that site drainage and geology issues meant it would cost \u0026pound1.5m to get ready for development.  Once general costs were taken into account, the total development bill would be \u0026pound2.25m \u0026ndash yet the value of the land was estimated at only \u0026pound1.1m.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe numbers clearly do not add up and never will unless there is cross subsidising with a mixed use development.  Ward councillor Kenny McLeod  backed the Barratt proposal, highlighting the lack of council housing available for rent in Tranent: the proposed Barratt development included 25 per cent affordable housing.  Mr McLeod said: \u0026ldquoWe need to keep the local connection and they are not building housing for rent in this area.  \u0026ldquoIt must be 50 years since a house was put in the area for rent.  However, fellow Tranent, Wallyford and Macmerry councillor Colin McGinn  said he was concerned about the traffic that would be created by more than 100 homes on the site, which is on the opposite side of the town\u0026rsquos Haddington Road from Steading View.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe have a responsibility within Tranent to increase employment and opportunities for our young people.  Councillor Brian Small , opposition leader, told the committee: \u0026ldquoThere is no point in having a [Local Development] Plan if at the first turn we think we can turn it over. We need to give this business land the opportunity to develop.  The committee was told that while the district valuer had agreed with developers that the land was not financially viable as a single business plot, they had said it could be made financially sound by developing it in phases.  Mr McMillan said: \u0026ldquoWe have enough land set aside for housing.  \u0026ldquoPeople want \u0026ndashand need \u0026ndash local employment and if we build it they will come.

That means traffic was responsible for 18.5 per cent of the total amount of carbon dioxide released in East Lothian in 2016.  But in total, CO2 emissions in the county fell over the same period.  Jason Rose, from East Lothian Greens, blamed more housing developments in East Lothian for the rise in CO2 from emissions relating to transport.  He told the Courier: \u0026ldquoTo live [in the new developments], you need a car. More houses means more cars.  Mr Rose also highlighted the fact that nearly half of East Lothian residents commute to Edinburgh every day for work.  \u0026ldquoThe main issue is half the people who live in East Lothian work in Edinburgh, so they have to commute, he said.  \u0026ldquoBuses take a long time, you want cheap and reliable.  \u0026ldquoWith trains, there definitely needs to be more of an effort to improve length and frequency.  \u0026ldquoEast Lothian Council should be trying to increase employment in East Lothian, so people don\u0026rsquot need to commute.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquove heard some people say, \u0026lsquooh what if you open a bridge here or build another road?\u0026rsquo but creating more roads just increases traffic and spreads the problem around.  Overall, emissions from transport, both private and for business purposes, increased by 3.5 per cent in the UK over the period between 2011 and 2016.  However, total CO2 emissions fell by 4.6 per cent over the five years in East Lothian.  The county was responsible for releasing 1.1 million tonnes of CO2 in 2016 \u0026ndash down from 1.15 million tonnes five years earlier.  But Mr Rose highlighted that it was not just CO2 emissions that needed to be monitored.  \u0026ldquoWe need to watch for NO2  and PM10  \u0026ndash those are the pollutants that can cause health risks, he added.  In East Lothian, industrial and commercial activities are by far the main producer of CO2 emissions, releasing 63.9 per cent of the total. In 2016, households produced 16 per cent of the CO2 in the county, lower than five years earlier.  The Department also takes into account the amount of CO2 produced by farms and through other rural activities and the CO2 removed from the air by trees.  According to its estimates, these agricultural activities produced more greenhouse gases than forests removed, and so were responsible for 1.6 per cent of the carbon emissions in East Lothian in 2016.  Overall, the UK reduced its carbon emissions by 15.4 per cent over the five years."},{"url":null,"title":"in-this-weeks-courier","story":"  We\u0027ll also reveal the Top 25 in this year\u0027s Pet Idol competition.

Mr Logan quoted advice from the Society of Local Authority Lawyers in Scotland  stating: \u0026ldquoSolar have advised us that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments, explaining that all children ... will participate.  However, a spokesman for Solar told The Herald the body did not provide a view to the Scottish Government on the literacy and numeracy assessments.  He said: \u0026ldquoSolar has not advised the Scottish Government that parents don\u0026rsquot have the option to opt out of the assessments. Solar does not have an agreed position on this matter and has therefore not provided any formal or informal view.  \u0026ldquoTo clarify, Solar works alongside other stakeholders, including the Scottish Government, on a number of matters, but we cannot and do not provide any stakeholder with legal advice.  Last night, the Scottish Government said they had worked closely with Solar during the development of the assessments.    A spokeswoman said: \u0026ldquoHaving asked Solar for a view, we received a response and communicated that to directors of education in good faith.  The confusion over where the opt out advice had come from provoked a backlash from opposition politicians.  Iain Gray, education spokesman for the Scottish Labour Party, said it was \u0026ldquoutterly unacceptable for parents to have been misled and called for an apology.  He said: \u0026ldquoParents and teachers who were appalled when Mr Logan told them pupils could not opt out of these tests will be further shocked to discover the letter was based on an assertion which does not appear to be true.  Liz Smith, education spokeswoman for the Scottish Conservative Party, said the government \u0026lsquos position on P1 testing was in \"utter confusion\".  She said: \"Worse still, it seems the Scottish Government has issued misinformation to the directors of education and has therefore confused matters even more. This is wholly unacceptable.\"  Tavish Scott, education spokesman for the Scottish Liberal Democrats, called for Mr Logan\u0027s letter to be withdrawn immediately.  He said: \"It is absolutely unacceptable behaviour by the government and yet another incident from blundering ministers intent on  making life difficult for parents.\"  There was also concerns from the members of a campaign set up to encourage parents in P1 to opt out of the assessments.  Eileen Prior, executive director of parent organisation Connect, described the revelation as \"shocking\".  She said: \"It is very disturbing that this misinformation was used to support the government\u0026rsquos stance on standardised assessments.  \"Schools acting on this advice might find themselves in direct conflict with parents at what should be an exciting time for new P1 families.\"  Sue Palmer, chair of literacy charity Upstart Scotland, said: \"Parents have the right to withdraw their children from the P1 tests, but thanks to this strange letter many headteachers are under the impression that this right doesn\u0026rsquot exist unless there are exceptional circumstances.\"  A spokeswoman for the Educational Institute of Scotland teaching union said the episode was \"very concerning\" and confusing for parents and teachers.  She said: \"We fully support the right of parents to opt their children out of standardised assessments. Where parents have concerns or state a clear wish to opt their children out we would advise that parents make this known to the headteacher.\"  Jackie Brock, chief executive of Children in Scotland, said: \"There is no legal basis for insisting that P1 children be tested. There is also zero credible evidence that children will benefit from being tested at this early age.  \"It\u0027s time to call a halt to this wasteful and damaging approach, which is opposed by organisations across the education sector.\"  The government stressed that parents had no statutory right to withdraw their child from any aspect of schooling - other than some parts of religious education.  The Scottish Government spokeswoman added: \"If a parent does not wish their child to take part in an aspect of teaching and learning, they can discuss this with their school.

In response, Glasgow City Council insisted the lodge change the route of a later march, which was again due to pass St Alphonsus church. Unhappy with the request, the lodge cancelled the march altogether.  In its subsequent statement, the lodge said: \u0026ldquoIn order to offer concessions \u0026hellip we identified the times of the service in the church and proposed times to avoid this. All of this was rejected. We were simply told that some streets are now no-go zones based simply and horrifically on religious beliefs.  \u0026ldquoThis is religious intolerance, nothing less.  It went on to suggest an alternative approach: that the parade should be allowed to pass St Alphonsus\u0026rsquos and parishioners should all come outside to greet the march. They could all \u0026ldquowish each other well and carry on with our own lives, it said.  I must admit, I didn\u0026rsquot realise the lodge had a sideline in comedy. The notion that an Orange march passing a Catholic church, where only recently a priest was reportedly attacked in similar circumstances, could magically become an exercise in religious harmony was truly brilliant. It\u0026rsquos impressive spin, I\u0026rsquoll give it that.  If it\u0026rsquos genuinely interested in improving relations with the Catholic Church as an institution and public perceptions of it, perhaps it should consider how Catholics feel about these marches.  As a Catholic who grew up on the Isle of Bute, I hadn\u0026rsquot encountered an Orange march in the flesh until I moved to Glasgow a number of years ago. However, I\u0026rsquod met and known plenty of people who would strongly identify with the lodge, which describes itself as the \u0026ldquooldest and biggest Protestant fraternity in Scotland, and organisation of people \u0026ldquobonded together to promote the ideals of our faith.  It would be an understatement to say I did not have good experiences with those people. It was abundantly clear that I was considered inferior and problematic. These views and attitudes may not reflect how the lodge would like itself to be seen in the modern age, but there\u0026rsquos no denying it exists among its followers.  During my first summer in Glasgow, I\u0026rsquod find myself awoken at the weekends by the banging of drums and the sound of flutes. It\u0026rsquos a very odd experience to wake to the beating of a drum I felt was designed to let me know my place. As I became used to the schedule of marches, I\u0026rsquod purposely avoid certain areas. On the day of the biggest Orange march in Glasgow \u0026ndash the week before the 12th of July events in Belfast \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquod avoid going out altogether or leave the city. I know many other Catholics who do the same.  On one occasion, I stepped out of the house and accidentally right into the oncoming path of a parade. I initially froze, and then in a panic, ran. Was it likely that anything untoward would happen? No. But that wasn\u0026rsquot the point. These events instil a certain fear among many Catholics. The lodge can argue until its heart is content that there\u0026rsquos no danger, but it is simply wrong to dismiss how Catholics feel about it. We are a minority in Scotland and, according to hate crime statistics, a highly targeted one.  For me, it\u0026rsquos a no-brainer that the lodge should avoid being part of the intimidating atmosphere created by marches passing Catholic churches. If it is serious about exhibiting good relations with Catholics it shouldn\u0026rsquot be calling on us to step out of churches, while fearing for our safety, to help it prove a point.  But all of that said, there\u0026rsquos an element of the lodge\u0026rsquos concerns that I do sympathise with. Amongst the debate about all of this, it\u0026rsquos clear that some of the condemnation of the lodge does not originate from a place of concern about balancing religious freedoms, but rather of religious intolerance.  I may not like Orange walks, but in principle I support the right of its members and supporters to march. The Orange Lodge is an easy target for those who do not believe the state should accommodate expressions of religious freedom. Just as they\u0026rsquod decry Orange walks, these are often the same people who would have complained that the visit of Pope Benedict to Glasgow in 2010 cost too much money and disruption to justify.  And so, to an extent I actually do share the lodge\u0026rsquos concern, and that\u0026rsquos why I hope it will step back from this ludicrous determination to march past Catholic churches. In the end, all it will be is a gift to those who really want to see the end of the lodge, and it may be surprised to find that this attitude isn\u0026rsquot coming from Catholics."},{"url":null,"title":"unions-give-full-support-to-top-official-in-salmond-case","story":"  Prospect, the FDA and the PCS all came out in support of the process after an emergency meeting with the government\u0026rsquos top official, Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans, on Tuesday.

Speaking in Paris at the Mouvement des Entreprises de France conference, Mr Lidington said: \u0026ldquoWith exactly seven months until the end of Article 50 process and less than two months ahead of the October European Council, we face the choice between the pragmatic proposals we are discussing now with the European Commission or no deal.  The Cabinet Office Minister explained that the suggested alternative models did \u0026ldquonot meet the level of ambition or the outcome we all want to see delivered.  \"So, Mr Lidington urged, \u0026ldquowe need the EU to engage with us on our positive vision of the future relationship.\"  He then warned: \u0026ldquoI truly feel that we are at a fork in the road. There are trends on both sides of the Channel, both sides of the North Sea, and both sides of the Atlantic that could see us drift apart.  But the Cabinet minister also sought to allay fears within the EU27 that Britain\u0026rsquos desire to have a close relationship on goods but a looser one on services would reduce red tape for British businesses, enabling them to undercut their continental competitors, and give them a \u0026pound6 billion Brexit dividend.  \u0026ldquoOur proposals would ensure a level playing field, declared Mr Lidington, \u0026ldquowith commitments on areas like state aid, environmental, social and employment protections and other regulatory standards.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe understand that the EU is concerned that we could lower our standards to gain a competitive advantage but these concerns are completely unfounded. Like France, we view economic growth, consumer and worker protection and sustainable development as going together hand in hand, not as trade-offs.  At Westminster during a one-off session of the Lords EU Committee during the summer recess, Mr Raab again insisted he was confident that a deal was \u0026ldquowithin our sights.  He told peers: \u0026ldquoWe\u0027re bringing ambition, pragmatism, energy and if, and I expect it will be, and if it is matched, we get a deal.\"  The Brexit Secretary also confirmed that the deadline for a deal, once put at the October 18/19 European Council, could \u0026ldquocreep beyond that, and slip into November.  On the Northern Irish border, he suggested there was still no agreed solution but stressed how Michel Barnier, the EU\u0026rsquos chief negotiator, had confirmed he was open to new solutions on the backstop.  \"He has acknowledged the position could be amended or improved. What I can say is we\u0027re both committed to a solution and there is a lot of interesting, innovative technical work to make sure we resolve it,\" explained the Secretary of State.  He made clear nothing had been ruled out on the Northern Irish border.  \"We\u0027re not going to see a customs border drawn down the Irish Sea. We\u0027re not going to do anything which would imperil the Belfast Agreement. We want to make sure, in a positive sense, that the solution works for the communities on both sides,\" declared Mr Raab.  He insisted the UK had a \u0026ldquoUnionist Parliament, as indicated in the latest Westminster votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill.  \"For all the din you get around parliamentary votes, actually it was quite a good opportunity to reinforce the fact that we don\u0027t just have a Conservative and Unionist government but we also have a Unionist Parliament.  \"Because some of those amendments - in fact all the amendments - that would have risked the concern that we have around a customs border on the Irish Sea, Parliament clearly supported the Government\u0027s position.

Now the pupils at one school have voted to turn their back on their daily fashion parade after voting overwhelmingly to adopt a uniform of for the first time.  Youngsters of Westhill Academy, Aberdeen, even turned their backs on the chance to opt for a more smart-but-casual outfit of polo tops and sweaters, and instead picked formal shirts, ties and blazers for their daily attire.  The school has had a permanent \u0027come-as-you-please\u0027 dress-code since it opened 1979, but plans were made to change tack for the start of this academic year.

She said: \"I took over as head teacher in August this year, and from when I was appointed I saw there was an appetite for introducing a uniform at the school.  \"Instead of taking the decision to introduce one I decided to have a consultation which asked all the stakeholders in the school if Westhill Academy should have a uniform.  \"I thought this was a good idea as I felt like I was hearing just one side of the argument.  \"When I spoke to some of the pupils in the school their biggest concern was when they were representing the school at events and didn\u0027t seem to have an identity.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchool uniform policy \u0027creating inequality amongst children\u0027  Ms Reid added: \"The school\u0027s been open for 39 years, and we had hoodies and a dress code, but this is the first time that they\u0027ve had an actual uniform.\"  The results of the vote were decisively in favour of bringing in a smart uniform, with pupils backing the proposal by three to one.

He said: \"I did say that I didn\u0027t want it, but after wearing it, I feel like it\u0027s better.  \"Previously I was at another school where we did have to wear a uniform and I wasn\u0027t a big fan of it.  \"When I came here we were given a bit more freedom, and I didn\u0027t want that to be taken away, but I\u0027ve come around to the idea.\"  READ MORE:\u0026nbspSchools told to ditch blazers in purge on expensive uniform  Uniforms have become a thorny issue for some families in recent years, with the Scottish Parliament\u0027s education committee urging schools to step back from insisting upon expensive blazers and other items when setting out their dress code in an effort to spare less-well-off families budgets.  This year Headteachers were also told to stop sending pupils home if they have missing or dirty school uniform, after a wide-ranging inquiry into the impact of poverty on education.  Yet this follows a resurgence in school uniform within the state sector, with many adopting expensive policies of the private sector such as the introduction of more formal clothing.    Each of Scotland\u0027s 32 councils are responsible for the schools in their area, and there is no national policy on uniforms.  The Scottish government said that about 120,000 families would benefit, with eligibility decided at a local level.  Annual costs for the change will be about \u0026pound12m, with costs split between government and individual councils.

It is the third period in a row that the figures have been a record low for Abellio, with opposition parties piling pressure on new SNP Transport Secretary Michael Matheson.  Scottish Labour\u0026rsquos shadow transport secretary Colin Smyth said: \u0026ldquoMr Matheson\u0026rsquos honeymoon period is over and it\u0026rsquos time for him to get a grip on Scotland\u0026rsquos railways as passengers face more delays yet are expected to pay more for tickets.  \u0026ldquoWhen the SNP handed the franchise to Abellio, they said it would be a \u0027world leading\u0027 deal, but the reality for Scotland\u0026rsquos hard-pressed passengers has been anything but with hikes in fares, overcrowding, delays and stop skipping.  \u0026ldquoIt is time to bring this SNP rail chaos to an end and return our railways back into public hands.  \u0026ldquoFranchising has failed passengers and staff and that\u0026rsquos why Labour is fighting for publicly owned railways which will serve the many, not just the few.

Now a campaign questioning the concern\u0026rsquos monopoly over both the Clyde and the Mersey has been endorsed by politicians from the SNP, Labour and Green parties.  Campaigners allege Peel Ports are letting key pieces of infrastructure lie idle that could help Scotland compete for shipyard and port jobs with north-west England.  Peel Ports dismiss this claim and point to investments approaching \u0026pound900m on the Clyde in the last two decades.  The row comes amid a long-standing conflict between two multi-millionaire tax exiles over one of the biggest marine assets on the British coast: Inchgreen Dry Dock in Inverclyde.  Three years ago this newspaper revealed one tycoon \u0026ndash Jim McColl of Ferguson Marine, Scotland\u0026rsquos last commercial shipbuilder\u0026ndash wanted to lease the 1000ft long facility from another, John Whittaker of Peel Ports.  The Save the Inchgreen Campaign, in a letter sent yesterday to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and MPs and MSPs across Western Scotland, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe Inchgreen Dry Dock is being sacrificed to protect The Peel Group\u0026rsquos Investments on Merseyside.  \u0026ldquoThe Peel Group acquired vast areas of industrial land from Glasgow to Ayrshire when they bought Clydeport in 2002. They are now cashing in on that purchase by building thousands of houses and major retail  complexes, but no industrial development. We question whether this breaks monopoly rules.  The letter was endorsed by MPs and MSPs from the SNP, Labour and Green parties and by the\u0026nbsp  STUC, including local Inverclyde nationalists Stuart McMillan and Ronnie Cowan.  Glasgow North-East Labour MP and former shipbuilder Paul Sweeney has long championed a major world-class shipyard at Inchgreen, which would cost at least \u0026pound200m to build from scratch.  Jim McColl  Mr McColl\u0026rsquos yard, Ferguson Marine in nearby Port Glasgow, is currently struggling with a Scottish Government order for two new high-tech ferries for CalMac.\u0026nbsp  The tycoon had wanted to move to the roomier Inchgreen but failed to come to agreement with Peel Ports, which now runs the facility through its Mersey shipyard, Cammell Laird.\u0026nbsp  Critics say Peel Ports and Cammell Laird have had a decade and a half to outline long-term plans for\u0026nbsp  Inchgreen and other potential shipyard and harbour sites.\u0026nbsp  The concern has been piling money into the Clyde \u0026ndash but mostly on housing schemes such as Glasgow Harbour.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  Now, aware of simmering discontent, it has announced that it will bid for the right to turn Inchgreen into a repair yard for the Royal Navy\u0026rsquos two giant aircraft carriers.  Ferguson Marine  That, the firm says, will mean jobs. Insiders expect a charm campaign to get Clydeside politicians on side.\u0026nbsp  Save Inchgreen\u0026rsquos Robert Buirds has also highlighted other opportunities on the Clyde for ship repairs, including central Glasgow\u0026rsquos historic graving docks.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp  A spokesman for Peel said: \u0026ldquoWe wrote to Mr Buirds a few months ago detailing how the \u0026pound874 million Peel has invested in Scotland over the past decade has helped create more than 5,400 Scottish jobs.  \u0026ldquoMr Buirds chooses to ignore that we are actively bidding for the refit work for the new Royal Navy carriers and have pledged that, if successful, this would be located at the Inchgreen Dry Dock.  \u0026ldquoThat would\u0026nbsp create significant numbers of local, skilled manufacturing jobs.

The \u0026pound1.34 billion crossing over the Firth of Forth opened to traffic on August 30 last year as a replacement for traffic using the Forth Road Bridge , coming in under budget but completed eight months later than first estimated.  Since the new bridge opened, there have been 14 occasions when the FRB would have had to close to high sided vehicles, Transport Scotland said.  On the Queensferry Crossing it typically takes around one hour to restore normal traffic conditions following an incident, compared to one to five hours on the FRB.  An Audit Scotland report published earlier this month found the Queensferry Crossing project was managed effectively and delivered value for money.  Transport Secretary Michael Matheson said: \"The recent Audit Scotland report recognised the Queensferry Crossing as having delivered its objective of providing a more reliable road link between the Lothians and Fife.  \"One year on since opening the new bridge, we are today providing further evidence that shows how reliability of journeys over the Forth have improved in the last twelve months.  \"This is in sharp contrast to the lengthy delays seen in the past on the Forth Road Bridge, where an accident or breakdown resulted in huge tailbacks and much longer journeys over the bridge and the surrounding road networks.  \"The impacts of incidents on the Queensferry Crossing have been much reduced by making use of the hard shoulders to assist in quicker response times in the recovery of vehicles and allowing for the ability to maintain two lanes of traffic.  \"There are clear and significant economic benefits from this reliable crossing for both industry and commuters alike, I am pleased to see this has been recognised by the road haulage industry today.\"  However he said the fact the contractor is still carrying out remedial and finishing work at night has an impact on those travelling outside of peak hours and has asked Transport Scotland officials to obtain an update on the work.  The road haulage industry said the new bridge has been of benefit to the Scottish economy.  Seamus Leheny, Freight Transport Association policy manager, said: \"At a time when reliable trading links across the country, and with the rest of Europe, are more critical than ever before, the Queensferry Crossing has quickly established itself as a vital component in the UK\u0027s supply chain.  \"Its ability to remain open when other options are closed by the severe weather conditions frequently experienced in this part of the world are a godsend for businesses on both sides of the border.\"  Martin Reid of the Road Haulage Association added: \"The importance of road transport to the Scottish economy and its supply chain cannot be overstated and so the Forth Crossing is a vital route to cities and major conurbations along the East Coast.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-benedetti-unveils-plan-to-expand-music-education-programme","story":"  However now Nicola Benedetti, fresh from two lauded concerts at the Edinburgh International Festival, said she is to increase and intensify her emphasis on music education.  She is to juggle new education projects with her glittering professional career beginning with a new series of masterclasses, called Super String Sessions, in four cities in Scotland next week.  An outspoken advocate of music tuition in schools, Ms Benedetti said her future plans for education works are \"if anything, way too ambitious.\"  Benedetti is to help teach 500 young people in the fundamentals, and finer points, of strings at four events in Scotland, with the Super Strings events, staffed with teachers from the Big Noise youth orchestras, in Aberdeen, Stirling, Dundee and Glasgow.  There will be more next year, and she has ambitions for more - and her educational drives will be \"formalised\" next year.  Last month, she became President of the European String Teachers Association, and is also involved in bodies such as the National Children\u0027s Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestras of Scotland and Music in Secondary Schools.  Ms Benedetti has long campaigned against cuts to instrumental teaching in schools, and earlier this year said music learning had been \"left to decay in many British schools.\"  She said: \"My plans are, if anything, way too ambitious.  \"There will be many, many more workshops, and not just for students, but for teachers too.  \"I just prioritise, and schedule it. It\u0026rsquos not easy, because different things come at different times, and it is hard to resist things that you want to do professionally, but its just really that much of a priority for me.\"  Of the Super String sessions, she said she wanted to connect with young musicians not directly in the catchment areas of the four Big Noise orchestras, for which she is a patron.  The violinist said: \u0026ldquoIt stems from a general desire from me that the expertise that Sistema Scotland [which runs the Big Noise] has built up over the last ten years is shared with more and more children.  \"It\u0027s something that I\u0026rsquove really desperate to happen more and more.\"  The increasingly uneven provision of music tuition continues to concerns her.  She said: \"That is our society: that is British society, it is an uneven one: it is not one that gives equal opportunity to all children, and that affects music - insofar as music is absolutely not taught in a high number of schools.  \u0026ldquoTo teach an instrument is hard, to teach it well is even harder, and to make sure that a teacher is equipped with what is needed to teach a child the violin - a lifetime of study is required for that.\"  Super Strings will culminate in a festival of Strings Day at the Caird Hall, Dundee on 9 October.  Ms Benedetti said she will also continue to speak out about music tuition and the value of music to children and to society.  She said: \"I think, with the exception of the post-World War Two period, money for anything that does not seem absolutely necessary and immediate is something that you constantly have to fight for.  \"I do think that some very strong arguments are being made for it in Scotland, and some of them are being won.  \"But we do hear, week in and week out, of a new council that is in danger of losing its ability to give children music lessons for free, which of course just exacerbates the difference in experience from those who have, and those have less.  \"Music and the arts, because its so difficult to quantify, because it deals with a lot of invisible things, it fits less neatly into charts and tables and statistics.  \"All of these decisions are detrimental to putting music and creativity and the arts, never mind at the heart of education, or anywhere close to a priority in education.\"  In the last year she has taught more than 1000 children in workshops, masterclasses, partnership projects, and school visits, and estimates she has met more than 100 teachers.  However Ms Benedetti does not plan to set up an educational institution, like the Yehudi Menuhin School, which she attended as a young musician.  She said: \"I don\u0027t want to lose my mobility.  \"I don\u0027t want to lose the unbiased collaborative spirit, I want to be able to be putting on workshops up and down the country, with people I can work with collaboratively, with charities, primary school teachers, and institutions of all types.\""},{"url":null,"title":"paul-sweeney-make-clyde-shipbuilding-great-again","story":"  But nearby underutilised infrastructure such as Inchgreen Dry Dock and Hunterston offer huge potential for the Clyde to expand towards large-scale shipbuilding as seen in Finland, France, Italy and Germany \u0026ndash which between them build around 90 per cent of the world\u0026rsquos complex cruise ships \u0026ndash and where average wages are actually higher than in the UK.  Those countries have succeeded in this competitive market because they viewed it as a long-term national industrial objective to patiently support investment in infrastructure and skills and they have captured the world market in the process.  Ferguson Marine is the country\u0026rsquos only remaining player in what is one of the most competitive and capital-intensive heavy industries in the world.  From dominating world shipbuilding a century ago, when the Clyde alone built more tonnage than the whole of Germany, the river today accounts for less than1% of global tonnage.  The success of the Port Glasgow shipyard is therefore critical as it is a platform from which to rebuild the country\u0026rsquos global market share and form the basis of a renaissance in commercial shipbuilding.  The two new dual fuel ferries under construction there for CalMac are crucial to this objective. The delays encountered by the yard during their construction are not unexpected due to the complexities of re-scaling the industry from near extinction just four years ago, but also because of design changes made by the customer, which have added to the cost.  In a feast and famine industry like shipbuilding, the competing pressures of maturing the ship\u0026rsquos design but also of keeping the workforce on the shop floor gainfully employed can be a difficult balancing act for shipyard managers, especially when scaling up the yard\u0026rsquos workforce from almost scratch and building what is essentially a working prototype.  Delays by the Scottish Government in signing the contract initially also added to costs, as the integrated propulsion system has been designed, manufactured and imported and has been subject to unfavourable currency fluctuations.  If we are to commit to a credible and sustainable commercial shipbuilding industry in this country, then the Scottish Government must accept that there will be risks of delays and snags as we re-learn the complex operation of large-scale shipbuilding and work collaboratively with our industry to learn those lessons.  Public sector contracts like the new CalMac ferries are an excellent way for the industry to develop the necessary resilience and efficiency in design, build, testing and commissioning vessels of this size so that it can then tender competitively around the world for contracts in the future.  The Germans Finns and Italians have shown the way. We need to do the same. We have done it before and we must now view this project at Ferguson Marine as a national mission to reinvigorate commercial shipbuilding and associated industries in Scotland.

A significant change is needed to make Scotland both more low carbon efficient and also a more resilient, desirable place to do business. Therein lies the opportunity - Scottish businesses that gain strengths in resource efficiency and environmental innovation will become increasingly valuable in global markets.  Scotland\u0026rsquos ambition is to be at the forefront of social and technological progress. In May the First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, announced new funding to support Scottish entrepreneurs, with a \u0026pound650,000 investment into Entrepreneurial Scotland .  The Scottish Government is keen to encourage an entrepreneurial focus in Scotland\u0026rsquos future, through individuals, social enterprises and across government and the public sector.  ES is at the forefront of this movement and its strategy \u0026ndash A Vision for 2030 \u0026ndash positions the entrepreneurial virtuous cycle as a key tool for success. The cycle is a simple one \u0026ndash entrepreneurial leaders drive changes which create value for society, which are embedded in the culture and go on to inspire future entrepreneurs.  One way Scotland is engaging its entrepreneurial community is through the Saltire Fellows, the next generation of Scotland\u0026rsquos brightest entrepreneurs. They are being tasked with tackling some of the biggest environmental challenges of our time to see how that virtuous cycle can unlock Scotland\u0026rsquos potential.\u0026nbsp  Entrepreneurial Scotland has recently partnered with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency  on a Sustainable Growth Agreement to create further opportunities for environmental and social success in Scotland. Last year Fellows were set the challenge of looking into the global issue of waste tyres, with the outputs feeding directly into the forthcoming sector plan that SEPA will be consulting on soon. This year the Fellows will focus on the global issue of plastics  James Stuart, managing director of ES, believes that a cooperative approach is vital to tackle a challenge that affects every business sector. \u0026ldquoA year ago we took the opportunity to work together with SEPA, recognising that while there is much talk about the scale of the problem it\u0026rsquos much more difficult to actually engage effectively with it. This joint approach allows us to look through a different lens and bring an entrepreneurial mindset to the project    Terry A\u0026rsquoHearn, chief executive officer at SEPA, agrees that there is a real challenge. \u0026ldquoIt is estimated that if everyone lived the lifestyle of us in Scotland, we would need almost three planets. We only have one. If we are to make a shift to a one-planet lifestyle we will need massive change. Everything we do has to be reinvented and reshaped and as a species we need to become more entrepreneurial.  Scotland needs to be more innovative and more collaborative, and it needs new, and perhaps unusual, partnerships to succeed.  Stuart believes the partnership between ES and SEPA is important for success: \u0026ldquoWe have the corporate knowledge of a big team with superb expertise and SEPA brings its own particular skills with people trained to think in a particular way to address the challenge of climate change. With a united approach we can bring things into the crosshairs of where these skill sets come together.  A\u0026rsquoHearn agrees: \u0026ldquoThe scale of environmental challenges facing humanity is enormous, with a real urgency to act. Poor leaders are going to pretend it isn\u0026rsquot a problem, good leaders will face the reality of the situation. Great leaders will understand that it is an opportunity. Only those that embrace the economic opportunity of sustainable solutions to environmental challenges will thrive.

Ms Sturgeon stressed there was an \u0026ldquoobligation not to discourage women from raising complaints.

Mr Salmond announced he was resigning from the SNP last night, insisting he wanted to avoid splitting the party.  He has been a member of the SNP for 45 years and its leader for 20, taking it to its greatest electoral heights and closer than ever to realising its goal of independence.  His crowdfunding appeal was set up to cover the costs of taking the Scottish Government to court to challenge its handling of the complaints, and has already smashed its target of \u0026pound50,000. By 2pm on Thursday, it had raised almost \u0026pound80,000.  But opposition figures criticised the fundraiser as \u0026ldquoastonishing, and suggested Mr Salmond was \u0026ldquosending a signal to those who have made allegations that he has the upper hand.

An open meeting, ‘Winter Fodder – Dealing with a Shortage’ was held on Friday, August 17 at Thainstone Centre and farmers heard about different strategies to help with winter fodder budgeting, managing stock numbers, and alternative fodder and bedding options.                                                    Farm Profit Programme advisors Declan Marren and Robert Gilchrist, along with focus farmers Scott Duguid, Andrew Biffen and Jim Gammie shared their on-farm successes and strategies.                                                    John Gregor, Executive Director at ANM Group and Chairman of the event, said: “We are pleased with the success of this event and strong attendance from the farming community. The Farm Profit Programme advisors and focus farmers did an excellent job sharing their expertise and provided a wide range of practical steps available to farmers as they plan for the winter ahead. It is incredible how a number of small changes can make a significant difference to the fodder challenge.        “ANM is committed to supporting our members and more information is available by contacting our Farm Profit Programme advisors or by getting involved in a focus group.”At the outset, farmers were urged to create a winter fodder plan by determining current levels of fodder supplies, how many animals they need to feed, and the extra fodder required.  To reduce fodder and increase commercial productivity, Mr Gilchrist advised to implement a strict bulling period, scan for pregnant cows 40 days later, and cull the poor performing, non-pregnant cows to achieve 90-100% fertility rate in the herd. This will ensure the calving interval is shorter for next spring and reduce the number of animals on the farm this winter.By identifying non-pregnant cows earlier, they can be removed from the system before the expensive winter period. The next decision to make is whether or not it is worth feeding them prior to the sale. Where grass and fodder reserves are extremely tight, selling will be the best option. Where younger, easier fleshed cows are scanned not in-calf and are thin, it may be worth feeding them for a short period to increase the sale value. Feeding 5kg concentrates at grass for five weeks pre-sale will cost £35 but has the potential to increase cow weight by 52kg and the overall value of the cow by over £130 per cow.                                                                                                        Next, weaning calves early in October will help maintain cows’ weight leading up to winter, as cows utilise this condition throughout winter before the calving period begins. Supplementing growing calves instead of cows will realise a better conversion of around 4kg of concentrate to 1kg of live weight gain, which is the preferred option rather than trying to build up flesh in cows whose feed-to-gain efficiency will be poorer.Mr Marren reported that there is a fantastic opportunity to increase fodder supplies as the soil temperature is currently above the seasonal average at 14°Celsius and grass is growing at the rate of 40-50kg of dry matter produced per hectare. Farmers also have the chance to optimise grass growth by blanket spreading nitrogen across the whole farm. Nitrogen can be spread right up until early September with the confidence that you will receive an economical response to the application. Applying 40kg of nitrogen per hectare will grow at least an extra 600kg of dry matter per hectare at the cost of £35 per hectare.Alternative bedding options presented on the day included woodchip, recycled wood, sand and rushes. Once the animals are housed, one option for farmers is to replace 6kg of silage with 1kg of straw and 1kg of barley per day for one month.

The Garioch Partnership had applied for a Community Asset Transfer in a bid to transform the Market Place School building into a third sector hub.                                                    However after discussing the plan at a meeting of the Garioch Area Committee on Tuesday, August 28, councillors decided to refuse the application.                                                    During the debate, councillors said that their decision was made as they felt the business case was not robust enough, that what the Partnership were prepared to pay was too low compared to the value of the estate, and the model by which they proposed operating it was not financially sustainable.        Members of the committee told the Partnership that this was not a straightforward decision, which was given the correct amount of scrutiny as a result. The debate referenced an amount of misinformation locally about the Community Campus and what it will provide.They stressed that the new facility will add more community space to the town, which can be used alongside the school, not in isolation.The perception that the community will only get access out with school hours is not the case, and the facility has been designed to ensure the community and school will use the premises side-by-side.                                                                                                         Speaking after the meeting, Garioch Area Committee Chair Cllr Fergus Hood said: “Committee took this decision today based on the application before us.“The application and business case we scrutinised did not fully articulate either the community or financial benefits of this transfer. “It is our view, and that of officers in their recommendations, that this application was not detailed enough, not fully thought-out and placed a number of expectations and burdens on Aberdeenshire Council.“The offer from officers and members still stands, we would like to work with the Garioch Partnership to find them a more suitable location for a third sector hub.                                                                                                        “We support the aspiration behind this application but we do not think that this application we saw today will fulfil this need.” Market Place School closed its doors in October last year and its pupils relocated to Uryside School.The town centre building has been vacant since.

Colin Clark, MP for Gordon, said that retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the prolonged hot and dry weather this summer.                                                    He also suggested that supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed in order to keep prices down.                                                    Mr Clark is a shareholder in a vegetable growing and packing company based near Inverness supplying carrots and potatoes to supermarkets.        Speaking during a visit to a farm in Moray, Mr Clark said: “This has been the worst drought since 1976 but it is a wake-up call for the supermarkets.“I have been involved in supplying fresh produce to the supermarkets for almost 30 years. Farmers and growers have become so professional that supermarkets and perhaps customers no longer understand how fragile the supply chain is.“Scotland will come into its own this year with availability of water and serious investment in irrigation.“Retailers will have to reflect vastly lower yields due to the hot dry weather. The east coast and the southern half of England have disastrous yields, crops have wilted and failed, the same is true across Europe.                                                                                                         “Supermarkets will increase the range of what can be packed to keep prices down. “With less intense farming plant disease pressure is less, traditional rotations and precision farming give Scottish vegetable growers serious advantages.“Climate change predictions suggest the use of water will become critical and UK producers will have to be more efficient.”Mr Clark also sounded a note of warning about the ongoing row over UK-wide frameworks in areas like agriculture post-Brexit.                                                                                                        He said: “The vast majority of output is supplied south of the border to national supermarkets who value the quality of Scottish produce.“A fully integrated UK market is essential to Scottish farming. This year more than any other shows how important food security is and the opportunity for Scottish growers to displace imports.”                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"strong prices at thainstone collective sale","story":"        Over 2,000 buyers and sellers attended the latest collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment at Thainstone.

Some reports suggest it may be more than just a fanciful notion.When first contacted by Wick historian Harry Gray about the recent restoration of the \"Iron Wellie\", we had visions of a giant Wellington boot unearthed from the Caithness moors. That theory was firmly booted into touch after a visit to this unearthed marvel on the northern side of Wick Bay.The Iron Wellie is in fact a spring water well situated down a flight of recently restored Caithness flagstone steps close to the Soldiers\u0027 Tower on the North Head.Charlie Bain of Wick Paths Group explained how together with Denny Swanson, Tommy Munro and others from the Royal British Legion Scotland they recently restored the site of the spring.\"The steps down to it were overgrown and damaged,\" he said. \"We also replaced the pipe the water flows through and there is a marker stone at the top of the steps.\"Denny Swanson said he remembered bringing the water to his mother who suffered from arthritis for most of her life.\"She sent me down every second day for a bottle of \u0027Iron Wellie water\u0027, as she called it. She maintained it helped her arthritis and it certainly seemed to take some of her pain away.\"After Harry symbolically cut a ribbon of barricade tape the group, together with Charlie\u0027s dog Jet, went down for a taste of the water that many in the area depended on in bygone times. It is speculated that the inhabitants of nearby Tinkers\u0027 Cave would have consumed the water. The Wick worthy Tudor James resided close to the site and lived to a ripe old age.Harry said that the Iron Wellie was also known as the Chalybeate Spring and its taste has been described like \"sookin\u0027 pennies\".\"Chalybeate waters, also known as ferruginous waters, are mineral waters containing salts of iron \u0026ndash hence the local name Iron Wellie,\" he said.\"There is no written history of this well but it was certainly known in the 18th century and by the turn of the 20th century it was sometimes referred to as \u0027Jocky Simpson\u0027s Wellie\u0027. Who Jocky Simpson was, is lost in time.\"Harry said that \"generations of Wickers\" out for a walk along the braes or exiles home on holiday would nearly always stop for a drink from the wellie.\"We as youngsters firmly believed that the water did us good despite the taste and it was a welcome drink when playing around the North Head or when fishing or swimming from the rocks,\" he said.\"Young lads get hungry and we would sneak a turnip from Bob Cormack\u0027s field above the wellie, dock it on a stab [for the uninitiated that means removing the ends of the neep by striking it against a fence post] and we then cut off the skin and washed the neep in the Iron Wellie water before sitting on a rock and devouring it.\"Harry laughed at how present-day health and safety regulations would make drinking the water seem like a risky act \"but none of us became ill or died from it, perhaps proving the efficacy of the wellie\u0027s water\".Perhaps in the future Wick will host thousands of pilgrims queuing up for a taste of the rejuvenating powers of the Iron Wellie water.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 2:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117108.jpg","title":"Dont be put off if youre being bullied employees are told after Scrabster complaint is rejected by tribunal","story":"A LOCAL advice service is stressing that although a tribunal has rejected a complaint of workplace bullying made by a Scottish Government agency employee, others should not be deterred from launching similar action.DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment while employed as a fisheries officer for Marine Scotland at Scrabster harbour, but a tribunal this week ruled against her in the case.Speaking to the Groat, Iain Gregory, the deputy manager of Caithness Citizens\u0027 Advice Bureau , stressed that bullying regularly takes place in the workplace, and each year he hears numerous complaints.\"Clients feel that they have been the victim of unfair dismissal, discriminatory treatment, bullying or other types of incorrect treatment,\" he said.\"Anyone who feels they have been the victim of such conduct or treatment should never be deterred from reporting the matter.\"DeeAnn Fitzpatrick had claimed that she experienced bullying and harassment after she became a \"whistleblower\" while employed as a fisheries officer at Marine Scotland at Scrabster.The 49-year-old Canadian national told an employment tribunal in Aberdeen recently that she felt intimidated after being sent anonymous cards between 2015 and 2017, and claimed she was targeted with sexual harassment, for being a woman, and because of her age.In a previous hearing, Ms Fitzpatrick had also alleged that she was taped to a chair and gagged by colleagues in 2010.The employment tribunal, however, ruled against Ms Fitzpatrick in its decision on the case.In its judgment, it said it could not agree whether the cards came from current colleagues, and is understood to have been unable to consider the chair allegation as it was said to have taken place more than three years before the complaint was brought.Mr Gregory says that each year CAB deals with a \"substantial number\" of bullying cases, each of which is examined carefully and then detailed evidence is obtained.He says in many cases CAB is able to resolve matters without progression to the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service  or to a tribunal \u0026ndash \"perhaps by raising a grievance with the employer or by negotiation\".He added: \"However, there are numerous cases which require referral via ACAS and we can often resolve issues at this point by using the \u0027Early Conciliation\u0027 process.\"He underlined that it is \"comparatively unusual\" for a case to proceed to tribunal, with only a \"small percentage\" going that far.\"While it would be inappropriate to comment on any case in which we were not involved, I would stress that people should not under any circumstances be dissuaded from pursuing their rights,\" Mr Gregory said.\"The system exists to ensure that your case can and will be properly considered and we can advise you and make sure that you understand it.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 2:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Jobs boost for AMTE Power in Thurso","story":"THE number of staff at a Thurso business is to increase by 25 per cent over the next year following a partnership deal with a British technology company.The workforce at AMTE Power Ltd, based at Thurso Business Park, is expected to rise from 32 to 40 following the deal with QinetiQ whose headquarters are in Farnborough in Hampshire.

This partnership will help us to take our technology to a broader customer base and provides us with the manufacturing support and expertise we need.AMTE is a privately owned company and is the UK\u0026rsquos only volume cell manufacturing facility.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 2:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"New group set up to save Trinkie","story":"MEMORIES of the golden era of the Trinkie came flooding back this week when a new group was set up with the intention of restoring Wick\u0026rsquos famous outdoor pool to its former glory.From the reflections, you\u0026rsquod think people were talking of the sun-swept coast of Spain, or \u0026ndash more closely \u0026ndash the holiday camp pools of Butlin\u0026rsquos or the 1980s TV show Hi-de-Hi.A significant number of Wick residents turned up to the meeting at the Francis Street Club, where it was decided to form the Trinkie Heritage Preservation Group.A previous group was disbanded earlier this year, blaming a \u0026ldquolack of community support.Friends of the Trinkie said it had enjoyed maintaining the outdoor pool at Wick\u0026rsquos South Head over the years, and stressed that it had not been an easy decision.For years, the lido on the Pulteneytown seafront formed a communal gathering spot, not just where people learned to swim, but also for barbecues, get-togethers and family occasions. Local resident and self-professed \u0026ldquoTrinkie lover Bryan Newlands welcomed the group\u0026rsquos formation, underlining that the pool harboured a lot of memories. \u0026ldquoI used to go there a lot... Even though I lived on the other side of town, every summer myself and a friend would go \u0026ndash even when it was raining, he said. \u0026ldquoIt was a great place as the town didn\u0026rsquot have an indoor swimming pool until 1994. Many people learned to swim at the Trinkie.While a slideshow showed images of how the pool used to look and how much Wickers got from it, other more contemporary images show a dilapidated ruin \u0026ndash a far cry from the hustle, bustle and smiles of yesteryear.The new group was formed with a mission to \u0026ldquobring the pool back to life and a number of office-bearers were proposed and elected.James Bremner was elected chairman with other roles going to William Macdonald , Catherine Patterson  and Garance Warburton .Seven committee members were also elected: Fiona Bremner, Trudi Mcalpine, Davina Lyall, Fiona McPhee, Leslie Grant, Roddy Mackay and Councillor Willie Mackay.Ms Patterson underlined that it was going to be no easy fix as \u0026ldquothere are holes in the wall at the deep end, which also has cracks that go right down to the ground.\u0026ldquoThe previous group... had the holes patched up, but they kept reappearing, she said. \u0026ldquoThe wall itself is also crumbling and the bridge that divides the deep and shallow ends has had its fixtures corroded. Also the south access road that leads the public to the pool is in poor nick.She stressed that volunteers to patch things up and general goodwill is always welcome, \u0026ldquobut [often] their help only scratches the surface of what needs to be done.She added: \u0026ldquoMajor investment is needed along with a report from a structural engineer to see how much damage there is, what can and cannot be done, and to get an estimate of how much the restoration will cost.Mr Newlands \u0026ndash committee member Ms Lyall\u0026rsquos son \u0026ndash stressed that the Trinkie added tremendous character to Wick.\u0026ldquoPut it this way, with the summer we\u0026rsquove had, that pool would have been full had it been in use, he said.Other memories came from Wick Society chairman Iain Leith. \u0026ldquoGoing there was a popular pastime in its day with adults and kids from all over Pulteneytown flocking to it, he said.\u0026ldquoRestoring it could be a big boost to the town\u0026rsquos economy by making it a tourist attraction as well as giving back the town a much-loved landmark.Ms Patterson emphasised that the Trinkie had the potential to be an asset to both locals and tourists.\u0026ldquoBut we need investment because if nothing gets done the pool is on its way out.Thursday 30 Aug 2018 2:42 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"Open evening in Thurso for potential Childrens Panel members","story":"AN open evening is taking place next week with the aim of attracting volunteers for the Children\u0026rsquos Panel in Caithness.Tuesday\u0026rsquos event in Thurso will allow members of the public to find out how they can play a part in the children\u0026rsquos hearings system \u0026ndash helping others and giving something back to the community in the process.Volunteers from all walks of life make life-changing decisions that create a difference in the lives of many, and this is very true for children, young people and families in Caithness and across Scotland within the children\u0026rsquos hearing system.It relies on the voluntary involvement of around 2500 people who are willing and able to give their time and commitment to serve as Children\u0026rsquos Panel members.A number of agencies work together with the system to deliver protection, care and support to families, children and young people. These include social work, police, education, the Scottish Children\u0026rsquos Reporter Administration and Children\u0026rsquos Hearings Scotland.No new panel member begins sitting on hearings without a thorough training being delivered beforehand. For any new Caithness trainees, the training takes place in Inverness.Panel member and trainer Christine Stone said: \u0026ldquoIt has been a great privilege to serve as a volunteer on the Children\u0026rsquos Panel for over 18 years and there are others residing within Caithness who have served for more than 20 years. Caithness Children\u0026rsquos Panel volunteers come from a wide iety of backgrounds and experiences \u0026ndash all walks of life make for a good blend.\u0026ldquoThe panel is always in need of new volunteers and, to that end, we are inviting any interested persons to our open evening, to take place at 7pm at the Children\u0026rsquos Panel Office, 23 Swanson Street, Thurso, on Tuesday, August 28. Please do consider coming along!\u0026ldquoThis is an information evening, where an overview of the voluntary work will be given, which will be followed by a question-and-answer session.\u0026ldquoThis is a great opportunity to find out more and to see if this is for you. Being a panel member is hugely rewarding \u0026ndash it is a great privilege to be able to come alongside families, young people and children in crisis and help them move forward constructively to a better future.\u0026ldquoIf you are interested in applying to become a panel member, please feel free to contact me for any further information.

This is a deal with one of the biggest names in international air travel, and we see it as the start of a partnership that will develop into a full codeshare agreement later in the year.”Gokhan Haciibrahimoglu, general manager of Turkish Airlines Scotland said: “We are pleased to be working with Loganair for our flights operating from Edinburgh Airport, thus giving Turkish Airlines the opportunity to extend its network and better serve Scotland. Our partnership will allow both of our passengers to easily connect with the regional airports of North and West Scotland to over 304 destinations and 122 countries.”The move is the latest in Loganair’s Better Connected programme, which aims to provide the Scottish airline’s key destinations with a wide range of links both for local community travelling worldwide \u0026#8211 but just as importantly to also enable incoming visitors, whether for tourism or business, to enjoy ease of booking and ease of access.Deals have already been signed with Air France, Dutch giants KLM, Emirates, Thomas Cook Airlines, and customers can through-ticket and through-check baggage where flights connect at Glasgow, Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Inverness and Norwich. Single ticket booking for ongoing flights with more than one carrier offers multiple benefits including through check-in, protected connections in the event of delays and, importantly, the APD saving on flights from the Highlands and Islands which can be as much as £78 per person if connecting onwards to long-haul destinations.The partnerships with KLM and Air France allow passengers from all Loganair’s Highlands \u0026amp Islands destinations to travel via Aberdeen, Edinburgh, Glasgow or Inverness onto KLM flights to Amsterdam and from there to destinations worldwide and via Aberdeen and Edinburgh to Air France flights to Paris Charles de Gaulle and again onwards to destinations worldwide.The deal with Thomas Cook Airlines allows holiday connections from the Highlands and Islands via Glasgow to destinations including the USA, and the same will apply to Emirates services to the Middle East and to the Far East and Australia.The Thomas Cook partnership also provides long-haul connections from Inverness and Norwich via Manchester to destinations including New York, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Seattle, Orlando and Las Vegas on a single ticket.It also complements codeshare arrangements Loganair already has in place with British Airways and its partner airlines at Manchester, offering connectivity to transatlantic routes, including Chicago and Philadelphia, with onward connections throughout the US.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

For an entry form, please go to www.rewdt.org. Alternatively, entry forms can be picked up in Trek and Travel and Cycle Orkney in Kirkwall, or entrants can also come along on the day and register before the race.This year’s lap will once again start at the pier and the race will be anti-clockwise around the island, finishing by Trumland House.Another run and walk is set to be held in Westray, with the biannual Bisgeos 12-mile run/walk.The 12-mile run/walk starts from Rapness Terminal at 10am, while a one-mile run and walk will take place from Quoys, Westside from 11am. A three-mile event will set off from Roadsmire, Westside at 11.30am.

Local residents are digging in the last few metres of cable to more than 35 per cent of the properties.Community spokesman Steve Jones said: \"It\u0026rsquos a tremendously exciting time. Like many residents I\u0026rsquove only been getting very slow speeds capped at 0.5Mbps, making even the most basic of online activities difficult and frustrating, so looking forward to ultrafast speeds is fantastic.\"Fast, reliable broadband will bring huge potential to regenerate our scattered communities. It\u0026rsquos a prerequisite for attracting families and businesses to the area, where the population has fallen in recent years. People now expect good internet as a basic. In essence, it will help us to build a closer and more integrated community.\"Lesley Negri, who runs the historic Aultguish Inn near Garve with her husband Dario, added: \"It will make a huge difference to us, especially for our booking system and payments.\"At the moment everything slows down from 4pm and we can\u0026rsquot manage customer expectations. Many of our customers want to stream things or download photographs and it\u0026rsquos impossible to do that at the moment. We\u0026rsquove lived with slow broadband for so long that we can\u0026rsquot imagine what it\u0026rsquos going to be like when we can access ultrafast speeds!\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 2:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

Although the provision of public toilets is a non-statutory function of local authorities, the Scottish Government ensured that the criteria for the fund did include capital support for toilet provision, where there was a demonstrable need.\"She added that she was aware of the council\u0026rsquos toilet closure plans and said she had \"personally pressed\" the local authority to reconsider.Council leader Margaret Davidson said the cuts were part of wider measures to \"balance the budget and safeguard essential services\" amid a climate of reduced funding for councils across Scotland and the wider UK.What do YOU think?

It consists of a retail box of fresh fish, sent directly to consumers all over the UK within hours of being landed. Fishbox now boasts in excess of 2000 subscribers with 100 new customers signing up every month.Mr Houston told the North Star: \"These are very exciting times for us. We will leave the Inverness premises on August 24. We have simply outgrown the premises and all of Coast \u0026amp Glen will relocate to Alness.\u0026nbsp We currently have 14 staff, plus four staff we have taken on from Summer Isles and are recruiting a further eight staff. There will me more next year too.\"Fishbox currently employs nine staff and this will increase next year too. We have big expansion plans for both companies.\"The award-winning businessman, a former motorcycle racer who taught himself the trade after a bad crash, has built up Coast \u0026amp Glen to a turnover exceeding \u0026pound2.2 million. The combined turnover for the two companies at the end of this year is set to top \u0026pound3m.His change in direction came by chance whilst out on a fishing boat. He went on to buy a small 21ft fishing boat, teaching himself from YouTube and Google. He decided to start selling his own catch and found the demand was so high he started selling from other boats. With the high demand from restaurants for a wider iety of products, Coast \u0026amp Glen was born.He said: \"I have always thought it\u0026rsquos very important to support the local community with jobs. It would be much easier for us to send fish to Glasgow to get processed just like majority of the salmon companies do and the whisky companies do for the bottling of their whisky, but that would have an impact on the area I was born and brought up in.\"This was the reason that I put a lot of time pressure on the people involved in the transition of the purchase of Summer Isles Foods.\"Thursday 30 Aug 2018 2:43 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspBy using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has been told to use a meeting of SNP parliamentarians to stamp out conspiracy theories about allegations of misconduct levelled at her predecessor Alex Salmond.                 Ms Sturgeon is set to address a meeting of her MPs and MSPs tomorrow for the first time since allegations emerged about Mr Salmond’s behaviour.             The former First Minister is in the process of taking the Scottish Government to court over its handling of a pair of complaints made this year about Mr Salmond.             She has been urged by rival parties to use the ‘Away Day’ in Edinburgh to stop SNP politicians from sharing conspiracy theories being disseminated on social media suggesting the allegations against Mr Salmond are a unionist plot. READ MORE: Salmond hits £50k crowdfunding targetMSP Richard Lyle retweeted a claim on Friday which said: “The attacks on Yes Facebook pages, Independence supporting blogs and Alex Salmond are not unconnected - The British State is terrified Scotland ends the 1707 union.”Outspoken MP Angus Macneil, meanwhile has retweeted several contentious statements and has shared details of Mr Salmond’s crowdfunding effort to help pay his legal bills. The Western Isles MP shared a tweet which said ‘I’m backing Alex Salmond’ and suggested the British establishment was behind the accusation.             He also retweeted a Twitter user who said: “I’m not using the term ‘Scottish Government’ until its clarified who is in charge - Leslie Evans  or Nicola Sturgeon.”READ MORE: Alex Salmond accused of ‘abusing his power’ over crowdfundingLabour MSP Rhoda Grant told the Herald: “A clear message should go to SNP parliamentarians that sharing and propagating conspiracy theories around the Alex Salmond case is harmful for all involved.“The First Minister has clearly stated that sexual harassment will not be tolerated and victims should come forward - however there are members of her party indulging in victim blaming which is totally unacceptable.”            A Scottish Tory spokesman said: “Nicola Sturgeon will no doubt feel obliged to answer the many questions her MSPs and MPs will have about what her government knew about such allegations, and when.“It’s therefore vitally important she is equally transparent with the people of Scotland, who deserve and expect answers about this very serious matter.”An SNP spokesperson said: “The SNP will keep a firm focus on how to build a fairer, more prosperous country, how we hold a dangerous, Brexit-obsessed Tory party to account at Westminster and how we drive Scotland towards independence.

An army of the unemployed descended on Edinburgh from all corners of Scotland. With them were bands, field kitchens and banners. Each marcher had a knapsack and blanket. The goal of the marchers was to meet with Sir Godfrey Collins, Secretary of State for Scotland, to demand the abolition of the means test, increased relief for men, women and children and for work schemes to provide jobs. The city authorities made it clear the marchers were not welcome and they would provide no accommodation or food.            The march was organised by the Communist-led National Unemployed Workers Movement , whose Scottish organiser was the veteran agitator, Harry McShane, but it won support from the Independent Labour Party, the trade unions and Labour Party. The Aberdeen and Dundee contingents marched south to join with the Fife contingent in Kirkcaldy. The Ayrshire contingent joined with Lanarkshire marching via Shotts and East Calder. The Renfrewshire and Dunbartonshire contingents, including a women’s section marched via Glasgow, Coatbridge, Airdrie, Bathgate, and Broxburn. The main Glasgow contingent marched to Kilsyth and Falkirk, where they joined with Stirlingshire, and onto Edinburgh via Bo’ness.READ MORE: Video: Rare footage of Edinburgh in the 1930sOn Sunday 12 June, they joined up in Costorphine for their entry into the capital. The next day 20,000 people greeted them at the Mound. The first sign of a thaw on the part of the authorities was when the Ministries of Labour, Health and Education agreed to meet delegations of marchers. But there was still no reply from Collins. A second victory was when the police lifted a ban on street collections. But Collins refused to meet with them.The NUWM members paraded through the royal palace of Holyrood with their band playing ‘The Internationale’ and other socialist tunes, and when the city council refused to provide accommodation their leader, Harry McShane, said they’d sleep on the pavement of Princes Street, the city’s most prestigious thoroughfare, as marcher William McVicar recalled: “I think someone offered us somewhere [to sleep] like Waverley Market or somethin’. And McShane and them wouldn’t accept that, they says, ‘No, no, we’re not going there.’ So they says, ‘Oh well, we cannae give you anything else.’ And of course he says, ‘Right we’ll sleep in Princes Street.’” The Edinburgh Evening News reported McShane telling the marchers as they gathered on the south side of Princes Street: “So far here we are and here we stay until another decision is reached. We can breakfast, dinner or tea here, and the men require a rest. They can have that rest in Princes Street. We have decided to give them a long lie in ‘bed’ this morning.” The Edinburgh Dispatch caught the mood among the ordinary folk of Edinburgh as they made thier way along Princes Street on that first morning: “Walking along on the carriageway one heard snatches of conversation: ‘Slept well?’ ‘How did ye enjoy yer feather bed?’ ‘Did ye feel a draught coming in during the night?’”            On the first morning, women marchers blocked the tramway while men shaved using their reflections in the windows of the big department stores. Tom Ferns remembers: “And they couldnae ha’ picked a better spot than Princes Street. Under the Conservative Party headquarters, the Liberal Party headquarters and the big luxury hotels, here was hundreds and hundreds o’ angry unemployed. Obviously a sight like that is not seen every day, particularly in the capital city of Edinburgh.”READ MORE: Astonishing press photographs capture interwar-era EdinburghAnother marcher, James Allison, said, “the police were going mad”. Yet Edinburgh police were not keen on inciting a pitched battle as Hugh Sloan recalled: “At dinner time, our field-kitchen came along and the police chief told Harry McShane, ‘This is Princes Street, you can’t feed here.’ Harry told them, ‘It was good enough for us to sleep here, it’s good enough for us to feed here.’” The marchers then demanded free transport home. Eventually the city’s chief constable and deputy town clerk told them they would provide transport if McShane guaranteed there would be no more marches to Edinburgh. He refused and the chief constable, worried about disturbances on the capital’s streets, backed down. Transport was then provided to take the marchers home.            On the last night, the marchers and their supporters gathered to burn an effigy of Sir Godfrey Collins before boarding buses and a final meal paid for by the city council. The march organisers refused to give a guarantee that no further hunger marchers would defile the city!Throughout the 1930s, the unemployed protested but the NUWM also organised children’s parties in the summer and at Christmas. A number of the marchers would go on to fight in the Spanish Civil War, including the leader of the Aberdeen contingent, Bob Cooney.The inter-war period, not just the “Hungry Thirties”, was grim in Scotland. Prior to the First World War, it had been at the cutting edge of British industry. Within a few years of the wars end the traditional industries, coal, steel and shipbuilding were in trouble. Scottish banks and companies were bought up by their bigger English rivals. Unemployment was a permanent feature, peaking in the 1930s and only ending with the demands of the Second World War.The shale mining industry collapsed, for example, as cheap imported oil cut demand for paraffin. In December 1925, “The Scotsman” reported from Tarbrax, a shale mining village then in South Lanarkshire under the headline “Situation at Tarbrax: Faced With Starvation,” which reported: “Workers from Tarbrax, to the number of nearly 400, marched in procession to Carnwath, nearly ten miles distant, on Thursday night last for the purpose of asking poor relief. Relief under the emergency clause of the Poor Law Act, which enables people in a state of absolute destitution to get relief, has been given to a number of people in Tarbrax on the recommendation of the doctor there. A meeting of Carnwath Parish Council has been called for today to consider the whole situation.”  Starvation – it’s a strong word. My father was little over a year old when the mine at Tarbrax shut. His father would have been on that cold December march before briefly finding work at another pit nearby, then giving up and coming to Edinburgh in search of work. He was without a permanent job until the end of the 1930s.

In my role as Deputy First Minister, I spend a lot of time talking about all of the different work the Scottish Government is doing to try and make this ambition a reality.            We regularly talk about what we are doing to make Scotland better for our young people. But what we do not talk about enough is how our young people are making Scotland better. We as a nation should be proud of their achievements, no more so than in this, the Year of Young People. Designed to do exactly that, the YOYP shines a spotlight on the contributions and success of some of our youngest citizens. And there is no mistaking the valuable contribution our young people make through youth organisations like the Boys’ Brigade. This year I have been invited to give the keynote address at their annual conference, and I have to admit to being extremely honoured, especially as a former member myself. The conference will see thousands of members from across the United Kingdom and Ireland return to the place where it all began, Scotland, to celebrate the 135-year anniversary of the Boys’ Brigade. Founded in Glasgow in 1883, the organisation has come a long way but still remains true to its core values and aims.             In Scotland, they remain active in more than 400 communities and each week around 20,000 young people take part in one of their many groups across the country.Involvement in organisations like this can be extremely empowering, offering developmental opportunities as well as the power to make decisions, take responsibility and make a real and lasting contribution to Scotland, both socially and economically.READ MORE: Boys’ Brigade book is pal’s promise fulfilledAnd we know that youth work can have an incredibly valuable influence on the life chances of young people, which is why the Scottish Government remains committed to supporting and improving the opportunities available in a iety of organisations through our national Youth Work Strategy.            The defining mission of this government is to improve the education and life chances of our children and young people.Every child growing up in Scotland, regardless of their background, should have an equal chance to succeed.The poverty-related attainment gap that so disproportionately affects young people’s outcomes is a complete waste of potential and talent – it has to end. I have also been clear that closing the attainment gap requires a collective effort. Involvement with groups like the Boys’ Brigade plays an extremely important role in supporting attainment and achievement and developing crucial skills for life, work and lifelong learning. I know from personal experience that the memories you make and the skills you learn during your time in youth organisations like this stay with you for a lifetime.            It means discovering more about yourself and helping you to challenge what you are capable of. Equally it means discovering more about your community and the world around you, something I think we could all benefit from doing more. READ MORE: John Swinney: The evidence shows Scottish education is first classThere is more we can do though. It is not enough to simply learn about your community, we want young people to be engaged, to have their voices heard and help shape the world they live in. This is an extremely special annual conference for the Boys’ Brigade this year.It is the very first one that has been entirely led by the young people involved, from planning, ideas and decision making.Scotland is leading the way on youth engagement. Our Year of Young People 2018 is a world first and I am extremely pleased to see youth groups like this one embracing the spirit behind it wholeheartedly.I have been lucky enough to participate in the Boys’ Brigade in a number of different ways over the years and I have a lot of happy memories.  I have gone from being a member myself, to attending and handing out awards at presentations across Scotland, where I am constantly impressed by the passion and commitment demonstrated by the young people I meet.  For me, it was a particular pleasure to be able to present the Queen’s Badge – the highest award a young person can achieve in the Boys’ Brigade. It is the culmination of two years of hard work including volunteering, sporting development and expeditions amongst other things and I still remember clearly the day I received mine.Of course, none of the incredible achievements the Boys’ Brigade, or indeed many youth work organisations around the country, would be possible without the fantastic contributions our volunteers make.Thanks to the talents and skill of thousands of volunteers, our young people are supported and encouraged to be the best they can be. I would like to thank everyone who chooses to give up their time to support our young people through groups like this.Figures show that 80 per cent of learning takes place outside of school. We want to make sure that, wherever children and young people are receiving the skills they need to succeed in life they are getting the best possible support when doing so. The most effective work goes beyond the school gates and into the local community. The true breadth of education in Scotland does not start and end in the classroom.The Year of Young People is all about inspiring our nation through our young people’s ideas, attitudes and ambitions. A year specifically focusing on its country’s young people is a global first and something we can all be rightly proud of. But the work our youth organisations like the Boys’ Brigade do, year in and year out, is something we can be proud of every day and every year, both now and for generations to come.

Britain’s competition watchdog has provisionally cleared the deal which would reduce the Big Six energy suppliers to just five.            The Competition and Markets Authority  dismissed fears that the tie-up would have an impact on the most expensive deals as its inquiry found the providers do not compete closely on standard iable tariffs .            There had been initial concerns that the proposed merger would affect these tariffs – the most common and expensive energy deals.Anne Lambert, chairwoman of the inquiry group at the CMA, said: “With more than 70 energy companies out there, we have found that there is plenty of choice when people shop around.“But many people don’t shop around for their energy. So, we carefully scrutinised this deal, in particular how it would impact people who pay the more expensive standard iable prices.“Our analysis shows that the merger will not impact how SSE and Npower set their SVT prices because they are not close rivals for these customers.”SSE chief executive Alistair Phillips-Davies said: “Following a thorough and in-depth investigation, we are pleased the CMA has provisionally concluded that the proposed merger of SSE Energy Services and Npower does not raise competition concerns.            “The scale and pace of change in the GB energy market continues to be significant and requires us to evolve to stay relevant, competitive and sustainable.“We look forward to continuing to engage with the CMA as it prepares its final report ahead of the statutory deadline in October.”SSE and Npower announced in November that their UK household energy supply and services businesses would join forces.Under the deal, the new company would be listed on the London Stock Exchange with SSE shareholders holding 65.6 per cent and Npower owner Innogy holding 34.4 per cent.            SSE is Britain’s second biggest energy supplier and the merged group will serve some 11.5 million customers.

Former SNP leader Alex Salmond has resigned from the party he headed for 20 years amid allegations of sexual harassment.                Mr Salmond, who strongly denies the claims against him, said he was giving up his membership to avoid potential divisions within the party.window.twttr =              The former first minister of Scotland also announced a crowd-funding campaign to help with his costs in a legal action against the Scottish Government.            Opposition parties have attacked the fundraising move as “astonishing” and “unbelieveable”.Nicola Sturgeon, the current First Minister and SNP leader, voiced her “huge sadness” in the wake of his decision but said she understood why her mentor for three decades had chosen to relinquish his party membership.Mr Salmond made the revelation in a video message posted online on Wednesday evening.READ MORE: Alex Salmond begins legal action against Scottish GovernmentHe stated: “I have been a member of the Scottish National Party for 45 years, 20 of them as party leader and seven as first minister of Scotland.            “I hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service...“I truly love the SNP and the wider independence movement in Scotland. They have been the defining commitment of my life.“But today I have written to the national secretary of the party resigning my membership.”Two complaints, fiercely denied by Mr Salmond, were raised in January against him and he was informed of an investigation in March.            Mr Salmond is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him, with papers lodged at the Court of Session in Edinburgh on Tuesday.Ms Sturgeon had faced calls from opposition parties to suspend Mr Salmond from the SNP after the allegations emerged, but she insisted there was “no legal basis” to do so.However, in his latest statement, Mr Salmond indicated he wanted to avoid a potential internal split within the SNP.He said: “I did not come into politics to facilitate opposition attacks on the SNP and, with Parliament returning next week, I have tendered my resignation to remove this line of opposition attack.“Most of all, I am conscious that if the party felt forced into suspending me it would cause substantial internal division.”            READ MORE: Alex Salmond demands full inquiry into harassment ‘leak’ in government letterHe added that it is his “absolute intention to reapply for SNP membership just as soon as I have had the opportunity to clear my name”.In a statement, Ms Sturgeon said: “I feel a huge sadness about this whole situation. Alex has been my friend and mentor for almost 30 years and his contribution to the SNP and the independence movement speaks for itself.“While the decision to resign has been Alex’s alone, I understand why he has chosen to separate the current questions he is facing from the day to day business of the SNP and the ongoing campaign for independence.”She added that the complaints received by the Government “could not be ignored or swept under the carpet”.The allegations about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, emerged last week.Police Scotland confirmed on Friday that the complaints have been passed to the force.Mr Salmond reiterated his strong denial of the allegations in the video message, saying: “Let me be clear again. I refute these two complaints of harassment and I absolutely reject any suggestion of criminality.”Earlier this week, he wrote to Scotland’s top civil servant, calling for an inquiry into how the allegations against him were made public.“In this case confidentiality has been broken greatly to my detriment and in a way which puts at serious risk the anonymity of both complainants,” Mr Salmond said in the message.“It urgently needs to be established who breached that duty of confidence and why.”He said his “entire focus” is now on preparing for the judicial review proceedings at Scotland’s highest civil court and he has launched a crowd-funder to help with costs.The Scottish Government has said it will defend its position “vigorously” in court.Opposition parties have attacked the fundraising campaign.A spokesman for the Scottish Conservatives said: “Scotland now faces the incredible and unprecedented situation of its most famous former First Minister appealing to SNP supporters for cash to take legal action against the government he used to run.”Scottish Labour’s Rhoda Grant MSP accused Mr Salmond of “dragging Scotland into the gutter”READ MORE: Letters: Nicola Sturgeon is right not to suspend Alex Salmond in face of allegations"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It has been a long journey for some and a hard fight to gain the ground and then keep it  for the new building.

Some of the themes could be, \u0026#8216What do you enjoy about Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What makes you proud of Shetland?\u0026#8217, \u0026#8216What is Shetland famous for?\u0026#8217.\u0026#8221\n Send any ideas, before Friday 6th July 2018, to youthservices@shetland.gov.uk or call  744490 or contact SIC Youth Services through their Facebook page.\nThe SIC\u0026#8217s education and families chairman George Smith said: “This is a really exciting project that will capture the creative talents of young people, who will design and create this substantial piece of graffiti street art.\n\u0026#8220This project will help to channel their energy, and produce something expressive and colourful that helps to transform the area of the Viking Bus Station. It will be a fitting local legacy of the Year of Young People 2018.”\n\n\nAre they going to remove the bus shelter to allow for the mural to be done\nI sincerely hope the art work or whatever, is not some form of contemporary, conceptual, expressionism or modern art rubbish, where splashing paint onto the wall is regarded as art when in reality it is utter rubbish\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.oh, but you can see the movement of the paint, the blending of colours and the meaningless shapes etc etc\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230and then give an equally rubbish title like Lerwick on a stormy night, the meaning of life or some other pointless title.\nOver the years art has very much lowered its standards significantly to make and justify it becoming more commercially viable\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.just as bad, selling a reproduction at almost the same price of the original work as a so-called \u0026#8216 limited edition rubbish \u0026#8216.\nI would think even Graffiti would be more interesting to look at\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230atleast, for the best part, you can still see what was being represented in terms of graphics and text.\nNo doubt the PC Brigade would like it because it gives the opportunity for somebody to express themselves through art and life experience\u0026#8230\u0026#8230\u0026#8230..despite the fact everybody else looks upon it as pointless and meaningless rubbish.\nLove the art, shame about the bus service, waiting for an area and all that. Never mind, the Morons have control!! I just hope no funds are wasted on this idiocy. How about a Council spend on a Shetland Wildlife centre based in Lerwick. Infinitely more valuable than Mareel, a far greater attraction for tourists,  hopefully, a better and local architect employed. Something less like an inverted bedpan with windows that Mareel so reminds me ..\n Oh, I forgot, the forcefield would need lowered to allow them to leave!!\nWhy not use that glaringly white, huge marquee beside the Clickimin Leisure Centre, called something like 60/40 ?  It\u0026#8217s crying out for some sort of camouflage before moss and lichen gradually take over that task.  Decorating it could become a regular summer holiday event for young people.  It has potential as an exciting, big, artistic canvas after all.\nThere are many young people who do not participate in sport but who might be more interested in such an art project. Great though it is that there are so many facilities for sporty types perhaps it is time to re-balance provision and support for those not so inclined.\n Next you\u0026#8217ll be saying Hjaltland should build houses with more than one bedroom outside of Lerwick!!\nI think the Mareel is a fine looking structure. It also won an award from the Civic Trust so I’m clearly not alone. That won’t stop the philistines from sticking their oars in I know but it would be nice to think that one day the scales may fall from their eyes and the axes they are so keen to grind will forever remain blunt.\nIf you like concrete and glass, gaudy displays and tarmac, Mareel fits the bill! As regards, \u0026#8220The Arts\u0026#8221, Mareel has hardly proved the game changer as so promised.  In fact, Shetland Arts at Mareel have achieved ?? SFA in my humble opinion. Mareel made a few pounds for a few usual suspects, talentless arty parasites. The talented have been left to fend for themselves.  Best live artistic performance on Shetland since Mareel opened, \u0026#8220Status Quo\u0026#8221, thanks, Malcomn Younger and \u0026#8220Scottish National Ballet, \u0026#8220Highland Fling \u0026#8220, just my view. No surprise Mareel featured in neither. !!!  Now, how about what matters, a Shetland Wildlife centre in Lerwick. Hardly need to spend £15 million on that. A scientific, educational asset that may help to educate our children and a massive tourist attraction.  Would not even need a bar!!!\nThe Shard in London, an amazingly beatiful structure is made from steel, glass and concrete.  Skyscrapers in New York are also made from the same materials. Buildings, too many to list here, in most countries on the planet also depend on their construction from the use of ——— steel, concrete and glass.   Building methods change along with building materials.  I suppose there are some people who would like to see the continued use of materials once employed in the construction of cathedrals and even the pyramids of Egypt but it’s not going to happen. One day, that simple truth may dawn on those trapped in a narrow focus world.\nCome on Haydn I agree there are many beautiful building all round the world made from concrete and glass, but the tin shed that is mareel is definitely not one of them.\nThe Shard is a massive glass pyramid\u0026#8230.I\u0026#8217m wholly indifferent to it in every way. At least its somewhat better than The Gherkin, which closely resembles a huge glass butt plug\u0026#8230\u0026#8230.\nMareel resembles a cheap mass produced tin shed which has broken its back.\nIf I have a point to make here, its that the choice of materials for any one given building are largely irrelevant to what that building is when completed. Massive useless carbuncles were created in the days when only timber and rock were the materials used \u0026#8211 There\u0026#8217s the most of one of them still sitting in Scalloway yet as proof.\nAll the choice of materials can do is either increase or decrease how much of a carbuncle it appears to be, but a carbuncle is always going to be a carbuncle whatever its made from.\nCall me old fashioned but I would love to see the modern  building business that could build a pyramid like the meg aliths of Egypt. Stones of 25 to 80 tonnes brought in from three to four hundred miles  ,all done 5000 years ago.It\u0026#8217s true you really can\u0026#8217t get the staff nowadays. I wonder if the Pharoahs had problems getting folk to pick their fruitcrops \u0026#8211 the British ways of one can\u0026#8217t get ones hands dirty and keep Johnny foreigner out is about  to finish off  another burgeoning industry.\nI’m curious to know how a concrete and glass building can also be made from tin . Somebody seems to be a bit mixed up!   As for the Shard looking like a massive pyramid what about the Louvre pyramid in Paris which is made from the same materials already mentioned. It was designed by I M Pei, a Chinese -American architect and it is a marvel.  May I suggest that those who have never stood next to it or walked around inside it make the effort to include it in their  bucket list of things to do before the grim reaper does his job and whips them off to the pyramid in the sky.\nAluminium, tin the terms are interchangeable when it comes to foil and sheds.\nI’m sure your terminology is correct Ali but would you not agree that the use of the  term ‘ tin shed’ lies not so much in  identifying the material nature of that being used but more an attempt  to denigrate the quality of the end product by likening it to a humble run of the mill structure?  Rather like calling a van a box on wheels? I am too well aware that for some people the only way to deliver criticism is to resort to demeaning  comments which, ironically, rebound on themselves. But that is just my personal approach to delivering an opinion.\nIf it walks like a duck, quacks like a duck and looks like a duck, it is probably a duck. The same goes for tin sheds.\n@ Haydn Gear.\nWhen there is nothing of note to differentiate one building constructed from certain materials apart from other run of the mill mundane buildings of similar materials and style, there is nothing to denigrate. It is a case of being factually accurate.\nPretentiousness is no more admirable than denigration.\nUnless you already know Mareel\u0026#8217s purpose and that its supposedly an \u0026#8216iconic\u0026#8217 design, it looks exactly like a run of the mill tin shed that\u0026#8217s broken its back, just the same as the Viking Bus Station looks like a certain style of building that earned itself the nickname \u0026#8216The Pagoda\u0026#8217 as soon as it was built.\nLet us not quibble over semantics, but I would compare the architectural award for \u0026#8220Mareel\u0026#8221 to be somewhat like The Turner award for Damiens Hurst\u0026#8217s \u0026#8220Pickled cow and calf.\u0026#8221, Just a load of pretentious codswallop! To the real point, for countless £ millions , Lerwick now has a cinema, a new bar and a Cafe. Shetland Arts have a splendid Gin Palace as a new headquarters. The contribution to original art on Shetland, by Mareel, since its opening, has been conspicuous by its absence! Nothing of lasting merit, since Mareel\u0026#8217s gaudy doors, were flung wide open.\nI have never seen any tin sheds on Shetland which resemble Mareel. If any actually do exist , maybe someone would be kind enough to direct me to them so that I can criticise them for looking like Mareel.   What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.  Further to that, there is never any shortage of those who seem to get a kick  out of venting there spleens in those directions.  I wonder how much input into the Shetland cultural activities these people contribute or is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments?  I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever, walk into an art gallery and loudly claim that their five years old grandson could do better. Pig ignorant prats.\nLeaving Lerwick on the boat last week, I happened to overhear some tourists comments on mareel, they were not impressed to say the least. And when I informed them that it had won an award for architecture, they laughed out loud and one comment was by who, a blind man?\nThose of us who are long in the tooth remember the foaming at the mouth and rending of garments that went on about Mareel prior to its opening. It all stopped soon afterwards, leaving the field to a few cranks.\nPurely as an addendum, I don’t suppose that the nickname The Pagoda was  in any way at all a reference to China or of people of Chinese ancestry was it?  I wonder if takeaway customers are over concerned about certain mild architectural  similarities.\nThe viking was a chippy when it opened.\n\u0026#8220What is abundantly clear to me is that there is never any shortage of subject matter at which nasty , negative comments may be flung.\u0026#8221 Well said Hadyn Gear, Especially well illustrated by, \u0026#8221 is their primary function to stand on the sidelines and hurl abusive, critical comments? \u0026#8220, \u0026#8220I am mindful of those who, having no talents whatsoever\u0026#8221 and \u0026#8221 Pig ignorant prats.\u0026#8221 Your words, Haydn! A Turner for you for contemporary hypocrisy perhaps!\n\nWell Ian, I think the key word in your missive is the last one —PERHAPS.    I submit that it more truthfully should be PERHAPS NOT.  There’s really not much mileage in playing this game of tug of war is there? All is does is underpin the fact that opinions, both informed and uninformed , proliferate.  Those who shout the loudest and longest think they have won when they have actually simply become hoarse.  I know that to be true since it came from the horse’s mouth.\nLove hate relationships are usually destined to cause pain and disillusion for all concerned and lead to all round disaffection. Having spent a major part of my life involved in “ the Arts”, mainly writing and the visual arts, I find it most interesting that so much attention and invective are directed towards the creative endeavours of some  by those who appear to be totally opposed to so much ——— apart from their own claimed preferred cultural snippets, just to avoid being labelled as philistines and to  maintain  credibility from the watchful public at large.         In regard to the Turner prize, it might be pertinent to remember that both Constable and Turner were derided and scoffed at by the critics for being mere Impressionists.  Look what happened!      So let today’s critics mock on if it makes them feel better.\n\nParaphrasing MGM\u0026#8217s famous motto, the phrase \u0026#8220Arse gratia artis\u0026#8221, springs to mind. LOL 🙂\nAs an artist myself  doing mostly portrait work but also the occasional wildlife, I do question whether certain art styles are indeed representative of art or just plain utter rubbish.\nI have been to many art exhibitions and  art shops where I question what is deemed as art and what is deemed as \u0026#8216 ripping off the customer \u0026#8216 with questionable so-called art skill to this of ridiculous prices for a piece of art which looks like it was done in less than a few seconds. It all fair and square in regards to art, but when art only becomes the interpretation of the artist and nobody else can see what they see, one has to look closely at the motive behind such art, and usually the motive is commercial.\nIt takes me about 20 hours to do a portrait, and I charge a minimum fee such work. I have been told by an art expert, I should be charging atleast double for my work. I do art because I enjoy it, but moreso, the joy it gives to other people who admire my art work.\nI have sold art work to collectors in France, Western Australia , USA, Spain and even Scotland and Wales but, so far, none in Shetland.!  Yell gallery has lovely work by Ruth Brownlee and those who find some art products difficult to accommodate should pay a visit.   Ripping off the customer as mentioned by David Spence  is an all   too common feature in most  walks of life —— not Just in the art world. Buyer beware should always be the watchword.    Freedom to express ideas of whatever kind should be encouraged. To condemn out of hand as has happened in these columns is  not too far removed from the  actions of the infamous dictatorial methods of the now dead Soviet Union. Beware the Nikita Kruschevs who take swipes at anything that does not conform to dogma. Roll on the Turner prize!!!\nSo talented, and yet so humble. You forgot blowing your own trumpet when lavishly covering yourself with plaudits.\nNobody has questioned freedom to express ideas apart from yourself here Hadyn referring the expressions an opinions of others as \u0026#8220pig ignorant\u0026#8221. What I question is the countless £ millions wasted on promoting such \u0026#8220arty things\u0026#8221.  We have human problems aplenty without such utter waste of funds on pretentious arty nonsense. Shetland needs food banks, yet we squander £16 million on a waste of public space such as Mareel, which at the end of the day contributes next to nothing to anyone! That is apart from the trivial entertainment to a very few, who are hardly in need of anything that was not there before this White Elephant was ordained/consecrated.\nNo doubt it was deliberate   and the  opportunity to be a comedian was irresistble but the phrase “Arse gratis artis” should, of course be “Ars gratis artis”—— Ah so !\nHad you checked out Ian\u0026#8217s link you would be in no doubt as to whether I was joking. I\u0026#8217d say the Turner Committee deserve credit for poking fun at themselves and, especially pricking the bubbles of any pompous \u0026#8220Sam the Eagles\u0026#8221 among us. That said, it\u0026#8217s a concept I wouldn\u0026#8217t wish to see spread any farther!  🙂\n\nNo insult was ever meant to you, Haydn. You are a real artist. If I ever get back to \u0026#8220The Black Mountains\u0026#8221. I  will try and visit. What I genuinely loath are the artistic parasites, sadly some on Shetland, who exploit grant money, to feather their nests! We have plenty of those talentless people around most can be found in  Mareel\u0026#8217s bar, a further few in Shetland Arts. They usually promote and do nothing else, nasty little creatures!!! .\nFair  enough Ian. I take you point and concede that you probably have a better overview of the local scene than most.  I do understand that parasitic ARTISTS do exist and I met but rejected plenty of such types when I was a student all those years ago in London.  Have no fear, I adopt a pretty cynical approach to people who pass themselves off as artists  when it is obvious to anybody who has the capacity to question, argue and then dismiss them as frauds. Too many around in all walks of life. Nice to have these little chats from a distance and always enjoy reading your submissions.

LoL\nThank you for the offer Haydn, but my style of art is recognizable and is representable to those people to whome I have done portraits of.\nBased on this, and the feedback from people I have done portraits of as well as people who have seen my work, I can categorically say my artwork is recognized for what it is, this of a portrait. To my surprise, even the people I have done portraits of say \u0026#8216 there is a strong likeness to themselves \u0026#8216 and they are very pleased with the outcome.\nAlternatively, I could always paint and draw a few squiggles and indistinguishable shapes on a canvas and pawn this off as a master class in doing a portrait, but I think most people would see the flaw and question whether I was taking the mick or ripping them off. lol.\nI could always get away with this by saying \u0026#8216 It is contemporary, conceptual or modern art \u0026#8216 and it is how I see your face. lol I am pretty sure the majority of people would be wanting a refund. lol\nWell, David I think you’ve made your point and I have every regard for it.    I’m not actually a sqiggles man myself and if you look at my products you would find this to be true.   My concerns are mainly moved by what I perceive to be ideas, thoughts and principles which may or may not generate  sympathetic responses.  It’s a matter of giving freedom of movement rather than swallowing everything hook, line and sinker. Remember, many artists who were once derided eventually grew in stature and became accepted in spite of inordinate criticism. Picasso was a prime example as was Henry Moore.  All artists were modern in their own time. Dare I say that you are and I are too but to dismiss us as makers of Modern Art in the way that critics use the term would be unfair and short sighted. I hope that I’ve made it clear.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"rubber duck wins first bergen lerwick leg of shetland race ","story":"Espen Børresen  and Morten Offendal celebrate their victory.

On that occasion a top-notch Shetland team came away from Kirkwall with a 3-1 win courtesy of goals by Sammy Johnson, John “Pisco” Leask and Jim Black.\nHunter also played in the legendary 9-7 victory in Orkney 10 years later when, according to Orkney veteran Eric Hutchison, every shot that Bert Sinclair hit seemed to end up in the back of the net.\nSinclair himself has an amazing memory, and has kept records of some of his incredible achievements. His eight goals in one junior inter-county match and 11 in the next three successive senior counties have already been documented, but his scoring spree in the late 1950s and early 60s is something else.\nFrom 1957 to 1964 he played in just over 200 matches, at junior and senior level including representative games, and I can only find two occasions on which he failed to find the net. If anyone anywhere in the country has a record to beat that I’d be delighted to hear from them.\nSinclair also speaks of his greatest disappointment, being dropped from the county side in 1964, apparently for missing training when he had pretty valid reasons for not turning up.\nAnother who experienced the highs and lows was Derrick Bradley, who as manager led Shetland to an unprecedented 12 wins in 13 matches, the only blip being a 0-0 draw in Orkney.\nThen he was unceremoniously ousted, apparently because a few of the players had had enough of him. Bradley retains some bitterness, but it doesn’t stop him wishing the current side all the best for next weekend.\nLen Laurenson and John Johnston recount what it was like to play for both Shetland and Orkney, while James Johnston, Shetland’s equal most-capped player, reflects on 17 caps and how he went out on a high.\nBut the final word should go to two Orkney men, Hutchison and Morgan Harcus, both of whom are still avid fans of the annual event. As well as the fierce rivalry and hotly contested games, they mention the friendships they formed with their opponents.\nThat is probably what makes this contest so special. As Harcus says, they like to hate Shetland for an hour and a half, but the rest of the time it is completely different.\n: : : : : : : :\nDid the best team really win the World Cup? That question has been asked the length and breadth of the country after France’s 4-2 victory over Croatia on Sunday.\nPersonally I thought the Croats were very unlucky. The free kick from which the French opened the scoring should never have been given, while the penalty decision to make it 2-1 was debatable. There may just have been enough hand-to-ball movement for the spot kick to have been awarded, but it took several viewings by the referee through VAR before he was convinced.\n predictor competition, partly as a result of the scoring exploits of Antoine Griezmann, I was disappointed that it wasn’t a Belgium versus Croatia final. A new name on the Jules Rimet Trophy would only have been good for the game overall.\nFrance were ultimately the strongest team in the competition – they improved and became more resilient as the event wore on – but they were definitely not the most attractive. There was something almost German-like about the winners with their dogged organisation and ability to counter-attack with deadly efficiency.\nAs for England, I would say far too much has been made of a “new dawn” under manager Gareth Southgate. The English did get further than most people expected, but they came up well short on two occasions against the Belgians and only stuttered past Tunisia and Colombia. Two of the victories, it should be remembered, were against a shambolic Panama and a Sweden team which appeared to have no interest in winning other than by penalties.\nAfter England’s exit Graeme Le Saux – now there’s a twit if ever there was one – was going on about Southgate’s “emotional intelligence” whatever that is.\nA group of players came together and played as a team, it has been suggested by both Southgate and the media. But is that the first time in the history of football that this has happened to an English team? I don’t think so.\nIt happened at the World Cups of 1966, 1970, 1990 and 1998, and also at the European Championship in 1996. I’m sure the players who took part, for instance Bobby Charlton, Terry Butcher or Paul Gascoigne, would stress the team ethic involved.\nSpeaking of Charlton, the referee for Sunday’s final, Argentinian Nestor Pitana, had the kind of comb-over which the great man himself would have been proud of.\nThere were many who doubted the wisdom of granting the staging of this year’s event to Russia. But all in all it was a very satisfactory tournament. The organisation was good, the stadiums were tremendous, there was plenty of excitement and some great individual performances, and the introduction of VAR provided several talking points.\nMy team of the tournament, with a token Englishman in the mix, is: Thibaut Courtois  Benjamin Pad , Raphaël Varane , Diego Godín , Ivan Strinic  Ivan Perisic , Luka Modric , Jordan Henderson , Eden Hazard  Cristiano Ronaldo , Edinson Cavani .\nIf anyone questions the omission of Kylian Mbappe, I would say the young French player has been somewhat over-hyped. He certainly has pace in abundance, and a touch of skill, but is also petulant in a way that would suggest he is more of a successor to the diving Neymar than the much more honest Lionel Messi.\n: : : : : : : :\nSeveral metro stations in Paris have apparently been temporarily renamed in honour of France becoming world champions.\nAmong them are Notre-Dame des Champs, which became “Notre Didier Deschamps” and Victor Hugo which was adapted to “Victor Hugo Lloris”.\nEngland quickly cottoned on to the idea as well, with the Southgate tube stop in London being enlarged to “Gareth Southgate”.\nMaybe if Shetland wins the Milne Cup 100th centenary match next weekend the top thoroughfare in Scalloway could be changed to “Kevin Main Street”?\nOr did the county manager not name enough village players in his squad for that to happen?\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 23 ","story":"Over a hundred Shetlanders had a memorable time in Orkney at the weekend, rekindling aquaintances and reminiscing about old battles during the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of the Milne Cup.\nSadly this year’s football team were unable to bring the famous trophy back home again, going down to a highly charged and spirited Orkney outfit who took their chances when it mattered.\nMany supporters have been critical of the team selection, in particular the decisions to drop keeper Saul Swanson who kept a clean sheet last year, to leave striker Paul Molloy in reserve and to field James Farmer who did not seem fully fit.\nWhile it is hard to disagree with that, I also felt there was a disjointed look about the side with several players not being fielded in the positions they fulfil for their respective clubs.\nBut despite the result this did not feel like a hammering. The 5-1 scoreline flattered the home side. Shetland could easily have had another two or three goals and it has to be remembered that Orkney only got their last two with the game either entering or having gone into stoppage time.\nMolloy’s introduction 10 minutes into the second half obviously made a difference, as he went on to score the type of goal I doubt if anyone else in the squad is capable of – muscling his way into the box, holding off a couple of defenders, creating space for himself and firing home.\nBut the damage had been done in the first half – at 3-0 down Shetland were always facing an uphill struggle and it was no surprise that Orkney put the icing on the cake with a couple of breakaway goals.\nSome have suggested it was a game too far for captain Leighton Flaws, who reversed his decision to retire after last year’s win in Lerwick. I wouldn’t necessarily go along with that. Flaws, who maintains it was not the carrot of the centenary match that prompted his U-turn, looked as good as anyone in the Shetland side in the second half.\nI felt really sorry for manager Kevin Main, who spoke openly beforehand about both his hopes for the big day and his selection tactics. As someone who was described this week as “the Gareth Southgate of Shetland football”, he deserves the chance to turn this setback around.\nTwo years ago the then management team of Allan Graham and John Scott Christie, whom Main had assisted, were basically forced out of their positions after a 3-2 defeat in Kirkwall.\nThere is no way that should be allowed to happen again. Hopefully Main and his assistant Robert Geddes will now take stock and work hard towards next year, when the match at Gilbertson Park in Lerwick will celebrate Shetland Football Association’s 100th birthday.\nIt’s just a pity we have to wait a whole 12 months until a chance of revenge.\n: : : : : : : :\nA couple of hours earlier another team in blue slumped to defeat, but with Orkney’s recent record on the hockey pitch that was less unexpected.\nThere are continuing signs of improvement among the hockey players, however, in spite of an ever-increasing list of failures at inter-county level.\nA score of 4-1 was probably about right, as Orkney were much more clinical and displayed a quality of crisp passing and control which was a shade above their opponents.\nThe Shetland players work incredibly hard and show much commitment, however, especially with the added handicap of having to travel to Brae for any kind of action.\nA few caught the eye on Saturday, among them goalkeeper Megan Nicholson who pulled off at least one fine save, Cara Leask who notched the opening goal and Kristan Robertson who got the nod as Shetland’s player of the match.\nI would also mention Victoria Duthie who was in the thick of the action throughout, making several excellent runs and showing much determination both in possession and when chasing an opponent. The fact that Duthie was still limping quite heavily a few hours later was testament to how much she gave for the cause.\n: : : : : : : :\nOrkney football historian Jockie Wood addresses the Milne Cup 100th anniversary reception at the PIckaquoy Centre in Orkney last Saturday. Former Aberdeen striker Joe Harper, the evening\u0026#8217s guest of honour, is in the centre of the picture. Photo: John Coutts\nThe reception at the Pickaquoy Centre later on Saturday evening, attended by over 400 guests, was a great opportunity for former county football adversaries to meet up again.\nUnfortunately the meal was nothing to write home about – the main course of roast beef and trimmings was cold – and the acoustics of the building were downright awful.\nThe speeches which followed, if anyone could hear what was being said, were on the lengthy side. And I have no idea at all what guest speaker Joe Harper, the former Aberdeen and Scotland striker, was on about. All you could hear was the occasional “effing” this and “effing” that.\nIt was fitting, however, when Jockie Wood called on a couple of former Shetland players to take a bow. Both Geordie Hunter, or the “big game Hunter” as Wood referred to him, and the inimitable striker Bert Sinclair certainly did their bit in years gone by.\nSinclair in particular was in his element, reminiscing with Orkney opponents Alan Findlay and Eric Hutchison who also featured in the famous 1963 game when he hit the back of the net five times in the 9-7 victory.\n: : : : : : : :\nAnd finally, as this week’s column is all about the inter-county weekend, it is surely fitting to end on a high note.\nOn Sunday morning, although the match really should have taken place as a warm-up to the main Milne Cup encounter, over two dozen veterans took to the field again.\nHelped by the fact that one or two of the team are still turning out occasionally at B-team level, the blues were much fitter and faster than their opponents.\nRobert Adamson, who fills out his shirt rather better than he did 20-odd years ago, was on the scoresheet along with his former Thistle team mate Stuart Smith who netted a hat trick.\nThe others came from Delting’s Stuart Hay and the aforementioned Main, who surely merited it after Saturday’s setback, and a penalty from the oldest man in the side Bruce Williamson of Spurs.\nThe final score was a 7-1 win for Shetland, which as some wise guy put it made for an aggregate 8-6 football victory. But unfortunately not many will see it that way.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 24 ","story":"Congratulations to Delting on their hard-fought Parish Cup win on Saturday, and commiserations to Southend United who pushed them so hard.\nIt is rare enough for a local game to end 0-0, and even rarer for it to remain scoreless after extra time when tired legs can often lead to goals.\nAstonishingly, Delting’s 4-1 triumph on penalties meant they relied on the spot-kick route throughout the whole of this year’s campaign. So they certainly had plenty of practice.\nThe final, sadly, was not a match which will go down in history as one of the greatest. But there were several near moments and the posts or bar came to the rescue on at least three occasions.\nDelting goalkeeper Iain Devonald was a fitting choice for man of the match. Not just because he saved two penalties but for his all-round composure, almost faultless handling and superior distribution over his Southend counterpart.\nDevonald has been in the Shetland squad on a couple of occasions, mainly as deputy to the now departed Erik Peterson, and on Saturday’s form he could well force his way back in before too long.\nThis is the 14th time the name of Delting will be engraved on the famous trophy, and it means that you still have to go back 36 years for Southend’s solitary success.\nApologies to older readers if I’ve already bored them by recalling what happened in 1982, but it was indeed an eventful competition that year.\nThe quarter-finals saw Southend come back to draw 2-2 with Sandwick at Boddam, and the following weekend managed to win the replay 4-1 away from home.\nThe semi-final was another away tie against Delting, then an up-and-coming side. It ended in another 3-3 draw and another replay was necessary.\nAfter Delting won that one 3-2 at Boddam the challenge appeared to be over. But after the intervention of Southend manager Allison Duncan, who protested that Delting had fielded a couple of ineligible Sullom Voe Terminal workers, an emergency committee meeting was hastily convened.\nDelting were found to have infringed the rules and another replay was necessary, to be played at Boddam the night before the final, in which Whitedale had claimed a place weeks earlier. This time Southend made no mistake, winning fairly comfortably.\nAlthough it was tough ask to play two games in about 18 hours, Whitedale were not without their own problems. They had asked for the final to be postponed as they had five players either injured or on holiday, but the committee refused.\nSo on Saturday 7th August, a tired but willing Southend took to the field at Clickimin South against a slightly cheesed-off Whitedale. Both sides were definitely understrength but Whitedale were probably still favourites, having won the trophy three years earlier.\nGoals by Peter Hutchison and Barry Davies gave Southend a 2-0 lead and although Giles Roberts pulled one back a resolute defence held out against late pressure for the win.\nPlayer/manager Duncan, who was the only substitute due to injuries, brought himself on for the final couple of minutes. But he was given instructions by Ian Manson to stay out of his own penalty area. I could not repeat the actual words used.\nIt was a memorable occasion to be part of and I remember well the “speech” from captain Andrew Manson as, stripped to the waist, he received the cup from Unst stalwart Geordie Jamieson.\nBut it’s high time that Southend consigned that moment to history and secured win number two. They’d better hurry up while Leighton Flaws, one of the best players on Saturday, is still around. Roll on next year.\n: : : : : : : :\nIn professional football, meanwhile, it was revealed this week that the money generated by English Premier League clubs from gate receipts is negligible in their overall income.\nThe benefits of television revenue are such that apparently half of the 20 clubs could have played in empty stadiums and still made a pre-tax profit in the first season of the current broadcast deal.\nDuring the 2017-18 campaign the clubs benefited from over £2.4 billion, with the biggest beneficiaries gaining around £150 million each and the bottom recipients pocketing over £94 million.\nJust where this is all heading is anyone’s guess, but there is a worry that the importance of having fans coming through the turnstiles is being disregarded somewhat.\nWhile players and managers, however famous or important they may seem, come and go, the supporters are always there. Clubs must not forget that.\nOn the field at the weekend, sadly, there was nothing to suggest that Manchester City, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Tottenham Hostpur will not be contesting the top places again this season.\nIn Scotland, meanwhile, the season is a week older and already some managers are veering towards the controversial.\nFollowing Rangers’ 1-1 draw at Aberdeen, a game the Ibrox side probably deserved to win, new boss Steven Gerrard suggested that his team were “a class above” their opponents.\nIt could have just been raw emotion which promoted Gerrard’s comments, but he should perhaps be reminded of the last Rangers interviewee who displayed similar crassness.\nThat was Joey Barton, who claimed that Scott Brown of Celtic was not in his class. Remind me how long Barton lasted at the club after that comment.\nPerhaps Gerrard believes the way to succeed is to go down the same route as Celtic boss Brendan Rogers, who sometimes finds if difficult to stop talking about other teams when he should be concentrating on his own side.\nRogers was not at it on Wednesday though when Celtic crashed out of the Champions League, losing to a Greek team which they were superior to.\nThere are those who say that the Scottish champions are in stagnation, when they should have brought in new blood over the summer. That may be so, but anyone who watched the game against AEK Athens would surely agree they should have done better, even with the present squad.\n: : : : : : : :\nOne of the biggest shocks of the current cricket season has been how poor India have performed in the test series against England.\nAlthough the first match was fairly close the second was an absolute hiding – an English victory by an innings and 159 runs.\nMuch has been made of the unfairness of playing in conditions which favour the home side, and the fact that a very high percentage of victories are achieved in that way.\nUnfortunately the ridiculous schedule imposed by the governing bodies mean that this is unlikely to change. The English players themselves have experienced similar problems on the last two trips to Australia and India when they had no time to prepare and were roundly hammered.\nI’m old enough to recall when a touring side played about three matches prior to the opening test, and continued taking on county sides throughout the summer in between the internationals.\nMaybe, as has been suggested, doing away with the toss and giving the visiting team the option of bowling or fielding in every game could go some way towards levelling things up.\nThe only satisfaction I can take from England’s success this summer is that it has helped diffuse some of the arrogance from the Indian captain Virat Kohli.\nSome apologists have said that one of the reasons for Kohli’s loathesome behavour is that he is so revered in his own country. It is simply what happens to people when they are given a god-like status, they maintain.\nIn answer to that I would mention the names of Sunil Gavaskar, Kapil Dev and the greatest of them all Sachin Tendulkar. I can’t recall any of them ever surrendering their humility because of fame.

A car park, for example, would be a major benefit, although that would of course be a question for the current community council to consider.\"\nAlso there to view the proposals was local Highland councillor Muriel Cockburn, who heard that the new works would have capacity to produce up to 200,000 litres of drinking water per day, supplied by an \"abundant source of raw water from the River Spey\".\n\"It all looks like a major improvement,\" she said, as she surveyed the old treatment works \u0026ndash mere yards from the disused compound where A9 mega pylon workers had been based until a few years ago.\nConcerns have long been raised over that particular eyesore but hopes are high now that a new tenant will be moving in soon to make use of the building.\nFull details of that particular development are still awaited.\nBut if the Scottish Water team win through on schedule, their new treatment works would be installed between the two old buildings.\n\"Obviously we will have to go on using the old treatment works while we construct the new system,\" explained project manager Debbie Henderson. \"But once in place the village will have a new works to look at.\n\"It will actually include two new buildings, which will be prefabricated and delivered to the site from Ross-shire Engineering\u0027s factory in Muir of Ord.\"\nGeorge Phimister, the company\u0027s senior project manager, explained: \"The main treatment process involved passing the raw water through a series of membranes which filter out larger organic compounds while allowing clean water molecules to pass through very fine pores.\n\"The water that has passed through the membranes is then treated further to ensure that it meets customers\u0027 expectations and remains safe to drink all the way to the tap.\"\nThe system will involve new piping from bore holes to a storage tank to the north of the village.\nMr Steel explained: \"Having gathered local feedback we will consider the comments will later advise customers when we are submitting our planning application.\n\"Subject to being granted approval, we anticipate being on site in early 2019, with work continuing into 2020.\"\nThursday 30 Aug 2018 2:43 PM\n\u0026nbsp\n\u0026nbsp\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.strathspey-herald.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04117000/04117090.jpg","title":"Leader echoes call for special case funding","story":"Iain Ramage\n\u0026nbsp\nTHE Scottish Government is \"short-changing\" the Highlands, according to Scottish Liberal Democrats\u0027 leader Willie Rennie.\nHe has echoed local politicians and organisations who argue that Highland is a \"special case\" because of its vast geography.\nHe has told us that he agrees with council chiefs that the region merits a larger share of grant distributed by Holyrood.\n\"The special nature of services in this part of the country isn\u0027t recognised by the Scottish Government,\" Mr Rennie said. \"Highland is short-changed on the NHS and the way the Scottish Government tried to short-change it through council tax changes in 2016 was outrageous.\"\nA proposal was mooted, but later scrapped, for inflicting higher council tax band payers with an extra levy \u0026ndash \u0026pound5 million in Highland \u0026ndash to fund education attainment.

state of emergency \"reserve\" funds of only \u0026pound8 million, warning there were \"no more rabbits to be pulled from hats\" to solve the problem.\nPolitical rivals then locked horns in an

To put things into context, he said \u0026pound5.1 million equated to only one per cent of the total budget.\nBut he added: \"I have no more rabbits to pull out of the hat to help. We\u0026rsquove looked at a lot of the opportunities for the council and there is nothing else there, so there is no doubt there\u0026rsquos some really challenging, underlying issues that need to be addressed as part of that process.\"\nHe said a comprehensive update on the budget would be presented to next week\u0026rsquos full council meeting.\n\"It does require immediate correction to normal business,\" Mr Yule added. \"The council really needs to challenge what the money is being spent on to make sure it\u0026rsquos being used as effectively as possible.\"\nDefending the administration\u0026rsquos handling of the finances, budget leader Alister Mackinnon said a process of \"robust monitoring\" would mean a monthly update from all departments from now on.\nHe pledged transparency but conceded the current position was \"a wake-up call for all of us\".\nCllr Adam cited a \"2.7 per cent\" UK government grant cut and an \"eight per cent\" grant cut from Scottish Government.\nAnd he said the reduction was worse for Highland, not least because of the high cost of safeguarding a costly portfolio of small schools in remote areas.\nCouncil leader Margaret Davidson claimed that \"local government and the services we deliver are not a priority for the Scottish Government\".\nCllr Laird insisted the crisis was \"entirely of this council\u0026rsquos making\".\nHe accused administration members of failing to read the budget proposals early enough to understand the implications and then, realising car park charges and toilet closures were among them, \"they ran away from it\".\nCllr Mackinnon accused the SNP opposition group of failing to present alternative measures as part of the budget process and has since failed to join a debate on the issues.\nHe said he had offered meetings to group leader Maxine Smith but had been turned down \"because she views her private commitments more important than reorganising her own diary\".\nThe comment incensed SNP councillors.

There is certainly great excitement surrounding them and anticipation is high amongst both band and audience.\n“The Stirling concerts will be celebrations of our long musical journey, albeit tinged with the realisation that these are farewell appearances and so naturally emotions will be high – this is something we experienced recently at the farewell concerts in England and Europe – all spectacular events but nevertheless very moving.\n“We’ve been overwhelmed by the response to the announcement of the Stirling concerts – all the positive comments, the stories about what our music has meant to so many people, the sadness as the end approaches. But overall there will be a huge amount of love and positivity at Stirling and that’s what will carry everyone through these days ahead.\u0026#8221\nJones has been with Runrig all his adult life, having first joined the band on stage as a 17-year old at a dance in Portree’s Skye Gathering Hall in late 1977. He hopes the set list – which will be lengthy – will give a full reflection of the groups’s journey from a three -piece Scottish dance band playing island village halls to one which has sold out major venues across Scotland and Europe.\nHe said: “Compiling a set list is always a dilemma, with such a large back catalogue to choose from. Of course, there are certain songs that have to be included, otherwise we’d be lynched – but it’s also nice to pick some lesser-performed songs, possibly giving them a fresh twist.\n“Our set will be a good bit longer than usual – the problem was trying to keep the length down to sensible proportions – in essence, it will hopefully represent the band’s whole career, a celebration of our music and the unique bond with our audience.”\n century – the history of their native communities has shaped Runrig’s lyrics and songs. Jones believes that staying true to their roots – fusing them with the popular rock and pop influences they listened to in their teenage bedrooms \u0026#8211 has made sure the band’s popularity has endured through the generations.\n“We’ve been fortunate that throughout our long career we’ve continually gained new fans of all ages, at home and abroad, which has sustained us, even as fashions come and go around us,” he adds. “I guess there must be something in the lyrics, the melodies and the ethos of the band that has attracted such loyalty amongst fans, something universal that transcends our shared background in the heartland of the Highlands and connects with the wider world.”\nAuthenticity has been the hallmark of a band which can essentially still trace its origins to the three Portree streets of Fraser Crescent, Kitson Crescent, and Balmoral Road.\nThe original Run-rig dance band was founded by the Skye-raised sons of North Uist Calum and Rory MacDonald, along with Blair Douglas in 1973, and a year later the trio were joined by Donnie Munro, who became the band’s singer for more than two decades. Munro, who left in 1997 and was replaced by Canadian singer Bruce Guthro, will be on stage as a special guest this weekend.\n\nJones’ hopes for a legacy of music that people can continue to enjoy, and be inspired by, seem assured.\nHe adds: “Even though the band’s touring and performing life will have finished, I hope that people will continue to enjoy and discover our music for many years to come, perhaps giving inspiration to musicians that will follow on from us, in the knowledge that if you stick to your own path, be true to your musical roots and retain an open mind, great things may happen.”\nAs for the future – the band say it might be the end for Runrig, but it won’t mean retirement or the end of their music-making careers.\nSaid Jones: “The first thing to say is that there will be a long wind-down period – for instance we’ll film and record Stirling, so that will have to be worked on and brought to some sort of completion, plus there is the whole ongoing administration of the band archive and legacy which may lead to some interesting sideline projects.\n“Beyond that, we’ll all still be involved with our own individual performing, writing and music-making projects – that’s something you never retire from.\n“Personally, I’ll miss the band dreadfully but on the positive side I’ll spend more time on Skye plus I’ll have time to learn some new accordion tunes!”\n\n"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Campbell-Stewart-MacLennan-Co.jpg","title":"oidhche mhath runrig whfp editorial 24 8","story":"\nAn Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine\n night spoke for the Highlands.\nThe unassuming Malcolm has often been a coolly detached figure on stage, concentrating solely on his guitar.\nBut he has been playing with the Run Rig Dance and Ceilidh Band since he was 17 years old and he is now in his 60th year.

Arising out of the local experience of sectarian discrimination, the march helped to set in train a series of events that would change Irish politics forever.\nNationalists in the Six Counties had begun to explore new ways of highlighting the reality of discrimination. They had looked to Governments in Dublin for decades but found little help there. The IRA’s Resistance Campaign had ended in 1962, having failed heroically against the overwhelming military superiority of the British Army and RUC. However, the imposition of internment without trial, the banning of Sinn Féin and the use of the B Specials as a rural terror force, all exposed the violence that lay beneath the surface of the Orange state. \n which read: ‘Protestant girl required for housework. Apply to the Hon. Mrs. Terence O’Neill...’\n\nFive years after O’Neill’s accession nothing had changed. Unemployment and emigration among Catholics was far higher than among their Protestant neighbours. In County Tyrone, with a population of just over 73,000 Catholics to 60,500 Protestants, there were only 52 Catholics employed in local government as against 300 Protestants. Such discrimination was highlighted by the Campaign for Social Justice established by Patricia and Conn McCluskey in Dungannon in 1964. \nParallel with these developments, the IRA and Sinn Féin were rethinking their strategy with more emphasis to be placed on open campaigning against injustice in the North. The Wolfe Tone Society was established as a forum for debate and to circumvent the Stormont ban on the Republican Clubs, the name which, in turn, had been adopted to evade the ban on Sinn Féin. Members of the Wolfe Tone Society, the Campaign for Social Justice and others were involved in the formation of the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association  in February 1967.\nIt was direct action on the ground that propelled the nascent Civil Rights Movement onto the streets. The Brantry Republican Club in County Tyrone had campaigned for council housing to be built but when 15 houses were built in Caledon only one of them was allocated to a Catholic. The house next door was allocated to a single Protestant woman, the secretary of a unionist politician. \nLocal people decided to protest. The main organiser was Annie Mary  Gildernew, grandmother of Sinn Féin\u0027s Michelle Gildernew. Over a period of several months in 1967/68 a local family and supporters occupied a house in the Caledon estate. When they were evicted the case was raised in Stormont and began to make headlines beyond Tyrone. This was the spur for the march from Coalisland to Dungannon which received the endorsement of NICRA. \n\n\nIn a pattern that was to become all too familiar in the months ahead, Ian Paisley organised a counter-demonstration for Market Square in Dungannon. This was then used as a pretext by the RUC to ban the NICRA parade from the Square. \nAbout 2,500 took part in the NICRA march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon. The main speaker was Austin Currie MP, later a Fine Gael TD. Also speaking was Gerry Fitt, West Belfast MP. Fitt who, years later, was lifted into the House of Lords by Margaret Thatcher, declared that they would go on until they had “Civil Rights and a 32-County Republic”.\nBut the real leaders of the Civil Rights Movement which began that day were the rank and file, the ordinary people of Tyrone and beyond who marched for justice and freedom. \nThe first Civil Rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon was held on 24 August 1968, 50 years ago this week.\n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27459  ","story":"Sinn Féin spokesperson for Business, Innovation and Enterprise Maurice Quinlivan TD\n Callum Smyth\n\n“The government is currently missing its own targets when it comes to reforming the apprenticeship system.

The document reiterates Sinn Féin’s aim toabolish student contribution fees for apprentices and details how the partywill promote apprenticeship programmes as another tertiary education choice.\n Apprenticeshipis a tried and proven way for employers to develop highly skilled workers fortheir company and industry by using a mixture of coursework and practical onthe job learning.

We want to build on the success of the traditionalcraft trades in Ireland such as plumbing, bricklaying and plastering, andexpand this way of learning, into a host of new fields.\n“Apprenticeships in fields such as green energy, retail, hospitality andfinancial services are hugely popular in other European countries. We aim toexpand the system into these areas to create different opportunities for allyoung people including more females and people with disabilities.”\n Currently,most apprenticeships are aimed towards male participants with just 160 out of13,589 people in apprenticeship programmes across the state being female in2018.

The attack on the marchers was carried out in front of the news cameras, brining global attention to the civil rights campaign and the the discrimination of the unionist regime at Stormont. \n\nThis Saturday\u0027s march, organised by Sinn Féin, is the first in a series of events planned to mark the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the civil rights campaign. \nMid Ulster Sinn Féin MP, Francie Molloy, who helped organise and took part in the original parade 50 years ago, said that the campaign for rights is as relevant now as it was in 1968 and encouraged people to take part in Saturday\u0027s march. \n\"Presently, with the deliberate denial of rights, a shortage of affordable housing and the ongoing issue of constituency boundary proposals, it is clear there is still a job of work to be done,\" he said. \nWith the DUP\u0027s denial of rights to the LGB\u0026ampT community, Irish language speakers and bereaved families awaiting inquests, it is clear the campaign for rights needs to continue in the north. The onset of the Tory Brexit, backed by the DUP, also represents an attack on the rights of people in the north. \nThe main speaker at the end of the commemoration at the Square in Dungannon will be former Sinn Féin MLA Mitchel McLaughlin. \nSpeaking ahead of Saturday\u0027s march, the former Northern Assembly Speaker called for a huge turnout. \"Let\u0027s exceed those who turned out on the very first civil rights march in August 1968 and let\u0027s ensure that a very clear and committed demand is presented to the governments - the Irish government as much as the British government - to address those issues of a rights based society that are enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement,\" he said. \nThe parade will begin in Coalisland at 3pm on Saturday and make its way to Dungannon. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27461  ","story":" Michael McMonagle\n\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago. - Mitchel McLaughlin\nHundreds of people took part in a commemoration in Tyrone yesterday to mark the 50th anniversary of the first civil rights march to be held in the north. \nThe march retraced the steps of the original march from Coalisland to Dungannon and was attended by Sinn Féin representatives from across the north. \nIt was led by Mid Ulster Sinn Féin MP Francie Molloy, who took part in the original march 50 years ago as a steward. \nMarchers carried replicas of the posters carried by the original march, reading \u0027One man, one vote,\u0027 \u0027Equal housing now\u0027 as well as banners referring to the Caledon housing protest which was the motivation for the march. \nContemporary posters on the threat posed to Brexit to rights were also carried by marchers. \n\nIn 1968 the original march was stopped before it reached the Square in Dungannon by the RUC because loyalist protestors staged a counter demonstration. \nThis time, however, the march reached its destination where speeches were made by Francie Molloy, local MLA Colm Gildernew and Fermanagh/South Tyrone MP Michelle Gildernew. \nThe main speaker of the march was veteran republican and civil rights activist Mictchel McLaughlin. \nIn his speech, the former Assembly Speaker said tat much has changed in the last five decades and that we are on the verge of a major shift towards Irish unity. \n\"The Orange state is now gone and we now have a peaceful and democratic way forward. \n“This is a very different place than it was in 1968 and I am convinced that we are now on the verge of another seismic shift towards a new, agreed and united Ireland that will provide a prosperous and shared future for all our citizens,\" he said. \n\nBut Mr McLaughlin also warned that our rights are still under threat today from Brexit and the right wing alliance between the Tories and the DUP. \n“My deep concern is that there are still people who want to deny rights and equality to their fellow citizens today. \n\"People in the north still face attacks on their electoral and civil rights, alongside the continued denial of rights to LGBTQ couples, women, Irish language speakers, and bereaved families seeking a coroner’s inquest.\n“Today, we are experiencing an unacceptable blockade on rights, imposed by the DUP and facilitated by the British government.\n“Rights are also under threat by a right-wing Tory Brexit and there are unwelcome echoes of gerrymandering and the hollowing out of democracy by the recent Boundary Commission proposals.\n“The denial of rights, equality and respect is as wrong today as it was fifty years ago,\" he added. \n\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"http://www.anphoblacht.com/files/images/orig/2018/AP-New-top-main-logo.jpg","title":"27462  ","story":"Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0026#039Neill.\n Michael McMonagle\n\n“We must specifically acknowledge the damage done by the Catholic Church to the lives of many women and children in the mother and baby homes, the Magdalene Laundries and a succession of abuse scandals and cover ups.- Michelle O\u0026#039Neill\nThe visit to Ireland by Pope Francis this weekend is an opportunity for the Catholic church to address the ongoing legacy of abuse, Sinn Féin Vice President Michelle O\u0027Neill has said. \nMichelle O\u0027Neill made the comments ahead of the historic visit to Ireland of Pope Francis this weekend to attend the World Meeting of Families which is being held in Dublin.

The march was blocked by the RUC at Thomas Street from entering Dungannon’s Market Square, subsequently leading to the second Civil Rights march in Derry’s Duke Street on 5th October 1968.\n\"The first civil rights march was a major cornerstone in Irish history, the people of the north stood up and said no more will we be treated as second class citizens, shaping politics on the island of Ireland for decades,\" he said.\nOver 2,500 took part in the first civil rights march from Coalisland to Dungannon. The march was stopped short of Market Square by an RUC cordon.\nThis would evidently change politics here forever - this was very much a campaign organised by people, from all backgrounds and none. \nProminent republicans were also central to the organisation of demonstrations, including the now Mid Ulster MP, Francie Molloy and the late Stan Corrigan.\nReflecting on the first civil rights march, 50 years on, Colm Gildernew said the first civil rights march should act as a rallying cry to those of us who seek to promote rights, equality and respect for all in society today.\n\"We are currently experiencing an unacceptable blockade on a swathe of rights-based issues by the DUP, including Irish language, marriage equality, women’s health, and legacy rights.  \n\"There are huge concerns arising from Brexit and the recent Boundary Commission proposals, seen by many as a new attempt to gerrymander the north.

They were on active service and at Drumnakilly, close to their homes, they were ambushed and shot dead by a unit of the British Army’s SAS regiment. The Volunteers were brothers Gerard and Martin Harte and Brian Mullin.\nThe SAS killings brought to an end a month which had been one of the most intense and tragic of the war in Ireland. It began on 1 August with the IRA bombing of Inglis Barracks in London, close to Margaret Thatcher’s Finchley constituency. It was the first IRA attack in England since the bombing of the Grand Hotel in Brighton during the Tory Party conference four years earlier. A British solider was killed in the Inglis Barracks blast. In the following days, the IRA killed three British soldiers and an RUC detective in the North. \n\nOn 8 August, two young nationalist men were murdered by a loyalist death squad in Belfast. There were two more such sectarian killings of young nationalist men in Belfast, on 17 and 18 August. On 20 August, eight British soldiers were killed at Ballygawley, County Tyrone, when the IRA bombed a bus carrying members of the Light Infantry Regiment returning from England. On 31 August, two civilians were killed in Derry after they triggered an IRA booby-trap bomb intended for British forces. \nPolitically this period was dominated by the issue of extradition and, on 27 August, Robert Russell, one of the IRA prisoners who broke out of the H-Blocks in the mass escape of 1983, was handed across the border to the RUC. This was despite widespread protests, including public dissent from within Fianna Fáil.\nIt was on the Long Bog Road at Drumnakilly, four miles outside Omagh, that the three IRA Volunteers met their deaths.\nAt 4pm on 30 August, they were ambushed by British forces who poured a hail of bullets into their car. The RUC and British Army immediately sealed off the area and the bodies of the three men were left at the scene, within the cordon and inaccessible to grieving relatives, until the following afternoon. \n\nGerard Harte  was the eldest of the three Volunteers and was an experienced IRA activist. With his brother, Martin, he was a prominent member of the Loughmacrory St Theresa’s GAA Club, where he organised youth teams. \nMartin Harte was just 21 but had been in the IRA for four years at the time of his death. A talented football player, he had captained the Loughmacrory team. He was the father of a three-month-old son and, to compound the tragedy, his widow was Briege Mullin, sister of his friend and comrade Brian Mullin. \nVolunteer Brian Mullin  had been singled out for particular harassment by British forces. He was arrested and interrogated in Gough Barrack on numerous occasions and a few weeks before his death he and his brothers were beaten by crown forces outside their family home.\n\n\nHundreds of British soldiers and RUC members saturated the Tyrone countryside as the three Volunteers were laid to rest. Speaking at the graveside of the Harte brothers, Sinn Féin President Gerry Adams said the Volunteers were “good, decent, patriotic freedom fighters driven to fight for justice”. \nVolunteers Brian Mullin, Gerard Harte and Martin Harte were killed on 30 August 1988, 30 years ago this week.\n\ntest\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.ballymenatimes.com/webimage/1.8615735.1535446354!/image/image.jpg","title":"continuing success at cambridge house","story":"\nFollowing on from the superb set of A Level results as recorded last week, with pupils gaining 87% in three A*-C grades, Cambridge House Grammar School pupils continue this success with a consistent increase in their GCSE grades.\n\n                \nNinety per cent of pupils achieved seven or more A*-C grades, while 96 per cent achieved five A*-C grades.

This is the most common form of food poisoning in the UK. \n  \nWe have heavily invested in research throughout the production chain and we have already implemented new ideas such as hot water heating, double barrier changing facilities in each house and other technologies which we firmly believe have had a major impact in reducing the number of our birds which can become infected with Campylobacter. \n  \nFurthermore, we are focusing on excellence in biosecurity and innovative processing technologies.\n  \n\n  \nOngoing challenges\n  \n\n  \nControlling infectious disease in poultry is an ongoing challenge Moy Park face, in particular avian influenza . To address this, they have upgraded their AI contingency planning, rewriting the rulebook in the past year to ensure they have a robust plan in place.\n  \nWe have to think carefully how we would react and prevent spread if AI came in to Northern Ireland and together with agencies and Government departments we exchange views regularly with working groups, in order to remain on top of this key issue, Peter said.\n  \n\n  \nCareer Highlight\n  \n\n  \nOver his 40 years with the company Peter said a key highlight has been promoting ownership and pride with the people he works closely with.\n  \nA back to basics approach is one of my fundamental pillars, and I still firmly believe that bird husbandry and welfare are key to producing a high-quality product.\n  \nThere are endless opportunities for those considering a career in agriculture and food production, and as my wife and son also work in the poultry industry, I can definitely vouch for that!\n  \nAs the world population continues to expand, the demand for goods also increases and food production, and those working in the industry, will have to keep up with this development.\n  \nBy strengthening our production capabilities over the past number of years, we are well placed to meet this demand, with poultry a healthy and versatile source of protein which is also good value for money.\n  \n\n  \nPositive outlook\n  \n\n  \nPeter concluded: As I look back on my time in the industry and at Moy Park, I’ve always started each morning the same way, and I think it has stood me in good stead!\n  \nThe first thing I think of is ‘today will bring a new challenge, a new opportunity and I will most likely learn something new’ as every day is a school day!”\n \n                  \n    \n          \n"},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_995387.jpg--.jpg?1535635242000\n","title":"superb gcse results for dunclug college","story":"  \nDUNCLUG College is celebrating historic levels of achievement at GCSE level. \n  \nAll students, including those with ious learning challenges sat a minimum of 7 GCSE subjects, including the compulsory core of English, Maths and Science and a range of GCSE optional choices in a balance of General and Applied courses.\n  \n Many gifted and competitive students sat 8, 9 or 10 subjects.

Universal Credit is definitely a part of that, I am in no doubt about that. We have been dealing with people who have said that they are in need of help because of Universal Credit. \nThe figures cover the six month period May to October 2017 and the period January to May 2018 with an average of 30 vouchers a month dealt with in the first period, jumping to 38 in the second.\nPeter acknowledges that these figures are from quite a small area over a limited time \u0027but something must have triggered it.\u0027 He said:There is an unmistakable trend, more people are needing help after Universal Credit. It\u0027s eight more families who need our help every month in a small town like Ballymoney.\nThe Trussell Trust, which compiles UK wide Foodbank figures, say that increases of over 50% are common in areas where UC has been rolled out for a year or more.\nThe Chronicle asked the Department of Communities, who rolled out UC, to comment on the issues raised, with a spokesperson saying:

by-election opens this Wednesday at three venues across North Antrim, including the Joey Dunlop Leisure Centre in Ballymoney.\nAccording to the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland  75,478 North Antrim voters are entitled to sign the Petition in respect of Mr Paisley, recently suspended from the House of Commons, with 10% of those or 7,547 signatures needed to force a by-election.\nUUP Leader Robin Swann and Dunloy Sinn Fein MLA Philip McGuigan have both expressed disappointment at the EONI decision to open only three centres with limited opening hours, instead of a possible 10.\n\n\nINADEQUATE\n\n\nBoth MLA\u0027s as well as TUV leader Jim Allister have said will be signing the petition.\nExpressing disappointment, Mr Swann said three petition centres was totally inadequate for a constituency the size of North Antrim, and by restricting the opening hours, the EONI has shown little regard to people in daytime employment,\n\nSUBVERTED\n\n\nMr McGuigan agreed that the EONI decision on venues was extremely disappointing, and simply not good enough.\nHe continued that people\u0027s ability to reject the disgraceful behaviour of Ian Paisley was greatly reduced by this decision after he had accepted lavish family holidays from the Sri Lankan government and lobbyied against a UN resolution about\u0026#160 human rights abuses by the Sri Lankan authorities.\nHe said the UUP would not register as campaigner during the recall petition, but would encourage any North Antrim electors who think what Ian Paisley did was wrong to sign the petition\n

The Skoda man felt the format incurred unnecessary expense in terms of fuel costs.\n\u0026#8220The fuel isn\u0027t cheap and the cars run on it whether you are driving a stage or the road sections, said Bogie.

The judges had an almost impossible decision narrowing the entries down to just three finalists who all showed technical ability combined with creative flair and imagination. The finalists were then featured on the Tayto Northern Ireland facebook page with more than 2000 people voting for their favourite.\n\n“All three finalists should be very proud of what they have achieved and they have certainly made a lasting impact on the catwalk and attracted huge interest from those attending – it’s hard to believe that these are made from material more commonly seen on the production lines at Tayto Castle.\n\n“We would like to thank everyone who took the time to vote and for the many shares which helped to bring our students’ work to a wide audience.”\n\n                            \n            \n            \n\n                            \n            \n            \n\nTayto crisps have been made at Tayto Castle, Co Armagh, since 1956 when Thomas Hutchinson spotted a gap in the market to make tasty potato snacks.

championships","story":"\n\nTHE Antrim\n GAA Club Championships clicked into gear at the weekend with a mixed bag of results for city teams.\nIn the Bathshack Antrim Senior Hurling Championship, St John’s booked their place in Group Two alongside Rossa and Loughgiel as they defeated Ballycastle 2-21 to 2-13at Corrigan Park in their second leg tie to win 59-37 on aggregate.\nThe Johnnies wasted no time in adding to their 14-point pre-game lead when Michael Bradley cracked home an early goal and while Kevin Barry McShane responded in kind for The Town, a Conor Johnston goal from a penalty gave the Whiterock side a 2-11 to 1-10 half-time lead.\nIt was plain sailing for the hosts in the second period with Johnston and Mícéal Dudley clipping over the scores and while Dermott McShane goaled for Ballycastle, this tie has long been settled.\nSt John’s will enter Group Two where the first game took place on Saturday lunchtime with Loughgiel romping to a 6-22 to 0-7 win over a badley depleted Rossa.\nShamrocks had this game decided by the break with Tiernan Coyle scrambling home their first goal on 13 minutes, while team captain, Shay Casey bagged two more before the interval to establish a 3-12 to 0-3 lead – Rossa’s scores coming from Stephen Beatty and Tiernan Murphy .\nThere was no let-up from Loughgiel in the second half as they emptied their bench.\nSian McGrath lobbed Danny Murray for goal number four on 51 minutes, while Dan McCloskey found the net twice more in the closing stages to complete the rout.\nIn Group One on Saturday evening, defending champions, Dunloy travelled to Cushendall and edged home by a point, 0-18 to 0-17.\n\nIntermediate Hurling Championship\nIn the Intermediate Hurling Championship, St Gall’s withstood three red cards to overcome Gort na Móna 4-10 to 2-11 on Sunday afternoon.\nMark Napier and Tomás O Cíarán hit first-half goals for St Gall’s before Conor Burke saw red, while Dessie McClean kept the Gorts in touch with a goal from a free to leave it 2-7 to 1-4 at the half.\nCJ McGourty and Jackson McGreevy plundered a further two St Gall’s goals early in the second half, but McGreevy and then Napier were both send off to leave them with a major disadvantage,\nHowever, Gort na Móna couldn’t take advantage with Darren Boyd’s goal with 10 to play ultimately proving mere consolation.\nEarlier in the day at Creggan, a badly depleted Lámh Dhearg were on the receiving end of a 3-21 o 0-1 defeat to Glenariffe.\nJohn Boyd hit the Red Hands’ only point of the game in the first half, but Glenariffe registered 2-11 in the opening period – Alex O’Boyle with their two goals.\nThere was no let-up from Oisin’s after the break as they piled on the scores and O’Boyle completed his hat-trick of goals to run out convincing winners.\n\nJunior Football Championship\nIn the Junior Football Championship on Friday, last year’s beaten finalists, St Patrick’s, Lisbirn eased to a 3-13 to 0-3 over Éire Óg at the Cricky.\nThe Lisburn men were well on top and were 0-9 to 0-1 ahead at the break with Eoin Fay, Shane McEvoy and Josh McMullan catching the eye.\nMcMullan fisted home a goal early in the second period with Denver Taggart adding a second, while Cathal McMeel stroked home a penalty as Éire Óg crashed out.\nAt Woodlands, Pearse’s overcame newcomers, Laochra Loch Lao 3-18 to 1-3.\nThe North Belfast men asserted themselves from the start with goals from Conaill Campbell and Daniel Magee and while Feargal Mac Ionnrachtaigh netter just before the break, Pearse’s still held a healthy 2-9 to 1-2 lead.\nThe New Lodge men kept driving forward in the second half and a third goal arrived from Liam Deegan from the penalty spot to wrap up their victory and place in the last eight.\n"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"passengers can use glider from today","story":"\nMEMBERS of the public will be able to travel on-board the Glider vehicles during the last days of testing before the service goes live on Monday. \n\nShadow running will see both Glider and  vehicles operating along the Glider routes for three days. Glider services are on schedule to launch on Monday 3 September on cross-city routes between West and East Belfast  and the city centre to the Titanic Quarter .\n\nWith Monday being the day the schools go back after the summer holidays – which always leads to an increase in traffic – many drivers are bracing themselves for delays along the main arterial routes in West Belast.\n\nRobin Totten, Translink’s Glider Senior Project Manager said they are entering the final phase of testing which will see most of the infrastructure, vehicles and off-board ticketing systems tested by their passengers before they go live on Monday. \n\n“During this final week of testing, passengers travelling on the East – West route will be able to travel on Glider on Thursday 30th August with a valid ticket or Smartcard,” he explained.\n\n“ services will continue to run the scheduled timetable, with Glider ‘shadow running’ more infrequently along the route, calling at Glider halts. \n\n“Glider services during these three days will operate half-hourly from approximately 7am to 7pm. Passengers who have a valid ticket or validated Smartcard will be able to use either  or Glider, if waiting at one of the new Glider halts.\n\n“We have trained around 60 helpers from Volunteer Now, who will assist Translink staff at halts during this final phase to support passengers to get familiar with the exciting new service and ticketing system.  The volunteers will also be in place for the initial introduction of the service to boost passenger confidence and ensure a smooth transition to the new Glider service.\n\n“We have also completed over 150 public information and engagement events along the Glider routes, meeting many community groups, disability groups, businesses and local stakeholders to show them how to use the new services and ticketing, this will now be the an opportunity to try the service for themselves.\n\n‘‘We are delighted that communities and stakeholders right across the city see Glider as a positive development, and are enthusiastic about the introduction of this iconic new service and the benefits it will bring for the city.\n\nTranslink have also published ‘how to use’ guides and short videos on You Tube to help direct and make the service easy to use for passengers.

Water from the River Lagan was used to douse the flames.\n\nMr Jennings described the conditions facing firefighters as \"very difficult\" with \"extreme\" temperatures.\n\n\"On a number of occasions we had to withdraw fire crews from the concrete stairs due to the collapses inside the building causing heat,\" he said.\n\n\"This has been very much a team effort, not just with fire crew but all agencies.\"\n\nFirefighters are continuing to deal with hot spots and areas of rubble, stock and timber burning under the collapsed structures.\n\nNIFRS said that the exterior of the building \"remains structurally intact\" but that it was working with engineers to \"determine the structural integrity and safety of the building\".\n\nDescribing the incident as \"ongoing\", it added that operations were \"expected to be scaled back to three fire appliances\" last night. \n\n\"There continue to be small pockets of fire within the building and a 45-metre exclusion zone remains in place,\" NIFRS added.\n\n\"There has been structural collapse within the building today.\n\n\"The exterior of the building remains structurally intact. \n\n\"We are continuing to work closely with engineers from Belfast City Council to determine the structural integrity and safety of the building. Once this has been completed a fire investigation will commence into the cause.\n\n\"In conjunction with our partners in Belfast City Council and the PSNI we have been facilitating escorted access for business owners in the local area who are affected by the incident to enable them to access and secure their properties.\"\n\nNIFRS confirmed that the building had a sprinkler system, but added that \"fire investigation will determine if the sprinkler system was activated and whether this would have had any impact on such an aggressive fire\".\n\nIt added: \"Building regulations define whether commercial premises are required to have a sprinkler system fitted. This is determined by the premises type and the size of the floor or compartment area.\"\n\nThe USDAW union, which represents Primark workers, said it had met the company yesterday.\n\nIt confirmed that all staff will be paid up until the end of the week.\n\nUnion area organiser Michala Lafferty said that further discussions will take place over the next few days to agree what happens next.\n\nShe said: \"Our members are extremely distressed and concerned as they now enter a period of uncertainty.\n\n\"The company has reassured me that the welfare and job security of the staff is their priority.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"former kincora boys home building on market for","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We also sub-let offices to a range of tenants.\n\n\"In over 20 years, we had only one visitor who called and was fully aware of the history of the building as a boys\u0027 home.\n\n\"After 2010 we formulated plans to refurbish the building. \n\n\"However, in April 2015 these plans were thrown into the air by statements made by Mr Peter Robinson, then First Minister, calling for the building to be \u0027razed\u0027 more than 40 years after its period of notoriety.\"\n\nMr Black said that a series of protests followed and the new focus on the building led him to decide to put the redevelopment plans on hold.\n\n\"We no longer consider that retention of the existing building with the planned development is commercially attractive due to its history having been thrust back into the public eye.\n\n\"Consequently, we have decided to apply for planning permission for 12 apartments on the site and gauge interest from developers.\"\n\nNews of the sale came on the same day a law firm said Kincora should form part of official efforts to address the legacy of the Northern Ireland troubled past.\n\nKRW Law represents Richard Kerr, who alleges he was abused by \"very powerful people\" with links to Kincora and does not accept the conclusions of the four-year Historical Institutional Abuse  inquiry.\n\nThe inquiry dismissed claims that senior politicians, civil servants and businessmen were complicit in a paedophile ring that operated at the home in the 1970s and for which three staff members were jailed. \n\nPublishing the HIA findings in January, inquiry chairman Sir Anthony Hart said of Kincora: \"It was not a homosexual brothel, nor was it used by any of the security agencies as a honey pot to entrap, blackmail or otherwise exploit homosexuals.\"\n\nThe retired judge added: \"It is now time to finally lay these unfounded myths to rest.\"\n\nBut a statement from KRW said: \"On his  behalf, KRW is considering issuing legal proceedings over failings in the Kincora investigation by way of a judicial review.\n\n\"In addition to proposed legal proceedings, KRW will argue that the Kincora scandal must be considered as part of the legacy of the conflict.\"\n\nThe 2,299 sq ft property is listed by Frazer Kidd estate agents.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts delays in belfast centre after primark blaze","story":"\n Hi

Here we look at what the restrictions will mean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n– What is being banned?\n\n\nDrinks with more than 150mg of caffeine per litre, like Red Bull, Monster, and Relentless, will be affected.                    \n\nOne regular 250ml can of energy drink contains around 80mg of caffeine – equivalent to almost three cans of cola.\n\nMany popular energy drinks now come in 500ml cans.\n\nSales will be restricted to either over-16s or over-18s, depending on consultation responses.\n\n\n– What are the concerns?\n\n\nThere are fears children’s health and education are being harmed, with the drinks linked to behavioural issues and poor classroom discipline.\n\nMany also have very high amounts of sugar, contributing to tooth decay and obesity.\n\nStudies have shown regularly consuming large quantities of caffeine can result in increased blood pressure, sleep disturbances, headaches and stomachaches.\n\nCampaigners have also criticised how much children can get their hands on with just pocket money, with four cans of generic 250ml energy drink available for as little as £1.\n\n\n– Why is it relevant to Britain?\n\n\nBritish children consume energy drinks way above the European average, contributing to emotional difficulties and tiredness, public health minister Steve Brine has said.\n\nNearly 70% of UK children aged 10 to 17 years old consume energy drinks, according to the Government’s childhood obesity plan.\n\nAnd those who do so are drinking on average 50% more than the EU average for that age group.\n\nJenny Oldroyd, deputy director for obesity, food and nutrition at the Department of Health and Social Care, has previously warned: “Around a quarter of adolescents are consuming more than three energy drinks in one sitting, so it’s that high level of consumption that concerns us.”\n\n\n– Why has the issue gained prominence?\n\n\nA boom in the energy drinks market, high-profile calls from figures such as TV chef Jamie Oliver, and the relatively low cost of some types compared with general soft drinks.\n\nWhile many major retailers already do not sell to under-16s, just 21% of the UK grocery market, including corner shops, are signed up to voluntary restrictions, No 10 said.\n\nUK energy drink sales jumped by around one-fifth  between 2012 and 2017, with total sales estimated at £1.65 billion last year, according to analysis from market researchers Mintel.\n\nA further 10% growth for the energy drinks market is expected for 2017-22, it added.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"revealed how much dentists earn in northern

It should be closed down.\" \n\nIt comes ahead of the resumption next week of the public consultation into the failure of the botched green energy scheme, when former enterprise minister Jonathan Bell will appear before the body.\n\nDubbed the \u0027Cash for Ash\u0027, the controversial scheme saw participants receive more money in payments than they paid out for fuel.\n\nEntry into the scheme was ended after the scandal broke, but public money has been committed to ensure those already signed up to the scheme will continue to receive lucrative payments for the next two decades.\n\nThursday\u0027s statement from Sinn Fein comes ahead of the end of a consultation on the future of the scheme, which has ran since June and is set to end on September 6.\n\nAs part of it the public has been asked to respond to a number of questions, including about their support for voluntary or compulsory buy-outs of the scheme.\n\n\n\n\nArlene Foster tells RHI inquiry \u0027I didn\u0027t do anything wrong\u0027 - how ex-minister\u0027s first appearance unfolded\n\n\n\n\nThe testimony in front of the public inquiry from Jonathan Bell has been long-anticipated due to his former role as minister for enterprise, and a controversial interview he gave to BBC\u0027s Nolan Show in December 2016 in which he said he would tell the truth about the scheme and alleged DUP advisers had delayed his plans to close the scheme.\n\nFollowing his appearance he was suspended from the party for speaking to the press without permission.\n\nArlene Foster is also set to appear before the inquiry again in the coming weeks.\n\nDuring her first appearance before the inquiry in April, Mrs Foster - who was enterprise minister at the time the scheme was launched - denied wrongdoing and defended her role.\n\nThe RHI scheme was the catalyst for the collapse of the Stormont Executive in January 2017, after the resignation of former First Minister Martin McGuinness.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"small number of northern ireland women referred for further investigation following cervical smear recall","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Those who haven\u0027t had a repeat test have either chosen not to take up the offer, or have an identified reason for why a test is not appropriate for them at this time.\n\n\"As expected, the majority of results of the repeat tests have been reported as normal.  A very small number of women have been referred to colposcopy for further investigation. \n\n\"The PHA and HSCB are unable to release specific numbers or further details to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.”\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry dragon to run for irish president but wont take a salary if he wins","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

Mr Casey promised not to accept any of the €1.7m salary which the president will be entitled to between 2018 and 2025. He described the salary as \"bonkers\". \n\n\"It\u0027s almost the same as the US president. It\u0027s much more than the Taoiseach who does the heavy lifting. It\u0027s just wrong. I wouldn\u0027t take any,\" he said. \n\nMr Higgins is entitled to a salary of €325,000 but has gifted 23% of this back to the State each year, bringing his annual income down to €249,000. \n\nThe father of five adult children accepts that he is best-known for his stint on reality TV - but would \"hate to think that you are eliminated from standing for office just because you were on a TV show\". \n\nHe is the third \u0027Dragon\u0027 to challenge Mr Higgins, following in the footsteps of Sean Gallagher and Gavin Duffy. \n\nThe Derry native who founded recruitment firm Claddagh Resources now lives in Atlanta. However, he recently signed over his company interest to his son and sold his American home ahead of a permanent move back to Ireland. \n\nHis campaign will be largely based around trying to harness the strength of Ireland\u0027s diaspora. He wants to replicate the \u0027Birthright Israel\u0027 programme which allows the children of ex-pats to travel to Israel on sponsored heritage trips. \n\nAsked why he believes he would do a better job than Mr Higgins, he replied: \"He certainly hasn\u0027t embarrassed the presidency.

very important role, which has been performed in exemplary fashion by our current president who I hope is reelected,” he said.\n\n“It is a matter for the people to decide in October, but I look

RHI should not continue in any form after March 2019 because it is not effective in reducing carbon emissions. \n#RHI\n \npic.twitter/ChZcoM9fC0\n\n— Sinn Féin  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nAn ensuing political row saw Sinn Fein apportion blame to the DUP, whose leader Arlene Foster was minister at the former Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment when the scheme was introduced to Northern Ireland.\n\nFormer deputy first minister Martin McGuinness resigned from his position in January 2017, effectively collapsing the Northern Ireland Assembly, in protest at the DUP’s “handling” of the scheme.\n\nHow the scheme went so wrong is currently being examined by an independent inquiry.\n\nThe RHI scheme continues to run with more cost controls.\n\nThe Department for the Economy ran a public consultation in June over the long-term future of the RHI scheme.\n\nBut Sinn Fein says in its response to the consultation that the RHI scheme should not continue in any form, arguing it is not effective in reducing carbon emissions.\n\nAppearing at a press conference at Stormont on Thursday, Mr Murphy, flanked by party colleagues Mairtin O Muilleoir and Caoimhe Archibald, said they believe even with more cost controls, the scheme remains vulnerable to abuse.\n\n\nSinn Féin’s Conor Murphy says the continuation of the RHI scheme can no longer be justified and says it should be closed down \n#RHI\n \n#Stormont\n \npic.twitter/VMelLk3xLl\n\n— Rebecca Black  \nAugust 30, 2018\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy said the funding for the RHI scheme should be redirected into another scheme that would be more effective in cutting carbon emissions.\n\n“RHI is not a good scheme that went wrong, it was a bad scheme that was made even worse,” Mr Murphy said.\n\n“We are now aware that before the RHI scheme was set up, a report commissioned by the department showed that compared to an alternative scheme, this scheme was less effective in reducing carbon emissions and nearly £200 million more expensive.\n\n“Despite this evidence the minister then responsible, Arlene Foster, opted for the less effective, more expensive option of RHI.\n\n“The original error of establishing RHI was then compounded by incompetent design.”\n\n\n\nThe RHI scheme is fundamentally flawed and should be closed down\nSinn Fein MLA Conor Murphy\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\nMr Murphy said his party believes if continued there is a risk that the scheme could be abused in the future, and says it should be shut down.\n\n“Spending more public money on a scheme that is at best ineffective, and at worst counter productive to the goal of carbon reduction, cannot in our view be justified,” he said.\n\n“The RHI scheme is fundamentally flawed and should be closed down.\n\n“The money saved from RHI should be invested in a new scheme that is actually effective at reducing carbon emissions and tackling climate change which was the original intention of this sorry episode.”\n\nThe RHI inquiry remains ongoing at Stormont.\n\nIt was ordered by then finance minister Mairtin O Muilleoir in January 2017.\n\nThat came over a week after the resignation of Mr McGuinness, leading some to accuse Sinn Fein of flip-flopping on whether RHI should be subject to a full public inquiry or an independent investigation.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday, Mr Murphy said there are indications the inquiry is likely to hear more explosive evidence over the next few weeks.\n\nWhen asked when Stormont might resume, Mr Murphy said his party intends to have ministers in place by next April 1, the start of the new financial year.\n\n“Our intention is to have ministers in place by April 1, our intention is not to sit back here and allow the timetable of drift to be dictated by the British Government and the DUP in terms of their own Brexit interests,” he said.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"alex salmond resigns snp membership all you need to know","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC |

Party leader from 1990 to 2000 and again from 2004 to 2014, he stood down following the independence referendum. Mr Salmond first joined the SNP 45 years ago and represented Banff and Buchan at Westminster and Holyrood and was MSP for Gordon and Aberdeenshire East.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why has he quit the SNP?\n\n\nMr Salmond resigned his membership of the SNP after it emerged he faces allegations of sexual harassment.\n\nHe strongly denies the claims and said he was giving up his membership to avoid potential divisions within the party.\n\nHe is taking court action against the Scottish Government to contest the complaints process activated against him.\n\n\n\nI hope I have done the party and the broader cause of independence some service.\nAlex Salmond\u0027s statement on resignation\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the allegations?\n\n\nThe allegations about Mr Salmond’s conduct towards two staff members in 2013, while he was in office, emerged last week.\n\nTwo complaints, fiercely denied by Mr Salmond, were raised in January against him and he was informed of an investigation in March.\n\nPolice Scotland confirmed on Friday that the complaints had been passed to the force.\n\n\n\n\n\" width=\"620\" height=\"\" rel=\"nofollow\" /\n\n\nNicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond had worked closely for decades \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has the Scottish Government said?\n\n\nLeslie Evans, Scottish Government permanent secretary, said it would defend its position “vigorously”.\n\nMs Evans added: “I note that the former first minister has indicated his intention to challenge the actions taken by the Scottish Government. His statement contains significant inaccuracies which will be addressed in those court proceedings.”\n\n\n\nComplaints must be investigated without fear or favour, regardless of the seniority of the person involved.\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat has the SNP said?\n\n\nLeader Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s First Minister, said it had been an “incredibly difficult” few days for the party.\n\nMr Salmond had been her mentor for three decades and Ms Sturgeon said she felt “huge sadness” about the situation.\n\nShe also reiterated her stance that the two complaints received by the Scottish Government could not be ignored.\n\n\n\npic.twitter/XSlZmDTDen\n\n— Rhoda Grant  \nAugust 29, 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat have political rivals said?\n\n\nOpposition parties have attacked Mr Salmond’s use of a crowd-funding campaign to help with his costs in a legal action against the Scottish Government.\n\nThe Scottish Conservatives said it was “astonishing”, while Scottish Labour’s Rhoda Grant MSP, said it was “unbelievable” that he would use his power in such a way.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"12 everyday things that might as well be classified as","story":"\n Hi \n\n\u0026degC | Lo \n\n\u0026degC \n | WEATHER\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlone\n\n\n\nBray\n\n\n\nCork\n\n\n\nDrogheda\n\n\n\nDundalk\n\n\n\n\n\nGalway\n\n\n\nKilkenny\n\n\n\nLimerick\n\n\n\nNavan\n\n\n\nWaterford\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHome\n\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nUK\n\n\n\nRepublic of Ireland\n\n\n\nWorld\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nPolitics\n\n\n\nWest Tyrone By-Election 2018\n\n\n\nGeneral Election 2017\n\n\n\nNI Assembly Election 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nSunday Life\n\n\n\nEducation\n\n\n\nLittle Reporters\n\n\n\n\n\nGraduations\n\n\n\nGood Friday Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\nSport\n\n\n\nFootball\n\n\n\nPremier League\n\n\n\nIrish League\n\n\n\nScottish\n\n\n\nInternational\n\n\n\nFA and League Cups\n\n\n\n\n\nRugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby\n\n\n\nUlster Rugby Round Up podcasts\n\n\n\nPRO14\n\n\n\nSix Nations\n\n\n\nEuropean Champions Cup\n\n\n\nSchools Cup\n\n\n\n\n\nGAA\n\n\n\nAntrim\n\n\n\nArmagh\n\n\n\nCavan\n\n\n\nDerry\n\n\n\nDonegal\n\n\n\nDown\n\n\n\nFermanagh\n\n\n\nMonaghan\n\n\n\nTyrone\n\n\n\n\n\nGolf\n\n\n\nMotorcycling\n\n\n\nMotor Sport\n\n\n\nOther Sports\n\n\n\nBelfast Giants\n\n\n\nBoxing\n\n\n\nTennis\n\n\n\nCricket\n\n\n\nCycling\n\n\n\nHorse Racing\n\n\n\nHockey\n\n\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nPaul Lindsay\n\n\n\nDeclan Bogue\n\n\n\nBilly on the box\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness\n\n\n\nNorthern Ireland\n\n\n\nCommercial Property\n\n\n\nMoney\n\n\n\nCyber Security\n\n\n\n\n\nUK \u0026 World\n\n\n\nBrexit\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nJobs\n\n\n\nFood, Drink and Hospitality\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nHelp and Advice\n\n\n\n\n\nTop 100 Companies\n\n\n\nBusiness Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nEntertainment\n\n\n\nHoroscopes\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\nFilm and TV\n\n\n\nMusic and Gigs\n\n\n\nTheatre and Arts\n\n\n\nBelfast Festival\n\n\n\nTop 100 Hospitality\n\n\n\n\n\nLife\n\n\n\nFashion \u0026 beauty\n\n\n\nHealth\n\n\n\nHouse and Home\n\n\n\nProperty Awards\n\n\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink\n\n\n\nRecipes\n\n\n\nRestaurant Reviews\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Magazine\n\n\n\nFood \u0026 Drink Awards Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures\n\n\n\nBooks\n\n\n\nRunning\n\n\n\nFamily Life\n\n\n\nJune 2018\n\n\n\nFebruary 2018\n\n\n\nMay 2017\n\n\n\nApril 2016\n\n\n\nFebruary 2016\n\n\n\nDecember 2016\n\n\n\nSeptember 2016\n\n\n\n\n\n11 Great Summer Walks\n\n\n\n\n\nCars\n\n\n\nOpinion\n\n\n\nNews Analysis\n\n\n\nEditor\u0027s Viewpoint\n\n\n\nColumnists\n\n\n\nAlf McCreary\n\n\n\nFionola Meredith\n\n\n\nGail Walker\n\n\n\nLindy McDowell\n\n\n\nMary Kenny\n\n\n\nNelson McCausland\n\n\n\nRuth Dudley Edwards\n\n\n\nSuzanne Breen\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTravel\n\n\n\nHoliday Guide\n\n\n\n2018 Travel Guide\n\n\n\nYour Hotel \u0026 Tour Guide\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n\nArchive\n\n\n\nEvents\n\n\n\nSpirit of N.

We are super excited about the new arrival and hope the new family member will be as quick as Bertie.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new baby tortoise is currently in the capable hands of the animal team and on show to the public in Creature Corner. \n\nIf it has anything like the pace of its father, they’ll do well to keep a close eye on it.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"appreciated im not 100 per cent sure hopefully derry city chairman philip odoherty speaks recent criticism magee university","story":"\nBy Gary Ferry\n\n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\nHE provides almost a thousand jobs locally and has saved Derry City Football Club on two occasions, but for some, Philip O’Doherty is still not exempt from criticism.\n\nRecent reports to Derry City FC’s shareholders have revealed that the club’s Chairman has contributed £300,000 of his own money on an annual basis, just to keep the club afloat.\n\nOn top of that, he has built E\u0026ampI Engineering to a stature that it is respected across the world, a real jewel in the Irish landscape that sits in Burnfoot.\n\nIn its 32nd year in operation, E\u0026ampI is still growing, with a new extension set to be completed on site by the end of October. \n\nThat will bring yet more jobs to the local economy, north and south of the border, news of which will be lauded by Taoiseach Leo Varadkar when he visits E\u0026ampI on September 11. \n\nSo when an angry Derry City fan accosts him whilst doing his shopping in Sainsburys, or when he is socialising with friends, what is his response?\n\n“The first question I usually ask them is ‘Are you a season ticket holder or do you go to the matches?’ If the answer is no then there is no point in me talking to them,” he states. \n\n“Why are they criticising if they don’t go to the matches and pay their money? If they do pay their money then I will have the conversation with them. \n\n“Usually it’s when results are bad. I feel exactly the same as they do. It does get a bit personal sometimes. We went through a few managers there and I did get a bit of stick about that.”\n\nO’Doherty is crazy busy, admitting himself that he spends 70 per cent of his time travelling across the world to meet customers personally. For him the personal touch is vital when it comes to meeting customers and establishing relationships. \n\nFor that reason he is a hard man to nail down, but he is not afraid to raise his head above the parapet, as he did during the recent controversy over the pricing of Europa League tickets at the Brandywell. \n\nBut with 840 families in Derry, 400 in South Carolina and 320 in Dubai relying on his ability to grow his business, there are more important issues on his mind day to day. \n\n“I would never let Derry City get in the way of that because too many families depend on me here to pay mortgages and car payments and stuff like that,” he continued. \n\n“I’ve always made it clear to the board that I’m not going to available. The big concern I do have is that I am away so much, probably 70 per cent of the time I’m out of Derry – is that reasonable for a chairman? I don’t know, but that’s the way it is at the minute. \n\n“When things are going well it’s an easy job but when things aren’t going well, it’s a difficult job.”\n\n\nResponsibility\n\n\nWith around 1,500 employees to cater to worldwide, there is a huge responsibility on O’Doherty’s shoulders, but it is one he carries well, with E\u0026ampI’s profits and workforce growing year on year. \n\nEven in his home town, so many rely on him. \n\n“I don’t even think about that, there’s no time to worry about that, you just have to get on with it,” he admits. \n\n“If I can keep the customers happy and bring in the sales from those customers, that’s key. It’s very easy to bring in a sale from customers who were happy with their last order. If that’s gone well, it’s easy to get the next ones. \n\n“We have some long-standing relationships with very big companies, some multinationals and the internet sector, we would count as customers and I would look after them personally.\n“I just keep going. I work very heavily in sales so I’m away a lot.\n\n“I suppose at the end of every year you sit down and see what the achievements were for the year and what you’re going to do next year. But I think I’m just too busy to reflect on where we are versus where we started.”\n\n“At the last count, O’Doherty’s personal value was estimated at £163 million, making him one of the most successful businessmen in Ireland. \n\nAt 25 years old, O’Doherty left Du Pont to start a business which focused solely on engineering. \n\nNow, 32 years on, the former St. Columb’s College student retains his hands-on approach. \n\n“I do get involved in things and because I’m an engineer, I’m very interested in research and development. I talk to a lot of customers who say: ‘I wish we could get this or I wish we could do that’, so that turns into a project. \n\n“I’m partly doing technical sales, but I’m partly working in research as well. I am using my engineering skills it’s not just a management job where I’m not actually doing things. \n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“I think getting close to customers is really important, because you have to ask the question – why do people in Silicon Valley place orders with a company in Donegal? They don’t just happen to be driving past and call in and see us, we go out and talk to them and show what we have.\n\n“We have a fabulous work force, which is the big advantage that we have. It’s a mix between Derry and Donegal people who have a great work this, a good education.”\n\n\nDown time\n\n\nThat passion for his work continues to drive him on, be it in his office overlooking the building in Burnfoot, in Anderson, South Carolina or in Dubai. \n\nThere is no down time for O’Doherty it seems. \n\n“To be honest, I’m quite happy with my lifestyle at the minute,” he shrugs. \n\n“I would like a little more free time. I’ve just become a grandfather my grandson is 14 and a half months and I would definitely want to spend more time with him. I have two kids, a boy and a girl, so I would like more family time but at the same time I like what I do. I like engineering.\n\n“Earlier this morning I was looking at some drawings for a large project we’re doing for a client and I really enjoyed going through them. I wouldn’t want to be an accountant. A lot of engineering people tend to make out that they’re management only then all of a sudden all they are doing is looking at financial statements all the time. \n\n“I do do that. I can read a balance sheet, but I wouldn’t want it to be the main focus of my job.”\n\nO’Doherty has created something hugely significant right on his own doorstep. His value to his home town cannot just be measured in jobs alone, but by other contributions, which he does not want acknowledged in print. \n\n“He has helped bail Derry City out twice, once in 1995 and again in 2010. From whatever angle you choose to look. It’s clear that O’Doherty cares, and cares deeply about his home town, and the people in it. \n\n“We have the right people in this area,” he explains. “We probably underestimate how talented our people are. I sometimes think we lack in confidence. I go to other cities in Ireland and the UK and they seem to be very confident whereas as soon as our people get stuck into a project, they are probably more impressive than people from these other locations. I think that’s the work ethic particularly. \n\n“What I notice about people here as well, is that if they encounter a technical problem they are very innovative in coming up with a solution. They tend to try and work solutions out themselves. I think that’s natural. I think this innovation is very, very important.\n\n“It’s not all me. I started it off but I developed a team. My workforce and in particular my two directors Damien and Cathal they have done a lot more than I have in terms of what’s in this building. I may bring the sales in but what you see in the factory is largely down to them.”\n\nAnother key issue for O’Doherty is education in the city, primarily the development of Magee university, which he believes has been held back in recent years. \n\n“We’re still short engineers there’s not enough engineers and there’s the lack of a proper university here,” he insists. \n\n“Magee is definitely making progress with the new vice-chancellor but it should have been making that progress years ago. \n\n\"The reason that I feel so disappointed at the lack of sufficient progress in the university, is that, when I meet other people who own businesses and you get talking to them, one of the questions I get asked is ‘Why have you built your factory in such and such a place?’ There’s two answers I give them one is that I was born here, and two is that \n\n“I went to university here and I met my wife. I think you need a good university to attract good people and I think the university will attract people who will eventually settle here as well.\nThat will create businesses which will help the university and all of a sudden you have a virtuous circle of good stable employment. Without a university, it’s definitely more difficult.”\n\n\nRetirement?\n\n\nSo, does he have an end-game? At 57 years old, is retirement now starting to creep into his thinking?\n\n“I certainly think I have got seven or eight more years until I think about retiring. \n\nI will probably wind it down a bit. \n\nI would like to work less hours and spend more time with my grandson particular, but I still want to do something. I don’t play golf,” he laughed.\nThe last question is a simple one- ‘Do you feel appreciated?’\n\n“I think I am, not by everybody but it really doesn’t matter,” he says. \n\n“I’ve got a very good relationship with my shop floor in particular. I tend to come down here on a Saturday morning if I’m not away and walk around. \n\n\"I just want to know what’s happening, because I don’t have time during the week because of my travels. I just don’t get time. I like to walk around and if there are any new starts I have a worked with them.\n“Am I appreciated? I’m not 100% sure, but hopefully.”\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry country park looking actors spooky flair star halloween events","story":"\nA Derry outdoor pursuit’s facility has put out a call for local actors with a flair for all things spooky.\n\nCreggan Country Park is looking for experienced performers aged 18 and over to star in their Halloween events.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\nFor more information email \n[email\u0026#160protected]\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"derry north west businesses urged return questionnaires ensure accurate future business rates","story":"\nLocal Businesses urged for responses on Business Rates return their business rates Reval2020 questionnaire to ensure their future business rates are accurate.\n\nPatrick Bradley, from the North West Regional Valuation Office based in Waterside House in Derry, has been urging local businesses to return their questionnaires.\n\nLand \u0026amp Property Services  has already contacted business ratepayers in the Derry City \u0026amp Strabane Council area to collect rental and other business data for the non-domestic rates revaluation – Reval2020.

The words “I want to be an organ donor” are simple, but what an inspirational difference they could make. \n\nThis Organ Donation Week  the Western Health and Social Care Trust  is centred on encouraging people to talk to those closest to them about organ donation. Many people don’t realise that their family’s support is needed for organ donation to go ahead.\n\nApproximately 140 people in Northern Ireland are waiting on life-saving transplants and approximately 6,000 people in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately every year around 14 people in Northern Ireland die waiting for an organ transplant, highlighting the real shortage of organ donations.\n\nDr Declan Grace, Lead Clinician for Organ Donation at the Western Trust said: “Organ donation transforms and saves lives and the Western Trust is encouraging everyone to join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones that they wish to be a donor, so that they are aware of their wishes.\n\n“Deciding to become an organ donor is entirely your decision but it does affect your family. After your death, your next of kin will be consulted on whether your organs can be donated, even if you carry a donor card, and any decision they make will be respected. When families or friends know the wishes of their loved ones it makes the situation less stressful and can give them the confidence to fulfil your wish to be an organ donor.\n\n\n\n        googletag.cmd.push                 .addSize                .addSize                .build            slot = googletag.defineSlot                .defineSizeMapping                                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                            .setTargeting                                                    .addService            googletag.display            googletag.pubads.refresh            \n\n\n\n“No one wants to think or talk about dying but set in the context of helping one or more than one person after death, the conversation becomes easier. The more people pledge to donate their organs and tissues after their death, the more people stand to benefit. Between 1 April 2017 and 31 March 2018 there were seven organ donors in the Western Trust area, resulting in 20 patients receiving a transplant.”\n\nDr Grace continued: “There is a constant drive towards promoting organ donation in the Western Trust and it has been successful. This is shown in the number of people registered as potential donors which has increased from about 25% to 43% in Northern Ireland over the past five years. While this is very encouraging, there is still a lot of work to do to ensure as many people as possible join the Organ Donor register and tell their loved ones about their wishes.”\n\nThere are many ways to register as a potential donor:\n\nRegister online at \nwww.organdonation.nhs.uk\n or \nwww.organdonationni.info\n\nRegister when applying for or renewing a driving licence.\nRegister when registering with a G.P Practice.\nTelephone the N.H.S.

delivering one of three parts of the intermediate level beekeeping course.\n\nThis builds on the knowledge gained from the preliminary course and improves the understanding of both the scientific and practical aspects of beekeeping.\u0026nbsp\n\nIt consists of three parts \u0026mdash scientific, practical and apiary practical \u0026mdash delivered over a period of at least two years and leading to the Federation of Irish Beekeepers\u0026rsquo Associations  Intermediate Certificate of Proficiency in Beekeeping.\n\nHolders of the FIBKA Preliminary Beekeeping certificate \u0026mdash or equivalent \u0026mdash may wish to increase their knowledge, understanding and practical skills in beekeeping. Those applying should be aware that independent study is essential in addition to attending classes and apiary workshops.\u0026nbsp\n\nThe practical written element of the course will be held in Dromore High School and will consist of 15 evening classroom sessions between September and April, followed by a three-hour written examination in April or May.\n\nThe first class will start on Wednesday, September 12, at 6.30pm. Elements covered will include migratory beekeeping, queen rearing, management of nuclei, disease and pest control, equipment, preparation of honey and wax for show, legislation and starting up in beekeeping. The syllabus is available on http:www.irishbeekeeping.ie/index.php/about-us/education/examinations/intermediate-syllabus.\n\nThe Intermediate apiary practical can also stand on its own as a step towards the Practical Bee-master Certificate for those not wishing to take all three hour written examinations.\u0026nbsp For those planning to progress further, it is a step towards completing the apiary practical part of the senior certificate.\n\nThe intermediate certificate will be awarded only when all three examinations have been passed.

They have also failed to engage through the formal negotiating structures with the trade unions.\n\n\u0026ldquoWhile the unions have had positive relations with some management of the legacy councils, it appears that the bad practice approach of others is now predominating.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe trade unions have offered a series of dates for talks with management at the Labour Relations Agency. Following the failure of management to respond to this offer, the unions have been left with no choice but to proceed to a consultative ballot on industrial action.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThis is a historic mark of shame for the council as this is the first time that all four unions representing the workforce have jointly balloted for action.\n\nIn a statement issued yesterday the council said that it was disappointed to learn that the trade unions had issued the press statement without giving pre-notice.\n\nIt says: \u0026ldquoThe statement issued by the Joint Trade Union Side came as a surprise, not least because the council had been in discussions with the unions up until Friday, August 24, where it was agreed by both sides that a meeting would take place on September 3, to be chaired by the Labour Relations Agency.\n\n\u0026ldquoWe were disappointed then to see the unions issue a pre-emptive statement on Bank Holiday Monday that we were given no notice of, nor were we contacted to respond to its contents.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoTrade Union representatives have been part of the job matching process for every post, except one where they declined the invitation to take part. We are working closely with all staff to ensure that they are settled in new posts as soon as possible.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoThe Council remains absolutely committed to resolving this issue with the unions, however negotiations must be conducted in good faith and in a spirit of co-operation and transparency.\n\nUNITE\u0026rsquoS regional organiser, David McMurray, told the Recorder yesterday: \u0026ldquoGoing by the mood of the meeting, which unanimously voted for the strike, I see no reason for that to have changed so I\u0026rsquom fairly confident that it will be a successful ballot.\n\nHe frankly admitted that the mood between the two sides had deteriorated.\n\n\u0026ldquoThings have got worse. In fact Mr Hannaway has been disingenuous with his internal statements to the workforce, said Mr McMurray.\n\n\u0026ldquoIn some ways I would expect that because if you are going to go to war, why wouldn\u0026rsquot you expect the other side to fight back?\n\n\u0026ldquoWe are waiting for genuine discussions which are open and honest.

Such was the demand that people were even contacting me on Saturday night to see if we had any spare tickets, he said.\n\nLocal priests who attended the mass were Fr Gerry McCloskey from Ardglass and Fr Brian Brown of St Patrick\u0026rsquos in Ballynahinch.\n\nChurch of Ireland Dean Henry Hull from Down Cathedral travelled on the coaches with the pilgrims and tweeted after his experience \u0026mdash \u0026ldquoSafely home after a very blessed and uplifting day in Dublin #PapalVisit.\n\nDespite the visit being viewed a difficult one as Pope Francis was being called upon to address the many instances of institutional abuse and clerical sexual abuse of children and women in the island\u0026rsquos recent history, parishioners were still excited to see and eager to listen to the words of their spiritual leader.\n\nDownpatrick man Jackie Breen, who attends St Patrick\u0026rsquos Church, says that the experience of seeing his spiritual leader will stay with him for a lifetime.\n\nHe made sure to make the visit special for his family by personally attending the earlier Festival of Families events on Thursday and Friday, attending the Croke Park concert with his wife Tracey and daughter Lucy and then the Phoenix Park mass on Sunday with his son Dylan.\n\n\u0026ldquoPope John Paul gave us the blessing of peace in Ireland when he spoke here and that was also\u0026nbsp seen in Europe a few years later and I believe that Pope Francis has left us with the special blessing of hope and healing in his visit, said Mr Breen.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos a message of hope and healing not just for Catholics but for all Christians.\n\nHe added that the entire Festival of Families and the Pope\u0026rsquos words helped to underline how crucial the role that families have in global society.\n\nMcCartan Digney , says that he felt very emotional about the entire experience.\n\nHe travelled with his mother Louise to Phoenix Park and proudly carried the yellow and white Papal flag that she had when she went to see Pope John Paul at the youth Mass in Galway.\n\n\u0026ldquoEver since I watched a TV documentary about nine years on the 30th anniversary of Pope John Paul\u0026rsquos visit, I\u0026rsquove wanted to see our Holy Father myself and kept the flag for my chance and I couldn\u0026rsquot believe that I got the chance to do so, he said.\n\n\u0026ldquoIt was very emotional from all the singing and the long walk there. There were tears of joy and tears of sadness\u0026nbsp when Pope Francis acknowledged for the first time the hurt that has been done, but it really needed to be said and it was good to hear the words from the head of our church.\n\nFor Mark Ferris from Drumaness and his partner Kathleen Oliver, their attendance in Dublin during the entire Papal visit was the highlight of a very religious week.\n\nEarlier in the week while holidaying in Portugal, the couple visited the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima.\n\nMr Ferris was a boy of eight when he last saw a serving pope in Ireland when Pope John Paul II visited in 1979.\n\nHowever, he watched the mass at Drogheda, estimated to have nearly attracted 1.3m people, on the television at home with his family.\n\nFor this visit, Mr Ferris says he was determined not to miss out.\n\n\u0026ldquoMy partner had arranged for us to go to Dublin for the Pope\u0026rsquos visit as a birthday celebration but I would have been there no matter what.\n\n\u0026ldquoThis experience was something that I would never will forget and well worth the blisters I have on my feet in walking the five or six miles to Phoenix Park.\u0026nbsp\n\n\u0026ldquoWhen the Pope did his tour of Dublin, we were really close when he pass by and I believe he looked directly at me.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe concert was absolutely brilliant as was the Mass and we really enjoyed the entire weekend.\n\nSouth Down MLA Colin McGrath also attended Sunday\u0026rsquos Papal Mass.\n\nWhile he represented the SDLP along with deputy Nicola Mallon, he travelled down as part of the Downpatrick and Lecale parish group.\n\nHe said that the event was notable for the number of young people who attended.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe atmosphere was electric and it was a special moment when the Pope arrived.\n\n\u0026ldquoThe overall theme of his visit was obviously \u0026lsquofamilies\u0026rsquo and it was great to see so many families there together too. There was a great connection amongst the Downpatrick Parish group with over 200 travelling together. \n\nHe added: \u0026ldquoPope Francis also sent a special message of forgiveness and healing for the Church\u0026rsquos involvement in difficult matters in the past which was important too.\n\n\u0026ldquoAll together, it was a fabulous event which will be remembered for a generation.\n\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t.ready.prettyPhoto\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n"}]
