The paratroopers also claim a member of 3 Para posted photos of paras posing with English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson (pictured in March) on their Facebook pageHe told the tribunal: \u0027In the early stages of my career, while I was in A Company, I heard my colleagues use racial slurs such as \u0027n****r\u0027, \u0027c**n\u0027, \u0027subdued call signs\u0027, \u0027the non-swimmers\u0027, \u0027p***\u0027 and \u0027choggie\u0027 on numerous occasions.\u0027This was often passed off as \u0027banter\u0027, although I found it very intimidating and offensive as a non-white person.\u0027Private Gue said the corridor he was staying in was often trashed \u0027on purpose\u0027.He said: \u0027The doors of myself and Private Lantieri would often be urinated on, have beer bottles smashed on them, and racial slurs written on them with marker pen which I had to remove each morning.\u0027It was said both Private Gue and his white South African colleague Private Lantieri moved companies \u0027as a result of the shocking behaviour and racial abuse\u0027.When asked by his Platoon Commander why he moved, Private Gue told him some things but \u0027didn\u0027t want to take it further\u0027 because he \u0027feared the potential repercussions of doing so\u0027.He said: \u0027I also felt that as a Private, it wasn\u0027t my place to report the harassment I was receiving from soldiers in the ranks above me.\u0027My experience in A Company had an extreme psychological impact on me, leading me to make the decision to change my surname from Gue-Hassan to Gue.         Private Gue was deployed with 3 Para to Kenya on Exercise Askari Storm in 2017. A staged riot by locals is pictured during the exercise. There is no suggestion of wrongdoing against anyone pictured above\u0027This was because Hassan is Muslim and I thought it would make me more prone to racial abuse if I continued to be known by this name.\u0027After moving, it was said over the next few years things got much better for Private Gue but in July 2017 he saw a Facebook post of A Company members posing with a Nazi flag.He said he had previously noticed there were Nazi, Confederate and SS flags, and photos of Hitler displayed in the A Company accommodation.Private Gue said: \u0027In October 2017, I saw that a member of 3 Para had posted pictures on social media of themselves with Tommy Robinson, leader of the English Defence League.\u0027It was clear to me at this point that racism was still prevalent in 3 Para, and A Company in particular. Things only got worse from there.\u0027In November 2017, I was deployed with 3 Para to Kenya on Exercise Askari Storm.\u0027At this briefing meeting, the BATUK (British Army Training Unit Kenya) officer who was giving the welcome brief told us that we should not behave badly while in Kenya or we would \u0027go to prison and get Aids\u0027.\u0027Due one of the training exercises with the Kenyan troops, Corporal Johnson said \u0027look at these idiots running, f***ing n*****s don\u0027t have a clue\u0027.... myself and Mr Zulu also hear Corporal Kinnell describe Kenya as a \u0027s***hole country\u0027.\u0027         The tribunal is taking place at Central London Employment Tribunal in Holborn (file picture)Throughout the Askari Storm, Private Gue said he heard 3 Para refer to Kenyan forces and locals as \u0027n****s\u0027, \u0027choggies\u0027, and \u0027African idiots\u0027.Private Gue said: \u0027I was shocked to hear my colleagues telling the Kenyan locals to \u0027f*** off\u0027 and telling the children that were begging for food to \u0027f*** off you s*** c***s.\u0027I was stunned by the racial abuse I witnessed during Exercise Askari Storm. I confided in Mr Zulu about how I was feeling and he shared my feelings of hurt and anger.\u0027He told me about the time that he was referred to as a \u0027black c**t by Sergeant Andy White, and that the Army never seemed to take any action against this, which infuriated me.\u0027Private Gue, who is now suing the Army for racial harassment and discrimination, requested early termination on January 18, 2018 when he arrived back in England.He also wrote a letter to the Army entitled \u0027The British Army\u0027s guide to jovial racism and how to turn a blind eye\u0027.When the Private received confirmation of his termination, he said nowhere did it cite his reasons for leaving.Private Gue said: \u0027The notice did not state anywhere that my reason for leaving the army was due to racial discrimination or harassment and instead used terms such as \u0027personal reasons\u0027 and \u0027perceived incidents\u0027 to describe the events that I had discussed in detail with my chain on command.\u0027I was dismayed that the notice appeared to be covering up my true reasons for leaving the Army and felt a complete lack of trust.\u0027This reinforced my views that the Army would not do anything to address my concerns or take my complaints seriously.\u0027The tribunal heard that shortly after Private Gue\u0027s early release, requested as a result of the racism, he and Lance Corporal Zulu\u0027s photograph was defaced with swatsikas and Hitler moustaches.Private Gue reported the incident to the commanding officer of 3 Para and \u0027as this was a criminal offence\u0027 he was told to go to the Royal Military Police (RMP) station to give a statement - but was told it was not their concern.He said: \u0027I was interviewed by the RMP on January 26, however during the interview the interviewing officer stopped the interview and told me that the RMP did not need a statement from me as the matter was not theirs to deal with but the commanding officer of 3 Para.\u0027When he replayed this to 3 Para, he was told the RMP was \u0027mistaken\u0027 and that he should go back to make a statement as soon as possible.Private Gue said: \u0027I was extremely disappointed by the RMP\u0027s failure to act after hearing the seriousness of my allegation.\u0027I would have expected the RMP, who represent law enforcement within the military, to process my complaint properly. The failure to do so left me feeling let down by the system.\u0027The tribunal heard that on February 7, Private Gue learned that his friend, Corporal Kebede returned to his shared accommodation to find his notebook vandalised with racial slurs such as \u0027n****r\u0027, \u0027p***\u0027, and \u0027go back to your country\u0027.It was said the incident was reported and the notebook was handed to the RMP.Private Gue filed a formal service complaint on February 21 and a week later went back to the RMP station to give a statement about the defaced photograph, as well as raising other racist incidents.The tribunal heard that Private Gue was accused of vandalising his own door to get early release.Private Gue said: \u0027Mr Zulu told me that he had been approached by Lance Corporal Brookes, a member of 3 Para, who told him that members of the Patrols Platoon had said that I had vandalised my own door in order to get early release.\u0027I could not believe this, particularly as the allegation made no sense - I had already been granted permission for early release before the incident on January 23 occurred.\u0027Both paratroopers told Lance Corporal Brookes to report what had been said to the 3 Para adjutant \u0027immediately\u0027.Private Gue attended a meeting with his commanding officer in March to discuss the service complaints procedure but in April was told by the Service Police in writing \u0027they were unable to find the offender\u0027.He said: \u0027On April 20 the Service Police wrote to me to inform me that their enquiries into the investigation had concluded and that they were unable to identify the offender.\u0027It was said that after this he was threatened with violence by a colleague.The tribunal was told that at Private Gue and Lance Corporal Zulu\u0027s leaving party in May, Private Gue was approached by a colleague who shook his hand and said \u0027I will bang you so hard that you wish you had not done what you\u0027ve done\u0027.He said: \u0027While I was there Corporal Joe Mitton approached me along with Lance Corporal Limbu.\u0027Corporal Mitton went on to shake my hand and said \u0027I wish you all the best in the future. However Gue, if I ever see you or meet you in the street I will fill you in, I will bang you so hard, that you wish you had not done what you\u0027ve done\u0027.\u0027Private Gue said even after his employment he continued to hear about racist incidents in the Army.He said an ex-colleague was sent a Snapchat from a Corporal which showed him shouting at a black child.Private Gue was asked in July to send in further details of the allegations but was told in November by a Brigadier that three were \u0027inadmissible\u0027 - Lance Corporal Zulu being called a \u0027black c***\u0027, the notebook vandalism, and the Nazi flag incident - because they did \u0027not relate to (his) own service\u0027 in the Army.He said: \u0027They seemed to miss the point that these events had a significant impact on my feelings that racism was systemic within the Army and that nothing was being done to tackle it.\u0027Private Gue filed for a review for the admissibility decision but it was upheld by the service complaints Ombudsman in January of this year.The Ombudsman also went on to say the racism in Kenya was inadmissible too.Private Gue said: \u0027I couldn\u0027t believe that the Ombudsman had reached this decision, which seemed completely unfair, particularly as it was the racism in Kenya that resulted in my decision to leave the army.\u0027But the next month the Service Complaint Secreteriat informed Private Gue the incidents in Kenya would be admissible and they would not be following the Ombudsman\u0027s recommendation.Private Gue, who now earns $300 (£238) a day working \u0027sporadically\u0027 as an independent contractor for the Endangered Species Protection Agency in Swaziland, said: \u0027If I had never witnessed and experienced such abhorrent racial abuse at the hands of my colleagues, I would have continued serving in the Army until my retirement.\u0027As a result of the discrimination and harassment I have suffered, I am seeking a declaration from the tribunal that I have been discriminated against and financial compensation.\u0027My experiences of racism, and the Army\u0027s failure to take adequate action to address this, have caused me to feel numb, disillusioned and bitter.\u0027The abuse I suffered during my employment with the Army led to me having to make the very difficult decision to leave behind my aspirations and ambitions to pursue a full career in the Army.\u0027He said the whole process of \u0027trying to seek justice, was \u0027extremely stressful and draining and had a \u0027huge psychological impact\u0027 on him.He asked that the tribunal recommend the Army implement additional equality and ersity training.Private Gue, who is calling for a a public apology to both paratroopers and Kenyan soldiers and nationals, added: \u0027No amount of money will ever be able to truly compensate me for what I have witnessed and experienced during my employment with the Army, which I once thought so highly of.\u0027The tribunal, due to last nine more days, continues."},{"url":null,"title":"Private school girl 26 reveals went Syria revolution","story":"Share this article \u0027I want to know that it\u0027s real.

She hoped he didn\u0027t mind!To BBC presenters and reporters of Robert\u0027s generation and then mine, working for the Corporation was the greatest honour imaginable.There was a strong sense among us that we were serving the public and we had a special, personal and even intimate relationship with them.Sadly, this is a relationship that has been cynically undermined over the years by the BBC itself, not least by the announcement last month that to save money up to 3.7 million over-75s will no longer receive a free television licence.As the BBC has grown into a complacent, self-satisfied bureaucratic monolith, a gulf has opened up between the people on screen or the airwaves and those who foot their wages, the licence-fee payers.A myth has been allowed to grow up that the presenters – or the \u0027talent\u0027 as the management call them – are somehow extraordinary and deserve exceptional rewards.The BBC\u0027s chairman, David Clementi, certainly buys into this nonsense: yesterday, as yet another row erupted over the BBC pay, despite a total salary bill that tops £1billion and a bill for the Beeb\u0027s \u0027stars\u0027 up by £11million on last year, he said he saw \u0027no evidence we are paying anyone above the market rate,\u0027 and even added: \u0027What I\u0027ve seen suggests the opposite.\u0027He and the legions of BBC bureaucrats are deluded – at least when it comes to delivering the news.On the evening of August 27, 1979, the BBC news bulletin drew its biggest ever audience of 27 million.It was the day that the IRA blew up Lord Mountbatten and members of his family in a boat off Mullaghmore in Ireland, and the same day that 18 British soldiers died in an ambush at Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland.              Robert Dougall (left) is famous for announcing in 1939 that Britain was at war with Germany. Huw Edwards (right) is another familiar voice on the BBCThe bulletin was read not by a \u0027star\u0027 or even by one of the regular news presenters but by veteran foreign correspondent Christopher Morris. Like me at the time, Morris was an all-purpose general reporter. The Beeb has forgotten that it\u0027s the news that matters, not who is delivering it.Elsewhere within the Corporation, it is evident from the list published yesterday that presenters\u0027 salaries are more outrageous than ever. It\u0027s as if executives are thumbing their nose at ongoing public concern about the BBC\u0027s excessive pay.How can Match Of The Day\u0027s Gary Lineker – a former footballer trained by the BBC to become a competent presenter – continue to receive £1.75million a year? Is his colleague Alan Shearer worth an extra £30,000, boosting his salary to £440,000? Would they earn that elsewhere? I very much doubt it. It\u0027s a kick in the teeth for every licence-fee payer, and especially the over-75s.The best-paid journalist, newsreader Huw Edwards, is on £490,000. To reporters of my generation, that sum is unthinkable.Bear in mind that veteran newsreader Kenneth Kendall\u0027s final salary at the BBC in 1981 was £16,000 a year – just over £60,000 in today\u0027s money. That\u0027s an eighth of Edwards\u0027 salary and Kendall commanded audiences of eight million compared to around five now.When I left the BBC in 1997, after 35 years\u0027 service, I was being paid a salary of £70,000: a good wage, certainly, but far from the stratospheric salaries commanded today.While reporting from Sarajevo in 1992, I was hit by mortar shrapnel. Some of the metal is still in my stomach: doctors say it would be too dangerous to attempt to take it out. I can assure you that, in contrast to the perils of war reporting, reading an autocue in a TV studio requires no remarkable gifts.The \u0027talent\u0027 would be alarmed to realise how many untrained people could do it just as well.         BBC director-general Tony Hall is presiding over an organisation with an enormous wage bill And their massively inflated salaries are not even performance-related. Indeed, earnings have increased even as audiences have diminished – a fraction of what they were 20 years ago for the main terrestrial channels.The BBC News at Ten, for example, has less than 20 per cent of the audience it enjoyed in the late Seventies.Admittedly, yesterday\u0027s figures do reveal that some trimming of salaries has begun. Jeremy Vine, John Humphrys and Steve Wright – all paid many hundreds of thousands a year – have taken pay cuts of between £85,000 and £150,000. That\u0027s a start but it must go further.If the BBC loses some of its best-known performers as a result, then so be it. There will be no lack of talented volunteers to take their places.What isn\u0027t widely known is that the overall earnings of the BBC\u0027s high-flyers are often in considerable excess of published figures. These presenters can enjoy additional windfalls from so-called \u0027corporates\u0027, including after-dinner speeches, videos and conferences.While MPs have to declare these things on a register, journalists and presenters working for the publicly-funded national broadcaster do not.Yet if a presenter is \u0027let go\u0027 by the BBC, such engagements dry up very quickly. What these men and women are worth outside the BBC is entirely dependent on the \u0027face-time\u0027 conferred by the broadcaster. Why isn\u0027t that fact part of hard-nosed salary negotiations?There are other ways to save money, of course, such as cutting management salaries or reining back on the Beeb\u0027s ambitions to compete with Netflix and other streaming services. We never seem to hear about those options.And it strikes me as odd, perhaps even hypocritical, that the BBC makes much of its status as a public-sector broadcaster when it is defending its licence fee, yet pretends to be a commercial organisation when paying its executives and presenters.I am pleased that the anomaly of the pay gap between men and women is being closed.For the first time, three of the top ten earners are female – Zoe Ball and Claudia Winkleman on £370,000 and Vanessa Feltz on £355,000. All of them have received substantial increases, as have Lauren Laverne, Fiona Bruce and Sophie Raworth.None of the savings required, however, should have come at the expense of the licence payer – or those elderly Britons who will have their free licences taken away.I well remember the day in 1999 when, as the only independent MP in the Commons, I heard Chancellor Gordon Brown announce free TV licences for the over-75s. What cheers there were!I am now 80 and have benefited from this freebie, though I didn\u0027t need it. And though I am not a wealthy man, I\u0027d be perfectly willing to have the levy reimposed on me, as are many others. But there are millions who cannot pay and who do not qualify for the pension credit benefit that will, from June 2020, entitle them to a free TV licence.It will hit their quality of life hard. These include some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society: frail men and women, often living alone and far from family, for whom television is their window on the world, and presenters on both radio and TV are their everyday companions.The BBC would do well to remember that it has no more devoted audiences than those of us in the autumn of our years. Never mind the \u0027talent\u0027 – they\u0027re replaceable, every one of them if necessary. It\u0027s the viewers who are the Corporation\u0027s greatest stars. They deserve better.Martin Bell OBE is an award-winning former BBC war reporter who left the Corporation in 1997 to stand as an Independent candidate in Tatton, Cheshire.

But Ernest Hemingway’s A Moveable Feast and a trip to Paris solved the problem:I thoroughly enjoyed his recollections of his time in Paris in the early to mid 1920s. As luck would have it I was staying in the 5th Arrondissement, which is where he mainly lived during this period so it was wonderful to be walking the same streets and stopping off in the same cafes.New York in 1872 has grown to a population of almost a million. A freelance journalist goes missing after telling his editor that he just seen his own father, who died the year before, though he had no sort of relationship with him, a man who had earned his fortune running slave boats along the Atlantic Coast. Always there is the spectre of corruption, of bribery and extortion headed by the gangster Boss Tweed. As gripping as the plot is, NY itself is very much the star of the show, a place imprisoned in thuggish corruption, where the police conspire with, rather than against, crime, a maze of alleyways crawling with the street-urchins who survive on the city’s garbage, darting beneath the wheels of carriages, acting as newspaper-sellers, and loitering at the edge of squalid saloons.

They were delightful. My favourite phrase was “ferociously unshaven gentlemen”. I don’t know why - but I was taken by that.At the end, there is a calendar of flowers and saints. And a footnote acknowledges the help of Dr Theodore Stephanides - the Theodore of Corfu, I assume. For some silly reason, it made me happy to see his name. He was such a nice character in the Gerald Durrell books and, from what I can gather, well respected by his fellow Greeks as an academic.The Devil’s Diary by Patrick McGinley has delighted BaddHamster:Set in Donegal in the 1980s it tells of strange goings on in a seaside town. A priest disapproves of modernity and the introduction of a cash economy. His mysterious brother returns from overseas and may or may not be a little mad. And there’s something shady about their childhood days. Beautifully written, you can practically smell the turf fires and the seaspray and a creepy plot that threatens horror with every turn of the page. I’d never read McGinley before, but I’m delighted to make his acquaintance now and roam the spooky hills after dark where all manner of shenanigans may be transpiring, just out of sight.ID583532 “wasn’t looking forward” to reading Welcome to Lagos by Chibundu Onuzo, “but I did and how glad I am that I did”:It was a terrific read! I loved the detail and vibrancy of the description of life in the city of Lagos, the delta and rural regions. The characterisation was excellent and the dynamics of the relationships engaging and convincing. There was no happy ending as such (and how could there be?), but the ending was largely positive and the message hopeful.This year’s Man Booker Prize International winner, Celestial Bodies by Jokha Alharthi, has intrigued Rex Bowan:It started by reminding me of The Waves but by the end, with the village, the confusing shifts in perspective, the barrage of history and madness revealed at the end of the book, it brought Faulkner to mind even more. I was pleased to read something experimental but I didn’t feel like my understanding or knowledge of Oman grew as a result of reading it.Finally, Vicc is “slowly reading” The Narrow Road to the Interior by Matsuo Bashō translated by Sam Hamill:Such a joy. A few words painting wonderful pictures of Japan in the 17th century. Calming and serene with beautiful haiku. Even the difficulties and sadness are something Bashō accepts:Through nine hellish days of heat and rain, all my old maladies tormenting me again, feverish and weak, I could not write. Altair meets Vega tomorrow - Tanabata - already the night is changedWhat an antidote to the world of today.That does indeed sound like a tonic.If you’re on Instagram, now you can share your reads with us: simply tag your posts with the hashtag #Books, and we’ll include a selection in this blog.

One Republican senator called the decision to pull the shoes “anti-American”.The “Betsy Ross flag” features 13 white stars in a circle, representing the 13 original colonies, and is one of many early versions of the American flag. It is named after the Philadelphia seamstress who is credited with creating the first American flag featuring stars and stripes in the late 18th century – though most scholars dismiss that story as myth.The flag has since been embraced by white nationalists and the American Nazi party.The shoes had been destined for stores to celebrate the Fourth of July holiday. But Kaepernick – the NFL star turned activist who took the knee during the national anthem in protest against racism and police brutality – said Nike should not sell the shoes with a symbol many consider offensive for its connection to an era of slavery, according the Wall Street Journal.“Nike has chosen not to release the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July as it featured the old version of the American flag,” a Nike spokeswoman told the WSJ.In response to the report, Doug Ducey, Arizona’s Republican governor, called Ross a “founding mother” of the US, and tweeted: “Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike.”Ducey said he had asked the state’s commerce authority to withdraw financial incentives for Nike to open a manufacturing plant in Arizona.He tweeted: “Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation’s independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism.”Ted Cruz, the Republican senator, said Nike “only wants to sell sneakers to people who hate the American flag”.Josh Hawley, a fellow Republican senator from Missouri, called Nike “anti-American, pure and simple”.Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who has been accused of racism in the past and recently interviewed Donald Trump on his trip to France for the D-Day commemorations, tweeted: “No more Nike sneakers for our family.”The Journal reported that the shoes had shipped to retailers, but Nike asked them to be returned, without giving further details. Some pairs of the shoes have been appearing on the re-sale website StockX for more than $2,000.The Betsy Ross flag has caused controversy in the past. In 2016, the superintendent of a Michigan school district apologized after students waved the flag during a football game.Kaepernick, now 31, has not played in the NFL since 2016, when he began kneeling during the US national anthem to call attention to social injustice and racial inequality. The former 49ers quarterback settled a grievance case earlier this year, which alleged the league had blackballed him and a fellow player for their political views.Nike unveiled an advertising campaign last year that put Kaepernick’s activism front and center, and featured the slogan: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything. Just do it.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1c2d61db29f55433bb6e5f82faa1bae1d988205d/144_0_4320_2592/master/4320.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1d497d10c52e0eedba0de42ff695c4a2","title":"whirlpool says up to 800000 faulty dryers exist","story":"Number of UK appliances affected is greater than first thought, company admitsWhirlpool has admitted that there could be up to 800,000 faulty tumble dryers in UK homes that have an increased fire risk, higher than previously thought.Last month the government ordered a recall of 500,000 tumble dryers, four years after fire safety concerns were first raised by the US home appliance maker. The affected brands are Hotpoint, Indesit, Creda, Swan and Proline.However, company executives appearing before MPs on the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee on Tuesday admitted the number could be higher.Jeff Noel, corporate vice president of communications and public affairs at Whirlpool, said estimates of faulty dryers in UK homes ranged from 250,000 to 800,000. He said Whirlpool had already modified 1.7m dryers to fix a fault that could cause fire through the build-up of fluff. The company logged 54 fires related to this issue in recent years, including three in machines that had been modified, according to Michael Farrington, another executive.Farrington said Whirlpool had moved from trying to fix the faulty dryers to replacing them with safe appliances free of charge. It is also offering customers discounted upgrades.MPs also heard from a customer, Jemma Spurr, whose modified Hotpoint dryer caught fire last September while she was at home with her young children, causing significant damage to her house. She told MPs that the company was unresponsive when she tried to report the fire, and only managed to do so when she visited a Currys store, which sells the dryers.She said she had neither received an apology from Whirlpool nor a forensic report on the cause of the fire, and was forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement before receiving any compensation.Noel apologised to her during the hearing. He said confidentiality agreements were required by insurers during settlements but, when pressed by Rachel Reeves, chair of the BEIS committee, pledged to raise the issue with them.The Whirlpool executives also promised to publish a full list of all faulty models on the company’s website by next week. When asked why the firm had not done this earlier, Noel said it had provided a model checker for customers and felt this was more useful than a long list.Whirlpool has faced heavy criticism over its decision not to recall the machines despite the fire risk.Commenting on the BEIS evidence session, Sue Davies, strategic policy adviser at the consumer group Which?, said Whirlpool had put corporate reputation ahead of public safety. She added: “If the safety of Whirlpool’s fire-risk tumble dryers cannot be assured, the secretary of state, Greg Clark, must step in and ensure that all potentially dangerous machines are immediately removed from people’s homes.”Whirlpool said in a statement after the BEIS session: “The Office for Product Safety and Standards recently concluded a comprehensive year-long review of the dryer programme which confirmed that the modification is effective in resolving the issue.“Safety is always our number one priority and we remain committed to resolving all unmodified dryers affected by this issue. As we updated the committee, we are expanding our recall campaign to include further options to encourage remaining consumers to come forward and remedy their unmodified appliances.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8b62bf527f475f14abde568009c3acaad192706/0_31_3267_1961/master/3267.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f7cd4cf66cd9e7a08975988d4c0014ce","title":"jeremy corbyn liability brexit labour party","story":"The winner of the Conservative leadership contest will be the third prime minister in four years to take on Jeremy Corbyn, which is a measure of serial Tory dysfunction and the Labour leader’s tenacity. Corbyn has held his party’s top job for longer than Gordon Brown, John Smith, Michael Foot or James Callaghan. The man obviously has stamina, even if gossipy civil servants say it isn’t so.Monolithic message discipline has been a consistent strength of the Corbyn project. Internal disputes never used to leak. A strict omertà prohibited it. Solidarity was sustained by fear that the tiniest fissure would be exploited by enemies, which meant anyone outside a narrow circle of true believers. Over time, even rebellious MPs learned obedience. Their 2016 coup failed miserably. They were further chastened by Labour’s robust performance in the 2017 election.Some of that surge was pure anti-Brexit protest, but the result was taken by Corbyn loyalists as a personal endorsement of the leader. Sceptics learned not to take his name in vain. It was safer to voice concern about bad advice from wicked aides.But the taboo is breaking down. Brexit is degrading the Corbyn brand at a rate that alarms ideological devotees. It has been disorienting for many Labour supporters that the leader, normally quick on the draw with a megaphone, refuses to broadcast pro-European resistance. He sounds tongue-tied on the subject and looks like a man hiding from battle, which undermines the image of a candid crusader. When the hero no longer embodies principles on which his movement was founded, the whole edifice wobbles. The attention of young idealists drifts affection turns conditional benefit of the doubt is withdrawn.It is getting notably harder, for example, to be loyal to Corbyn and determined to combat antisemitism at the same time. Those who try tie themselves in knots, seeking to insulate the leader from decisions that are clearly taken with the boss’s preferences in mind, such as the grimly farcical sequence of suspension, readmission and resuspension of Chris Williamson. There is not much point trying to decrypt what happens inside the Labour leader’s head on this subject. What matters is that an alarming number of people who think Jews are a sinister, conspiratorial clan also believe that Corbyn is their guy and Labour is their party. Their ideological cover is impeccably Corbynite too: it is the loose interpretation of “Zionism” as a keystone in structures of global, neocolonial oppression. From there it is a short step to seeing Jews as perpetrators of injustice, and so disqualified from sympathy as victims of racism.The task of disentangling antisemitism from the package of hard-left, “anti-imperialist” doctrines is not simply a matter of kicking out iniduals who are too stupid to express their prejudice in code. It means decontaminating Corbynism itself, which raises the question of what that word means beyond the assertion that Corbyn must be prime minister.There is a healthy ecosystem of ideas for domestic reform on the left, looking at ownership structures and ways to “democratise” the economy. But that can cover everything from Sovietisation to Scandinavian social democracy. Labour’s tortured Brexit position contains the same tension. Amid all the electoral fretting over leave-voting constituencies is an old doctrinal instinct that sees EU rules as inimical to red-blooded socialism. McDonnell, curator of Corbynism’s economic agenda, is coy on the question of whether the ultimate ambition is reform or abolition of capitalism. He also knows that winning power is the first step, regardless of the destination. To that end he is persuaded by the utility of jumping down on the remain side of the fence, and frustrated that his old friend won’t join him.Even if such differences are purely tactical, their visibility signals a problem. It reveals the suspicion that Corbyn is no longer such an asset to Corbynism. There was a time when the leader’s avuncular persona was more powerful than policy or slogan. Everyone in Corbyn’s 2015 campaign, including the candidate, was astonished by the effect. He once exuded a gentleness that made allegations of fanaticism sound preposterous. Now his peevish side cuts through. He once animated feelings of belonging and purpose in people who had felt starved of inspiration by soulless New Labour. Now he refuses to quench the thirst of his party’s parched remainers. He had Glastonbury singing his name in 2017. It wouldn’t happen now. He can still pack a town hall, but that is propping up a base, not enlarging it.Few Labour MPs, if any, relish the prospect of an election under their leader, although most pretend to want one. It is hard to present Corbyn as a man for the future, and May’s departure will date him even more. He will be a stale continuity figure from the time of stasis, irradiated through years of loitering ineffectually amid the referendum’s toxic fallout. His aura of specialness has dissipated, revealing the man in all his flawed mediocrity. The prospect of Britain having a radical Labour government is sliding into the gap that has opened up between an idea people once called “Jeremy Corbyn” and the actual Jeremy Corbyn."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3939249a71da8854a4631d667807345a3dfba1e3/906_340_1836_1102/master/1836.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b4b40d98d6ec59fcb7c40c23f8b3bdbd","title":"the guardian view on picking a prime minister a race to harden brexit","story":"The contest to choose the next PM is turning into a competition for the hardest of Brexits by pandering to the lowest common denominatorJeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson have been dubbed the Thelma and Louise of Brexit. Like the characters from the 1991 Hollywood film, the two candidates say they are prepared to end the Brexit adventure by driving us over a cliff. In the movie it was two women on the run who lost their lives. With the United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union, a country is at stake. It beggars belief that both men are prepared to plunge the economy into the abyss with apparent disregard for people’s jobs or that they would stress-test to breaking point the union between the country’s biggest nations or put the hard-won peace and security of Northern Ireland at risk.The problem is that the Conservative party membership does not reflect the UK, yet it will elect a prime minister to lead the country. Tory members predominantly are elderly, wealthy and concentrated in the southern half of England. They are also more rightwing than the population as a whole and seriously deluded: they are unconvinced, despite their own government’s best recent efforts, that a no-deal Brexit would cause serious disruption. In a survey earlier this year, three-quarters of them said such warnings were “exaggerated or invented”. Little wonder that Nick Boles, a former Conservative MP who became an independent after failing to convince fellow Tories to compromise over Brexit, thinks only exposure to the disaster of a no-deal exit from the EU would shake former colleagues out of their stupor.Instead of challenging their electorate, the two prime ministerial candidates have pandered to their worst instincts. The result has been an arms race in no-deal rhetoric that has revealed the outlines of a state-shrinking, low-tax, deregulatory Brexit project that is inimical to the interests of the country and seeks to strip protections hard fought for in the fields of employment, environment and consumer rights. Both men appear to be selling the idea of a managed no-deal. This introduces big problems that – despite claims to the contrary – WTO membership can’t address, and EU crisis negotiations are unlikely to. It also suffers from the very same flaw as Theresa May’s deal – of being dependent on the EU’s goodwill, which would have been exhausted by the determined foolishness of whoever is prime minister.It looks almost certain that Mr Johnson will win the race to Downing Street. Mr Boles worries that there is no easy route for MPs, even in a parliament that the Tories do not control, to block Mr Johnson taking the UK out of the EU without a deal. He thinks Tory MPs would not vote to bring down their own government to prevent a no-deal Brexit. The former Conservative minister believes Mr Johnson would probably enact a no-deal Brexit and then call an election, a strategy which has the attraction of outflanking Nigel Farage.The process of choosing the next PM has given greater weight to party interests than those of government or country. With Brexit this is not a good thing. Trouble is being stored up for the future by mainlining nationalism into post-Brexit politics as well as bringing up immigration constantly. The choice of populism as a narrative frame – with an out-of-touch elite intent on depriving a sovereign people of a decision they voted for – is as dangerous as it is trite. Britain’s political crisis has already reached new lows it ought not to plumb even greater depths."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5c239d7a010a7fb59312c965d6a1a51e2b8cefc/279_145_1437_862/master/1437.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=12341e88730add161da0a1817ed32f62","title":"crickets urban drive batting beyond boundaries","story":"An Islington youth project has transported cricket from the village green into the heart of inner-city communities.  Chas Newkey-Burden meets the children getting involvedOn a five-a-side football pitch, a short stroll from the Arsenal stadium, local kids are falling in love with sport. But it’s cricket, not football, that has them buzzing.For the past four years, thanks to the Islington Chance to Shine Street Youth project, Mikey Thompson has run weekly sessions at this north London leisure centre for the Eritrean Youth Club.Holding classes all year round, whatever the weather – including snow – the Islington setup is a far cry from the sleepy sun-kissed village greens often associated with the game.Thompson, 55, is known as the godfather of inner-city cricket. He says his mission is simple: “to put a bit of joy back on to kids’ faces”.It’s working. The children are enraptured by his down-to-earth approach, which relies on simple drills to teach them the basic disciplines of cricket. As the sun shines, the kids support one another, screams of joy keep going up, and the smiles are everywhere.Eight-year-old Sesen says her favourite part of cricket is the batting. “It feels so nice when I hit the ball because the bat really vibrates in my hands!”But there is another reason why she enjoys picking up the bat. “It makes my hands more steady,” says Sesen. “This is important, because when I grow up I want to be an artist and then my hands will have to be still, so my art doesn’t go all wiggly.”Winta, also eight, says that the sessions have helped her emotionally. “It helps me feel more confident in life,” she says. “If I’m a bit upset in the middle of the week, I just think about cricket and it immediately makes me feel better.”The project has the “open to all” ethos of its backer, Chance to Shine, a charity that aims to give all children the opportunity to play, learn and develop through the game of cricket. Chance to Shine’s main partner, NatWest, also has a long history of supporting grassroots cricket, facilitating schemes to assist communities and to show iniduals that anyone can play, no matter their level of experience.Hiyab, 12, personifies this. He says that when he first came to the sessions, he knew nothing about cricket and wasn’t even sure whether he would be able to play it. “But now I’ve got really confident because I did better than I expected,” he says, with a big grin.Hanan, 10, is also “surprised” by how well he did when he started going along. Before he knew it he was being picked for his school cricket team he now dreams of playing in the Olympics one day.Nine-year-old Selina thinks more children should get involved in cricket, whatever their circumstances or knowledge of the game. “They can still try it,” she says. “It’s so much fun once you start.”Thompson believes the key to the fun of the sessions is for him to channel his inner child. “If you don’t go into their world, you’ve lost them,” he says.He sweeps aside cricketing jargon to produce an experience that captivates children, drawing on decades of coaching and playing involvement, as well as his experiences coaching the blind and those with other disabilities.Thompson fine-tuned his approach when he ran a project in Hackney. “We went into some serious estates where it was all concrete,” he remembers. “I knew that old-fashioned cricket coaching simply wouldn’t work there – the children would have just walked away.”So he introduced tape-ball cricket and speedy, 20-ball games. Nodding at the nearby football stadium, he says that he injected some of football’s speed and excitement to lure inner-city children away from that game and towards cricket.He is full of praise for the support of his charity backer. “Chance to Shine is one of the most wonderful, wonderful things that has ever happened to cricket,” he says. “If it wasn’t for Chance to Shine, state school cricket would be dying.”It is people like Thompson who keep it alive. He believes that, taught correctly, cricket can be “a vehicle to steer children away from crime and antisocial behaviour and towards the right paths”.A passionate, tireless worker, he now hopes to get government backing to take his work into young offenders’ institutions – something Chance to Shine is also looking in to. “I think I could really help,” he says. “I’d like to use cricket to steer young offenders away from crime and get them off welfare.”For almost four decades, NatWest has supported cricket, with a mission to make the game easier for everyone to play and enjoy. A proud partner of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) and the charity Chance to Shine, NatWest champions cricket at all levels - from grassroots support for local clubs and getting more people involved in the game to supporting current and future England stars and helping fans cheer on their teams, however and wherever they choose.With NatWest, cricket is a game that has #NoBoundaries.

With commission, the amount paid by the anonymous buyer was £735,000.Alexander Kader, a Sotheby’s expert who spent a year studying the chess piece, said: “This is one of the most exciting and personal rediscoveries to have been made during my career. It has been such a privilege to bring this piece of history to auction and it has been amazing having him on view at Sotheby’s over the last week – he has been a huge hit. When you hold this characterful warder in your hand or see him in the room, he has real presence.”The Sotheby’s sale also featured 6th-century Byzantine jewellery, 15th-century German stained glass and 16th-century Spanish polychromed wood sculptures. But the star was the 8.8cm-tall Lewis chessman, displayed in a transparent case in front of the auctioneer Harry Dalmeny and three Sotheby’s clerks.It was identified as a missing piece from a hoard that was discovered in the sandbanks of Lewis, in the Outer Hebrides, in 1831. The chessmen are well known in popular culture thanks to the children’s television series Noggin the Nog and Ron Weasley’s perilous chess game in Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone.A total of 82 Lewis chessmen pieces are in the British Museum in London and 11 are in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Five are missing.The newly discovered piece was bought by an antiques dealer for £5 in 1964 and passed down through his family, who mostly it kept out of the way in a drawer. The family were unaware of its significance until the piece was taken to Sotheby’s for assessment.The chessmen were most likely made in Trondheim, Norway, of which the Western Isles were part, between 1150 and 1200. Theories of how they ended up in Lewis range from the hoard being part of a shipwreck to them being hidden for safekeeping by a travelling merchant.A former British Museum director, Neil MacGregor, included them in his A History of the World in 100 Objects series for BBC Radio 4 and talked of how the “much-loved pieces take us into the heart of the medieval world”. He said they showed not only high status, wealth and power but also “knowledge, taste and intellect”.

A story of gender and power in theatre, Sarah Henley and Tori Allen-Martin claim they conceived the show, which is billed as a creative collaboration between the actor Idris Elba and the director Kwame Kwei-Armah.After four years working on the project they were dropped, they said, and then went through eight months “where we questioned everything and felt bullied and silenced”.They continued: “For us it’s been devastating proof of the way doors are shut on women, and on the underdogs. We became completely disposable because we’re not famous or important enough. We were expected to shut up, lie down, and take it.”Tree, which is a fusion of music, drama and dance, is being touted as one of the highlights of the festival, opening on Thursday before a run at London’s Young Vic in August.Elba’s Green Door Pictures company, the Young Vic and the festival (MIF) said in a joint statement they were “deeply saddened” to read the online article. All three were “passionate about supporting and nurturing emerging talent within the creative industry from the widest variety of backgrounds” and were “committed to ensuring fair representation on stage and behind the scenes”.They said they appreciated that Henley and Allen-Martin “were involved in exploring ideas for a project based on Idris’s original concept”, but “the truth of the matter is that MIF and Green Door did not feel their proposed direction was artistically viable. It was decided by these producers that the show needed to go in a very different direction with a new writer attached, using Idris Elba’s original concept as the starting point.”The added: “Several offers were made to Tori Allen-Martin and Sarah Henley to discuss the future of the show, and how the producers could continue working with them, which they declined.”Henley and Allen-Martin, writing on the online publishing platform Medium, said the show was based on their work. “We put four years of work into that project, and the majority of those involved read our script, our proposal documents, our premise, and our synopsis – there is no way it’s a ‘different project’, no matter how much it’s changed.”The two writers said they had consulted lawyers and decided it would be too expensive to take the case to court. They said Tree’s producers had “continued to make financial offers to ‘buy us off’”.The show’s producers rejected that characterisation, saying offers were made in the spirit of reaching a compromise. They also denied a breach of any legal obligation, saying “Despite attempts by the producers to resolve the issue with them, they decided to instruct solicitors.”Henley and Allen-Martin said the most pressing issue was paying legal fees of £5,000 and have set up a donations page online to raise the money. Anything above that £5,000 figure will go towards a new organisation the pair have set up called Burn Bright, with the aim of driving positive change for female writers.He expressed sympathy for the two writers but rejected their version of events. “I understand the pain of being ‘released’ from a project.

Nearby were more signs of fresh pasture: short grass, feeding troughs, and salt for cattle.The vast 145,000-hectare (358,302-acre) farm is one of several owned by the company AgroSB Agropecuária SA – known in the region as Santa Bárbara. Located in an environmentally protected area, Lagoa do Triunfo is more than 600km (372 miles) from the capital of the Amazon state of Pará on the western fringes of Brazil’s “agricultural frontier” – where farming eats into the rainforest. To get there takes hours of driving along dirt roads and a ferry ride from nearby São Félix do Xingu, a cattle town accessible only by plane until a few decades ago.AgroSB supplies cattle to JBS, the world’s biggest meat packing company and single biggest supplier of beef, chicken and leather globally, with 350,000 customers in more than 150 countries.A joint investigation by the , Repórter Brasil and the Bureau of Investigative Journalism found that during 2018, the Lagoa do Triunfo farm delivered hundreds of heads of cattle to other farms also owned by AgroSB for fattening. Cattle was sent from those farms to slaughter in JBS plants.Embargos are imposed for environmental violations, such as farmers or landowners cutting down trees and deforesting illegally,  and serve both as a punishment and protective measure to allow land to recover. Between 2010-2013 at least 12 areas of land on Lagoa do Triunfo were embargoed, and Ibama fined AgroSB more than $18m (£14m) – at current rates – for deforestation on the Lagoa do Triunfo farm.Our investigative team visited land clearly demarcated as embargoed on government websites, and found cows grazing there. A farm worker said cattle were allowed to roam in areas employees knew were embargoed. “You can’t cut down the vegetation,” the employee said. “The vegetation grows and we work the cattle inside.”  is withholding their name in case of retaliation.Work by Stockholm-based NGO Trase, seen exclusively by our team, this week reveals the extent to which the international demand for beef is driving deforestation, with thousands of hectares of Amazon being felled every year to provide meat for world markets.AgroSB is a powerful farming empire owned by the Opportunity group, co-founded by Daniel Dantas, a controversial businessman Bloomberg described as the “bad boy” of Brazilian finance. It owns half a million hectares across Pará and has long attracted controversy. Over the past decade, AgroSB has been accused of illegal deforestation, keeping workers in slave-like conditions, and spraying a community occupying one of its farms with pesticides – accusations it has strongly denied.Scandal has also surrounded JBS, which is supplied by AgroSB. In 2017, following an Ibama investigation, the meat company was fined $7.7m for buying cattle from farms with embargoed areas, including another farm owned by AgroSB. The company pledged to stop buying cattle from the farm.That same year, Joesley Batista, CEO of its controlling company, almost brought down the government of President Michel Temer after secretly recording him appearing to endorse bribery – Temer was indicted but never tried and has always denied the charges, claiming the recording was edited. Joesley and his brother Wesley, then JBS CEO, admitted an extensive web of bribery in a plea bargain deal. In an email, a spokesman for AgroSB said any deforestation had occurred before the company acquired Lagoa do Triunfo in 2008. “AgroSB does not carry out deforestation in order to increase its area, but rather it recovers degraded areas. This brings social and environmental progress for all, because in the same area it is possible to produce more, without deforestation, in respect to the environment,” the spokesman said.“AgroSB’s business model is anchored in the acquisition of degraded open and pastured areas, which are fertilised, reclaimed and transformed into high-intensity pastures or grain plantations – which increases food production per hectare and also captures carbon dioxide (CO2) of the atmosphere in the plantations and in more than 250,000 hectares of forests (legal reserve) maintained on its properties.” He pointed out that: “There is no irregularity in the marketingtransfer of livestock.”With a population of 125,000 and more than two million cattle, the town of São Félix do Xingu covers an area bigger than Scotland. Cattle farming fed its growth from remote Amazon outpost to busy town, and there are clear signs of wealth here.Just outside town, big money was being splashed at a horse racing meet in a field full of 4x4s. As two jockeys spurred their horses down the rudimentary race track, a commentator bellowed and men waved wads of cash as their bets came in.There was more than $35,000 in prizes over two days of racing, said Valdiron Bueno, owner of two agricultural supplies shops and the race organiser. Bueno built his business more than 20 years after arriving here with just the clothes on his back. “It wasn’t easy. I cried a lot,” he said.São Félix do Xingu was mostly forest when Arlindo Rosa, now president of the town’s union of rural producers, arrived in 1993. “There was practically none of this farming … there was no highway, there was nothing,” he said. “People came from outside with the spirit to raise cattle,” said his vice-president, Francisco Torres, who arrived in 1987.Both men were critical of what they saw as overzealous environmental controls. Torres criticised Ibama as a “fines industry”, borrowing a phrase from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has dismantled environment protection and enjoys support from farmers like these. “How are you going to work if you can’t deforest an area, principally a small one?” said Rosa.But the embargos do not appear to have affected AgroSB’s business, the  and Réporter Brasil investigation found.A spokesman told the  via email: “JBS has a responsible purchase policy for raw materials and does not purchase animals from farms involved in deforestation of native forests, invasion of indigenous reserves or environmental conservation areas, or that are embargoed by the Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (Ibama).”Official state documents seen by the  and Repórter Brasil show that from January to October 2018, Santa Bárbara delivered at least 296 cattle from the Lagoa do Triunfo farm to its Espiríto Santo farm in Xinguara, in the same state.Between July and December 2018, Santa Bárbara sent least 1,977 cattle from the Espiríto Santo farm to two JBS slaughterhouses in Pará. In January at least 936 cattle were sent from the Espírito Santo farm to JBS’s slaughterhouse in Redenção in Pará.Throughout 2018, Santa Bárbara also sent at least 729 cattle from the Lagoa do Triunfo farm to be fattened at its Porto Rico farm in Xinguara. In April 2018, 36 cattle from the Porto Rico farm were sent to slaughter at JBS’s plant in Tucumã in Pará.Growing international demand for beef has become a key driver in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest, with new figures seen by our team revealing the full extent of deforestation directly linked to a handful of major food corporations. Beef linked to deforestation is exported globally, including to key markets in the east Asia and Europe.An investigation by Trase has uncovered how up to 5,800 sq km of forest is being felled in the Amazon and other areas annually to be converted into pasture used for cattle farming, with livestock from deforested areas found to be supplying abattoirs producing beef for global markets.Companies in JBS’s supply chain are potentially responsible for the destruction of between 28,000 and 32,000 hectares (280-320 sq km) of forest each year for exported beef, according to data assembled by Trase. There is no suggestion Lagoa do Triunfo beef is exported. AgroSB state that they purchased the land in 2008, after the deforestation had already happened. JBS points out that it has “one of the largest private supplier monitoring systems in the world… which covers the legal Amazon region.” It has been working on the GTA-Verde concept, which would cover all links in the supply chain and “prevent the entry of cattle from illegally deforested areas into the meat industry”.The latest data shows that deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has been on the rise since 2012. Between August 2017 and July 2018, about 7,900 sq km was destroyed.In the most comprehensive study of its kind ever produced, TRASE used customs, agricultural, sanitary inspection, and deforestation data to map Brazilian cattle exports from the international markets which consume them back to the more than 3000 municipalities where the cattle were raised.The analysis includes data on “indirect” suppliers, which are often intermediate farms that don’t sell directly to abattoirs, but supply other farms which may truck cattle to slaughter. This is a “previously invisible” part of the beef chain, say researchers, which is not monitored for deforestation risks.The supply chain “map” was then cross-referenced with official datasets on pasture expansion, deforestation rates and figures on regional cattle production in order to calculate a deforestation “risk” associated with specific companies and the main international export markets. Because of the high volume of Brazilian beef shipped to China and Hong Kong, these markets are associated with the highest amount of deforestation in total – 16,000 and 22,500 hectares per year – according to the analysis. The EU also imports more than $600m worth of beef from Brazil each year. And that will increase if the EU and member states approve a new trade deal with Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina and Paraguay to gradually let 99,000 tonnes of low-tariff South American beef into Europe every year.Erasmus zu Ermgassen, lead researcher at Trase, said that while some slaughterhouses monitor their direct suppliers, none monitor their indirect suppliers. “There is enormous potential to use land more efficiently and sustainably in the Brazilian beef sector, and to improve rural livelihoods by investing in cattle ranching on existing pasturelands.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2db4953e010c7ed78a613a98bb0b48da52050807/0_295_6588_3953/master/6588.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=985adef5fe4c7c35f865b7589588c820","title":"tory mps green manifesto urging more eco friendly policies","story":"Fracking ban and new environment act among influential group’s suggestionsFracking should be banned, the UK must take global leadership on the climate emergency and a royal commission should decide how to build homes in an environmentally sustainable manner, an influential group of Conservative MPs has said.The Conservative Environment Network (CEN) set out a manifesto on Tuesday that they said must govern the UK’s policies to prevent climate catastrophe and allow for greener economic growth. Among the 41 MPs who signed up to the pledges, which include a call for a new environment act, are senior figures such as Sir Nicholas Soames, Sir Oliver Letwin, Greg Hands, Caroline Spelman, Richard Benyon and Zac Goldsmith.Both Tory leadership contenders, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, offered assurances that they supported the broad aims of giving government policy more environmental focus, but stopped short of explicitly endorsing all of the plans.The initiative ned the Brexit ide, with Brexiters such as Sir Bernard Jenkin, Michael Fabricant and Tracey Crouch enlisting alongside pro-Europeans including Sir Roger Gale, Soames and Spelman.The principles include the net zero target on carbon emissions recently committed to by Theresa May, and the view that a “prosperous market economy” is the best way to achieve it – in contrast to the commitment by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to renationalise key industries such as energy.Support for onshore wind, though without subsidies, is among the pledges, despite the fact the government has put obstacles in the way of new onshore windfarms, leading to a sharp decline in renewable energy jobs.There should also be investment in regional transport networks, the manifesto said, and a system of road pricing that would replace the current fuel duty. After Brexit, the common agricultural policy should be replaced by a system that “brings public and private money into a single market-based scheme for natural capital restoration”. It calls for the common fisheries policy to be replaced with properly enforced maximum sustainable yields for fish populations.Rebecca Newsom, Head of Politics for Greenpeace UK, said: “This manifesto contains many transformative policies that, taken together, would constitute a significant step towards addressing the climate and nature emergency. “There are some important gaps that still need to be closed, including policies to limit aviation demand and block further fossil fuel exploration, but this is a very positive and important step forward.”In recent years the Conservative party has moved away from green policies such as subsidies for renewable energy, low-carbon homes standards and the flagship energy efficiency scheme, the Green Deal. Michael Gove, the environment secretary, who was not a signatory but spoke in favour of the manifesto at its launch, professed himself a “shy green Tory” and said there were many more in Conservative ranks. Seeking to reclaim the mantle of green concern as a Tory issue, he spoke of a love of the environment being core to the party’s beliefs. “That is at the heart of Conservatism,” he said.He spoke of the government’s work on marine conservation, green energy and natural protection, and the 25-year environmental plan, which was nearly shelved by Theresa May before being revived last year, when it was met with caution by environmental groups.Brexit would help the UK become more environmentally focused, rather than leading to the abandonment of environmental protections as many green groups have warned, Gove said. He cited fisheries as one example: “Leaving the EU gives us an opportunity to fundamentally change our support on marine protection.Richards added: “We have a record to be proud of, as one of the leading countries tackling climate change. But we know there is more to do, and the manifesto aims to present a space to discuss these potential future pathways.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a80b027179b6b35a63a330dff763451dc1189f6a/0_118_4182_2510/master/4182.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=889df1e0d0aad2598b8d7311a7358d8d","title":"viard quiet savoir faire first chanel couture show","story":"Designer nods to predecessors Coco Chanel and Karl Lagerfeld at Paris fashion weekby  Jess Cartner-Morley in ParisKarl Lagerfeld is no more, but Chanel remains the blockbuster event of any Paris fashion week.That was the message of Virginie Viard’s first haute couture show since taking over the Chanel design studio from her boss of three decades. Concealed within the Grand Palais, the temporary show set was an epic three-floored circular library in the style – and on the scale – of the British Museum’s original Reading Room, the three levels linked by traditional sliding staircases. As befits Chanel, arguably a giant of French culture itself, the shelves were stacked with Stendhal and Flaubert.The choice of a library – accessorised with metal-framed reading glasses on several models, and club-style slippers in place of the house’s traditional ballerina pumps – gave the occasion an air of calm, serene competence. Viard may have become a boldfaced name in fashion only this year, but she began overseeing haute couture under Lagerfeld in 1997. The atmosphere of quiet savoir-faire was a subtle reminder that this is not her first rodeo.“I dreamed about a woman with nonchalant elegance and a fluid and free silhouette, everything I like about the Chanel allure,” said Viard before the show. The dominant silhouette was tall and narrow. Mandarin collars on slender tweed coats, and vertical rows of contrasting buttons on a sumptuous raspberry velvet evening gown, accentuated the shape.Viard has not one but two ghosts at her shoulder in Karl Lagerfeld and Coco Chanel. The set was framed as a fantasy library for Coco, with stone lion bookends (Mademoiselle Chanel was a proud Leo) and art nouveau lamps to suggest the era of her youth. But staged in the same venue where less than two weeks ago the vast screens installed for Lagerfeld’s memorial played many scenes filmed in his personal library, there was also clear reference to Viard’s predecessor.The collection, too, held Coco and Karl in balance: the 1930s-style wide trousers, flat shoes, the models’ stance of slender nonchalance hinted at the house’s founder, but there were also homages to Karl. Lagerfeld’s handwriting worked in sequinned embroidery. White feathered ruffs were a reminder of Karl’s high white collars, which have slipped into the Chanel vernacular and are now as much an emblem of the house as the camellia.But the success of Viard’s tenure at Chanel will ultimately depend not on her ability to juggle Coco and Karl, but on whether she can breathe her own spirit into this house. The most exciting moments of this show, and of Viard’s cruise collection for Chanel two months ago, came when she channelled a mood of polished and dynamic 1980s glamour. The models wore glossy ponytails makeup emphasised bronzed cheekbones and strong eyebrows. A fuchsia tweed suit with blouson-style jacket and mid-thigh-length skirt brought a shot of newness so did an emerald green, halter-neck satin cocktail dress."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a10ce2a51a0c8eb4bda919beca6de28585f61606/0_190_3504_2102/master/3504.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6e0979555cd79a58faa739925ce1cf7b","title":"carry on films return","story":"The return of Britain’s direst comedy franchise is thankfully nothing but a recurring rumour – but the fact that it’s persisting is cause for national alarmGreat news! The Carry On films are coming back! Finally, a win for Britain. We might have become the global punchline to an unfunny joke, and things are almost certainly going to get worse, and we’re all going to die penniless and humiliated, scavenging for food with our broken fingernails, but the Carry On films are coming back! At last, we’ll get to show the world what we’re really good at: dirt cheap films that highlight our collective national fear of sexual arousal.Except they’re probably not coming back. Despite a flurry of excited noise last week, the truth is a little more mundane. Nobody is making a new Carry On film. All that’s happened is that the Intellectual Property Office invalidated some of ITV’s trademark rights to the series, allowing a film producer to begin planning a range of Carry On branded merchandise, which he hopes will eventually make enough money to fund a new film. Unless I’m sorely underestimating the appetite for novelty tit-shaped “Ooh, Matron!” mugs, it probably isn’t going to happen.Because the Carry On revival keeps not happening. It didn’t happen in 2016, when Variety announced that the writers of Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps were planning to make two new films entitled Carry on Doctors and Carry on Campus, because that fizzled away in a cloud of fraud allegations. And it didn’t happen in 2003, when a new film called Carry on London was announced, centring on a celebrity limousine firm and variously linked to Burt Reynolds, David Jason, Shane Richie, Danniella Westbrook, Vinnie Jones and Justin Lee Collins.And that’s probably for the best, because the last time someone successfully revived the Carry On series, the result was Carry on Columbus which is as good a reason as any never to try that nonsense again. Produced 14 years after the series sputtered out of its own accord, Carry on Columbus deserves to be seen as nothing less than a warning from history. It was a miserable, regressive, cheap-looking puddle of a film that received terrible reviews, took much less money than expected and was once named the worst British film of all time.And the saddest thing is, Carry on Columbus wasn’t that much worse than many golden age Carry On films. At their peak they were churned out twice yearly, with writer Talbot Rothwell managing 20 completed scripts in an 11-year period before bowing out from nervous exhaustion. Their production values were poor (the most expensive of the original run, Carry on Emmannuelle, still only cost £320,000). Their casts were badly paid and resentful. For every inspired one-liner, there were dozens of go-nowhere duds. My suspicion is that the people who love Carry On films the most haven’t seen them for a long time, because they don’t exactly hold up to scrutiny.The Carry On films existed in a weird pocket of time. The first, Carry on Sergeant, came out in the same year that Britain declined to participate in the Treaty of Rome. Instalments trotted along nicely until the series began to falter in the early 1970s, after the Treaty of Accession was signed. Then, the year that Carry on Columbus came out, Black Wednesday happened. It’s almost like the Carry On films can only succeed when Britain’s relationship with the rest of the world is at its weakest.So I take everything back. Of course Carry On films are coming back. The Carry On films are the cinematic equivalent of a blue passport. They’re the greengrocer who thinks that metric units of measurement are inherently treasonous. They’re the Britain that Brexit voters see when they close their eyes. Carry On is coming back, it will be awful, and we’ll deserve every second of it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e827f8c50fddb37cc2455973d3960c05808dff64/0_63_3075_1845/master/3075.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a37b594a7c7d1b20c35fb377f77f56a0","title":"the real story behind the greatest showman is one of exploitation its time we told it","story":"New First Nations cabaret Natives Gone Wild will reveal the shocking true history of Indigenous people and the circus – through song, dance and humourThe character of PT Barnum – the founder of the Barnum \u0026amp Bailey Circus, billed since 1919 as The Greatest Show On Earth – has been enjoying a pop culture resurgence with the recent blockbuster film The Greatest Showman and current Melbourne live show Barnum: The Circus Musical. Together, they celebrate him as both a visionary, and a scammer.I wonder if the world would consider this self-professed “humbug” light, innocuous entertainment if they knew he sent henchmen to the colonies to kidnap and coerce Aboriginal men, women and children, before casting them as “human oddities” in Barnum \u0026amp Bailey’s “show-stopping” exhibition The Ethnological Congress of Strange Tribes?In truth, Barnum tore apart families, denying them the ability to practice their culture, all the while exploiting the western world’s voyeuristic curiosity about the colonies.Many Aboriginal people who were kidnapped or lured to join Barnum’s circus understood this to be their new lot in life, and some even embraced it as a vehicle to lead a new secret existence away from the missions.To escape the Aboriginal Protection Board, which governed where Aboriginal people could live or work and quarantined all their wages, many performers hid their identity to get ahead. Several “Spanish” or “wild Indian” performers went on to become some of the greatest circus acts in the world. When tightrope walker Con Colleano, one of the highest paid vaudeville performers ever, died in Miami in 1973, not one Australian newspaper mentioned him. Yet across the Americas he was widely celebrated as “the Wizard of the Wire”.Colleano possessed enormous skill no one has perfected a forward somersault on a highwire since. But he had to change his name and identity at huge personal sacrifice to achieve what he did.To learn that Con Colleano was an Aboriginal man from Lismore brings an enormous sense of pride and inspiration to First Nations communities, showing them that they too can excel against all odds. Colleano lived between two worlds, and has left us an incredible legacy – along with other notable Aboriginal circus performers.Consider too the story of Tambo. Tambo was kidnapped along with 17 Indigenous men, women and children from the Hinchenbrook and Palm Island communities, and became a “star” attraction of Barnham’s circus in the late 1800s. When he died, his remains were embalmed and exhibited in Drew’s Dime Museum. His wife and other members of his family were unable to perform the customary death rituals necessary for him to go off to The Dreaming. His remains were only repatriated to Palm Island in 1994, where the rightful ceremony was conducted.It’s important that stories like Tambo’s and Colleano’s are told. That’s why we are excited for Natives Go Wild, the Sydney Opera House’s new First Nations cabaret, which shines a light on the dark underbelly of Barnum \u0026amp Bailey.Fundamentally, the show is about resilience. It inverts the story of Barnham and his “Greatest Show” through song, dance, and, of course, humour, which is so often used to deal with intergenerational trauma in Aboriginal culture.But while humour has a long history in Aboriginal theatre, Indigenous productions these days can sometimes move into ‘“worthy” or serious territory. Yes, there was a moment in history when we needed those stories, but I think we’ve moved on from there – and I’ve been interested in the fun aspect of cabaret and vaudeville for a long time. We want to engage audiences in all facets of First Nations culture, not just the serious dance or theatre shows.It’s important to share a global First Nations story too – one that s the Pacific, as we’re all connected. While fewer Fijians were kidnapped (access to them was more limited), some Polynesian women were taken to join Barnum’s “Human Zoo” in London, alongside Asian, Aboriginal, Pacific Islander, African, Canadian and American performers. Within six months, almost half of them had died from pneumonia. When Barnum’s money spinning “Fijian Mermaid” passed away, he crudely grafted a monkey with a fish, which people travelled the world to marvel at. It’s still on display at Coney Island, although the monkey has now lost all its hair.For me, Natives Go Wild is about honouring the pain and resilience of First Nations people. We are incredibly adaptable. We can encounter the worst situations and wake up to tackle the next day with optimism and hope, to fulfil our inherited cultural legacy. The next generation of First Nations artists are sticking it to the establishment and having some fun in the process.• Natives Go Wild makes its world premiere at Sydney Opera House on 19 October 2019• Rhoda Roberts is the head of First Nations programming at Sydney Opera House"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50c11a1970e8a93c057d27dab0319683d31f7341/0_1348_5483_3290/master/5483.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=cf933df7b5d22ad450286474a348de16","title":"nigel slater clams broad beans and fettuccine recipe","story":"Seafood pasta with tender green veg and a hint of vermouthCook 300g of broad beans in boiling water for 5-7 minutes until tender then drain.

Given this support and City’s reticence to meet the asking price, United are the favourites to sign the defender. Leicester’s demand for the 26-year-old is believed to exceed the £75m Liverpool paid Southampton for Virgil van Dijk in January last year. Maguire has told his club’s board he would like a move and his preference is thought to be to join City. The England international hopes he will not be priced out of a transfer.The finance remains available for United to make a serious move for Maguire despite the club having spent a combined initial £60m on Aaron Wan-Bissaka and Daniel James.Although City view Leicester’s stance as unrealistic, it remains to be seen whether they may be drawn into a bidding war for Maguire. When Pep Guardiola became manager in summer 2016 he identified Everton’s John Stones as his No 1 target. After initially resisting the valuation of the centre-back, City did eventually pay around £47m for him.The previous summer the club followed a similar pattern regarding Liverpool’s Raheem Sterling – eventually agreeing a total £49m transfer – yet City did drop interest in Van Dijk because of Southampton’s valuation.United have not given up hope David de Gea will sign a new contract, though club and player remain some distance from an agreement.De Gea’s terms expire next summer after United were forced to trigger the goalkeeper’s one-year extension clause. The Spaniard’s representatives are in discussions with United’s hierarchy. Ed Woodward, the club’s executive vice-chairman, and Matt Judge, the head of corporate development, remain optimistic De Gea can be persuaded to commit his future.Any new offer would place De Gea in a similar pay bracket to Paul Pogba, who earns around £290,000 a week. De Gea is in a powerful negotiating position as United do not want him to leave for free next summer. If the 28-year-old refuses to sign a deal United may try to sell him in the current window to recoup a fee.United are continuing the search for a technical director, who will assist in the long-term strategy of the club, but Rio Ferdinand, who had been in the frame, is now thought to be only an outside candidate."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7b37243da41ee1aadbb2dd773827e80dd239c7e3/438_75_2228_1337/master/2228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91931e9e19120e9288b3e165b3ee5cc3","title":"tanguy ndombele tottenham medical lyon roma toby alderweireld","story":"• France midfielder passes medical to become record signing• Roma considering move for Toby AlderweireldTanguy Ndombele has signed a six-year contract at Tottenham after passing a medical. The club have shattered their transfer record to buy the midfielder from Lyon for €62m (£55.45m) plus €10m in add-ons – eclipsing the £42m paid to Ajax for Davinson Sánchez in 2017.The 22-year-old was Mauricio Pochettino’s No 1 target and Spurs were able to see off late interest from Manchester United. Pochettino has convinced six-times capped France international that the next step of his career would be best served at Tottenham and Ndombele was impressed when shown around the training ground.Jean-Michel Aulas, the Lyon chairman, has maintained that Ndombele is worth €75m and he is line to virtually get his price. What Spurs will get is a player to quicken the pulse, a central midfielder to replace Mousa Dembélé, mixing skill and electric dribbling with raw power.Roma are considering a move for the Spurs centre-half Toby Alderweireld, and the idea has been floated that the Italian club’s midfielder Nicolò Zaniolo could be part of a deal. That would involve Spurs paying a surplus because Alderweireld, 30, is available for £25m this month due to a clause in his contract and Zaniolo, a 20-year-old prospect, is rated in the £40m bracket.Spurs are open to bids for the full-backs Kieran Trippier and Danny Rose and they put their names forward to Roma only to be told there is no interest in either. But they would be open to taking Alderweireld, who has entered the final year of his deal and can be signed at a discount provided that the transfer is completed at least 14 days before the window closes on 8 August.Roma, who finished sixth in Serie A, are looking for central defenders after selling Kostas Manolas to Napoli for €36m and they also like Marc Bartra of Real Betis. Alderweireld is weighing up whether to see out his deal at Spurs.Zaniolo is on Spurs’ wish-list after his breakthrough season at Roma and the London club have held talks with his representatives. There remains the expectation that Spurs will sell their playmaker Christian Eriksen, which would greatly help to balance the books, after he announced that he wanted a new challenge at another club. Real Madrid are interested in him, as are Juventus, whose new manager, Maurizio Sarri, is a big fan.Trippier’s future has been under the spotlight and if he leaves it could see Spurs move for either the Norwich right-back Max Aarons or Fulham’s Steven Sessegnon. Spurs are keen to sign Sessegnon’s twin, Ryan, also of Fulham, who is rated at £25m.Tottenham have completed the signing of the winger Jack Clarke from Leeds for around £10m, rising to a possible £11.5m, and have loaned the 18-year-old back to Elland Road for the season."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3af46490c85c524a27820ff347ceeba57361174b/0_71_2050_1230/master/2050.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9eded3873cf0238837959a69923c27a3","title":"usa england womens world cup match report","story":"They have won new friends and influenced plenty of opinions during a transformative month in France but the Rhône was swelled by English tears last night as Phil Neville’s Lionesses proved second best to the defending champions.England and their manager can head to Nice for Saturday’s third-place play off with heads held high though after a wonderful game featuring some particularly harsh luck, most notably the marginal offside which saw a White goal disallowed, a missed penalty by Steph Houghton and the sending off of Millie Bright after two yellow cards. Well before the end, USA had paid England the compliment of shifting to five at the back.The teamsheet made intriguing reading. Megan Rapinoe proved a shock USA absentee and, as the “is she injured or dropped for disciplinary reasons” debate swirled in the sultry evening air, the English contingent joked that America’s outspoken social activist-cum-left-winger may have no fear of standing up to Donald Trump but Lucy Bronze was something else entirely.As expected, Bronze remained at right-back but Neville, too, refreshed his side, switching formation for the first time in France.Twitter: follow us at @_sportFacebook: like our football and sport pagesInstagram: our favourite photos, films and storiesYouTube: subscribe to our football and sport channelsOne change was enforced, a hamstring pull dictating that Karen Bardsley was replaced by Carly Telford in goal. Otherwise Rachel Daly was deployed in front of Bronze on the right of a new-look 4-4-1-1 configuration which also saw Toni Duggan and Fran Kirby dropped, Beth Mead introduced on the left and Nikita Parris moved up front just behind Ellen White.Not that England did too much attacking in an opening period dominated by Jill Ellis’s side and featuring Parris persistently being forced to drop deep and track back. Neville had predicted that a set of players with a useful habit of scoring early goals would want to “throw the first punch here” and so it transpired.As Rapinoe’s replacement, Christen Press had a point to prove and she had already shown off a devastating change of pace before supplying the US with a 10th-minute lead. It came from a cross, Kelley O’Hara providing an inch-perfect right-wing dispatch for Press to head home, the winger rising imperiously above Bronze who had been caught badly out of position at the back post.At that point England looked in severe peril of being overwhelmed. They were snatching at the ball and conceding possession far too cheaply but then Ellis’s side momentarily seemed to lose concentration – or perhaps take a breather in the 28C night-time heat.Sensing a rare opening, Keira Walsh quite brilliantly played Mead in with a visionary diagonal ball and her curving left-wing cross was met on the volley by Ellen White’s outstretched toe cap. The ball flew beyond Alyssa Naeher and into the bottom corner as White celebrated her sixth goal in five games. Maybe Neville was not being quite so fanciful when he described her as a cross between Ruud van Nistelrooy, Alan Shearer and Michael Owen.The manner in which White had bisected the central defenders offered England hope and their manager became so excited he had to be ticked off for sprinting on to the pitch in jubilation.It did not last. Telford had earlier performed wonders to deny Rose Lavelle but she had no riposte to yet another goal from a cross – who said they had gone out of fashion? – at the end of a classically rapid USA counterattack.This time the fabulous delivery came from Lindsey Horan whose whipped-in ball found Demi Stokes suffering a temporary lapse in focus, enabling Alex Morgan to mark her 30th birthday by heading emphatically home.Ellis’s captain had hitherto been virtually, deceptively, anonymous but her movement across a bewildered Stokes was simply bewitching and fully deserved to preface her own sixth goal of the tournament.Few could argue the USA did not merit their half-time lead but, to England’s immense credit, they repeatedly rallied, refusing to fold. Indeed they could conceivably have gone in level at the interval had Naeher not made an acrobatic fingertip save to ert Walsh’s 25-yard thunderbolt as it whizzed on its apparently inexorable trajectory towards the top corner.If that made theories Ellis’s goalkeeper was her team’s weak link look distinctly fanciful, no one could argue this semi-final was anything less than a sensational advert for the women’s game. Or that Neville was right to be privately worried about the sheer physical power of this American side.The time had come for Neville to earn his money and he responded by reverting to 4-2-3-1 by replacing Mead with a natural No10 in Kirby and relocating Parris to her more familiar right-wing beat in front of Bronze.Neville is big on standing by his principles and philosophy but he deserves plaudits for acknowledging he got his starting system wrong and rectifying it by reverting to a more effective framework.Until then the US had literally been pressing England into submission, smothering any creativity out of them but, with Kirby suddenly confusing Ellis’s players by ghosting between the lines, gaps suddenly began appearing. Jill Scott too appeared newly liberated and enjoyed a generally excellent second half. Walsh – justifying her selection ahead of Jade Moore – played a superb pass into one such space, permitting Scott to flick the ball into White’s path. The striker’s left foot finish looked to angle done the rest but Ellis immediately requested a VAR check and the goal was disallowed for the tightest of offsides against White.The look on Neville’s face spoke of searing disappointment but he took take mild encouragement from the injury which had forced the impressively influential Lavelle off. On the other hand Ellis had ordered a switch to five at the back as she instructed her side to sit back, protect their lead and see the game out.That plan swiftly went awry when Kirby slipped a pass to Stokes who crossed for White only for the striker to be sent tumbling.It did not look a penalty but a lengthy VAR check ensued and concluded with the Brazilian referee pointing to the spot. Houghton stepped forward but her penalty lacked power and Naeher saved.As things unravelled Millie Bright was sent off for a second yellow card, namely a foul on Morgan."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed413c1c4fb4c6884513c1b6c9e7aeb63202bcd1/0_54_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9081c37fc15c10e9b74331cc80e0ba71","title":"where are you watching the womens world cup semi finals and with whom","story":"If you’re a fan of the World Cup and will be watching it with friends and family, we’d like to hear from you England face the USA on Tuesday, with many hoping their team reaches the final on Sunday.

Problem being, the USA - the reigning champions and the best team in the world - were just that little bit better. The USA will play either the Netherlands or Sweden in the World Cup final on Sunday England will face off against the losing team on Saturday in the third-place match. Congratulations to the Americans commiserations to England. All that’s left is to guide you towards Louise Taylor’s match report. Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night, wherever you are!An emotional Ellen White talks to the BBC. “I’m gonna cry.” She takes a moment to wipe away the tears before bravely gathering herself. “Obviously I’m devastated not to get to the final. But all I feel is pride, proud of my team-mates. The USA had an amazing match, we couldn’t quite match them. I’m disappointed about the one that was offside. But I’m just proud to be English, and wish the USA the best of luck in the final. But I’m devastated.” Could England have done any more tonight, she’s asked. “Scored!” A big laugh, the gallows humour in full effect. “The first half we were a little bit sloppy but got ourselves back into the game. In the second half we tried to play and created some chances. We’ve got an unbelievable squad, and we had belief that we could make the final. But it wasn’t quite enough, and we look forward to the third-place final.” As for her friend Steph Houghton? “It takes a lot of courage to step up and take a penalty. It happens. Keepers save penalties. We’ll never put anything on Steph, she’s our leader. We’ll rally round her.”Victorious US coach Jill Ellis speaks! “I can’t express how proud I am. It was such a great effort. We had some challenges in terms of bodies, and everyone stepped up, and that’s what this team are about. That was Alyssa Naeher’s shining moment, though we’ve got one more game. What a frickin’ stop! I couldn’t be more proud of this group of players. Stay humble, we’ve got one more.”Tea party. Alex Morgan celebrated what turned out to be the winner by pretending to sip a nice cup of splosh. Details of this seismic event can be found in our latest bid for the Pulitzer Prize below.Finally Neville has a word for the captain Steph Houghton, who will perhaps be hurting most tonight after missing the crucial penalty. “She’s an amazing person on and off the pitch. She’ll deal with it the way that she does. She’ll look forward. She’ll be upset, she’ll be disappointed, but she’s been phenomenal, and no blame should be attached to her. That’s football, that’s sport. We’ll go again.”As for the VAR decisions and the sending off ... “The disallowed goal was offside. We’ve had VAR decisions that have gone our way. We got on with it, we came back. We got the penalty. You score them, you miss them. That’s football. And Millie shouldn’t have got booked in the first half, 100 percent. I thought the referee wasn’t in control of the game, to be honest with you, but she sent Millie off. We went to three at the back, and it became stretched. But I can’t ask for anything more. We’ve had the time of our lives, and they’ve really played their hearts out.”An emotional but proud Phil Neville speaks. “My players gave me everything. We said before the game, we wanted to leave our hearts and souls on the pitch, and they did. They gave everything. We’ve gone toe-to-toe with the best team in the world. They’ve showed great experience at the end with taking the ball into the corner. We went down to ten when we ran out of steam. But I asked them to play football the way I wanted them to play. We’ve come to this tournament and done our very best, we’ve not left anything in that dressing room, and I’ve told them there should be no tears tonight. We should be proud. We’ve touched the hearts of the nation back home, and they’ve left their hearts on that football field. So I’m happy.”Ellen White is in floods. No World Cup final for her, or England, despite her tournament tally of six goals. She’s been magnificent, scoring one tonight and earning a penalty lifeline that her captain Steph Houghton couldn’t grab. Tears for Lucy Bronze, too, as she lets out a sob and allows her shoulders to slump. Poor England. It’s going to be a long night. But the USA were too good over the entire piece, and deserved winners. Wearing perhaps the widest smile as they celebrate: Megan Rapinoe, who bounces onto the field of play to embrace her team-mates. A win over the Netherlands or Sweden on Sunday, and a fourth World Cup is theirs!The reigning holders reach their third World Cup final in a row! And England fall at the semi-final stage, just as they did four years ago.90 min +6: Moore sends a harmless shot miles wide right from distance. She had options either side as the USA desperately held their shape. That was England’s last chance, surely.90 min +5: Parris is cautioned for barging into the back of Lloyd, as the US striker kills time near a corner flag.90 min +4: Stokes lets the ball slip from her hands mid-throw. An elementary mistake at a time England simply can’t afford one.90 min +3: Bronze scampers down the right. But her cross is no good, and Lloyd can make her way into the space vacated by the England right-back. Lloyd doesn’t really go anywhere, eventually checking back and losing possession, but that clock keeps on keepin’ on.90 min +2: A long ball. Parris rises to flick a header on. Naeher gathers. The clock ticks on.90 min: But there’s going to be seven additional minutes, a legacy of those VAR checks. The USA have one foot in the final ... but ten-woman England aren’t out of this yet!89 min: England’s last throw of the dice, as Stanway comes on for Daly. The USA are pressing England back in their final third. Parris is getting extremely agitated about the time they take over a throw.87 min: How quickly the bottom fell out of England’s world back there. The USA take the sting out of the game by swapping O’Hara for Krieger, and taking their sweet time about it. England would do the same.86 min: Bright slides in, studs up on Morgan. It’s reckless, and over the ball. There’s not much contact, but that’s not really the point. It could have been a straight red it’s just a second yellow. The referee Edina Alves Batista nearly does a Graham Poll, momentarily forgetting that she’d already shown Bright a card. But someone points it out, and Bright’s on her way.84 min: That wasn’t a good penalty kick, but it still required Naeher to guess the correct way. She’s America’s hero right now. It was the right decision to award the spot kick, by the way. Sauerbrunn did make contact with White’s boot from behind.83 min: The captain Steph Houghton squanders the chance to equalise! She sidefoots towards the bottom left, but hits it poorly, and Naeher smothers the ball!82 min: After what seems like an interminable wait, the ref points to the spot and books Sauerbrunn! It’s a penalty!80 min: Heath is replaced by Carli Lloyd. But the game doesn’t restart with a goal kick, because that White-Sauerbrunn challenge has gone to VAR! Is this a penalty?79 min: White misses a huge chance! Kirby spins in the midfield to make space, then sends Stokes into the USA box. Stokes rolls a pass across the front of the six-yard box. White will surely sidefoot home ... but under pressure from Sauerbrunn, she takes a fresh-air swipe. White claims there’s been contact. The referee isn’t interested.78 min: A loose pass out of defence by Bright has England on the back foot. O’Hara, who has worked the right flank well, nearly bursts clear. But not quite.76 min: Heath goes down in order to get some treatment. And maybe to catch her breath. She’s not the only one who needs it. Everyone takes the opportunity to make for the touchline and take a bang of an isotonic beverage.75 min: It’s all a bit scrappy now, as the teams tire. Some passes aren’t sticking. Other passes are a mile off target. And no wonder: it’s hot in Lyon.73 min: If nothing else, that disallowed goal will at least give England some hope. They have the ability to carve the USA open. But they don’t have much time left in which to do it again (and this time to specifications that will keep VAR happy).71 min: Keira Walsh has arguably been England’s best player tonight. But she’s tiring, and so on comes Jade Moore.69 min: The equaliser’s ruled out by VAR! It’s the correct decision, but it’s oh so tight. White had one hand and half a boot offside. She’s stuck on six goals. And England are still going home as things stand. Shame for England, because that was such a lovely move."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e9206a2c284087fb54391cf907e341dc2300b8/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0027994a2e7c8ce81d6ef35b99c0cf4a","title":"can you pet the dog the purity of petting pixelated puppies","story":"@CanYouPetTheDog has more than 250,000 followers, including game developers, but most are just digital dog enthusiastsGames often feature dogs but player interaction is generally limited to violent, negative verbs – attack, shoot, kill. Now one wildly popular Twitter account is dedicated to championing the games that allow us to interact positively with our pixelated pals.@CanYouPetTheDog is a journal of record initially inspired by the virtual strays of Ubisoft’s military shooter game, The Division 2, and covers everything from unlikely candidates such as Super Smash Brothers Ultimate to the aptly named Dog Petting Simulator (video above).“I saw many others lamenting the lack of dog petting, and thought there might be interest in a hyperspecific catalogue.”Interest is putting it mildly. At time of writing, the account has more than 250,000 followers – many of them game developers and other influential members of the industry, but the vast majority simple digital dog enthusiasts.“On a base level, it feels nice to pet a real-life dog, so a digital approximation will almost always hold appeal,” says the creator, who posits the “purity and innate goodness” of petting as a major draw alongside more personal reasons such as nostalgia.“Petting a dog in a video game rarely yields tangible rewards, like loot or experience,” they explain. “It is a simple, typically brief interaction that exists almost entirely because it is pleasant.“In an industry where living, never-ending games increasingly demand more and more of the player’s time, energy and focus, petting a dog can feel like a pressure release.”Though the account is a simple catalogue of games that let players pat dogs, its popularity is such that its creator is careful about the games that they feature.“I grew worried that the account’s apparent influence might put pressure on small development teams,” the creator says. Many indie games like Afterparty or Crosscode have, since the account’s creation, begun adding updates specifically to add dog-petting.“My worst nightmare would be a harassment campaign springing forth as a result of one of my posts.”The account is also notable for its support of a variety of social issues aside from the goodness of dogs, among them trans rights and game development unionisation. “I felt apprehensive about having a somewhat large platform and neglecting to use it to support worthy causes,” the creator says. “If the account’s modicum of influence can be used for even the smallest good, I see no reason why I should not try to help those in need any way I can.”Still, it’s most likely the account’s own purity of purpose that draws fans, though recent forays into “casual Fridays” involving other dog-related interactions such as hugging, shaking paws, or being revived from death by dogs has also won approval.“I’ve seen replies that state something like ‘hugging a dog is just petting it with your whole body’,” the creator says, “though I think petting the dog owes its charm to its simplicity and specificity.”Asked for a specific dog-positive interaction to highlight, the creator nominated the 1981 classic Zork II, the earliest recorded game in which you can pat the dog, in this case a three-headed Cerberus who reacts with “doggish joy”.“This 38-year-old text adventure proves that as long as video games existed, people have wanted to pet the dog,” they say. “Can you blame them?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f4a1538b2c392afd0095f7cdf6f97d3d0dcebba/0_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f226d41be96083df52b25d39f20e2756","title":"how to tell your best friend youre in love with them by those who have taken the plunge","story":"Popular culture is littered with examples of great love blossoming from platonic beginnings. But in real life, falling for your best friend doesn’t always go so smoothlyIt was supposed to go the way things do in the movies. Nora would tell her best friend that she loved him, he would feel the same way and then they would kiss – preferably in the rain. So when the 30-year-old arts manager declared her love for her best friend when they were still teenagers, she expected a happy ending. “I was so convinced that if you’re best friends and one of you starts getting feelings, the other person would match you.” Sadly, that was not to be the case.“I said: ‘I’m in love with you and we should give it a go,’” Nora remembers, “and he couldn’t really meet my eye. I was like: ‘Oh God, oh God, I’ve made a massive mistake!’” He said some kind words and let her down gently. Humiliated, Nora began to cry.If there is one thing pop culture can agree on, it is that platonic friendship can turn to great romance – hence the genre-defining When Harry Met Sally, Ross’s mad airport dash in Friends and Ron and Hermione’s marriage in the Harry Potter novels.“You see that trope again and again,” Nora says. “They’re like brother and sister, then something magical happens and they start to see that person differently.” But, in real life, things don’t always work out well. What is the best way to tell a friend you are in love with them?Sit with your feelings for a while, advises Simone Bose, a relationship therapist at Relate. “If you are going to take that step, ask yourself: are you serious about this?” Look for signals that they might be romantically interested in you. “Is it an intense friendship? Does it sometimes feel like boundaries are crossed?” Clues might be if you keep touching each other, or avoid talking about sexual partners around them.Nora wishes she had read the signs. “He hadn’t given me any indication that he was interested in me romantically at all, and friends had tried to say that to me very gently, but I wasn’t hearing it.”Keith, who is 61 and from Bristol, has loved a close friend for more than a decade, during which time he has even put her in his will – but has decided against telling her. “I love her to bits,” he explains, “but I daren’t bring that up because it could unhinge what we currently have.” He does his best to be philosophical: “Hey ho – we don’t always get what we want.”Perhaps he needs a “Cupid”. That’s how Janette Miller, 76, describes the man who helped her towards a very happy 30-year marriage. “Miles was 34 and I was 21 we met when we were learning to ice skate. Miles became my friend and dance partner for eight years. But, to him, I was just a pair of skates on legs. One day, our mutual friend Noel told me I ought to marry Miles. I said that he would be perfect, but he never saw me that way. Luckily for me, Noel had said the same thing to Miles – and Miles then started to court me.”If you are unsure whether your best friend may have feelings for you, Bose has a simple solution. “Flirt! Try and get a gauge on whether they’re reacting in a positive way, or if they look really uncomfortable.” Be warned: the flirting may go over their head. When 28-year-old publicist Asher Alexander, from Barnet, asked his best friend, Rae, to the cinema, he thought it was clear he was asking her on a date. But his intentions were lost on her. “After the movie, I said: ‘Look, we should make this an official thing and date properly.’” Rae was so shocked she laughed in his face. Happily, she softened over time six years later, they are getting married.What you shouldn’t do is tell your friend you love them when you are drunk or high. “You can behave in a more emotionally catastrophic way,” Bose warns. “Things can get out of hand quite quickly. So have the confidence to share your feelings when you’re sober.” Keira, 28, learned this the hard way after confessing her feelings for her best friend after taking MDMA on a night out. “It wasn’t just like: ‘I’m high and I’m just saying this because I’m high,’” the editor, from London, clarifies. “I genuinely believed it at the time. I’d been thinking it for ages and blurted it out before I’d processed it.” He responded positively and they made plans to go on a date. But as it neared, Keira started having doubts. “I’d think: ‘Do I actually fancy him? He’s a great guy, but I couldn’t imagine us having sex.’” So she did something she profoundly regrets: she ghosted him. “It is probably the absolute worst thing I’ve ever done to a friend.”Alex, 27, who works in the fashion industry, fell in love with his best friend. When they met in 2015, “it was love at first sight”. They bonded over everything – their childhoods, values and favourite photographers. “I connected with him in a way that I have connected with few human beings on this Earth.” But Alex has never said anything. Why? Because his friend is straight. “There was nothing to be gained from telling him, because I knew he didn’t like me in that way.”Eventually, Alex had to take a step back from the friendship because it became too painful. He knows he made the right choice. “I believe he knows and, in my heart of hearts, I believe he did love me back in some way. He used to say I was like his soulmate, or brother – like a soul brother. I didn’t believe in love at first sight or soulmates until I met him. If there’s a platonic version of a soul mate …” He tails off. “The connection was very strong and very real.”Be mindful of how you transition from a physical relationship to a sexual one. For 31-year-old copywriter Tom, who has been in a relationship with his best friend for two years, it came easily. “The sex was totally mental and as soon as that happened we were both like: ‘Well, if we’re best mates and the sex is mental ... we’ve been inseparable ever since.” But what if the sex feels awkward, like you’re kissing your brother or sister? “Go with the flow and what your desires are, rather than forcing it,” says the sex therapist Miranda Christophers. If at any point it doesn’t feel right, take some time out. “Think about why it’s not feeling right. Focus on that feeling and ask yourself: ‘Am I just feeling nervous, or is it actually that I don’t really want to be doing this?’ In which case, you need to remember that they are your friend, first and foremost, and you should be honest with them and say: ‘It’s not feeling right.’”When things go right, falling in love with your best friend can be magical. “I have nothing to hide from her,” says Alexander. “I can be my most complete self, and open, and I never have to succumb to any of that bullshit toxic masculinity where I have to ‘be the man’.”The downside? “It can be claustrophobic,” says Tom. “Sometimes we’ll be having a tiff and our group WhatsApp will go off and I see her respond to it – even though she’s ignoring my messages.” Alexander has never been able to keep a secret from Rae, because she knows him so well. “She’s so good at reading me – from my tone of voice to my facial expression. It’s just really hard to keep things on the downlow. I don’t think I’ve ever got her a surprise gift without her knowing what it is a week before.”And what if the relationship doesn’t work out? In a word: communicate. “Say: ‘This is hard, but let’s work this out, because we want to be friends,’” Bose advises. “That can be tricky, because once you’ve gone over the line it’s hard to go back. But it’s not impossible.” Ellen, a 26-year-old HR manager from Ashford, is proof you can transition back to friendship amicably. She discovered her love for her best friend like they do in the movies – by kissing him in the rain. (It was less cinematic than it sounds: they were drunk, waiting for a night bus and standing beside some bins.) After three years of dating, they broke up in 2016. “The passion had gone and it was back to us being friends again.” As they both felt the same way at the same time, the breakup was frictionless. “Our friendship is still as strong. I can talk to him about anything at any time.”Some names and identifying details have been changed.

They met on a Russian-language websiteIn 2015, Emma joined a language website. She was looking for someone to practise her Russian with and she didn’t want a boyfriend – besides, she already had one. It quickly became clear many people were on there to flirt or get together. “When I saw Dmitry’s profile picture, I expanded it to see whether he looked like he might be a bit sleazy,” she says with a laugh. But he was, she says, “the first person I met who seemed relatively normal”.They started talking by Skype, about twice a week. Was there a spark? “I don’t think I thought of you in any romantic terms,” Emma says to Dmitry. “We were very clear this was just about language. I liked you and I thought you had a nice smile, but I didn’t think anything else.” Dmitry says his “mood was better every time after we’d had a chat. I felt really positive. But I think it started only when we finally met in person.”A year later, they met in St Petersburg, where Emma had gone for a 10-day language course. She spent three days with Dmitry and his brother. “We never actually spent any time alone together,” she says. She admits to thinking he was “quite good-looking. Because I was in a relationship, I suppressed it. I think I also thought: ‘What’s the point? He’s in Russia, so it wouldn’t work anyway.’”Apart again, they started to text more frequently. “I noticed I was thinking about her all the time,” says Dmitry. “I was trying to engage in different things and I tried to deny the whole idea I had feelings for her, because I thought: what are the chances for us to be together?” He tried not to text Emma, but lasted all of two weeks. One morning, he sent a text asking: “Do you think we’d be good in a relationship?” Emma had been thinking about him, too. She broke up with her boyfriend and they started messaging “pretty much continuously”. “At some point, we realised we should meet again and spend time together, just us,” says Dmitry.Emma went to St Petersburg in September 2016. “I worried that maybe it was an infatuation and that spending time together would make us realise it wouldn’t work,” she says. “The first few days, it felt a bit awkward – we weren’t in a relationship, we didn’t know whether to hold hands or not. As time went on it got more comfortable and by the end of the holiday we were like: OK, let’s give it a go.”It was difficult for Dmitry to get a visa to the UK, so they met in between every three months in countries such as Georgia and the Czech Republic. This continued for 18 months until they decided to get married, which they did in Moscow in February last year. Dmitry was introduced to Emma’s family the night before at the airport Emma met her new mother-in-law for the first time in the taxi on the way to the register office.Back in the UK, she started the long process of getting a spouse visa for Dmitry, who had had to stay in Russia. At the same time, the novichok poisonings were unfolding and relations between the UK and Russia were breaking down. “All my friends were like: ‘Do you think that’s going to affect the visa decision?’ and I said: ‘Of course not Dmitry’s not an oligarch or anything,’” says Emma. “But I got a bit nervous – and then we got rejected.”They were told Dmitry’s English language qualification wasn’t valid, even though it was. “It was really stressful,” says Emma. “I didn’t know if it was a mistake or they were rejecting him for some other reason.”A month later, as they were about to start the expensive and time-consuming reapplication, the Home Office said their case had been reviewed and they were granted a visa. Dmitry arrived in the UK three weeks later they had been apart for five months. “We’re really happy,” says Emma. “It’s really nice not having to look at each other on a screen.”Want to share your story?

Top talent requires top money, goes the argument, and the market for sports rights means Lineker could expect something similar from commercial rivals.If you’re a member of the Conservative government, the controversy over salaries – and subsequent attempts to fix them – is the intended result of a decision in 2016 to force the BBC to publish details of employees earning more than £150,000 a year. That turned the publication of the annual report from a dull story into an annual jamboree of BBC criticism.If you’re one of the 25.4 million British households with a TV licence, you may take the view that the seven pence a year you pay towards the Match of the Day presenter’s salary is small change in the scale of things.If you’re one of the millions of over-75s who are to lose their free TV licence, which provides many with a lifeline to the outside world, you might recognise that it’s small change while still objecting as you struggle to find £154.50 a year on pain of criminal prosecution to subsidise Lineker’s wages.If you’re a prominent male BBC presenter who has been forced to take a substantial pay cut – while the Lineker-led football pundit class enjoy pay rises – you might be wondering whether there are any jobs going in the commercial sector.If you’re a prominent BBC woman, you might be wondering how the BBC is celebrating progress in the gender pay gap while also pointing that, in the words of one household name, “we were told rather dramatically of male presenters’ pay cuts last year but some of these seem to have seen pay go up instead”.And if you’re Netflix or one of the other companies looking to muscle in on the BBC’s traditional territory, you might be asking why so much fuss is being made about what is, in the world of global entertainment, a relatively trivial salary for a well-known presenter.The BBC is stuck between its dual status as a hulking beast of the UK media scene and, increasingly, a relative minnow on the global stage. At home it continues to run popular and unpopular TV stations, mass market national radio stations and worthy but niche local stations. It provides sports coverage and a dominant website, the World Service and research projects, all while having to deal with real-terms cuts in income.And yet while much of the British media industry continues to look enviously at its licence-fee funding and audience reach, the BBC is fighting to stop everyone from David Attenborough to top-tier British drama talent being tempted by Netflix’s sky-high budgets. And it has to do this while being a political punchbag, the potential future prime minister Boris Johnson last week calling it the “Brexit Bashing Corporation”.In truth, the real threat to the BBC’s future isn’t the annual row over how much it pays one ex-footballer to introduce Premier League highlights, it’s how will be able to secure a longterm future when younger Britons are wondering what they get in return for the licence fee.

Other highly paid sports pundits include Jermaine Jenas on £210,000 a year and Ian Wright on £205,000, while John McEnroe is paid £190,000 for taking part in the BBC’s Wimbledon coverage.While many leading male news and current affairs presenters – including Huw Edwards, Jeremy Vine and Nicky Campbell – took substantial pay cuts following a public outcry over their salaries, the sports department instead increased the amount it pays to on-screen pundits such as Shearer and Wright in the past year.The BBC director general, Tony Hall, defended Lineker’s salary and said he provided value for money for viewers.The annual pay disclosures only cover staff who earn at least £150,000 a year while working directly for the BBC. They do not include presenters and actors employed by independent production companies to make programmes on the BBC’s behalf.As a result, many prominent figures associated with BBC hits such as Strictly Come Dancing, Top Gear and Doctor Who – which are made by the commercial BBC Studios arm – do not feature on the list.Even those high BBC salaries are though to pale in comparison to the sums paid by commercial rival ITV to its top stars, such as Ant and Dec.The figures, contained in the corporation’s annual report, will come under increased scrutiny after the BBC announced plans to scrap the free TV licence for most over-75s, arguing it needed the money to protect investment in programming.The BBC chairman, David Clementi, blamed the government for the licence fee decision. “This was not a decision we wanted to take and it was a decision we were required to take by legislation,” he said.Clementi also said it was “nonsense” to suggest cutting the salaries of leading stars would cover the cost of providing the benefit to over-75s, saying: “The sums don’t add up.”He insisted the corporation did not overpay senior staff. “On management, there is absolutely no evidence we are paying our excellent people above the market. All the evidence is the reverse,” Clementi said.The total amount the BBC paid all on-air talent rose by almost £11m in the past year to £158.6m.With market conditions in the media industry tough, the BBC also hired more than 1,000 new staff, taking the number to 19,231. In total, the number of employees at the corporation, including in commercial operations such as BBC Studios, grew from 21,431 to 22,401.The corporation has struggled with pay since it was forced to disclose the salaries of all staff who are paid more than £150,000 a year. The first annual disclosure in 2017 exposed the radical differences in salaries between many leading on-air men and women.Since then, many leading BBC men have been shamed into taking substantial pay cuts, with the salary of the outgoing Today programme presenter John Humphrys falling by £110,000. Radio 2’s Steve Wright cut his pay by £75,000 and Jeremy Vine took a £150,000 reduction.However, a handful of male presenters such as Chris Evans – who took home £8,500 a time for presenting the BBC Radio 2 breakfast show – have instead chosen to leave the corporation.The BBC’s highest-paid woman is Zoe Ball, the new Radio 2 breakfast show host, who took home £370,000 in the 12 months to April but will be paid less than Evans. Other female high earners include Claudia Winkleman, Vanessa Feltz and Lauren Laverne.The Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey told the Today programme that “perhaps it would have been better to cut more male salaries rather than to up some female salaries. I absolutely get that.”The BBC Women group urged caution and pointed to many continuing pay disputes. “There has been some progress in the last two years, but many women at all levels of the BBC are locked into slow, inefficient and demoralising internal processes,” it said.“New equal-pay cases are still emerging and staff are yet to have confidence that pay inequality is in the past.”In a press conference, Hall was also asked about the accusation of bias made by Boris Johnson, who renamed the BBC as the “Brexit-bashing corporation”.He said in response: “The BBC is doing a fantastic job in actually describing to the public the choices being made on their behalf about Brexit. You can ask no more of the BBC than that.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/876ce9afc9d94544332f965c57b1197eb0506e50/0_173_5228_3138/master/5228.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0effd5eeee9e639e71a6d70a8bcd8188","title":"readers glastonbury highlights","story":"From your favourite headliners to surprise delights, you’ve been sharing your top moments from a scorching weekendThe experience was like being taken into a vortex of sound and light with no way out as they transitioned seamlessly between haunting tracks on their most recent album (Free Yourself and Eve of Destruction were especially memorable) to classics like Hey Boy, Hey Girl and Galvanize.They flashed images of both old and new (robotic figures interspersed with black-and-white images) in a hypnotic way, with repetitive elements, so that the audience was truly engrossed and the atmosphere electric. The 3D imagery made you feel as if you were part of it. Light and dark moments in the music and the show took you through a waterfall of emotions, while the beat keept you in ecstasy. A truly unforgettable show, perhaps the best I have seen at Glastonbury. Satya, 26, GloucesterI was really nervous about going to Glastonbury because I’d never been to a festival before – I was there with my parents to celebrate my forthcoming 18th birthday. We waited at the Pyramid stage all day on Friday to see Stormzy, and saw some amazing performances from Bastille and George Ezra. We’re used to watching the headliners on TV so it was quite surreal!I’d decided I wanted to be near to the front for Stormzy but I never thought I’d be so close. His set was absolutely incredible, and all of his singers and dancers were amazing. The highlight of the night – and the whole festival – was when Chris Martin came on for Blinded By Your Grace. It was unforgettable, and I felt like I’d had a real “Glastonbury moment”. Seeing two such different musicians come together really showed me just how amazing the festival is. Megan, 17, LiverpoolAn old litter-picking volunteer with a white beard, dreadlocks and a Lancashire accent, who introduced himself only as “that guy”, did a short set at the open-mic in Strummerville on Saturday afternoon. He had a drum machine and a bass guitar, with which he played some remarkably funky tunes, before adding his own unexpectedly brilliant vocals, most notably in a song I assume was called Put It in the Bin Please, in which he pleaded with the audience in increasingly irate tones to correctly dispose of their rubbish. We’d only gone up there for a snooze in the shade of the trees but came away with a proper Glasto highlight. Russell Carswell, 32, LondonJeff Goldblum’s soundcheck! Warm fuzzy comedy from the king of smooth: guess the animal pattern pants, guess the animal sound, and then the surreal banter with the BBC journalist! When she asks, “When are you going to start?” Jeff casually replies, “Well, I think I already have” to an uproarious, loving crowd. Thanks for an amazing memory Jeff! Gary McKillion, 43, BarnstapleThe IICON stage was absolutely incredible. Obviously I loved the music, but I couldn’t believe how amazing the stage design was. It looked like something out of a dystopian future: proper way to listen to electronic music. Zach, 25, BristolThe Killers absolutely smashed it! We’ve seen them several times, including last year at TRNSMT, so I was initially a little underwhelmed when I saw the lineup … But it was their best performance by far, they put so much effort into it and it was flawless.Being our first Glasto with the kids we were fully prepared for meltdowns, but the children (Holly, eight, and Charlie, five) threw themselves into it and didn’t complain once, despite the heat and all the walking. Seeing them dancing their wee socks off at sunset to Liam Gallagher and the Killers made for such beautiful moments.The Kidzfield is a paradise, they got a photo with lovely Dynamo, who completely captured their imaginations! They spent hours doing arts and crafts, going potholing, playing in forts, and getting decorated with rainbows and glitter. They were really on board with the green focus at this year’s festival, even though they are very young, they recognise the importance. Edwina McNulty, GlasgowSeeing Michael Eavis singing Elvis songs on the Avalon Cafe stage was probably the sweetest moment of Glastonbury. In a relatively intimate setting was the man who made this all happen, singing his heart out at the age of 83 and clearly loving every minute of it. It only got better when Emily joined him for a duet of Something Stupid. Neither have particularly brilliant voices but the music world owes them everything. An utterly charming moment. Simon Donohue, 47, ManchesterThe Acoustic Brass Off on the Truth Stage on Thursday night was an absolute blast, with lots of catchy covers and a great atmosphere. Dat Brass began on stage, belting out Cry Me a River and several other tunes. They then waded into the crowd, where they joined forces with the New York Brass Band for some more fun, playing Thrift Shop and Get Lucky. Double sousaphone equals double fun! Matt, 29, LondonFrank Turner on the Avalon Stage on Friday night. I’d not seen him live before but the energy and desire to put on a great show were incredible. Jonny Ford, 50, LiverpoolThis is about my 25th Glastonbury and the highlight this year was wandering around with my 13-year-old daughter, Cliodhna, on Sunday night. We went to the top of the Ribbon Tower in the Park, which I’d never done before. It’s just fantastic. The whole of gorgeous Glastonbury is laid out before you, a million lights twinkling. All three of my kids have been coming since they were little. We all love it and I hope we’re all there next year at the 50th Glastonbury, as I’ll be 50 too. Jane O’Hara, 49, CharlseworthMy friends and I agonised over whether to see her or the Cure. Halfway through the first song I knew we’d made the right choice. She is the Glasto performer that 2019 deserves: singing and talking about being an outsider, acceptance, joy, sexuality, confusion. She dazzled with on-point choreography, confidence and pitchperfect delivery. It was theatre, dance and music – a real show, a triumph. It helps that she’s very funny, exudes warmth and can build a rapid rapport with the crowd with her slightly off-kilter English. It was a shame so comparatively few people were there to see it. But it gave the show an intimate feel and even a little space to dance. Andy McGrath, 30, StreathamIt was the first time I’ve seen the Cure live – WOW! An amazing performance from a band who showed you really don’t need the bunting and the special guests, just a huge catalogue of amazing songs performed brilliantly by superb musicians and a singer with Robert Smith’s ability to mesmerise. solarevolutionWatching Jorja Smith with my 14-year-old daughter, her eyes filled with happy tears as she looked across at me and mouthed: “This is the happiest I’ve ever been.” In front of us were five 21-year-olds from south Wales at their first Glastonbury. They too were teary, hugging us and telling us how much they wanted to bring their daughters to Glastonbury when they were older, saying how wonderful it was to make such special memories. I’d stewarded that day between 3am and 10am and was knackered! But as the sun (finally) began to dip beneath the horizon the world stopped just for a moment and it was the most beautiful place in the world.

An audience-shot clip of Asher, a British Sign Language interpreter, went viral, showing her gunfinger-happy, head-spinningly dextrous visualisation of the grime MC’s rapidfire lyrics.For Asher, who also interpreted Stormzy at Glastonbury in 2017, it was just another night’s work. “There’s not many interpreters who interpret music and do festivals,” she says. “There’s a shortage nationally.” And there’s even fewer who specialise in grime. “I’ve listened to grime since the Risky Roadz days, since the very beginning, so it’s easier for me, because I understand the context, the slang, all that stuff.”Alongside Asher, Stormzy’s set was also interpreted by Stephanie Raper. Overall, 20 interpreters volunteer their time with Glastonbury’s DeafZone to make sure that key Glastonbury performances are accessible for deaf audiences. With each song taking about a day’s preparation to learn, it’s a mammoth job – made even more difficult by the fact that interpreters don’t have access to setlists before shows. This means they usually look up an artist’s recent sets online, and spend weeks prepping all the songs that might be played. And if the artist goes off-script and plays something new? “We just have to go with it,” says Raper. “It’s about the beat, the words, the melodies, the feeling, the tempo change – it’s just trying your best to relay all that.”For most interpreters, the work begins with immersing themselves in an artist’s world. Paula Cox, who interpreted Janet Jackson’s set, explains that ahead of a gig, she “listens constantly – in the car, in the morning, in the evening, when I’m cooking my dinner. Part of the research is looking on YouTube, and seeing how the artist moves to this song, and what their mood is. If they’ve got a certain way they hold themselves, you want to try and match that.”For Benjamin Gorman, who interpreted his very first set at Glastonbury for Bastille, preparation is more intricate. Gorman is deaf himself and performed with the support of other volunteers giving visual cues. “I had to read as many lyrics as I possibly could,” he explains. “Also, when you sign in BSL, it’s not the same grammar and structure as spoken English, so you need to think about how to change it, but not change it so much that you depart from the original lyrics.”Part of what makes such translations consistently go viral is the sheer emotive power of the performances, stemming from the visually expressive nature of the language. Angela Dawes – who provided BSL interpretation for Christine and the Queens, Billie Eilish, and Loyle Carner – finds it easier to translate when she connects emotionally with a song. “Having an artist you can relate to – that really helps. We want to put that across in our interpretation: how you feel when you listen to a song.”As well as covering main performances, DeafZone also provide “roaming” interpreters who support deaf people accessing other aspects of Glastonbury, such as getting a massage or watching a debate. But DeafZone’s work isn’t only about helping deaf people – it’s also about raising awareness of BSL as a language in the hearing community. Volunteer Abigail Gorman (who is deaf herself) explains that the DeafZone tent provides free BSL classes to all Glastonbury-goers. “We talk about deaf history, culture, language. We don’t want people to just come in and learn a few signs – that’s tokenistic. We want people in the future to campaign on our behalf, be our allies and support us.”The best outcome of these viral videos would be more support for interpreters at festivals – who could benefit from access to setlists and an in-ear audio feed – but also, most importantly, improved access for the deaf festival-goers. The impact of that access can be immeasurable. “The first time I came to Glastonbury, I was a punter, and I didn’t expect anything,” says Gorman. “I’d been to other festivals with limited access – whereas here, it’s inclusive. I’m not ostracised. Festivals need to be more deaf aware. They need to employ deaf people to find out what deaf people need. I face a lot of barriers. There are no barriers here at Glastonbury.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0361c4de4cb46434fdce5a66a6e60e2fac174c0b/0_0_4580_3053/master/4580.jpg?width=720\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=c0097e11cd3a786c1391e9f1b511254c 1440w","title":"a sneaker peek behind the scenes at new balance","story":"Since 1982, New Balance has produced its flagship 990s at one of two US factories. We take a look at the craftsmanship that goes into each trainer at the site in MassachusettsFew trainers can claim a fanbase as erse as that of the New Balance 990 series. The first trainer to cost $100 when it was released in 1982, it was a performance running shoe that was eventually embraced for its nerdy dad look (the late Steve Jobs was a fan), while also acquiring street cred in Baltimore and DC. Meanwhile, the 990v4, which was released in 2016, popped up at fashion shows while being name checked by rappers such as Meek Mill and Lil Yachty.Each pair of 990v5s takes three hours to make they’re constructed from more than 30 different components and are handled by more than 30 workers. Tejada is the leader of the “closing” team, which puts the final touches on the shoe – hand-sewing the leather and suede in the heel. She’s been sewing at New Balance for 31 years, and first put needle to thread when she was a nine-year-old girl under the watchful eye of her mother, who was a seamstress in the Dominican Republic, where Tejada grew up.“I have sewn all my life. This is my pride,” she says. “When I’m sewing, I am happy – I am doing what I learned, with high quality. No run-off. Clean lines, everything where it needs to be.”Eric Vassall, the senior product manager at New Balance in charge of the 990 series, believes the craftsmanship and experience that workers such as Tejada bring to bear is part of what has made the shoe appeal to so many distinct markets.“I’ve been here 19 years and you see generation after generation after generation. So you have the mother who has been here that taught the daughter, who had taught the son,” he says.And at New Balance, the workers don’t just make the shoes – they are also integrated into the design process. This is only possible because, unlike most of its competitors, New Balance both manufactures and designs the bulk of its trainers in the same offices. This means that instead of emails going back and forth across different time zones, workers can give designers and engineers direct feedback in person.For Vassall, the fact that his team only works a few floors above the production line has been crucial. It allows them to make quick adjustments and, ultimately, produce a better product.“I would say for the latest version of the 990, the 990v5, we always would come downstairs and talk to the craftspeople and say: ‘Hey, what’s working, what’s not working?’”Jesse Plouffe, the product developer who worked on the 990v5, says workers like Tejada have made him better at his job.“They’re experts.

It cited anonymous civil servants saying that Corbyn seemed to lack a firm grasp of issues and was being “propped up” by his advisers.Theresa May’s official spokesman said: “It would clearly be inappropriate and unacceptable for comments of this sort to have been made or briefed to the press.“The Cabinet Office is investigating this potential breach of the civil service code fully, just as it would any other. If we are able to identify any inidual responsible, we will take disciplinary action.”Asked whether the civil service would carry out the investigation, he said: “We are taking the matter extremely seriously. The civil service is responsible for looking into any potential breaches of the civil service code, and this is no different.”Labour strongly suspects Sedwill is responsible for the leak, or at least had knowledge of it, and is concerned that he would have a key role in preparing Whitehall for a potential change of government at the next general election.One senior party figure said there was a lack of trust in the cabinet secretary, who was hand-picked by May.For that reason, the government’s announcement of an internal inquiry is unlikely to satisfy Corbyn.He wrote to Sedwill on Tuesday, demanding reassurances about the “scope and independence” of the inquiry, and calling for a “speedy and thorough independent investigation, rather than one carried out by the Cabinet Office”.The shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, raised the leak in parliament on Monday, saying: “I’m standing next to the leader of the opposition, whose fitness I must say is legendary.”Labour has seized on the leak, claiming it is evidence that a powerful political establishment would try to resist the radical reforms a Corbyn-led government might carry out.Corbyn tweeted on Monday:"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/29e1d03b445ddc023e93b60cac34f8306560b6e0/0_355_5724_3434/master/5724.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=26adf240b0326d31b67cb1969c027c6b","title":"would the last tory left in northern ireland please turn out the lights sketch","story":"Audiences in Belfast bored to tears as Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt pretend to care about themIt feels longer than 10 days. Much longer. With the Conservative leadership hustings into their second week, the feeling of existential despair now feels total. What novelty there might once have been has long since worn off. Even Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson can barely keep their eyes open as they stumble their way through tired scripts. There is no sense of edge or danger. Of the next prime minister being tested. Just a continuing beauty parade of the incompetent and the inadequate. Lip service to democracy.There was barely a ripple of applause for the arrival of Hunt in Belfast. Not just because there wasn’t much interest in Ken doll – there was no greater enthusiasm for the appearance of Johnson later – but also because there are only 500 Tory members in Northern Ireland and most of them had better things to do with their life than turn up for something entirely meaningless. The others had merely come for the tea and biscuits.Overnight, Hunt seemed to have forgotten his 10-point Colonel Kurtz no-deal action plan and drifted back into his more familiar role of Barbie’s squeeze. His stump speech was delivered with all the passion of a man on heavy medication. Halfway through, he seemed to vaguely remember he was in Northern Ireland and dropped in a reference to Game of Thrones. Which is the one thing about Northern Ireland that people who don’t give a toss about Northern Ireland actually know.The MC for the day, the radio presenter Iain Dale, briefly woke up to point out that even by the standards of this leadership contest, this was a lie too far. “Hmm,” Ken grumbled. It was typical of the EU to deny that something that didn’t exist actually didn’t exist. Clearly bored, Dale then asked Hunt which Game of Thrones character he most identified with. “I know it’s a cliche,” Ken smiled coyly. “But it’s Jon Snow.” Because that was the only character he could name. So he probably had no idea he had chosen the one who ends up in exile after killing the blonde psychopath who was about to destroy the world. The chronicle of a death foretold.Audience questions quickly petered out as Ken promised to spend billions of pounds he didn’t have on problems he didn’t understand, and though he didn’t want a no-deal Brexit, he’d do it anyway – just for the hell of it – if Johnny Foreigner didn’t appreciate his entrepreneurial skills. By the end, everyone had given up and had taken to asking him about his favourite colour and whether he preferred dogs to cats. Just to fill time.Still, at least Ken had some idea of where he was. Which was more than could be said for Johnson, who gave one of his laziest performances yet. There’s a fine line between being utterly bland to avoid screwing up and not appearing to give a shit. And Boris was well the wrong side of it. Good evening, Glasgow!When asked to explain the continuing failure of the power-sharing executive in Stormont, he made Karen Bradley seem like Mo Mowlam. When asked to talk about Game of Thrones, he burbled on about Star Wars. Which had been filmed in the Republic of Ireland. It was almost as if he was going out of his way to cause offence. Yes, he’d happily turn parts of Northern Ireland into a tax-free centre for smuggling. Though he couldn’t say what ports might qualify. And he’d build the bridge between Scotland and Ireland that every civil engineer said was impossible to build. There was no detail over which he had the slightest grasp. No wonder he struggles to remember how many children he has.Piffle, paffle, wiffle, waffle, Johnson ad-libbed. Everyone just ought to stop being so glum. A no-deal Brexit was nothing to be worried about. The negative claims being made were being wildly overdone. Just believe. By now, Boris had lost the entire room, as everyone had tuned into Philip Hammond’s final outing as chancellor at Treasury questions. Freewheelin’ Phil had been determined to go down fighting. Ken and Boris were complete fantasists, he shrugged. A no-deal departure would cost £95bn minimum. Money we didn’t have. And he’d happily vote with Labour to prevent them from bankrupting the country.Johnson was still rambling when Dale cut him short. “Let’s wrap this thing up,” he said. Enough was enough. Best to end the embarrassment. Would the last Tory left in Northern Ireland please turn out the lights?"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afa688b516d51f375dd864a0e8c5a9bbc705898b/0_19_4256_2553/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a662bc7e1b8357b839855898c600ab6","title":"mps in fresh attempt to extend equal marriage to northern ireland","story":"Cross-party group wants law to apply within three months if Stormont remains stalledA cross-party group of MPs is to make another attempt to extend equal marriage to Northern Ireland by adding an amendment to a bill that would automatically change the law within three months if the devolved government remains stalled.The amendment, led by the Labour MP Conor McGinn, seeks to evade objections that the change should be a matter for Northern Ireland by stating that if and when the region’s executive is revived, it can then approve or repeal the measure.Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK where same-sex marriage is not legal, despite polling which indicates a majority of Northern Irish people support it.Theresa May’s government has said it also supports it, but will not act without the approval of the Stormont assembly, which has been suspended amid political deadlock since January 2017.McGinn, who is from Northern Ireland but as an MP represents St Helens North in Merseyside, has been campaigning for a change of stance, often in alliance with the Conservative peer Robert Hayward.The amendment would be attached to a bill expected before the Commons next week connected to budgetary matters for the suspended executive and Northern Ireland assembly, and delays to future elections. It has been backed by the former education and equalities minister Justine Greening, her fellow Tory MP Nick Herbert, the Green MP Caroline Lucas, the Liberal Democrats’ Layla Moran and Labour’s Owen Smith.It states that within three months of the bill being passed, the Northern Ireland secretary must pass a decree extending same-sex marriage, assuming a new devolved executive is not formed in the interim. If the executive is revived after the law comes into force, it can then endorse or change it.McGinn said patience was running out over the issue: “There is currently no devolved assembly. There has been no executive in place since January 2017. How much longer are LGBT people in Northern Ireland supposed to wait?“The government can’t continue to invoke devolution or negotiations to re-establish Stormont in perpetuity. So what we’ve said is, we’ll give you three months to try and resolve this – if you can’t, Westminster will do what it arguably already should have done.“Then if devolution is re-established, the marriage law goes back to Stormont, and by all means they can change the law again if they so wish to do.”At a hustings event in Belfast earlier on Tuesday, both contenders to replace Theresa May as prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt, said they supported the idea of equal marriage in Northern Ireland but believed it should be left to the devolved government.Pressure over the issue has been building in Northern Ireland. The partner of the murdered journalist Lyra McKee, who was shot dead by dissident republicans during rioting in Derry in April, has urged May to impose the change.Sara Canning said she made the request when she met the prime minister at McKee’s funeral in Belfast.In a statement released through Amnesty International, Canning said: “If the politicians won’t legislate for equal marriage at Stormont, then the prime minister should do it at Westminster. That’s what I told Theresa May at Lyra’s funeral.“I wanted her to know that Lyra and I had a right to be treated as equal citizens in our own country. Surely that’s not too much to ask?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf4e303285161fad0c3d4a7c3e924e751667741b/0_0_4256_2554/master/4256.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=021fb721b2212a5b5aea6275acb0e8aa","title":"tell us has your camhs record affected future employment","story":"As part of an investigation into the issues people who have completed treatment face we would like to hear your experiences Hundreds of thousands of young people pass through the UK’s Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (Camhs) each year.

It took a mere 25 minutes to realise how little any of that mattered. With 5.1 overs gone England were reduced to 19 for four – welcome to the Ashes.Incredibly, despite that start, England came within a hairsbreadth of maintaining their unbeaten run – Australia hobbling to victory by two wickets after England had been bowled out for 177 with three of their overs going unused. At 67 for two after 17 overs, it should have been a walk in the park for an Australia lineup that bats all the way into next week. It was not. Welcome, once again, to the Ashes.“It was a tight game,” England’s captain, Heather Knight, said afterwards. “You’re not going to win many games when you lose those early wickets, but I’m really proud of the fight the girls showed. It’s a characteristic we’ve shown a hell of a lot over the last two years.”It was Nat Sciver who gave England their first glimmer, bagging the wicket of Ellyse Perry in her first over courtesy of yet another stunning stumping off a wide by Sarah Taylor. England already owed Sciver a debt: earlier in the day it had been her patient 95-ball 64 which marshalled their recovery, after Megan Schutt and Perry had wreaked havoc with the hooping new ball at the outset.Sciver’s partner in crime with the bat, Sophie Ecclestone – brimming with confidence after smacking the Australia bowlers around the park on her way to a run-a-ball 27 earlier in the day – then announced herself by demolishing Australia’s middle order, finishing with figures of three for 34.“Her talent is amazing,” added Knight. “She’s brilliant to have up your sleeve as a captain. She can come on and take a wicket from nowhere. She’s got a real good eye, she strikes the ball cleanly, and she’s been invaluable for us this summer coming in and striking the ball and clearing the ropes.”Australia had looked on course thanks largely to the imperious Alyssa Healy, who brought up her half-century with a six slammed behind square. It took a ing catch in the deep from Fran Wilson to see her off for 66. Unlike Wilson’s stunner earlier in the summer, this effort is unlikely to go viral. That honour went to the shocker of a decision Wilson received during England’s innings – ruled leg before to Jess Jonassen after the ball had clearly deflected off her glove. The ECB has apparently decided against using DRS in this series for budgetary reasons. It may live to regret it.As it was, the winning runs came in the 43rd over courtesy of five wides down the leg side from Katherine Brunt, a finale that aptly summed up the nervy contest. “I think it’s going to be one of the closest Ashes series that I’ve been a part of,” said Healy. If the opener is anything to go by, she will not be far off the mark."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0925b11b4dc89b5eebcdb5096f7ea46546ce3ba2/0_83_2987_1793/master/2987.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1044807874e139d24ead4609bd9ba0fe","title":"india bangladesh cricket world cup match report","story":"Two days after a morale-denting defeat by England, India restored order to their World Cup campaign with victory against Bangladesh at the same venue to secure a place in the semi-finals with a group match to spare.Rohit Sharma’s fourth century of the tournament, a feat that makes him the leading runscorer with 544, proved the key contribution as India set their opponents 315 to win.Yet for a Bangladesh side who knew that nothing other than victory would keep alive their own hopes of reaching the last four, this will feel like an opportunity missed.In Shakib Al Hasan they perhaps have the player of the World Cup so far. But not even the all-rounder’s sixth 50-plus score in seven matches could save his team from elimination as India’s bowlers dismissed Bangladesh for 286 in 48 overs.Things might have been so different had Tamim Iqbal not dropped a regulation chance at deep midwicket off Mustafizur Rahman when Sharma was on nine. He went on to make 104 during a 180-run opening stand with KL Rahul.Despite a decent comeback from Bangladesh’s bowlers, the 95 runs Sharma added afterwards proved the deciding factor in this match given India’s margin of victory was 28 runs.Steve Rhodes, Bangladesh’s English coach, admitted: “When you give guys like Rohit Sharma a chance you can pay the price. I was praying he’d hit another one in the air soon after. Tamim’s human, we’re all human and we’ve all dropped catches. Sometimes they can be very, very costly and that one proved to be.”India will not care one bit, with Virat Kohli, their captain, saying: “I have been watching Rohit for years now, he is the best ODI player around. He is a joy to watch and is having the tournament of his life.”India complete their group campaign against Sri Lanka at Headingley on Saturday, but they are likely to return to Birmingham next week for a potential semi-final against England.Eoin Morgan’s side need to beat New Zealand at Durham on Wednesday to set that up. But this result also gives them a backdoor route into the last four if they lose, with Bangladesh able to prevent the hosts’ early exit if they beat Pakistan on Friday.Bangladesh had chased down 322 against West Indies earlier in the tournament. They rattled India here, too, with Kohli angrily confronting the on-field officials in the 12th over after losing an lbw review when third umpire Aleem Dar deemed Soumya Sarkar had edged the ball. When Hardik Pandya dismissed Sarkar three overs later, Kohli mouthed “out” and raised his finger. Whether or not he is sanctioned for his petulance remains to be seen.Bangladesh reached the 30-over mark still in contention on 163 for four. But their hopes dwindled when Shakib was dismissed by Pandya four overs later, a leading edge taken at extra cover. They fought until the end, but not even a spirited half-century from Mohammad Saifuddin could deny India."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9861c65ad134a88848cbe804785aee96ffcde703/0_149_4462_2677/master/4462.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=99ca96f02cab1a8235b24bad944815c5","title":"rafael nadal overcomes jitters nick kyrgios clash","story":"After the tremor that ripped through Wimbledon on day one, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal survived early scares when they stepped on to the grass for the first time on Tuesday, but it is the Spaniard who must prepare for another rumble on Thursday when he faces his new nemesis, Nick Kyrgios.It is fair to say the match of the first week should be and could be the one in the second-round between the Mallorcan matador and the Aussie bull in a china shop. Kyrgios is the opponent from heaven and hell, armed with an often unfathomable game and an acid tongue.Now, like the loud lad in the pub who has been banging on about the guys in the next postcode, he must back up his recent podcast roasting of “super salty” Nadal, the perceived sore loser, and duke it out with him in front of everyone.After spending nearly three-and-a-half hours ousting his long-time friend and compatriot Jordan Thompson in five angry, crazy sets that set the tournament alight, Kyrgios at first did not sound quite so belligerent towards Nadal. They have history, old and new, some good, some bad, some civilised, some not so.Nadal needs no reminding that the lowest-ranked player he has lost to at Wimbledon is Kyrgios, who beat him in the fourth round five years ago when the Spaniard was in his pomp and the loud winner was the most precocious teenager outside of Hollywood, ranked 144 in the world. It was the sort of seismic shock that should have spread through the game with much more force and longevity than it did. Why it didn’t, only Kyrgios knows.“I’ve looked back on that moment,” Kyrgios said. “That’s never going to leave my tennis career. It was one of the most special moments I’ve ever had.”Now they meet again where it all started for them, with their career score three-all.“Going into this match, he’s one of the greatest tennis players of all time,” Kyrgios said. “I go into that match as an unbelievable underdog. I know if I play the right type of tennis, I can have success against him. I have to come with the right attitude, I have to be willing to fight. If not, it’s going to be butter for him.”However, when asked if he thought his criticism of Nadal and his uncle Toni would have an effect on his mood or performance, he bridled, falling back on his old tactic of questioning the questioner. “Did I go at him first or did his uncle come at me first?” he inquired. When the flustered (and young) journalist hesitated, Kyrgios said: “I assume you get your information right.”Asked if he would like to get to know Nadal better, he said:“Not sure that me and Rafa could go down to the Dog and Fox and have a beer together. I don’t know him at all. I know him as a tennis player. I just don’t … no, I don’t know him very well. I don’t know what you want me to say to the question. It’s a very strange question.”But not quite as strange as some of the answers. Elsewhere civility reigned. After Federer beat the 22-year-old South African Lloyd Harris, 3-6, 6-1, 6-2, 6-2 in an hour and 51 minutes on Centre Court, Nadal – who lost the first 11 points – put the Japanese qualifier, Yuichi Sugita, into touch 6-3, 6-1, 6-3 in a tick over two hours on Court No1.Federer next plays the British wildcard Jay Clarke, who was a solid four-set winner over the American qualifier Noah Rubin – and from there the draw opens up a little for the 37-year-old Swiss in pursuit of a ninth Wimbledon title.When Nadal went two games down at the start of his match against Sugita, he might have been saying to Federer: “Anything you can’t do, I can’t do – like win the first set.” But he rediscovered his focus more quickly than the Swiss had, held and broke back and forged on to win comfortably.From there to the end, he looked more like the player who almost beat Novak Djokovic in last year’s semi-final than the one who, after making the 2011 final, had gone out of the tournament four times in a row to players ranked outside the top 100, a remarkable statistic in itself."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/125ebc01ccbe4f39cf926230cde6606cb2413675/532_825_4553_2732/master/4553.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=659500d2da72af1a8b13b21e3742adce","title":"judi denchs wild borneo adventure review joy awe and orangutans","story":"Strap into your harness and scale the tallest trees in the rainforest with the empress herself. She will show you astonishing things – and leave you agogIt is amazing to see Judi Dench in the wild. Almost the last of her kind – there are thought to be only three or four grandes dames left in the country, mostly roaming round Downton Abbey – the ITV documentary Judi Dench’s Wild Borneo Adventure was a rare chance to see her unscripted and at play. Her natural habitat is the stage and screen, but with the adaptability for which this species is known she looked as comfortable in the jungle as she does anywhere else, from the Lyttelton to exotic Marigold hotels.Hang on, I’m getting a message through my earpiece … Ah. Apparently, we were meant to be marvelling at the creatures and canvas of the tropical rainforest through which Dame Judi journeyed, not Dame Judi herself. But who, really, has ever been able to take their eyes off her when she’s about? She looks, at the age of 84, as she has always looked – part-sprite, part-empress – and sounds like she has always sounded – whisky, honey and just about to tell the filthiest joke – and remains the most beautiful thing you’ve ever seen. This time, with orangutans nearby.Her Wild Borneo Adventure was the kind of jolly-with-a-point that is occasionally offered to national treasures. This time, it was a trip to the island land of slow lorises, sun bears, elephants, hornbills and trees that grow straight up into the heavens, all of which we are killing because we are so rapacious in our consumption, because we are so relentless in our quest for profit, because we are so endlessly, fathomlessly stupid. La Dench is a particular fan of orangutans, and this is enough for her to get the job. She sponsors three of them, and I do like to imagine them all sitting in a literal green room together wearing cast-off kaftans and swapping tales about careering round the countryside on Ralph Richardson’s motorbike (“Killed several civilians, darling – nobody cared! It was the 60s!”) while Larry looked askance.With the conservationist David Mills (“my chap”), Dench flew over the deracinated outskirts – the logged forests and palm oil plantations – on into one of the last untouched regions of rainforest in south-east Asia, in the heart of the island. It is also one of the oldest in the world – 130 million years old there when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. There she meets scientists who show her all the extraordinary sights therein, from the dung beetles that clear the floor poo-ball by poo-ball, to the ferns growing 250ft off the ground (she heads up there in a harness while you try not to think about the insurance admin involved) in trees that play host to an estimated 40,000 types of insect, and the harlequin tree frogs that leap and glide among them. There’s also the kubong, which I am not over yet. We watched one of these arboreal mammals jump, stretch out a furry blanket of skin and virtually fly to its next post. It was like watching a billion years of evolution both expand and telescope before you. I’m going to need someone to send Eileen Atkins or Joan Plowright over there to take a more in-depth look.Dench’s greatest contribution – apart from pulling in the punters in the first place – was to treat every revelation of the forest with equal awe and wonder. She was as agog at the insects she saw (the giant katydids were worth the price of admission alone, even if you will never close your eyes easily at night again) as she was the orphan sun bears being released into the jungle after their stay at a local centre that rescues cubs whose parents have been killed for their parts, which are considered valuable in traditional medicine. This approach kept the delicate balance of all the elements of a fragile ecosystem at the forefront of your mind, which should always be the way.So, all we’ve got to do now is stop killing things, despoiling forests, plundering virgin lands and plumbing the depths of stupidity and selfishness.

And the French managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, will move to Frankfurt to take over from Mario Draghi as the first female president of the ECB once it is formally signed off by the Eurozone group.Von der Leyen, 60, who speaks fluent English and French and studied at the London School of Economics before taking a medical degree, is now the European commission president designate. She will only formally become the first female head of the EU’s executive branch if she wins the support of a majority of MEPs.Donald Tusk, the outgoing president of the European council, said after the marathon talks: “I am really happy about it – after all, Europe is a woman. I think that it was worth waiting for such an outcome.”The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, whose coalition government abstained in what was otherwise a unanimous decision to back the nomination, said: “For me, it is also a good sign that a woman will have this office for the first time.”Merkel noted that it was the first time in 52 years that a German national would be heading the commission.France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, had proposed Von der Leyen to lead the commission after Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Italy rejected the candidature of the Dutch former foreign minister Frans Timmermans over his previous criticism of populist governments which fail to protect the independence of their judiciary.Von der Leyen, a gynaecologist who only came to politics in her early 40s, regularly emerges in opinion polls as one of Germany’s most popular politicians.The mother of seven introduced improved maternity and paternity benefits as Germany’s family affairs minister and drove forward boardroom gender quotas.She has been working to increase funding for the country’s armed forces in her most recent government role although she has been mired in controversy over the awarding of contracts and has faced criticism about gaps in military readiness.On Brexit, she has fully supported the commission’s position on the Northern Irish backstop, and criticised the “hollow promises” of those who campaigned for the UK to leave the EU.At the end of the summit, Tusk said the new leadership would not offer concessions on the Brexit deal struck with London.He told reporters: “I am absolutely sure that the new leaders of our institutions will be as consistent as we are today when it comes to the withdrawal agreement and our readiness to discuss our future relationship with the UK”.Macron confirmed Tusk’s reading of the new leadership’s position on Brexit, adding that the EU should “not be afraid of a no deal”.The president is proposed by the European parliament and nominated by the European council of leaders of the EU member states. They lead the commission\u0027s work in implementing EU policies, chair the weekly commission meetings and set its policy agenda. They also represent the EU at European council meetings, G7 and G20 summits and at bilateral summits with third countries.The role was held by Jean-Claude Juncker from November 2014 until July 2019, when the German defence minister, Ursula von der Leyen, was nominated to replace him.The 28 heads of state and government, of which only five are women, were under pressure to break the male monopoly on the top jobs although there was never any certainty this would happen.The debate over the future leadership proved extremely difficult, with the leaders talking through the night on Sunday, and needing to meet again on Monday and Tuesday to find the right gender, geographical and political balance for the five top jobs soon to be vacant.Belgium’s prime minister, Charles Michel, 43, has been chosen to replace Donald Tusk as president of the European council. Spain’s foreign minister Josep Borrell, 72, will become the EU’s high representative for foreign affairs if the commission as a whole is signed off by the parliament.The European parliament is expected to elect its own president in a vote in Strasbourg on Wednesday, with the main political groups likely to support David-Maria Sassoli an Italian MEP for the Socialists and Democrats political group, as part of a delicate ision of jobs among the parties.Michel, who is in a caretaker role while Belgium’s politicians seek to negotiate a new federal government following May’s election, is a member of the Renew Europe political group formed out of a combination of the former liberal group in the parliament and French MEPs from Macron’s La République En Marche party.The leaders’ nomination for the commission marks a break with the “Spitzenkandidaten” system, under which lead candidates were chosen by the political groups to campaign for the post during the elections.Juncker was appointed in 2014 after his European People’s party group became the biggest party. This time he had championed the candidacy of Manfred Weber after the EPP group again proved to be the largest party, albeit weakened and in a more fractured parliament.He said he feared the nomination might run into trouble when MEPs had their say. The parliament is able to reject the leaders’ candidate, and the entirety of the new president’s commission.“The solution we’ve found is a good one,” Juncker said. “Ursula von der Leyen has extensive experience in defence and social policy. I believe it would be in the European parliament’s interest to approve this, though I am sad the Spitzenkandidat process suffered a setback.”Tusk added: “I am not a prophet. It’s not for me to assess what is the real chance to achieve success in the parliament.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b97aa9e0cdc247a4ff7e1139ee28155e52a37ae2/2_0_1747_1048/master/1747.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3652d7d4cd545e865abe22724858ca7a","title":"west papuan independence group say they are ready to take over country","story":"Three rebel armies fighting for liberation from Indonesia join forces under movement headed by exiled leader Benny Wenda Three rebel West Papuan armies have joined forces under the control of the independence movement, led by exiled leader Benny Wenda, who says they are now “ready to take over our country”.It comes as Indonesian authorities increase efforts in their search for five soldiers and nine crew from a military resupply helicopter which went missing on Friday.West Papua, which shares an island with Papua New Guinea, has been under Indonesian control since 1969 and is in the grip of a long-running independence conflict.The armed groups unified last month under the command of the United Liberation Movement for West Papua (ULMWP) – the umbrella organisation for three independence groups.“Politically and militarily we are united now. The international community can now see without a doubt that we are ready to take over our country,” said Wenda, the chair of the ULMWP.“Indonesia cannot stigmatise us as separatists or criminals any more, we are a legitimate unified military and political state-in-waiting.”The groups include the TPNPB, which attacked a construction site in December, reportedly killing 17 Indonesians.The incident sparked a military crackdown in the region, claiming dozens of lives on both sides.Shortly after the attack Wenda told the  he could not stop the TPNPB, but called for calm.The Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua share an island with Papua New Guinea, and its indigenous population has been engaged with a low-level insurgency with Indonesia for about half a century.After the departure of Dutch colonisers, and disagreement between Papuans, the Netherlands, and Indonesia, the United Nations sponsored a treaty appointing Indonesia as temporary administrator.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspIn 1969 a UN resolution affirmed the so-called “Act of Free Choice”– a referendum which saw 1,026 hand-picked West Papuans vote to remain with Indonesia, but which has been repeatedly dismissed by international observers as unrepresentative and coerced. Indonesia maintains the regions have always been Indonesian and the resolution simply affirmed its sovereignty.A guerrilla separatist movement grew and violence has continued ever since, with claims more than half a million West Papuan people have been killed, as well as countless arrested and injured, and villages destroyed. Indonesia is regularly accused of human rights abuses, which it denies.In recent years the West Papua cause has gained increased support from regional neighbours, including Vanuatu, Tuvalu, and the Marshall Islands, but a 2017 independence petition – signed by 1.8 million West Papuans and smuggled out of the country to the UN’s decolonisation committee – was rebuffed as outside its mandate.Bobby Anderson, Papua researcher and fellow at Chiang Mai University’s School of Public Policy, cautioned that the rebel groups had previously announced unifications which had amounted to nothing.“This declaration of a unified command might just be the ULMWP trying to grab some of the momentum from the Nduga actions,” said Anderson.“We won’t know if it’s real until we see coordinated armed actions both in Nduga and beyond, that will demonstrate that the ULMWP declaration is a reality.However Anderson said having the leadership of Wenda might make the difference, and an “unprecedented” unified command would see increased bloodshed.“He managed to cobble together the ULMWP from civilian representatives of the disparate Papua independence groups and that it’s held this long is impressive.”The unification marks another new development in the long-running conflict, just days after it was revealed West Papuan children have been drawn into the fighting.TPNPB has acknowledged the presence of teenage and adolescent boys among its ranks, the Associated Press reported last month.The use of children as soldiers is a war crime under international law.Human rights lawyer Veronica Koman said it was a sign the conflict was far more serious than the rest of the world acknowledged.“West Papua needs urgent international intervention, because child soldiers are themselves victims,” she said.“The Indonesian government’s security approach has created an intractable conflict by brutalising generation after generation of West Papuans.”Reports of military and rebel violence in the region have continued through this year, including claims of the Indonesian armed forces allegedly using  white phosphorus, and rebel attacks on soldiers, something Jakarta denies."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Tests have been carried out on private water source at Croagh Kilfinny GAA GroundsRev Trevor Sargent emphasises social justice, human rights and humility at Dublin forumMinister of State to meet chair and board of Irish Greyhound Board to discuss dog welfare issuesSiobh\u0026aacuten Jordan was 100m from finish line during race in Dublin when she collapsedMotorcyclist Glenn Carty (34) was killed in collision with car at Leitrim T-junctionTrade deal could be \u0026lsquodeath knell\u0026rsquo for Irish beef sector, FF leader saysMinister says costs of acute hospitals, medical card and treatment abroad schemes to blameOne in five Irish species assessed \u0026lsquothreatened with extinction\u0026rsquo, BirdWatch official saysLoss of backing from household names follows controversy over documentary on industryGarda\u0026iacute seek witnesses to incident after which shirtless man ran towards Bachelors WalkConference told lowering tax base a sleight of hand as cost of services transfers to workersLandlords claim they are being \u0026lsquodemonised\u0026rsquo for the State\u0026rsquos failure in home-buildingNI Police Ombudsman starting criminal investigation into alleged misconductSvanik Rajath fractured arm when infant hit into him as he climbed up slide in crecheA third of systems that failed inspections during 2013-2018 \u0026lsquostill not fixed\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash EPAMinister Eoghan Murphy says rents still too high and time needed for measures to workTory leadership candidate says finance for such a project \u0026lsquonot the issue, the issue is political will\u0026rsquoDanish GreenKayak joins Dublin\u0026rsquos City Kayaking to offer free trips to pick up plasticCourt heard assault by Alice Byrne disfigured woman\u0026rsquos face and affected her breast implants"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944642.1562096902!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"barry s tea and fbd insurance pull greyhound racing funding","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tBarry’s Tea and FBD Insurance have pulled their sponsorship of greyhound racing in the aftermath of an RTÉ programme on the industry. Image: iStock.In separate statements on Tuesday, the companies confirmed they would be ending their relationships with various races around the country. They had said at the weekend that their sponsorship of the sport was under review.The companies had relatively small involvement in sponsorship, with Barry’s Tea backing a race in Cork and FBD having an arrangement with Kilkenny Greyhound Stadium. Industry sources said while the loss of the sponsorship would not present a commercial threat, the departure of two household names would be a blow to a sport that has struggled to attract sponsors in recent years. It could also increase pressure on headline sponsors such as Boylesports, which is among greyhound racing’s biggest commercial partners.The RTÉ Investigates programme last week raised concerns over the treatment of dogs and potential widespread culling of thousands of animals based on performance.The sponsorship development comes as the Irish Greyhound Board and Irish Coursing Club have been asked to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Agriculture next Tuesday. Committee chairman Pat Deering TD said they will be asked what structures are being put in place after the recent revelations. “We want to see exactly how quickly they will do this,” he said. “The Irish Greyhound Board will have received €16 million in Government funding this year. We will be looking to see how much of this will be ring-fenced on animal welfare.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944715.1562101580!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"miriam lord richard bruton is like an oxygen eater in an upturned boat","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment Richard Bruton. Photograph: Dara Mac Donaill  The Exactly 10 weeks to go to the National Ploughing Championships.Doesn’t time fly when you’re upsetting the farmers?The biggest outdoor event in Europe is taking place in Carlow this year. It’ll be all go in Ballintrane for three days from September 17th. Funnily enough, the Dáil returns from its summer recess on the same day. But with a general election on the horizon, politicians will be beating a path to the midlands, resumption or no in Leinster House.We hope the Taoiseach doesn’t have more pressing demands on his time when these hugely important dates in the Irish agricultural calendar roll around. He might have to wash his hair or take his mammy to the shops or something.Same goes for the Tánaiste. And the rest of the Cabinet. Even those who don’t have any hair.And you never know the day nor the hour when somebody might fall off a swing and hurt themselves and not be able to scuttle around a few trade stands and have photographs taken with a litter of piglets and somebody from RTÉ.Obviously, the Minister for Agriculture has no choice but to attend and face the firing squad. But maybe he can slip in very early and then hide. You hardly see or hear Michael Creed around Kildare Street at the best of times, so that won’t be too difficult, but unfortunately farmers are the undisputed champions of the Men and Women Who Get Up Early in the Morning.The few rural-based Government TDs in for Leaders’ Questions couldn’t have looked more downbeat had they lost the prestigious brown bread competition at the Ploughing by a short, eh, bread.It’s all down to Mercosur, which may sound like a continental supermarket chain but is the huge South American trading bloc which has reached a draft deal with the EU after a mere 20 years of negotiations.Irish farmers – particularly the beef sector – are fuming. Farming organisations were out in force over the weekend following the announcement of an agreement, predicting devastating losses for the beef industry and serious environmental implications.Such is the depth of worry in the sector, Michael Creed has gone out on a limb and declared himself “very concerned”.On the Dáil’s first day back since the agreement, all parties and groups lined-up against the Government in opposition to the draft deal.Climate change may be the existential question of our time, but it is still a novelty to hear party leaders holding forth on the destruction of the Amazonian rainforests during Leaders’ Questions.Even the Healy-Raes went global for the day that was in it, although Danny, who doesn’t hold with all this climate change malarkey, stuck to the beef.The Taoiseach and Tánaiste were out of the country, so it fell to Minister for Communications and Climate Change Richard Bruton to fill the Leader’s slot.When opponents are spitting fire, demanding answers, further time for debate and a final say in how Ireland votes, there is no better man than Richard to face down the angry forces across the floor.He is like moss on a lawn. An oxygen eater in an upturned boat. The man could smother a raging forest fire by just talking to it. When the opposition erupts with questions, Bruton the fire blanket neutralises them with a numbing flow of smooth economist balm.Micheál Martin railed against this “environmentally unsustainable” trade deal. What is the Government going to do about it?Very significant concern. . .fully understand. . .Ireland continuing to press concerns. . .need to take time to evaluate this as a whole. . .look at how to deal with it as it unfolds. . .legal considerations. . .phasing period. . .small open economy.”But “we need to draw back”. Indeed, “we need to evaluate it in the round”.AmazonBut what about Brazil? Micheál Martin has the measure of that country’s leader. “The Trump of the Tropics” is what he is called, he reminded the Minister for Climate Change. “The behaviour of the Brazilian government in respect of the Amazon rainforest should be a showstopper” for the Mercosur deal. “This should be a showstopper right now.”President Bolsonaro might say Brazil will adhere to the Paris Agreement, but “it means nothing to this leader. Absolutely nothing”.Nonetheless, we have to evaluate and look at everything in the round and as a whole, soothed the Government’s chief damper downer.Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald was worried too. The deal is a sell-out of Irish farmers and their families, she thundered.No more than Micheál, she couldn’t believe the Government is prepared to sign a deal with Brazil where the president has no problem with destroying the rainforests and indigenous communities “in order to increase the profits of a few millionaire beef exporters”.Twice, she had to “insist” the Dáil be given a say on the matter.Richard threw out the fire blanket. You can’t isolate governments and then expect them to row in behind international climate change protocols. Instead, the deal has a number of clauses written into it to achieve compliance.“They are part of a multilateral strategy to try to deliver the climate protections that we all crave.”“Crazy”, spat Michael Healy-Rae. Irish farmers are being told to reduce animal stocks and plant trees. Now Mercosur is bringing in countries which don’t have the same level of traceability or production standards while felling thousands of acres of rainforest to raise the beef they want to sell to us.But what would you expect, he sighed. The Taoiseach has already said he was “going to save Ireland by reducing his own meat intake”.Michael still isn’t over the time Leo said he was cutting down on red meat for health reasons.“The European standards will not be diluted one jot,” insisted Richard, in full smother mode.“It is also worth recognising that there are threats and opportunities and we have to work our way through them.”The Opposition had to have a row instead about time allocated to debate the deal.“It is causing significant concern across the land,” said the Fianna Fáil leader, with every other leader and spokesperson, from all sides of the political spectrum, agreeing with him.He went so far as to suggest the Dáil would sit an extra week – the summer recess starts at the end of next week – but extra hours were found to ward off such an appalling vista.This draft deal will be around for a while. So too will the farmers.No doubt Government Ministers will be given a broadly courteous reception when they, if they have the bottle, brave the Ploughing.Though it might be an idea to close the milkshake stall."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944024.1562082221!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"brexit party meps turn backs on eu anthem on parliament s first day","story":"Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs when the European anthem \u0027Ode de Joy\u0027 is played on the first sitting of the new European Parliament.

Photograph: by Frederick FlorinAFPNigel Farage and his Brexit Party MEPs turned their backs during the playing of the European anthem at a ceremony to mark the opening of the European Parliament. As a saxophone quartet and opera singer performed Beethoven’s Ode to Joy in the Strasbourg chamber on the first day of the new parliament, the 29 Brexit party MEPs turned away from the group to face the back wall.Labour’s leader in the European parliament, Richard Corbett, later described the move as pathetic.More than three months after Britain was scheduled to leave the EU, 73 British MEPs have arrived in Strasbourg to take up a mandate that is due to expire on October 31st, the new deadline.The Brexit Party’s 29 MEPs marked their arrival in Strasbourg, with a photograph underneath the 28 national flags outside the Strasbourg parliament. A few wore turquoise ties, the colour of the party intended to mark the difference with Ukip purple, Mr Farage’s old party.Mr Farage, who has been an MEP since 1999, said Brexit Party MEPs would stay beyond October 31st “if we have to stay longer” and delivered a carefully-crafted message to the two Conservatives battling to become prime minister, Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt. Crude slogan“Now we have two contenders telling us whatever happens, come hell or high water we are leaving on the 31st of October,” he said. “I don’t believe a word they say but I will give them this warning: if they don’t deliver Brexit on that date they are toast and then we will then see a turquoise takeover.”His new MEPs cheered as Mr Farage claimed the Brexit Party was the biggest in Europe. While the 29 Brexit MEPs are the joint largest party in the European Parliament (along with Germany’s CDU-CSU alliance), Mr Farage has been unable to forge a pan-European group, meaning he will no longer have a prime-time speaking slot in European Parliament debates.Massing on the other side of the parliament, the British Liberal Democrats also trumpeted their arrival by walking into the chamber together wearing yellow T-shirts emblazoned with their campaign slogan Bollocks to Brexit. The party has a record 16 MEPs, while Labour and the Conservatives have been reduced to all-time lows.Chris Davies, re-elected for the Liberal Democrats after losing his seat in 2014, said he expected to serve out his full five-year term. “Of course I do. If Brexit isn’t delivered by the 31st of October I don’t think it will happen. There is no majority in the country there is no majority in the House of Commons.”The MEP denied the crude slogan was unparliamentary. He said that when he met MEP colleagues who told him he would stay only a few months, “I say no. ‘I am here for five years. Bollocks to Brexit.’ And I get the same reaction every time: a big smile. It’s amazing how well Bollocks to Brexit translates into 24 different languages.”Protests were also held against the decision to deny a seat to Catalan separatist Carles Puigdemont and this issue was addressed by Sinn Féin MEP Matt Carthy. Newly elected Irish MEPs Mick Wallace and Clare Daly arrived for their first sitting of the parliament wearing matching teeshirts emblazoned with the slogan “Free Assange - No US extradition”. Tuesday marks the opening of the new five-year session of the parliament, though the length of the UK’s involvement remains in doubt.UK MEPs may sit in the parliament until the country formally leaves the EU.A deadline of October 31st has currently been set for the UK to leave, though this could be extended if a deal is not found by then. – PA"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3944429.1562095724!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"germany s ursula von der leyen nominated to lead european commission","story":"\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t                                                            German defence minister Ursula von der Leyen has been nominated as the next European Commission president.

The selections were set out in a series of tweets posted by outgoing European Council president Donald Tusk. He said he expected Frans Timmermans of the Netherlands and Margrethe Vestager of Denmark would be put forward as the deputy heads of the commission. French president Emmanuel Macron had earlier suggested Ms von der Leyen for the powerful EU executive post and International Monetary Fund (IMF) chief Ms Lagarde to run the ECB. They will be the first women to hold the positions, breaking 60 years of male dominance in the EU institutions. The European Parliament is expected to elect its own president in a vote in Strasbourg on Wednesday, with the main political groups likely to support the former prime minister of Bulgaria, Sergei Stanishev (53). He is an MEP for the Socialists and Democrats political group.DifficultThe debate over the future leadership proved extremely difficult, with the leaders talking through the night on Sunday, and needing to meet again on Monday and Tuesday to find the right gender, geographical and political balance for the five top jobs soon to be vacant.The commission president is responsible for the the EU’s day-to-day affairs and proposes legislation, while the European Council president organises summits of government leaders and brokers compromises.Leaving the meeting on Tuesday, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said he was pleased with the outcome.“It may have taken three days, but I think we have had a very good outcome overall for Ireland and for Europe. People of real capabilities are holding these roles,” he said. The Taoiseach said those chosen were were “friends of Ireland” and he paid particular tribute to Mr Michel. “I’m really happy to see Charles Michel in there as president of the council, a friend of Ireland… As a Belgian prime minister he really understands Brexit issues because they are among the most affected by it.”Ms von der Leyen (60) speaks fluent English and French but has had a tough time as defence minister, a post she has held since 2013. Her tenure has been marked by scandals over the awarding of contracts and right-wing extremism in the Bundeswehr, criticism about gaps in military readiness, and a crash between two German Eurofighter jets last month in which a pilot was killed.German chancellor Angela Merkel said she abstained in an informal vote on her Christian Democrat colleague but that the decision had the unanimous backing of the other leaders. Her selection to replace Jean Claude Juncker in the role will now move on to the European Parliament for consideration. Dr Merkel said it was important that the European Union finally achieved broad unity in nominating its future leaders. She said that “everyone had to move and did move”. “It is important that we were able to decide with great unity today, and that it is important because it’s about our future ability to work.” RarityMs von der Leyen is a rarity in German politics in that she came to the game late, when she was 42, following a career in medicine.A mother-of-seven who was born in Brussels and lived in Britain and the US, Ms von der Leyen grew up surrounded by politics. Her father, Ernst Albrecht, was a state premier for the state of Lower Saxony from 1976 to 1990.She studied at the London School of Economics from 1977 to 1980, but used the pseudonym “Rose Ladson” due to concerns she might be targeted, as the daughter of a prominent politician, by left-wing guerrillas active in West Germany at the time.A trained gynaecologist, she was once hoisted out of a barrel on German entertainment TV by Hugh Jackman and kissed by George Clooney after handing him an award for promoting peace.The German defence minister has previously been supportive of greater defence co-operation in the EU, telling a German newspaper earlier this year that “Europe’s army is already taking shape”.Mr Michel currently heads the Belgian caretaker government. He leads the country’s Francophone liberals (Mouvement Reformateur). He is the son of former EU commissioner and MEP Louis Michel. He qualified as a lawyer at the Brussels Bar and is fluent in Dutch and English in addition to his native French.Ms Lagarde was the French finance minister in during president Nicolas Sarkozy’s Republican administration and then moved to the role of managing director of the IMF.Mr Borrell (72) is currently the Spanish foreign minister.

Though at home near Hanover, Lower Saxony, she was born in Ixelles in the southern suburbs of Brussels and grew up as the daughter of an influential Lower Saxon politician and later state premier, Ernst Albrecht.In addition, the so-called Visegrád states – Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic – were reportedly not opposed to the idea of her appointment.The appointment would solve one problem for Merkel but caused complications elsewhere. It would end Bundesbank president Jens Weidmann’s ambitions of heading the European Central Bank (ECB) and block EPP spitzenkandidat (lead candidate) Manfred Weber from any top job. That would be seen as a betrayal by Weber’s colleagues in Bavaria’s ruling Christian Social Union (CSU) – Merkel’s conservative allies.“After years of anonymous EU leaders we agreed on the lead candidate system to increase European election legitimacy,” said a CSU source to The . “Ignoring the candidates people voted for at the first opportunity would be very difficult to communicate.”Asked if ditching Weber for Von der Leyen would cause a crisis in Berlin’s ruling grand coalition, the CSU source added: “By no means.”Medical doctorVon der Leyen is Lutheran and a medical doctor by training. She married in 1986 and has seven children, the youngest now 20.Seen as a liberal and reliable pair of hands, she has held three posts at the Merkel cabinet table. As family minister (2005-2009) she boosted funding for childcare, generating controversy in the more conservative wing of her own political camp. As labour and welfare minister (2009-2013) she oversaw a toughening up of the Schröder era reform programme.Her greatest challenge has been as defence minister since 2013. Her task: to retool and rebuild the Bundeswehr after years of underinvestment and ongoing confusion over its role at home and abroad. It has proven a complex, perplexing and often thankless task – in particular amid growing US pressure on Germany to boost its military spending in line with Nato commitments.She made several decisions that earned respect within the ranks: agreeing to buy unmanned drones backing weapons deliveries to Iraqi militias battling Islamic State forces and adding a new cyber warfare pillar alongside the army, navy and Luftwaffe.But, now in her sixth year in defence, she is increasingly unpopular over a series of cost overruns on military aircraft, as well a surge in spending on outside consultants.Never a close political ally of Merkel, Von der Leyen was once considered a potential reserve chancellor. However, the minister eventually took herself out of the succession stakes, pointing to the four-year age difference between the two women.It remains to be seen whether the European Parliament will back Von der Leyen as successor to Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2019/06/11/TELEMMGLPICT000197062411_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqWZZ9520Qrn8RyVs0byqFfxdYxsWUQUCtgJX18DpO5X4.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"making final call publish mps expenses","story":"Former editor of The Daily , William LewisIts publication led to the biggest parliamentary scandal in a generation, but two national newspapers had already turned the story down.The decision to pay for the full expense claims of every MP in Westminster was laced with risk: the leaked information could have been deemed stolen, or worse - it could have been a hoax.

A report by the London School of Economics (LSE) into children’s attitudes towards the internet found they overwhelmingly wanted a ‘grand erasure’ of their online footprint to stop childhood mistakes affecting their future.The research, which was funded by the Information Commissioner\u0027s Office, also found that children were generally trusting of tech companies in the same way they are of their schools.LSE researchers reviewed more than a decade’s worth of studies into children’s understanding of their online data and also conducted focus groups with more than 160 secondary school-age children.Professor Sonia Livingstone, who led the research, said children were generally “outraged” when they learned how much of their personal information is being hoarded online and wanted “a fresh start” when they turned 18.She said: “They say ‘whatever I do before I am 18 should be wiped off’ as it shouldn’t have any effect on them as an adult. They want a kind of grand erasure because they talk about the importance of making mistakes and just being kids trying things out.”The Government is currently looking at a range of new measures to better protect children online including imposing a legal duty of care on tech giants and introducing an Age Appropriate Design Code, which will mean social media giants will have to assume users are children if they can\u0027t age verify them.Duty of Care white paperMost social media companies have a minimum age of 13, but due to the lack of proper age checks the study found children as young as nine said they had profiles.The study found that children generally took instructions they received online on “face value” and often didn’t understand how tech companies were commercially benefiting from the information they handed over. As a result, they found it “puzzling” that internet companies often asked them to give out details they did not see as relevant to the service.The children interviewed were also shocked to learn that material they thought they had deleted could still exist online and wanted “delete to mean delete” when it came to social media.Other features children wanted from tech companies were a way to see which other companies their details had been shared with and “child-friendly mechanisms” to edit their information.Prof Livingstone said the children were generally mystified as to why tech companies were interested in personal information they saw as quickly going out of date as they grew up.She added: “Creepy is a really common word that they use. It’s creepy and sinister that all that data is being kept.”Duty of Care CampaignTheresa May to unveil review of devolution and how the UK Government can bolster the UnionCambridge University to assign white staff members ethnic minority \u0026#39reverse mentors\u0026#39 to challenge racismBBC hands stars £11m pay rise -

She has now moved into second place according to the poll. Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator who was also widely seen to have performed well in the first debates in Miami last week also substantially increased her support. Another poll released on Tuesday by Quinnipiac University showed similar movement, with Mr Biden dropping from 30 per cent support before the debate to 22 per cent and Ms Harris rising to second place on 20 per cent. Polling experts urge caution at over-analysing results, with surges in support after campaign debates often not lasting long and repeated surveys needed to establish a trend. However the sharp change suggests that Mr Biden, who has enjoyed a substantial lead on all rivals to the Democratic nomination over the last two years, is being pegged back.Around 650 Democrat voters or independents leaning that way were asked in the CNN poll to say which candidate they would most likely support for the nomination, with the names being listed randomly. Mr Biden came top with 22 per cent of those asked backing him. He was followed by Ms Harris on 17 per cent, Ms Warren on 15 per cent and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders on 14 per cent. The second night of the Miami debate saw Ms Harris, whose mother is Indian and father is Jamaican, challenge Mr Biden over his historic positions on civil rights issues. Their clash was the stand-out moment of the debates and was repeated often on US cable news channels in the following days. In a separate development, Hunter Biden, Mr Biden’s son, has opened up about his struggles with addiction in an interview with The New Yorker magazine, including his use of alcohol and cocaine.The younger Mr Biden said: Everybody has trauma.

That’s why we are guaranteeing that under our leadership, Britain will never join a permanent customs union and instead seek to negotiate a comprehensive Canada-style free trade deal.This means Britain will enjoy a fully independent trade policy to compete with the world’s biggest players.It is simply not good enough for a country as productive as ours to hand over its trade policy to the European Union.We intend to leave the EU with optimism and confidence. Britain can walk tall in the world with the lowest corporation taxes to attract business, a £billion boost for our armed forces and a competitive free trade policy.We will have political leadership at the heart of our team from the start of the negotiation with the EU.This will include the best and brightest, like world class negotiator Crawford Falconer. And there will be no need for a Department for Exiting the European Union.So we will fold these resources into a beefed-up Department for International Trade and Digital Enterprise.We want to be a truly Global Britain and this cannot be done on the cheap. We need to be competitive so we will increase our trade footprint overseas by doubling the International Trade department budget.So we must wrap up Brexit as quickly as possible. It’s an urgent priority and that will be our unrelenting focus until it is done.We both voted three times to leave the EU andothers had done the same we would have left by now. We don’t see Brexit as a problem to be solved but as the most amazing opportunity for our country.It is a task which will require confidence, craft, vision and attention to detail. It will require the promotion of some relationships and the resetting of others.And let us make one other thing clear: that team will never include the Labour front bench, which is hell bent on blocking Brexit.There are a few other things about our Brexit plan that readers should know. If we leave without a deal – not an ideal outcome but one that must remain an option – the full £billion orce payment will not be handed over.We will not pay a penny more than is legally required. Anyone who thinks we are going to write a blank cheque to the EU is sorely mistaken. To leave we need an experienced deal maker.Perhaps one who delivered a smooth Olympic Games in . Perhaps a deal maker who delivered £million a week for the NHS after winning a battle with the Treasury. Perhaps a deal maker who is already around the table with European leaders as Foreign Secretary.So today our solemn promise is this: We must be able to demonstrate real progress with the EU by the middle of October. If no agreement is in sight by then we will press ahead with No Deal.No one sensible wants this outcome, butit’s a choice between no Brexit or No Deal then we will never betray the democratic mandate that Brexit won in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Imagine that!Why the sudden interest in women’s football  I’ve heard more than one person ask.Well, it doesn’t take a genius to spot the cause and effect — put women’s football on to BBC TV and people will not only watch it, they will bloody love watching it, and realise the level of talent possessed by the likes of Ellen White, Lucy Bronze and the rest of the team.It strikes me that exposure and access is the only reason that we as a nation have cared so much less about women’s football than men’s in recent years. In fact, I know this to be true. You know how Maybe you already know this too but just to recap, this isn’t the first time that our nation has fallen in love with women’s football.Cast your minds back a hundred years or so to World War One when any man fit enough to play football had been sent to fight on the front line.Back at home, it turned out that women were completely able to do so much more than stay at home looking after children.In fact they were able to not only take on the men’s jobs — they also took their places on the football field. And people loved watching them.Women’s football was absolutely huge during World War One, drawing crowds of up to , even after the war had ended.These pioneering women managed to achieve phenomenal success and recognition, and they did it at a time when such a thing would have seemed nigh on impossible. They defied society, challenged convention, cocked a snook at tradition and expectation — and changed the mindset of a nation by taking women’s football to unprecedented  heights, all within a couple of years.And they did it because the men were away fighting — and so they were allowed to.And then women’s football here disappeared completely.Why The men came back from the frontline — and they wanted their jobs and their football back.And the women  They were expected to go back to the domestic realm. And, just like that, it turned out  women were no longer considered suitable to be footballers.Apparently, the sport was condemned as “inappropriate for their bodies”. And so began a campaign against women’s football, the sport that had been appreciated by the nation. That culminated on  December , when the FA called on clubs belonging to the association “to refuse the use of their grounds for [women’s] matches”.It would be easy to conclude that they were scared of the competition.With women safely out of the way men could take their rightful place back on the pitch. Incredibly, it was not until after England’s World Cup win in  that women’s football began to be revived.In  the Women’s Football Association was formed, and in  — a full half-century after the ban — the FA allowed its members to host women’s games again.Still, though, until now the attention paid to women’s football has been pretty desultory.But that’s changed, thanks to the Lionesses and to the exposure that women’s football has rightfully  been given. And now finally, after  years, football may be coming home.England’s Lionesses are two games away from winning the World Cup, having shown skill, determination and hard work in the tournament.The way they play out from the back, the way they keep possession, the way they handle themselves under pressure is a real credit to football. The men should take note.I couldn’t be more proud and how fabulous that more than .million tuned in to watch them.To say that I’m excited for the USA game on Tuesday is an understatement.When you’re at boarding school you wear what you’re told, eat what you’re told, go to bed when you’re told. In fact, you spend your le doing what you are told.Yes, sure there is an upside to that – the one thing I craved when I came out of boarding school was independence, and it gave me a survival instinct.But there are lots of downsides, too, which is why I didn’t send my kids to boarding school.Although, on reflection, maybe I should have . . .BREAKING news – the Miss England competition has launched a  make-up free round for the first time.The idea is to support body positivity and natural beauty.For ’s contest,  entrants – including  Bethany Cammack, trolled as a teenage beauty queen –  have been challenged to submit snaps of themselves with no make-up.It is a far cry from traditional Miss England competitions, where most wannabes have been plastered with more make-up than the average Love Island girl. So I suppose, in a way, it is progress.But here’s a more radical thing. Should we  have a Miss England competition at all It’s outdated, old-fashioned and sexist.We should not rate people on their looks but on their character, what they stand for and what they do.No matter how you dress it up, the prize for Miss England goes to the best-looking entrant. With competitions like this still going on, is it any wonder young women are tortured by self-esteem and confidence issues Make-up or no make-up, it is still judging women on how they look  – and pitting them against each other.I didn’t know until now there is  a Mr England competition too, but that is just as bad.Talk about a bitter-sweet level playing field – where men are as obsessed as women about their abs  and whether or not they should be hair-free.WHAT does it say about society when men who beat up women are not jailed  It says that violence against women is often tolerated.Attacks on woman are the most socially tolerated form of violent behaviour.This week a steroid-using, drug abusing body-builder beat up his girlfriend so badly she thought she would die.She was the FIFTH partner this man has assaulted.He was not jailed as the judge  thinks imprisoning a serial domestic abuser would do “no good”.  No good  It would send a signal that it is not OK to beat up women.As this was his fth victim on record, I am sure there will be more, as he has escaped suitable punishment.He should be in jail and the judge removed from office, at the VERY least.IT’S hard not to feel  sickened by the fact Faryal Makhdoom and her boxer husband Amir Khan spent  £, on their daughter’s first birthday party.Faryal, , and Amir, , held the Amazonian-inspired bash earlier this month at the University Of Bolton Stadium – the same place where the couple held their £, engagement party and eldest daughter’s £, second birthday celebration.I’m sorry, but £, for a first birthday party  Where has  their perspective gone Of course everyone wants to throw their child a great birthday party, but a one-year-old won’t even remember the event.Wouldn’t it have been better for Faryal and Amir to have held just a small celebration and put all that money they spent – on something that lasted for just  a day – into a bank account  so that their daughter could eventually put it toward her own flat, or setting up a business when older Sleeping under canvas, even   it is dressed up as a “bell tent”, “eco-pod” or a “VIP yurt”, is my idea of a nightmare.Add to that probably more than , people, a woeful lack of loos, nowhere to hide from the beating sun and nowhere to wash – and it becomes a vision of hell.Yuck.ANYONE  do a massive eye-roll watching footage of Aaliyah, the -year-old Londoner appearing on Channel ’s  Hours In AE Not only was she there because she had just a broken fingernail, she was complaining at having to wait to see a doctor – I guess because the doctors were busy attending to real emergencies.Aaliyah, broken nails were why plasters were invented.You – and your mother, who took you to AE in the first place – need to get real.So do we.

We could end up with a version of Mrs May’s hideous Chequers stitch-up, with a few extra bells and whistles on the Northern Ireland backstop.That won’t wash, Boris. Voters have been conned twice already. They won’t fall for another blatant fudge.Worryingly, Boris has surrounded himself with Mrs May’s most loyal Cabinet supporters — ministers who connived, and failed, three times to get her botched deal through Parliament.He is listening to staunch Remainers like Health Secretary Matt Hancock.He is taking advice from Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay who, for all their Brexit credentials, willingly dipped their hands in the Chequers blood. They each have a CV to protect.Bearing in mind Boris’s pathological craving for popularity, allies are also alarmed by the sudden support of old cronies and arch-Remainers David Cameron and George Osborne.None of them will tell him what he needs to hear: To save the Tories from the Farage sword, Britain must leave the EU as free traders.We cannot sign up to any iety of customs union, single market or EU court.Boris famously loves to be loved. He likes to have his cake and eat it. He hates making hard choices.But this is the biggest decision of his le and he cannot fudge it.Brussels’ greatest fear is Britain, the world’s fth-largest economy, as a free-wheeling tax haven on its western shore.It is, therefore, our deadliest negotiating weapon, and Boris needs to show his readiness to use it.He has frequently hailed Singapore’s transformation from a small, poor nation to a small, low-tax, well-educated, rich one.Against howls of protest, he backed Brexiteer tycoon Sir James Dyson’s decision to move his HQ there.Boris likes to remind us he won Mayor of London against the odds. But it is worth remembering he only did so after almost running out of steam.He needed to have his feet held to the fire with a blunt warning: “Let us down and we’ll cut your f***ing knees off.”Someone should sit down and give him exactly the same message today.THE most striking aspect of the Tory leadership contest has been the articulate energy of all the candidates – including the no-hopers.All are professional politicians whose job is to argue their case, sometimes without notes, and win over the hearts and minds of voters.It is only striking because Theresa May ­possessed none of those skills.Now we discover her Madame Tussauds waxwork has been given the heave-ho.

Trips to Bulgaria have doubled since  and it looks set to continue… with bookings for summer  up  per cent on last year.”In April, Thomas Cook said in its holiday report that Brits were increasingly looking beyond Europe for their summer break.While Spain was the number one destination for flights, countries such as Turkey and Tunisia were coming back in favour.The tour operator saw a  per cent increase in flight-only bookings to Turkey at the start of this year, overtaking Greece, which the tour operator said was the third most popular destination.And Tunisia was the third most popular holiday spot for Thomas Cook before the devastating  Sousse attacks.Its made a steady move up the rankings since February this year, and is now the seventh most popular destination for Thomas Cook customers. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

including mainland China.They claim the measure will prevent Hong Kong, a colony of million people, from becoming a magnet for fugitives.The legislation has met with widespread opposition from a huge cross-section of society including lawyers, journalists, activists and business figures.A procession of people almost two miles long marched for seven hours through central Hong Kong on Sunday, June .A group of protesters had planned to stay outside the government headquarters until the extradition bill undergoes its second reading, but police moved in after a permit to protest expired at midnight and met the protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets.Even though China has run Hong Kong since , the handover deal with the Brits ensured a -year one country, two systems deal where the city can retain key liberties, such as freedom of speech and an independent judiciary.Martin Lee QC, a pro-democracy figure and former legislator who helped organise the protests, told the : “If we lose this one, Hong Kong is not Hong Kong any more, it’s just another Chinese city.”"},{"url":null,"title":"love island caroline flack host hr","story":"“Islanders,” she ­thundered, “I’m sure you’re all wondering why I’m here.” As a matter of fact, yes.At best it seems like you’ve got a minor admin role. At worst, you’re Love Island’s head of Human Resources.What the ITV show really needs you to be, though, is the one thing you’re very obviously not — a host.Or just someone with enough wit and presence to draw attention away from the feeling I’ve had, ever since the th minute of the opening show, that this series of Love Island isn’t working.That was the moment Lucie arrived at the villa with a list of her own pre- prepared catchphrases. The public, I’d imagine, hated the presumption, but it was hardly unique to her.There’s an air of calculation and entitlement about most of this year’s contestants who, five series into its le, appear to have worked out what does and doesn’t play well with the public and are just killing time by the pool until they cash in on their performance afterwards.This doesn’t do much for the spontaneity of Love Island or the catchphrases which seem to have been replaced by those insanely annoying verbal tics that make the rest of us want to throttle everyone under the age of .Elma on Maura: “The bird has, like, ­literally lost her s**t.” Molly-Mae on Lucie: “I’ve, like, literally had her back in here.”Joe to Lucie: “You’re, like, literally a ­unicorn.” She’s, like, literally not.I think I could live with the bombardment of likes and literallys, though,it wasn’t for the overriding problem with this bunch, compared to previous series.They’re not very nice.In fact there’s a particularly ­indignant and gossipy bunch, centred round Anna, Amy, Molly-Mae and Amber and a couple of weaselly blokes , who are prepared to do their dirty work, that have given it a really unpleasant atmosphere a lot of the time.This has a knock-on effect, obviously.For the first four years, Iain Stirling’s commentary was the show’s outstanding feature.This series, it’s as manic as ever, but so flat and repetitive I’m starting to wonderI imagined the previous triumphs.This is by no means his fault. The deaths of two former contestants before the series began had already put it under huge scrutiny, and the spin-off seems to be that a small-yet-noisy chunk of the audience are now Love Island vigilantes who think it’s their duty to bombard Ofcom with complaints about anything, but mostly nothing.A great shame, as I genuinely love this show, which is normally the funniest and most ­gloriously un-PC event of the year.It still has its moments, of course. AndI had to pick only one, it would be Tommy claiming Molly-Mae “refreshies me,”you really ­pushied me.The inescapable feeling, watching this series of Love Island, however, is that all the innocence and quite a lot of the charm has been lost forever, like, literally.Joe and Lucie — Jucie.Jordan and Anna — Jordanna.Anton and Belle — Bellend.FOLLOWING the main BBC News, from Glastonbury, and The One Show, from Glastonbury, there was a complete change of gear from the Beeb from .pm on Friday.Glastonbury, on every single BBC channel, with the usual cast of thousands playing presenter tag.So a gushing Clara Amfo threw to Mark Radclfe and Jo Whiley, who threw to Jack Saunders, at the John Peel stage, who threw to James Ballardie, who threw back to Jo Whiley and some new bloke called Huw Stephens, who threw . . .You get the point.

Schools wouldn’t be able to give kids what they need.Older people would have problems with their pension payments.Grieve’s plan would have brought about the very thing that he and other anti-Brexit moaners have been warning about: A national meltdown.As a spokesperson for  Downing Street said of Grieve’s Remoaner plot: “Any attempt to deny vital funding to Whitehall departments would be grossly irresponsible.”This money is for “crucial areas like schools, housing and welfare”, the spokes­person said. To cut this money off is to play politics with people’s everyday lives. This extreme anti-No Deal plan was clearly aimed at Boris Johnson.Johnson has said thathe is elected Tory leader, and therefore becomes the next Prime Minister, he will take the UK out of the EU on October  “do or die”.It would be nice to leave with a deal, he says.ButBrussels refuses to renegotiate Theresa May’s Withdrawal Agreement, and keeps trying to foist a bad deal on us, then we will walk away without one, he has promised.The anti-Brexit wing of the establishment hates the idea of us making a clean break with Brussels, even though .million of us voted to leave three years ago.And so they will do anything to thwart it — including bringing about a government shutdown.Grieve’s plan would hamper essential government work and potentially inflict misery on huge numbers of people.It confirms how ruthless the Remoaner set has become.There is nothing they will not do to prevent us from walking away from the EU.We now know that these people are not actually ­worried about the wellbeing of ordinary folk in Brexit Britain.That is how they have ­justied their Brexitphobic antics over the past three years — as an effort to “save” Brits from the consequences of a No Deal Brexit.Yet it is clear now that they are more than willing to make people’s lives more ­dficultit helps them achieve their political aims.That is because their ­over-arching, obsessive aim is really just to stop Brexit. It is all they care about. The Grieve wrecking-ball plan shows what those of us who believe in democracy are up against today.We are up against a political class that will do almost anything to prevent the UK regaining the independence that millions of us voted for in the  referendum.They will whip up the politics of fear. They will demonise voters as stupid, “low-information” and xenophobic.And they will let Boris know that they are prepared to mess up government spending — and by extension everyday le —he goes for No Deal without Parliamentary approval.It is a kind of political blackmail: “Do what we want or we will shut down ­government departments.”If it does make its way to debate, MPs must reject this cynical, dangerous, anti- democratic plan and stand up for the right of the next Prime Minister to play hardball with the EU.The vote for Brexit — the largest democratic vote in UK history — must be upheld, however much it offends Dominic Grieve and other moaning MPs.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Avoid pollenThe most effective way to control hay fever is to avoid exposure to pollen.But this is easier said than done - especially during the summer months when you want to spend more time outdoors.Allergy UK say the best way to do this is to keep windows and doors closed when inside - especially early in the morning and evening when the pollen count is highest.They also advise avoiding peak pollen times and wearing wraparound sunglasses and a hat to prevent pollen getting onto the face and in the eyes.You should also avoid drying clothes on an outdoor washing line and shower when you get indoors to remove pollen from your skin and hair.. AntihistaminesAntihistamines treat hay fever by blocking the action of the chemical histamine, which the body releases when it thinks its under attack from an allergen. This stops the symptoms of the allergic reaction.Antihistamines are usually effective at treating itching, sneezing and watery eyes, but they may not help with clearing a blocked nose.Theyre available in tablet form and also as nasal sprays and eye drops.. CorticosteroidsCorticosteroidsare used to treat hay fever because they have an anti-inflammatory effect.When pollen triggers your allergic reaction, the inside of your nose becomes inflamed.Corticosteroids can reduce the inflammation and prevent the symptoms of hay fever.They are better at preventing and relieving nasal symptoms including sneezing and congestion.For those requiring rapid short-term relief from severe symptoms, for exampleyou have an exam or driving test, a GP may prescribe a course of tablets.. Nasal sprays and eye dropsNasal decongestants, in the form of a spray, can reduce the swelling in the blood vessels in your nose, which opens your nasal passage and makes breathing easier.Eye drops can treat red, itchy and watery eyes as they usually contain antihistamine to reduce the inflammation.Both nasal sprays and eye drops are available from a pharmacist.. Natural remediesMany people are turning towards natural remedies rather than conventional medicine to alleviate symptoms.Some try inhaling steam to clear congestion while others suggest drinking nettle tea - an anti-inflammatory.A new natural approach is Breaze Vapour Oil, which can be inhaled from a tissue to ease nasal itching, interrupt sneezing fits and clear a stuffy nose.. ImmunotherapyFor those with persistent hay fever symptoms, a GP may refer you for immunotherapy treatment.This involves gradually introducing you to small amounts of the allergen, such as pollen, and monitoring your allergic reaction in a controlled environment.Hay fever, on the other hand, can’t spread from person to person. It’s an allergic response to an environmental irritant such as pollen or dust.The nasal cavity contains cells that recognise foreign substances such as bugs and pollen.Once the body detects a bug or irritant, it activates an army of T cells that hunt down and destroy the substance. This is known as an immune response.In hay fever, the irritant triggers the same immune cells as viruses. But it also causes the release of IgE antibodies and histamines to produce an ongoing blocked nose, impaired sense of smell, and nasal inflammation.Both hay fever and the common cold causes sneezing, runny or stuffy nose and coughing.One of the key dferences is the colour of the nasal discharge - also known as snot, says Prof Ghildyal.She said: It’s more likely to be a yellowish green colour in colds, while in hay fever, it’s clear.Facial itchiness – especially around the eyes or throat – is a symptom typically only seen with hay fever.If someone is allergic to a seasonal environmental trigger such as pollen, their symptoms may be restricted to particular seasons of the year.Butyou’re allergic to dust or smoke, symptoms may last all year long.Hay fever, like asthma, is an allergic disease and can sometimes cause similar symptoms, such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath.A sore throat, on the other hand, is generally a precursor to cold.If you have cold-like symptoms and a sore throat or have had one in the last few days, your condition is more likely to be the common cold.An allergy test, using a skin prick or blood test, for allergen-specic IgE could inform you of the specic irritants that trigger your condition.These tests can be organised through your GP or pharmacist.Oral antihistamines are effective in hay fever patients with mild to moderate disease, particularly in those whose main symptoms are palatal itch, sneezing, rhinorrhoea, or eye symptoms hay fever treatments.Generally, treatment isn’t necessary for a cold but over-the-counter medications such as paracetamol and ibuprofen can help relieve some of the symptoms."},{"url":null,"title":"nike scrap air max colin kaepernick","story":"The sneaker giant reportedly ditched the in-demand £ sports shoes - which had already been sent to shops - after a complaint from outspoken NFL star Colin Kaepernick.The former San Francisco ers quarterback said he felt the use of the th century Betsy Ross Flag carried slavery connotations, sources told The Wall Street Journal.After pics of the shoe were posted online, Kaepernick - a Nike ambassador - is said to have contacted the company saying he and others felt the flag was offensive because of its connection to an era of slavery.In response, a Nike spokeswoman said: “Nike has chosen not to release the Air Max  Quick Strike Fourth of July as it featured the old version of the American flag.”Nike had already shipped the shoes to stores when it asked for them to be ed without any further explanation, according to the reports.It was in use at a time when lawmakers were pushing for the expansion of slavery and stated those born into slavery were to be slaves for le.The flag got its name from the woman who is said to have sewn the first “stars and stripes” on the US flag in .However, the flag has more recently been hijacked by some extremist groups opposed to increasing ersity in the US.In  it was claimed the flag was on display in the home of a member of the white nationalist group Identity Evropa.The Betsy Ross Flag has been turned into a symbol of white nationalism and domestic extremism, one person wrote.Conservatives will whine, but Colin Kaepernick was right to speak out and Nike was right to pull the products.However another wrote: Can we just for ONE DAY Attempt to be Americans and be PROUD especially during the th of July!

These are ided into two main types.The first are chemical insecticides, which poison the lice.

Pte Gue said he felt “racism was systemic within the Army and nothing was being done”.  He added: “My experiences of racial harassment and ­discrimination during the course of my employment have led me to realise that the Army is not the honourable ­institution I once thought it to be.” Both men claim there was an attempted cover-up and that officials did not acknowledge their reason for leaving. While in Kenya their colleagues called children begging for food “shit c**ts” and the country a “sh*****e”, the tribunal was told. Pte Gue said: “I was stunned by the racial abuse. I confided in Mr Zulu and he shared my feelings of hurt and anger.” Ugandan Pte Gue said the racial slurs were “often passed off as ‘banter’, although I found it very intimidating”.  It was said Pte Gue moved companies “as a result of the shocking behaviour”. He said his door and another private’s were “urinated on, have bottles smashed on them, and racial slurs written”.

Hannah Bharaj died of ‘catastrophic injuries’ following the fall inside the department store in Cheadle, Stockport, on July  last year.Today an inquest was told that Hannah was a ‘high-achieving perfectionist’ whose le began to ‘unravel’ following the death of two close family members, reports the Manchester Evening News .At the time of her death, the -year-old was a residential patient at the nearby Priory psychiatric hospital seeking treatment for her eating disorder and serious mental health problems.    On the evening of her death, the Birmingham University student was visiting the first floor cafe in John Lewis with her parents Harnovdeep and Sarah. Giving evidence, Mr and Mrs Bharaj told of the horrying moment Hannah, from Bolton, got up from the corner table they shared saying she was going to buy another drink before ‘walking briskly’ to the balcony ft away. Mrs Bharaj said: “We went to the Priory to pick Hannah up at about .pm. We would tend to go to the upstairs cafe in John Lewis because it stayed open later. Hannah had a book with her, I had a crossword. We all had a drink. Then Hannah said she wanted another drink, but she said she fancied a mocha, which was very unusual because of the calories. I gave her £ and she got up and something fell out of her book. It was a card addressed to mum and dad. That made me concerned. She went off to get a drink and when I looked up she didn’t go left to the drinks bit, she went right. I think I knew she was walking towards the balcony. I said ‘Harni, look at the balcony’. I knew then. He leapt up and ran after her. She walked briskly, it was very measured. She stood on a chair then a table then I just saw her legs go down the glass.”    Mr Bharaj added: “I ran towards her. I was about to grab her. She went over. I watched her fall. I couldn’t do anything. I screamed aposplease, anyone call an ambulanceapos.” Mr Bharaj said he believed the fall was a ‘deliberate’ attempt to take her own le. Earlier the inquest had heard how Hannah, a former pupil at Manchester High School for Girls, was a ‘tremendously hard worker’ who could be ‘quite tough on herself’. Her parents said she would set herself ‘very high standards’ and could get ‘very distressed’she didn’t meet her targets. A gymnast, dancer and swimmer, Hannah did ‘fantastically well’ in her GCSEs, and set her sights on a career in medicine, eventually applying to study at Birmingham University. She went on to get an A*, two As and a B at A-level. Initially, the grades weren’t good enough to get on the course, and Hannah ‘considered herself a failure because of the B’, Mrs Bharaj said, but eventually the university did offer her a place. But in her first few weeks in Birmingham Hannah’s grandfather, to whom she was ‘very close’, died. Hannah, who felt the late offer of a university place left her unprepared and was struggling to adapt to le as a student, found the death ‘very dficult’. Mrs Bharaj said: “It was almost like a secret le. She had a good group of friends at university and they would go out socialising but at home she would be very stressed and anxious and just not quite the same.” Hannah began a ‘fanatical’ exercise regime combined with a ‘low calorie high protein’ diet. She became ‘obsessional’ about food, weighing everything she ate and refusing to allow her parents cook for her. Eventually she was consuming just  calories a day, about a third of the recommended intake for an adult woman, and lost a ‘signicant amount of weight’. Mrs Bharaj said: “I think she felt everything in her le was out of control, so the only way to get on top of it was to control everything in a regimented fashion. That was her way of coping with the stress.” During the early stages of her second year at university Hannah was diagnosed with depression and admitted to Oak Trees eating disorder unit on the Wirral with a body mass index of . and was diagnosed with ‘severe anorexia’. Despite being given ‘intensive support’ her weight continued to fall and her depression escalated to the point where she became suicidal and ‘ending her le was her only topic of conversation’. Dr Jessica Morgan, a consultant psychiatrist at the NHS trust which runs Oak Trees, told the inquest Hannah was a ‘high-achieving perfectionist’ who suffered from ‘at least two severe mental illnesses’ and ‘acute grief’.  After six months in the unit Hannah began to show signs of improvement and was allowed tohome. But the inquest heard the death of a second close family member left her ‘absolutely devastated’. Shortly after Hannah attempted to take her own le by taking an overdose of her prescribed medication. She was admitted to an acute psychiatric ward at the Royal Bolton Hospital, before, because of a lack of NHS beds, she was transferred to the Priory, a private clinic in Cheadle. Mr and Mrs Bharaj told the inquest they felt the Priory wasn’t the right place for their daughter to be treated, describing it as ‘quite a scary place’ where Hannah ‘didn’t have the support she had at Oak Trees’. The inquest is expected to last for four days. Representatives from the Priory, John Lewis and the NHS are expected to give evidence.

The journey from hell had  fth-year Bristol veterinary students endure a torrid ride from Gatwick Airport to Somerset courtesy of Sparrow Travel. The outward bound trip from their university town to Gatwick and then on to Crete - in celebration of the end of their exams - went smoothly for those in the main -seater coach, but not so well for the accompanying minibus. The minibus driver was on his phone and made the passengers feel unsafe, they claimed. On theleg on June  the drivers of the coach and the minibus switched, leading to a sweaty-palmed ride home for those in the bigger vehicle.  Francesca Corbett, one of the tripaposs organisers, told  Somerset Live how the fraught journey began even before they had left the airport. It was the journey from hell - I am never using themagain, she said. We booked to be picked up from the airport at .am but we did not leave until  minutes later. We were delayed because the bus driver did not have a permit to park at the airport. My friend ended up paying £ for a permit so that we could finally leave. Sparrow should have sorted that but they did not. Things really started to go down hill when they got on the road. When we finally got going, the driver was frequently on his phone as he did not have any idea where he was going, Francesca continue. A lot of people were feeling worried so I went and sat right by him to tell him that I would direct him with the phone because it was not safe. I saw him struggling to stay in the lanes and he was veering across the road as well.    He nearly hit a sign, he got lost and we nearly hit into a van. The coach door was partly open on the M for a good five miles too. Francesca added: Eventually I got him to give me his phone but by that time the front screen was misting up badly. He was using his hat to clear the misty screen. He also opened the window which left lots of people very cold. When I asked about it he reacted quite aggressively and said the heater was not working. But it later turned out that he didnapost know how to turn it on. The miserable journey proved too much for some students, who got off the coach when it pulled in at Reading Services. Many of them burst into tears before taxis arrived to ferry them home. He said he was too tired so he wanted to pull over at Reading services to get  minutes of sleep, said Francesca. People were crying and were very scared. There were a lot of tears. The students who ended up getting taxis refused to go back on. I think the taxis were £ or so.  They waited for nearly an hour but they chose to do that and go all that way , rather than get back on the coach. Another person almost had the luggage hold door hit them as they removed their suitcase as well. The minibus did not have any problems and we did not get back home until several hours after them. Despite having supposed to have left the airport at .am, the coach didnapost arrive back in Bristol until .am. According to Google Maps the journey should take two and a half hours. I felt I let the team down. It was definitely the worst journey I had ever been on, Francesca said. We have tried to complain to themsince but they have just ignored us. Someone in our group called the police on  on the way back from Reading. They said they would send a car out to look for the coach to check the driver had a licence. Iaposve tried getting in touch with the person who rang but he has not got back to us. I think the people who paid for taxis should be compensated and my friend who paid £ for the coach permit should too. This put a downer on the holiday. The holiday itself went pretty smoothly. Everyone had a good time but at the final hurdle it was so unsafe. A spokesperson for Sparrow Travel said the driver was self-employed and taken on with work references from previous companies. They said the door could could not have been open while the coach was driving due to a safety device and that airport parking is always the customeraposs responsibility. If the driver was that bad then I can’t understand why they wouldn’t request a dferent driver for thejourney, they said.  Also when the driver takes the vehicle out on the road we can’t control what he is doing. Using a mobile phone is against the law. We can’t control this, only act on it after the event and we did act on this and sacked the driver. How can we be publicly blamed when all drivers are responsible for their own actions as we can’t watch and control them when they go out on the road  "},{"url":null,"title":"susie boniface learning idol ensured","story":"NewsopinionLearning from her idol ensured Coco was set for victorySusie Bonace celebrates Coco Gauffs incredible Wimbledon win over former champ Venus WilliamsShareCommentsBySusie Bonace:,  JUL Updated:,  JUL NewsopinionCoco beat Venus in straight sets\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailSome people would crow about smashing a former champion out of Wimbledon. Not Coco Gauff. The -year-old reacted to her win with grace and charm, just like the defeated Venus Williams. And between them, they provided the best news of the week. We watch sport for the stories. Coco was the youngest player to qualy for the event since . Venus was the oldest woman in the draw. Youthful enthusiasm took on a woman of experience, and won in straight sets. Coco – real name Cori – was also a wildcard, just like a -year-old Boris Becker back in . Who could forget him vaulting over the Centre Court net after clinching the championship  It was a joy to hear people chant “Boris! Boris!” then. Not so much today. But most importantly, Coco was playing a woman she’d looked up to since Venus inspired her to pick up a racket aged seven. To compete against what you worship is hard, to win astounding – and Coco managed it for one simple reason. Over years of coaching she learned to focus like Venus and her sister Serena, whose picture was on her bedroom wall, urging her on. She trained, studied, suffered, strived, to be like them. And then she went on to Court One, brought her own game, and won.    Every strand of the story in that match is inspiring, but none more so than the power of having a good role model. Whether it’s Venus, Raheem Sterling, Harry Kane, or Ellen White, an adult who, win or lose, plays a good game gives youngsters a space they can grow into, and then grow out of. It’s like parenting, in a way, but on a grander, better-paid, and less-forgiving scale. Parents are always flawed, because we see them up close. An idol is distant and perfect, which is why the public get so disgusted when other pictures on bedroom walls turn out to include adulterers, gamblers, or tax dodgers. Venus Williams has known for  years the responsibility of being so admired. Perhaps that’s why after losing to Coco she made a brief appearance for the cameras to congratulate her, before retiring to punch the wall in private.    One of my idols was a chief reporter on my first local paper. She taught me how to handle death knocks, sub editors and Fleet Street drinking games. Another was my gran, who railed at Tories after Sunday lunch and baked stonking cakes. I remember being , desperate to have a purpose, and adulthood, and the ability to have a crack at all these things. They taught me how, just like Venus did Coco. Idols matter. Applaud Coco for finding her purpose, and applaud Venus for delivering it.

Cameron Gallagher was set to jet home from his holiday to Cypriot party resort when he realised heaposd lost the crucial documentation. The -year-oldaposs week-long dream trip turned into disaster, reports the Daily Record. Cameron, from Kilmarnock, realised his passport had vanished at the island’s airport last Wednesday morning. Cameron’s  pals, some of them in tears, all headed home without him and to add insult to injury, a case mix-up at the airport meant the only clothes he had left to wear belonged to his friends while his own luggage made it back to Glasgow.    The former St Joseph’s Academy pupil has been pleading with authorities to let him go home but a series of hold-ups have trapped him in the party island that more than , sun-seekers flock to each year. “It’s been a bit horrible and frustrating to say the least,” Cameron said. “I was  minutes away from boarding the flight and realised that I didn’t have my passport on me and I was running round the airport like mad trying to find it but I couldn’t. “It was a heart in the mouth moment, and I didn’t really know what to do. “By that time everyone was on the plane so I told my friends to go and board the plane and leave me. “I still haven’t found my passport but I’m always losing things.”    Cameron was up for around  hours while trying to find a way home and took an hour-long bus ride to the British Embassy. Officials told him that it would take two working days to cobble together emergency travel documents but the embassy is closed on weekends. Speaking from the island earlier this week, Cameron said that the authorities said his temporary passport was ready on Monday, but couldn’t be collected until Tuesday. “The British Embassy has been shut over the weekend so it’s been a bit of a nightmare,” Cameron said. “I stayed in the town of Larnaca, where the airport is, for the first few nights and then went back to Ayia Napa for a night. But I’m now back in Larnaca. “I’ve been lucky because my parents have sent me some money to tide me over. “I haven’t even enjoyed being out on my own, I’ve just been sitting watching movies in my hotel. I get really bored easily.” And Cameron is now desperate to get back home to resume his summer job teaching English to kids at St Andrew’s College Language School, which he’s held down for three summers now. “I really want to get back because I was meant to start my summer job on Saturday and I don’t want to let them down. “My work have been great and really understanding of the situation though. “First time I spoke to my parents, my mum called me an idiot but they’re now as frustrated as I am and just want me home.” Cameron is  hopeful of getting home today by flying to London Heathrow and on to Glasgow. Last year, the Foreign and Commonwealth Officeissued emergency travel documents to over , Brits who were abroad. Officials say that it takes around two working days to issue an emergency travel document. An FCO spokesman said: “We have provided assistance by issuing emergency travel documents to a British man in Cyprus who had lost his passport.” "},{"url":null,"title":"whirlpool admits up 800000 faulty","story":"NewsWhirlpool admits up to , faulty tumble-dryers in homes around the UKIn June, the Government said it would issue a recall notice of up to , dryers which are a fire riskShareCommentsByNada Farhoud:,  JUL NewsIn June, the Government said it would issue a recall notice of up to , dryers which are a fire risk \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhirlpool has admitted that there could be as many as , faulty tumble dryers in homes around the UK.

Charlie Pugsley, deputy assistant commissioner of the London Fire Brigade, said it had seen a wide range of faults causing fires in machines which had already been modied.    MPs were taking evidence over the scandal that has seen . million products modied so far. Witness Jemma Spurr, whose modied dryer caught fire, told the Business Committee she was asked to sign a non-disclosure agreement. Whirlpool bosses were asked by MP Antoinette Sandbach why some victims were asked to sign NDAs, when the company had stated it wanted to raise awareness of the issue.She said: “Why is it that you are trying to shut people up by asking them to sign NDAs ”    Jeff Noel, from Whirlpool, defended their use, saying they are an “important part” of any settlement. He was also asked about the Grenfell fire and whether the firm stood by its statement the blaze may have been caused by a cigarette. An expert told a public inquiry it probably started in a Whirlpool Hotpoint fridge-freezer. Mr Noel said: “I’m not in a position to say anything other than I think it’s appropriate for issues to have been raised.” Five million dryers had a fault that allows fluff to touch the heating element and has caused at least  fires.

The foodie expert claims the sweet taste of the fruit goes brilliantly with the creamy and tangy Salad Cream, creating a unique dessert experience.    He said: Much like partnering fresh strawberries with balsamic vinegar, the sweetness of the strawberries contrasts favourably with the zinginess of Heinz Salad Cream, I think the combination is the perfect match. Those keen to discover whether or not heaposs right can try the pudding for themselves from now up until July  as it is on the menu at Elyaposs Department Store in Wimbledon. A bowl of the stuff will set you back £. - this is a tad more expensive than the strawberries and cream actually being sold at Wimbledon which cost £. per serving of at least ten Grade  English strawberries.

Dylan Maharani, known as Rani to her parents, has been living with predatory reptiles at her house in Tangerang, Indonesia, since she was two years old. Her father, Syahrul Effendi, works to provide care for injured exotic animals and said his daughter has acquired the animal-loving nature from him. Footage shows three-year-old Rani lying on a bed and watching aposUpin  Ipinapos, a popular cartoon show in southeast Asia, accompany with six dferent type of pythons. The snakes, which include a green tree python, a reticulated python and a yellow Burmese python, can be seen slithering over Raniaposs body as she locks her eyes on the phone screen.    Although the snakes are non-venomous, it could cause harm to Ranithey constrict. She didnapost move much but appeared very calm when the snakes moved around her. But this is not her first close encounter with dangerous reptiles. She was filmed applying medicine to a ft long Burmese python to treat its mouth ulcer and brushing her pet crocodileaposs teeth. Her father Syahrul did not appear to be very concerned about Raniaposs safety. He said: I understand what others are feeling. It is true that I am sometimes scared, but after seeing her interaction with the animal, the scary feeling goes away.    The first time she plays with a wild animal, I always watch and give her directions what to do. To be honest, currently, I donapost have any worry about her when playing with the animal. I donapost know why. I believe in her, so do to the animals. There were times that Syahrul would get injured while handling the animals, but he said it never happened to his daughter. He believed Rani had some connections with wild animals. He said: For example when she handles the big centipedes. They often bite me and those are extremely hurt. But, the centipedes never bite maharani.    When my mother touches the python, it twisted on her arm and that was very tight and hurt. But when maharani takes care of it, the python relaxed and strengthened its body. But the video has left web users feeling uneasy as they worriesthe snakes could attack the little girl. aposNorma Rodriguezapos said: So wrong!

These should ensure everyone receives #joined up# care, that they are asked how they are feeling as part of every diabetes appointment and that a mental health professional with knowledge of diabetes is part of every diabetes care team.To sign our petition, go to diabetes.org.uk missingAngela Mitchell, National Director of Diabetes Scotland.Sir,I#m asking residents in the Highlands and Islands to give their views on Conservative proposals for tackling serious crime.In order to provide Scotland with an alternative to Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP in , we are keen to gain feedback from as many people to our policy proposals to make them as relevant as possible to the needs and aspirations of everyone in Scotland.Too many people in Scotland are affected by the behaviour of serious criminals. This needs to be properly addressed and my colleague Liam Kerr MSP, shadow Justice Secretary, has outlined key policy proposals in a member#s bill in the Scottish Parliament to tackle this scourge.It would give Scottish judges the power to impose whole le sentences to those convicted of the most serious violent and sexual crimes including the murder of a police officer.The courts would still have discretion to impose the appropriate sentence based on all the facts of each case, as they do in England and Wales where such a provision already exists.The proposed Whole Le CustodyBill will not mean the perpetrators of a particular crime will always receive a whole le sentence, but rather that the courts will have the power to impose one where there is sufficient justication.We have started the consultation and experts and members of the public are invited to register their views.Email me at donald.cameron.msp@parliament.scot or write to me at Donald Cameron MSP,  George Street, Oban, PA NT, with your views.MSP Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands.Sir,The SNP has warned Scotland’s NHS is under threat from a Tory-Trump trade deal that could leave the Scottish Government without a veto over a post-Brexit deal that sells Scotland out.This stark warning follows the revelations from Donald Trump that in terms of trade deals, everything, including the NHS, would be on the table.At Prime Ministers Questions, SNP Deputy Westminster Leader Kirsty Blackman MP said Donald Trump and the Tories could not be trusted on the NHS and criticised the UK government for plotting to take powers away from the Scottish Parliament that would allow it to safeguard Scotland’s NHS.The threats to Scotland#s NHS are growing under the prospect of a hard-right Tory-Trump Brexit trade deal. Those threats could undermine the integrity and independence of our Scottish NHS.The UK Tories will block any potential veto by the Scottish Government over such a damaging deal.The SNP government will fight to the end to defend Scotland#s public services from this unprecedented Tory Brexit danger. Our NHS must remain in public hands. It is not, and should never be, up for sale.Scotland has been completely ignored throughout the Brexit process and Tory plans to grab powers from the Scottish Parliament will leave us even more exposed.It is clearer than ever that the only way to properly protect Scotland#s interests, and keep our NHS in public hands, is with the full powers of independence.MP Brendan O#Hara, Argyll and Bute."},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures week 25","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowFiona McCuish of Ardrishaig captured the VIC puffer wending its way up the Crinan Canal.Fiona used her camera phone as the vessel passed through West Bank, Ardrishaig."},{"url":null,"title":"dunadd drubbing for league leaders","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowArdnamurchan Women#s Camanachd AssociationDunadd ladies closed in on the top of the table with a thumping win against the league leaders.The Mid Argyll girls travelled to Spean Bridge for the game against undefeated Ardnamurchan but proved too strong for the home team.The game started evenly, but two early goals from top goal scorer Eilidh Cameron settled Dunadd.Against the run of play, however, Ardnamurchan broke away and scored, giving the home team hope and momentarily shaking Dunadd.

Working with the Kilmartin Museum Education Officers, Field Archaeologist Roddy Regan and the Tarbert Community Castle project team led by Robert McPhail, pupils either spent a half day or full day on the castle site.Each day the children had a guided tour of the castle site and of the ious open ‘dig’ trenches, followed by a viewing of some of the objects found on the site in previous weeks. The highlight of their day was to excavate the soil in their trench and the children enjoyed ‘trowelling’ the soil, then sieving their excavated soil checking for any objects that may have escaped their eye.Finally, at the end of the dig sessions, the pupils gathered round to examine the objects no matter how big or small, they had each found on the day. Over the two weeks, the children found a iety of broken pottery pieces ranging in age and style that included medieval and Victorian pottery, clay pipes, broken Victorian slate pencils, ious colours and style of glass and one silver D coin dating to early s.On behalf of the Kilmartin Education team and the schools that took part in the community dig, we would like to express our sincere thanks to the Tarbert Community Trust for allowing the schools such a wonderful opportunity, to dig on a site that is steeped in history, and is of such historical signicance for the West coast of Scotland but in particular for the Mid Argyll and Kintyre area."},{"url":null,"title":"lochgilphead dental practice to open next year","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowPremises have been found for a new dental practice in Lochgilphead as recruitment problems continue at Mid Argyll Hospital dental suite.Attempts to recruit a replacement for a senior dental officer in Mid Argyll Hospital who retired in November last year proved unsuccessful.

Leaderdale and Melrose at the local authority, told us: \"I am pleased that Newland Assets have listened carefully to the representations they have received concerning the Borders Gateway proposals.\"A Class  food retail store was very much against local and national planning policy for the site in Tweedbank as it introduced out of town shopping but the developer has listened carefully to ious concerns on this issue and removed it.ldquoThe new proposals have taken on board many observations made so far during the planning process and the revised plans are better in terms of design, road layout and visual impact.\"I am very excited about the economic impact this development could have on the wider Borders economy.ldquoSecuring a Premier Inn for the Scottish Borders will help put our region firmly on the tourism map and the economic impact of Premier Inn and the potential for other investors to follow them, is something which must be grasped.ldquoThe revised Borders Gateway proposals will complement the work taking place to develop the Tweedbank Innovation Park and will sit comfortably alongside the public and private sector projects which are underway at Tweedbank at present.\"The pound million Borders Gateway development also includes a BP filling station, a Costa drive-thru coffee shop, and a MS kiosk.And it is expected that the new outlets will create up to  jobs.Although the wider vision of the development had been welcomed, the supermarket part of the plans had come in for criticism.And Newland Assets revised their plans to omit the supermarket earlier this year.Councillor Parker added: ldquoBorders Gateway has the overwhelming support of the public and many businesses in the area and now that the food retail plans have been dropped there is no reason why these proposals should not be fully endorsed by the planners and backed by Scottish Borders Council.\"The economic advantages of this proposal signicantly outweigh the very small number of policy considerations which are left.ldquoAlthough it was right for the planners to raise concerns about the previous proposal, now that the developer has listened carefully to all the objections and amended the plans accordingly to deal with them, the Borders public simply wonrsquot understand why the council isnrsquot backing this ambitious inward investment opportunity.\"It will help bring new jobs and secure existing jobs and undoubtedly lead to a tourism boost in the Scottish Borders.ldquoI look forward to this development receiving approval and work commencing on

including  around the Eildon area.Among the identied playparks to be decommissioned are  in Galashiels - Balnakiel Terrace, Broom Drive, Croft Street, Kingsknowe, Lee Brae, Netherbank, Roger Quin Gardens, Rosebank Place, Sykes Acre, Waverley Place and Woodlea - four in Earlston - Acorn Drive, Everest Road, Gun Road and Summerfield - four in Selkirk - Bannerfield small park, Fairfield Crescent, Heatherlie Park and Rosebank Quarry - and three in Melrose at Eildon View, Fairways and Priors Walk.Playparks in Darnick, Fountainhall, Gattonside, Lauder, Newstead and Newtown St Boswells are also facing the chop.Opposition councillor Stuart Bell, who represents Tweeddale East, said: ldquoParents tell us that ndash particularly for small children ndash they value small local facilities where the kids donrsquot have to cross busy roads, and parents can keep an eye on them.ldquoThese parents have a right to be consulted on any changes.Council leader Shona Haslam has been driving the plans forward.And she believes that the sacrice of smaller playparks will be worth it.Councillor Haslam said: ldquoOur investment means we will have better and bigger facilities but some smaller sites will have to close.ldquoWe have lots of old equipment in unsuitable locations, for example on concrete standings or in areas that flood easily, are often vandalised, or in a poor state of repair ndash and we are discussing with communities what should happen to these.\"We want our playparks to be the best, but that may mean that some of the single swings or roundabouts may have to go."},{"url":null,"title":"selkirk-bids-for-online-stampede-following-website-launch","story":"SELKIRK is hoping to attract a few surfers to explore the Royal Burgh with the launch of a new tourism website.The online site went live recently -

extension will receive this pound million boost for a full study into how we can bring the line to Hawick, Newcastleton and on to Carlisle.ldquoLess tangible but equally important is the investment in broadband, tourism, business and energy which the whole of the Borders is set to benefit from.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said:ldquoItrsquos fantastic news that the UK Government is to invest up to pound million in the Borderlands Deal.ldquoThis is an ambitious approach to cross-border working between Governments, local authorities and partners which will boost economic growth by helping existing business, encouraging new ventures and bringing a wealth of improvements to people who live and work in the area and to visitors.ldquoThe Borderlands Deal has made huge progress in the last  months.ldquoId like to thank the five lrmlocal authorities who have worked so well together, along with the UK and Scottish governments, to achieve this.ldquoThe south of Scotland and northernmost parts of England operate as a single economic area and it is important the border is not allowed to become an obstacle to development.South Scotland Labour MSP and Scottish Labourrsquos Shadow Cabinet Secretary for Infrastructure, Connectivity and Transport, Colin Smyth, has welcomed the news but warned that the Borderlands deal will not provide a quick fix for the challenges facing the region.He said: ldquoHaving been involved in the Borderlands since the beginning, Irsquom pleased to see this deal finally agreed as it has been a long time coming.ldquoThe five local councils deserve enormous praise for developing the projects and getting to this stage, given that many people predicted it would be impossible to bring councils from across the border together in this way.ldquoEveryone now needs to get on with delivering the projects.ldquoThis will not be a panacea for the regionrsquos massive economic challenges.ldquoIt works out at around poundm a year over ten years for the whole of the south of Scotland which is quite modest.ldquoHowever, it will bring some badly needed investment into projects that could make a real dference to the local economy."},{"url":null,"title":"campaigners-ignored-as-eildon-housing-approved","story":"CAMPAIGNERS say their concerns ldquofell on deaf ears after Scottish Borders Council approved a controversial planning development on the foot of the Eildon Hills.Rural Renaissance, the contracting arm of Melrose-based JS Crawford property developers, wants to build  homes on the Croft, near Dingleton Road, Melrose.Some of the new properties would tower m about the height of Dingleton Road, and the council has so far received  objections and representations.However, councillors sitting on Scottish Borders Councilrsquos planning and building standards committee, which met on Monday July , opted to stick with planning officerrsquos recommendation to approve the development.Speaking at the meeting on behalf of the lsquoDonrsquot Build on the Eildonsrsquo campaign group, Melrose resident Carrie Henderson told councillors: ldquoBad design has been compounded by certain stipulations made in the planning brief.ldquoThe requirement for a road to loop around the nursery, when combined with the awkward levels on the site, have results in plans for houses on the southern slopes being some  metres higher than the level of the road.ldquoBe in no doubt, this housing estate will be dominant, intrusive and jarring. It will be an eyesore.Philip Neaves, from Edinburgh-based Felsham Planning and Development, spoke on behalf of Rural Renaissance.He said: ldquoThe Croft is an allocated development site that was allocated in .ldquoThe reporter who allocated the site would have been well aware of the sensitivity of the site but has still allocated it.ldquoWhat we have is proposals for  houses for private sale and seven affordable housing units.ldquoThe site, when viewed from Melrose, appears as part of the settlement, not the countryside, and views of the site from the Eildons are limited.ldquoThere are signicant economic benefits to the development, not just for employment during the construction phase but for nearby residents as well.Nearly all of the councillors expressed reservations about the development, but only one, Galashiels councillor Sandy Aitchison, voted against the proposals.He told the committee: ldquoThe fact is the reporter has made a big mistake here and the land should never have been allocated for housing in the first place.ldquoFurthermore, I donrsquot like the fact wersquove got affordable housing as a token gesture, itrsquos not spread out in the site and there are no family homes.\"Do people who need affordable homes not have families ldquoThere are so many objections. Many are from where and they are asking us to step in and protect this site which we as a local authority are charged with protecting.ldquoI really object to this application for a number of reasons.Melrose and Leaderdale councillor Tom Miers, who chairs the committee, also criticised the proposals but said he believes it can be acceptedthe council imposes certain planning conditions: ldquoI have real problems with the design and concept. I think the houses at the back are much too high and they stick out too much.ldquoThe middle three in particular, which will be at the back of the site, should be reduced in height.He suggested that the houses be reduced, by way of a planning condition, from three storey houses down to two storey.All councillors except councillor Aitchison were in agreement, and as he failed to find a seconder for his motion to reject the application, the proposals were granted planning permission without the need for a vote.Speaking after the meeting, Ms Henderson said: ldquoOver  people objected to this development and yet in the end it felt like their opinion counted for nothing. Todayrsquos decision is obviously a huge disappointment for them.ldquoUnfortunately, the planning committee couldnrsquot, or wouldnrsquot, see past the fact that this site is in the local plan.ldquoThe arguments we put forward that the proposal for the Croft is sub-standard and would irrevocably scar the view of the Eildons fell on completely deaf ears and the committee happily waved it through.ldquoFuture generations will look back and wonder how it was possible that a housing estate was ever allowed to be built on the beautul Eildons. But by then, of course, it will be too late.ldquoThe members of the planning committee, bar the one councillor who objected, should be ashamed of themselves for the decision they made today."},{"url":null,"title":"ft-england-1-united-states-2-lionesses-out-of-womens-world-cup","story":"FT: England  United States Christen Press scored the opening goal for the USAEllen White equalised for England before Alex Morgan put the US back in frontWhite had a second goal ruled out and then won a penalty on VAR, but Steph Houghtons spot-kick was saved by Alyssa NaeherWHAT THEY SAIDEngland boss Phil Neville: ldquoMy players gave me everything.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area.

It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

There are several factors influencing this, but the major factor which has tipped the balance is the extended funding hours and the negative impact this is having both financially on small businesses, like Mary Poppins, and to the quality of early learning and childcare.New Scottish Government policy instructs councils to increase their funded childcare hours from  to , by . This move also includes longer opening hours and a move from term time to year-round opening hours to attempt to make childcare more nationally accessible.Ms Dewar said: ldquoThe money received for funded places does not cover the costs of providing the quality of early learning and childcare which we want and are required to provide, especially with regards to staff costs.ldquoThe timescales and measures that the Scottish Government has put in place to educate a workforce to meet the increased requirements are insufficient, and there is a serious shortfall to meet the requirements of the extended funding.ldquoEast Lothian Council indicated it estimated it would require approximately  staff to facilitate the increase in funded hours in East Lothian. The majority of these posts are early learning and childcare practitioners.ldquoThe local authority advertises early learning practitioner posts at between pound. and pound. per hour. Private nurseries are unable to compete with these rates of pay due to the funding rates we are allocated.A group of parents and staff, including Ms Dewar, are visiting county MSP Iain Gray to discuss the problems, but Ms Dewar added that unless he can ldquowork a miracle and change the policy, then it is unlikely the decision to close the nursery will be reversed.When asked about the nursery, Mr Gray said: ldquoThe loss of any nursery provision is disappointing, particularly with the Governmentrsquos , funded hours policy set to be implemented next year.ldquoIn the case of the Mary Poppins Nursery, the owner has highlighted a number of factors that have contributed to their decision to close.ldquoI have written to East Lothian Council about some of these issues.ldquoHowever, there are also wider issues at play here. The nursery sector has been warning the Scottish Government that private nurseries are struggling in the run-up to the roll-out of its flagship , policy from August .ldquoMinisters must act quickly to address the sectorrsquos concerns and ensure that the capacity exists to deliver the funded hours next year.A Scottish Government spokesperson said: ldquoIt is, of course, concerning to hear of any nursery considering closure, and the obvious effects this might have on staff, parents and children.ldquoEast Lothian Council has provided assurance that they will support families to find alternative early learning and childcare places for children who had been expecting to use the Mary Poppins Nursery from this August.Ms Dewar added: ldquoI am distraught that circumstances have forced me to this decision and that such a wonderful place for children to experience their early years is to close.The decision was met with an outpouring of grief on social media.The nurseryrsquos recent th birthday was marked with a garden party.The nursery was founded by Sue Armstrong, affectionately still called lsquoMiss Suersquo, after she had written to Mary Poppins author P L Travers to askshe could use the name.Miss Sue said: ldquoI received many letters from P L Travers about the nursery.ldquoAt the beginning, she wanted to know what the nursery was going to be like. She had no objection to me using the name, she just wanted to find out more. I ended up meeting her as well.ldquoWe were hoping to get her to come and open the nursery  years ago, but her arthritis was bad. We stayed in touch, however. I would send her letters about how the nursery was getting on along with photos, and she would write back saying how she liked it, and ideas of what to do.ldquoShe said that the children should be encouraged to make up their own stories. lsquoChildren like doing that,rsquo she said.Miss Sue sold the nursery to Ms Dewar in  as she was ldquosick of all the paperwork.She said. ldquoWhen I heard it was to close down, well, itrsquos just all so sad really. Itrsquos such a terrible shame.ldquoIt is such a nice and happy place for the children, homely and warm. Itrsquos just awful that it canrsquot stay open.Miss Sue still attends events at the nursery, dressed as the iconic nanny Mary Poppins.She added: ldquoIn the film, Mary Poppins says that shersquoll stay until the winds change. Well, maybe this is the wind changing for Mary Poppins Nursery.Ward councillor Craig Hoy said: ldquoThe closure of the Mary Poppins Nursery is deeply regrettable but reflects the real pressures the independent sector is experiencing as a result of the SNPrsquos , hours policy.\"The Government faces huge problems to provide the free childcare it has promised.

Five minutes in a car can cover a distance which would represent a fairly long walk.Itrsquos kind of a simple principle, I know, but one I sometimes forget, as I did a couple of weekends ago. We set off from an event at Amisfield Walled Garden for a walk. My idea was to walk along the River Tyne to Hailes Castle and thenndash by car a -minute round trip.We had some supplies in the form of fruit in my bag and a little water. It was a sunny and warm day and so we set off on our adventure.We began the walk at the old Abbey Bridge which spans the Tyne close to Amisfield. As you walk under its ancient ribbed arches of this late medieval bridge, you get a real sense of its age and the beauty of its construction.The path beyond follows the river and it is almost impossible now to imagine that a great abbey once stood here, with connections to the infant Mary Queen of Scots. A ruined old mill of later centuries still stands here. I reflected on the stories of this location: a courageous nun who defied a flood in the th century and a gruesome murder in the th century and just visible in the near distance the old graveyard, now ringed with trees and almost unrecognisable as a resting place for the dead.A labourer once thought he saw a ghost at the graveyard, but it proved to be something , and I had a wry smile at that tale of a drunken evening over  years ago. These are all tales I have already told here, but they entered my head as we wandered to the gate that led along the northern bank of the river.Hailes Castle is on the southern bank of the river and I knew that there was a bridge that would takes us over. So we set off to find the bridge.But it took us over four hours.It was a stunning walk, with wild flowers and trees decorating the riverbank almost all the way. A grey heron seemed to follow us perhaps he was warning us that the walk was longer than Irsquod anticipated.It is a walk decorated with history too, of course. A stone in the corner of the field by the first gate caught my eye. Deeply ingrained groove marks on it intrigued me. I was later told that it could be the marks of a plough, as the tips of the plough have scraped over the stone a ploughman unwittingly leaving evidence of his unrecorded toil.Halfway along the walk we arrived at the small hamlet of Sandyrsquos Mill. The cottages and mill itself have been beautully restored. The th-century mill still has its waterwheel, although itrsquos now embedded in silt. The mill ceased working  years ago and was transformed into a residential property, but with much of the old machinery inside still intact. It appears to be a very sympathetic and sensitive restoration.It was beyond Sandyrsquos Mill that the distance began to take its toll. The young kids were tired and desperately looking for the bridge. I spotted Traprain Law some distance away and realised that I had badly misjudged the distance and time it would take with wee ones. We had to sit and have a rest and story, with that grey heron listening, to gather the energy to continue.The kids didnrsquot complain much as we wandered along the still-beautul path, now desperately looking for the bridge. As we had rested wersquod phoned for friends to come and lsquorescuersquo us at Hailes Castle with chocolate and water, and we knew they were there waiting for us.Irsquove never been quite so pleased to see Hailes Castle. It loomed suddenly from across the river. I had never approached it from this direction and it certainly did its best to impress. The bridge was just a wee way further and we finally crossed it with a sense of relief.When we arrived at the castle, the kids devoured the chocolate and water, in a way that reminded me of a scene in the movie Ice Cold in Alex. Thank goodness for good friends.Wersquod made it and what a sense of adventure ndash and an achievement!I sat with the kids and told stories as my we went with the friends to retrieve our car. Hailes Castle drips with history but they wanted tales about giants.The day was a lesson for me: to think more carefully about distance when setting on a walk! I thoroughly recommend the path, especially on a lovely summerrsquos day. But itrsquos going to take half a dayyou have kids. So prepare for that!Unbelievably, the kids later wanted to go to a playpark. ldquoWhere do they get the energy  my we asked.ldquoFrom us! I replied!"},{"url":null,"title":"hopes-of-seeing-railway-station-return-to-haddington","story":"RAGESmet with Peter Brett Associates ndash a leading consultancy of engineers and planners ndash to outline the case for improved transports links to and from East Lothian.One of the more ambitious plans was to see theof a railway station to Haddington.Residents of the town have not been served by a railway station since , with the station closing to freight nearly  years later.However, RAGES feels there could still be a possibility of a station ing to the town ndash though the group acknowledged that work needed to be done.A spokesman for the group said: ldquoRAGES expressed its preference for re-opening of the Haddington branch, ideally to the previous terminus on Station Road.ldquoMinimal compulsory purchase relocation of existing industrial units would be required the biggest physical obstacle would be the reconstruction of the A overbridge which was unwisely built without preserving the railway alignment and loading gauge.ldquoA level crossing would be required at Gateside, failing which an alternative road access could be provided for the new houses on the north side of the line onto the A.There was also a suggestion of creating car parking and even a park and ride facility in the town to serve the new service, which would link the town with Edinburgh.The spokesman added: ldquoAs insufficient parking exists at Station Road , a park and ride station at Oak Tree would be essential, which could also serve the substantial Letham Mains and Gateside developments.ldquoJust east of where the A crosses the railway formation, there is a large rectangular piece of ground, occupied only by scrub, which would be suitable as a car park.ldquoAs only single track would suffice between Longniddry and Haddington, it would be possible to retain a footpath cycleway as the line was originally provided with double track throughout.ldquoAn electric train service from Haddington to Edinburgh would provide the speed and capacity which road transport ndash car or bus ndash cannot match.

It is better than some human beings are treated ndash that is the sad truth.Mr Farnsworth was presenting an annual report on the racecoursersquos performance over the last financial year.The Beast from the East snow storm, an outbreak of equine influenza, and a long spell of dry weather all contributed to what he described as one of the worst years the course had been through in his memory.A number of key fixtures were cancelled and profits fell.In December, four horses died during one day of racing at the course but a subsequent review by the British Horseracing Authority ruled that the course and race organisers were not at fault.Councillor Gordon Mackett asked Mr Farnsworththe racecourse had been affected by animal welfare concerns.The course manager said: ldquoWe did have a horrible day when there were four fatalities however, these were all completely separate incidents.ldquoIn a sport like this you will get injuries and fatalities from time to time. It is horric for the people involved.Mr Farnsworth said that the public were becoming more aware of incidents like these through social media which, he said, ldquofuelled the debate around animal welfare.However, he said there had been no indication that it had had an impact on events at Musselburgh, which saw record crowds at its Easter Day racing this year and another sell-out Ladies Day.His report to the committee revealed that the racecourse had reported a loss over the last financial year after it paid over pound, of legal costs relating to the ongoing process by East Lothian Council to find new third-party operators to run the course.Councillor Kenny McLeod questioned why the costs were being met by the course and not the council itself.However, depute chief executive of the council Alex McCrorie told the councillor that the costs were charged to the racecourse because when the new operator was procured it would be the racecourse that benefitted.He conceded to Mr McLeod that, without the legal costs being taken from the coursersquos funds, it would have been in profit last year.East Lothian Council replaced the previous governance committee which oversaw the running of the course with a new committee last year after relations between members of the old committee badly deteriorated and the British Horseracing Authoritythreatening to suspend its racing licence.The new Musselburgh Racing Associated Committeendash which is made up of four elected councillors and two representatives of the racing industry, currently members of Lothians Racing Syndicate ndash has been overseeing the hunt for a new operator.However, the BHA has only granted temporary licences and extensions under the new committee as it continues to monitor its performance.Mr Farnsworth said that the introduction of the new interim committee had caused some problems too.

I have heard many dferent versions of this tale, and most recently come across one version in a book by Taffy Thomas, who is a renowned storyteller. Here is my version of the story, which I have titled lsquoThe Riddle Rulersquo:IT WAS to be the final race of the tournament. The two knights had been equally matched, and now they would race each other for the prize of a gold cup filled with gold coins.There was an air of excitement as the crowds gathered for this race. Sir John and Sir Harry arrived together, each mounted on their stallions. Sir Johnrsquos horse was called Lightning, while Sir Harryrsquos horse was named Spear.They were equally matched, both knights had won an equal amount of races, and both had won against each other. There was no favourite, everyone knew this race would be very close.The atmosphere was electric with anticipation.Then the kingrsquos storyteller leaned over to whisper in the kingrsquos ear: ldquoYour majesty, this race is the last of the tournament. I feel it should be a race with an extra challenge, so that the crowd are better pleased.The king agreed, but asked the storyteller what he thought the extra challenge should be.ldquoThe race should be a test of the knightsrsquo wits as well as their riding ability, replied the storyteller. ldquoSet them a riddle rule and see how they solve it.ldquoAnd what is the riddle rule to be  asked the king.The storyteller smiled: ldquoDeclare the rules of this race to be thus: the horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and coins for its owner.And so the king declared the riddle rule just before the beginning of the race: ldquoThe horse which crosses the finish line second will win the cup and gold for its owner.There was a murmuring amongst the spectators. The knights looked at each other, thinking.When the starter flag was lowered and the king cried ldquogo, both knights stayed at the starting line. ldquoYou go first, said Sir John to Sir Harry. ldquoNo, after you, said Sir Harry to Sir John. But neither knight was willing to leave the start line lest they be deemed to be first.Soon there were boos and clapping from the crowd, but the prize was too great for either knight to risk going first.ldquoThis race is no fun, said the king to the storyteller, annoyed now that hersquod agreed to the change in rules.ldquoGive them until this afternoon to find a way to race, replied the storyteller, ldquothere is a way but they must discover it. It will challenge their wits and also their riding skills.And so the king stood: ldquoThe race is postponed until pm this afternoon. The knights must find a way to race to the riddle rule, otherwise the prize will be forfeited.For the rest of the day there was an excited buzz as people began to discuss possible solutions to the riddle rule with the knights.ldquoWhy donrsquot you agree to cross the finish line together  was one suggestionldquoBut then they would be equal first and the prize would be lost, commented another.ldquoBesides, said Sir John, ldquoI do not trust Sir Harry not to pull his horse back at the last moment. ldquoI do not trust you either, said Sir Harry.The deadline was fast approaching and no solution to the riddle rule had been found.ldquoPerhaps being first is more important than winning the gold, said an old woman.The knights looked at each other, thinking about this. Then they both said ldquonaw and shook their heads.It was  minutes before the race and a child came up to the knights and said: ldquoI have an idea. Everyone looked down at the child and laughed. How could a poor child know the answer when the knights themselves and all the spectators were scunnered But the storyteller was walking by and overheard the laughter. ldquoChildrenrsquos wisdom is not to be laughed at, he scolded them.And so the knights asked the child for the solution.The child said two words to the knights.In a flash, the knights got mounted and prepared to race. When the starter flag was lowered and the king shouted ldquogo, both Sir John and Sir Harry raced as fast as they could, each being desperate to be first across the finish line. Their riding skills were well challenged by this race.Who won does not matter in this story. What matters are the two words that were said by the child. They were the answer to the riddle rule, and so made the race possible.What were those two words If you havenrsquot already worked it out then re-read the story carefully. If you still donrsquot know, and want to know the answer, then I will give it next week.Or perhaps you could ask a child. I know some children from P in St Gabrielrsquos Primary School who know the answer to this."},{"url":null,"title":"plan-to-turn-prestonpans-town-hall-into-a-digital-paradise","story":"Prestonpans Community Council is bidding to take control of the High Street venue and turn it into an audio-visual and digital haven.A sub-committee of the community council that was formed when the option for a Community Asset Transferof the Town Hall to the group was first offered has come up with a lsquodigital destinationrsquo concept ndash and garnered positive feedback from the community council.The community council is the only group to have put in a note of interest for the Town Hall, and the sub-committee ndash featuring DJ Johnston Smith, Calum Miller and Professor Roger Bromley ndash has now made public its vision for the building.Their initial idea is to create an audio-visual centre within the Town Hall for gamers and competitions, as well as running educational classes on technology and creating a ldquodigital destination for all with k audio-visual displays, fibreoptic network, high-speed computers, floor space and a cafe.In the subcommittee strategy, the members state: ldquoThe activities which once occupied our Town Hall are not filling it today we need to think creatively to identy new audiences.ldquoAll of the traditional activities can now be accommodated where in our town.ldquoOur Town Hall needs to offer something unique to the community: our challenge is to use our assets to create richer social interactions for all.ldquoWe live in a world where the social networks that helped us advance are increasingly replaced by the digital iety.

To show her she is cherished and adored, particularly in a world of air kissing and fake intimacy. That they have a special bond.To suggest such a gesture has sexualised undertones shows just how far wrong we have gone as a society. Instead of praising a loving, supportive father and child relationship, people look on with distaste and discomfort.Until she died when I was in my early s I would always kiss my gran on the lips. It was such a special gesture, a sign of our closeness and importance to each other as family.

We donrsquot see each other often and Irsquod forgotten about it. It buoyed me so much that I emailed a friend about it that evening. My dad was never involved in my le and Irsquom an only child, so, growing up with that gesture, it felt like my uncle was marking me out as one of his girls, along with my two female cousins. Itrsquos a tiny thing that feels really special and without a male role model at home, it showed how affection should feel.The thought of anyone condemning this as inappropriate is deeply dispiriting. Itrsquos familial love, a most precious thing.Children must be encouraged and enabled to set their own boundaries, of course. As soon as kissing a family member becomes uncomfortable or embarrassing or simply something the child doesnrsquot want to do, then it should stop.Children have a right to autonomy over their own bodies and itrsquos important they arenrsquot forced to take a sloppy kiss on the cheek from an auntie or give a family friend a hug when they donrsquot feel like it.

I know nothing of the Queenrsquos soul. I can neither judge her good or bad, but I accept many see her as a person of moral standing. However, the character of Elizabeth Windsor is meaningless in any debate about monarchy.The institution of monarchy should have been buried decades,not centuries, ago. Like the death penalty or denying votes to women or jailing people for who they have sex with, the idea that a person has a hereditary right to rule stands in opposition to every principle of modernity.What slaves it makes us to accept this state of affairs. This isnrsquot a call for some Robespierre revolution. Britain ndash England in particular ndash has been sucking on the crack-pipe of royalty for too long to be weaned off any time soon. Whatrsquos needed though is an intelligent ongoing conversation which challenges the accepted wisdom that monarchy is a good thing when it clearly isnrsquot.The time is ripe for that debate. It may be an ugly thing to say but the Queenrsquos age makes the discussion pertinent. Even Republicans like me accept that the monarchy is safe as long as she lives. However, the entire fabulation ndash every palace and power, every penny and privilege ndash needs to be put to the test before her Crown passes on.I struggle to find one argument to sustain monarchy. People cite tradition. It used to be traditional to burn witches. The traditions of this country have served us badly. Britain clings to the past like a drowning sailor ndashthe country hadnrsquot been so obsessed with the war, the flag, and the Royals, we might have seen clearer and avoided the red, white and blue disaster thatrsquos Brexit.

Monarchy murders meritocracy.Social mobility barely exists in the UK. The top professions are dominated by public schools and Oxbridge. No wonder. The monarchy effectively codies inequality in law.

The final bill is expected to be pound.m. It will be the perfect home for their baby. There was a headline in one of the glossy magazines recently which read \"Why the Royals canrsquot stop giggling\". It had lots of pictures of Harry and William and all the rest of them laughing. I couldnrsquot help but think, theyrsquore laughing at us.Amid all the squandering of money on these people, it feels redundant to make the point that there are working families unable to pay their mortgages across the land, and jobless families struggling to clothe and feed themselves. Yet, the British doff their cap, and donrsquot bat an eyelid.The philosopher Thomas Paine said \"a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong gives it a superficial appearance of being right and raises at first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But the tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason.\"Britain, with its stubborn anti-intellectualism and ingrained deference, has refrained from critical thinking about the royals. One moment spent in true thought about monarchy and what the institution says about Britain, what it symbolises within our society, and the entire edice would logically come tumbling down. Monarchy is incompatible with equality.There was one person who dared to hint that the emperor had no clothes, though. When the Queen came north, Patrick Harvie, co-leader of the Greens, refrained from the usual obsequiousness, dropped the phrase Your Majesty from his address to Holyrood and simply referred to the Queen and the rest of the audience as Friends. Mr Harvie also stated that itrsquos the people of Scotland who are sovereign ndash no-one .That simple levelling ndash of bringing the Queen down to the same status as the rest of us ndash was an important act which quietly and politely said: \"not everyone accepts this grotesquerie\".Britain is locked on a path of seismic and inevitable constitutional change and the royals will have to change with the times. Britain may soon be a rump state, with a unied Ireland to the west, an independent Scotland to the north, and a lost Europe across the channel. The Queen may find herself ruling over a very little England indeed.

That is probably in part due to geography, Ms Parkinson and Mr Serreze said.The Arctic is a floating ice cap on an ocean penned in by continents.

That allows the ice to grow much farther out, Ms Parkinson said.When Antarctic sea ice was steadily rising, scientists pointed to shts in wind and pressure patterns, ocean circulation changes or natural but regular climate changes like El Nino and its southern cousins.Now, some of those explanations may not quite fit, making what happens next still a mystery, Ms Parkinson said."},{"url":null,"title":"hs2-operation-contract-decision-delayed","story":"Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said in April that the West Coast Partnershipfranchise was due to be awarded in June, but no announcement has been made.The winning bidder will succeed Virgin Trains on the West Coast Main Line from March next year and run HS services between London and Birmingham from December .Sim Harris, the managing editor of industry newspaper Railnews, told the PA news agency that a ldquocombination of uncertainties have left the Department for Transportldquoa bit worried about who should be handed the franchise.:New Glasgow city centre railway station needed for extra-long HS trains, report warnsA bid involving Virgin Group, Stagecoach and SNCF was disqualied by the DfT in April due to a row over pensions.

The one marked ldquoUnited Kingdom had been placed at the bottom of the pile. The new premier frowned, pulled it out and placed it right at the top.In the last few days, Mrs May has had to endure the sight of the two contenders rubbishing her approach to Brexit and dancing on the grave of her failed attempt to get Brexit through even though both of them backed her Withdrawal Agreement in the final Commons vote.Her speech on Thursday will be scanned for any nuance that can be interpreted as a put-down to one candidate or an endorsement of the other in other words, Boris for the former and Jeremy for the latter.No doubt, alarmed by the ldquodo or die rhetoric of Mr Johnson, Mrs Mayrsquos central message about strengthening the Union will be directed at her former Foreign Secretary. Watch out to seethere are any references to charging at the guns and the Valley of Death.In the last few days and, no doubt, in the next  hours before the Scottish hustings, the two would-be premiers will be busy burnishing their Unionist credentials.Just as there has been a bidding war on fiscal promises and on who can sound the hardest on a no-deal Brexit, so we can expect the two contenders to be trying to out-speak one another on who is the greater Unionist.Mr Hunt has already pronounced that he would support the Union with \"every drop of blood in my veins\". At Tuesdayrsquos Belfast hustings, when talk was of the backstop and borders, Mr Johnson declared the ldquoUnion comes first\" and was ldquoabsolutely inviolable.Both men have committed to introducing a Union Unit in No  to better co-ordinate the Unionist message across Government.With time so short before she goes, the PMrsquos attempt at legacy-building is dficultnot impossible. And yet this newspaper has been told that she will soon announce a review, possibly in her speech on Thursday in Scotland, to look at how the Government structures can be configured to strengthen the Union the very subject of her final address.The Conservative administration is due shortly to publish its response to the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee report on constitutional matters, which called for a review of the role of the Scottish Secretary and Scotland Office now that we are  years on from the start of devolution.While the Nationalists want the post and office abolished, some Unionists want them to be subsumed into a Department for the Union headed by the Deputy Prime Minister or First Secretary of State.But David Mundell has been, behind the scenes, battling to have the role enhanced. Indeed, there are suggestions the Scotland Office is going to be beefed up with a couple of new ministers as part of the underpinning of the Union.The Scottish Secretary is due to appear before the committee next week when he will doubtless expand on his vision for his office which, of course, might not include him depending on who wins the Conservative crown.Other signs of strengthening the Union are the UK Governmentrsquos new hub in Edinburgh, including a dedicated room to enable the UK Cabinet to hold some of its meetings there, and a push for more direct Whitehall funding of Scottish projects in devolved areas denounced as a ldquopower-grab by Edinburgh.One Unionist project, however, is unlikely to see the light of day: Mr Johnsonrsquos idea of building a bridge between Scotland and Northern Ireland.When asked about it, he insisted he was still supportive but noted diplomatically it was something for the Northern Irish Executive to take forward.

Edinburgh was full of colour and noise, and there was a real sense of hope and expectation. Donald Dewar’s speech in the parliament’s first chamber was one of those moments where the hair stood up on the back of your neck. In my view – as someone in a dferent party to Donald, with very dferent views on the ultimate destination for Scotland – that speech was one of the finest speeches in modern Scottish history.How much of a privilege is it to run the country and how dficult is the top job There’s no doubt that being First Minister of Scotland has been the privilege of my le.

And like many people in senior positions, particularly women, I have had moments of self-doubt but I believe it’s important to be open about that and to be a role model to young people. But more than anything, I am grateful to have the opportunity to help make Scotland a better place to live.What is the Parliament’s biggest achievement in the last  years  Twenty years on there are so many achievements that we can be proud of, and that have made Scotland a better place to live, work, study and grow up in. From free personal care to the abolition of tuition fees, the ban on smoking in public places, a minimum pricing for alcohol and the introduction of equal marriage. There’s a long, long list of these inidual policies that wouldn’t have happenedwe hadn’t had a Scottish Parliament.Across the world there are other countries now looking to Scotland to learn from the globally ground-breaking things we’ve done on public health, on tackling climate change, and on the work we’re doing around renewable energy.But above any inidual policy, there is a much more fundamental achievement, and that is that,  years on, the parliament has reinvigorated Scottish democracy and become an accepted, established part of Scottish le. We should all take great pride in that.What has been the most dficult challenge the Parliament has faced and you personally The sad and unexpected death in  of Donald Dewar – the man who had driven through the Scotland Act and then become the first First Minister – was no doubt a moment of great uncertainty for all MSPs in the early days of the Parliament.On a personal level, I’d have to say assuming the office of First Minister was my biggest challenge. Despite having spent  years in frontline politics, and seven as Deputy First Minister, nothing can prepare you for the moment where suddenly you are the last word, where there is no longer anyone above you to seek a second opinion on somethingyou want it – everyone is looking to you.What is your most memorable moment There have been many memorable moments. The passage of the Equal Marriage Act and the Minimum Pricing legislation are two key ones for me. I also think the referendum campaign has to be one of them. It not only saw Parliament at its best – with robust debates and intense scrutiny – but also sparked an enormous outpouring of democratic engagement across the country. Although the result didn’t go the way I wanted, the legacy of a more politically involved country is one we should all cherish.I have a lot of memorable moments. It’s not the famous names or the big events, but the stories I hear from iniduals around the country that inspire me. I’ve spent a lot of time lately listening to the le experiences of Scotland’s care experienced young people. Their stories will stay with me forever and drive me to improve their lives and opportunities.In  years’ time, how do you hope the Parliament will have evolved It should evolve in line with the way people in Scotland want it to. The Parliament was established in large part because of the democratic deficit that opened up during  years of a Tory government which became more and more unpopular in Scotland. Despite devolution, Brexit in particular has demonstrated that Westminster is willing to ignore the views of people in Scotland and disregard votes of the Parliament. I have absolutely no doubt that by  we will have completed the powers of the Parliament and become an independent country. That means we will have established a genuine partnership of equals with the rest of the UK and will have ensured that people in Scotland always get the governments they vote for.Are there any people you would like to thank We should never ever forget those who campaigned for decades to see a Scottish Parliament – many of whom never lived to see it become a reality.Then there are those who have worked tirelessly behind the scenes. We couldn’t do our job without the work of the parliament staff, led by the Parliament’s chief executive, Sir Paul Grice, who recently announced he was moving on to a new job after  years. He might not be well-known by the wider public but, as someone who was there from the very beginning, all MSPs and staff owe him an enormous debt of gratitude.For me personally, I certainly would not be where I am today without the support of my mum and dad and my husband Peter.Everyone is invited to join the partySaturday, June ,  is gearing up to be a great day.From am to noon, the Queen will address Parliament and each of the party leaders will speak in response. The audience will include those young people who were born in  as well as finalists from a competition for student film-makers who produced a short film on the impact the Scottish Parliament has had in their area. There will also be a number of performances celebrating the best of Scotland’s culture and music and the Makar will perform a new piece of work.In the afternoon, the Parliament will open its doors for a day of celebration – a party everyone is invited to join from pm to pm.There will be a chance to sit in the Presiding Officer’s seat and see how it feels to take charge, as well as retro games like giant Jenga, Kerplunk and space hoppers. There will also be live music, dancers, face painting and caricaturists.And of course, there will be birthday cake and food too. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: “It will be a great day, full of colour and energy. Parliament always does these events well and brings in so many people from across Scotland. “I hope we spend the day not just looking back on what has been achieved, but focused on the work the parliament still has to do.“The public are often sceptical of politicians, but I hope people across the country will reflect on how far we’ve come with the parliament and the dference it has already made to so many people’s lives.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon the scottish parliament s greatest achievements","story":"The Scottish Parliament will celebrate its th anniversary today .Her Majesty the Queen will take part in the th anniversary celebrations today, with the iconic Parliament building in Edinburgh being open from pm to pm for visitors to join in the birthday celebrations.And in an exclusive QA, Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told us what she believes the Parliament’s top  greatest achievements are.The country’s top politician also shared her thoughts on Brexit and the future, sounding a note of caution for the UK’s next Prime Minister.Here, in her own words, Nicola walks us through the Parliament’s success story...Right from its earliest years, the Scottish Parliament showed that it was ready to take policy decisions substantially dferent to those at Westminster to help build a better country.A clear early example of this was the introduction of free personal care for the elderly. This was a substantial commitment but was vital for Scotland’s long term interests, preparing ourselves for the challenges of an ageing population. We’ve recently extended free personal care to cover all those who are assessed as needing it, no matter their age.MSPs also charted a dferent course when, following a change of administration in , parliament voted to scrap tuition fees in Scotland, restoring Scotland’s long and proud tradition of free education.Similarly, the decision to abolish prescription charges brought to an end what was little more than a tax on ill health. The NHS of course is the greatest, and most valued, example of a universal service where care is provided on the basis of need and not ability to pay. Our health service, like others across the world, faces challenges. But it is a real achievement of the Scottish Parliament that we have resisted the marketization moves south of the border while ensuring that under the current government Scotland’s AE departments are the best performing in theUK.On other occasions, the Parliament has led the UK in making bold policy choices, such as the ban on smoking in public places. Our Climate Change Act includedthe most ambitious emissions reduction targets of any legislature in the world and, as Health Secretary, I was heavily involved in the campaign to introduce a minimum unit price for alcohol, which we knew would play a key role in tackling Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with drink – another world leading measure.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.glasgowsouthandeastwoodextra webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"As the Scottish Parliament prepares to celebrate its th anniversary, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on both its journey and her own.\"  First Minister Nicola Sturgeon reflects on  years of the Scottish Parliament viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"GLAS | Article Teaser\"It took a decade of hard work to make this policy a reality and I am personally very proud of the campaign, working with stakeholders, to persuade MSPs to back minimum pricing, as well as overcoming a legal challenge that went all the way to the Supreme Court.I am personally committed to making sure every child and young person in Scotland gets the best possible start in le. We have already delivered an increase in free, high quality childcare for all three and four year olds and extending entitlement to eligible two year olds and will increase it further before the end of this parliament.Scotland has also become a much safer society under devolution. Recorded crime has fallen to some of the lowest levels seen since the s. In particular, non-sexual violent crime has fallen substantially, thanks in no small part to the excellent work of the Violence Reduction Unit, which was established over a decade ago with cross-party support and is now being copied across the UK.In recent years, new powers have come to the Scottish Parliament and with those powers come increased responsibilities for MSPs to deliver for the people ofScotland.Income tax policy is now a key feature of the annual Scottish budget. We’ve used these new powers to introduce a fairer income tax policy, with most people paying less tax than they would south of the border – while continuing to raise revenue to support investment in the economy and public services.Last year Parliament passed the wide-ranging Social Security Act, paving the way for devolution of a number of benefits, as well as creating a number of newbenefits such as increased carers’ support allowance and best start grants for families with young children – and a new social security agency to deliver them. This new agency has a culture of dignity and respect at its heart and early feedback from service users has been overwhelmingly positive.I also appointed the first gender balanced Scottish cabinet and we are encouraging more women to stand for parliament, and bring a better balance to ourpublic le.Over the course of the Scottish Parliament consistent action has been taken to ensure communities have the opportunity to own the land they live and work on.Many communities have benefited from the right to buy that now covers rural and urban communities.Of course, the foundation of our country is a strong and resilient economy. That’s why we have slashed or abolished business rates for , premises –saving almost £. billion for our small businesses.We have invested in our infrastructure with all governments building new schools and hospitals and, of course, the iconic Queensferry Crossing.And, to help make sure we have the workforce we need for years to come, we have delivered just over a quarter of a million Modern Apprenticeships in the lastdecade.In April this year, new legislation to tackle controlling and coercive behaviour came into effect, giving Scotland some of the most robust domesticabuse legislation in the world.I’m also proud of the many steps we’ve taken to make Scotland a fairer society, including the introduction of equal marriage rights – attending one of the first same-sex weddings in Scotland is a memory that will stay with me for a long time.And we all worked together over many years to help Glasgow successfully host the  Commonwealth Games. This helped to inspire Scots to get more active,delivered new facilities and put Scotland on the world stage. It was a sight to behold.My final achievement is perhaps harder to quanty. There is no doubt that the re-establishment of Scotland’s parliament has profoundly changed our political culture for the better, with our nation’s lawmakers much more accessible to those they represent. It has also enabled us to have conversations we wouldn’t have had and to debate our own future, with the  independence referendum generating an increase in democratic engagement.Looking ahead, we now face the signicant challenges posed by Brexit which, of course, Scotland’s people and parliament overwhelmingly oppose. Given the long-term damage that Brexit will cause to Scotland, and the material change in circumstances this represents, I believe it is only fair that people are given the choice of whether to become an independent country. Indeed, the current SNP Government was elected on a clear manesto commitment that people should be offered that choice should Scotland be taken out of the EU against its will. Polls consistently show that people living here believe the decision on whether to hold a referendum should be a matter for Holyrood and not Westminster. Twenty years after it came into being, that is an important measure of the way people in Scotland view the Parliament and one that the new UK Prime Minister would do well to heed."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July ,  at : pmLonghope Leboat was called out this afternoon after the Coastguard received a report of what was believed to be either a parachute, or a sail from a boat, washed up on Swona.

There has to be a commitment to reducing the numbers of geese and not just keeping the population at its current level.“This means we need to see funding that lasts long enough to ensure that the measures take effect and that farmers have confidence that their concerns are being seriously addressed.“I will be closely monitoring the new measures being taken forward by SNH in the coming months and at the outcomes of SNH’s study on goose management in the islands.“I also look forward to hearing how the Minister intends to ensure that efforts going forward are sustained so that farmers in Orkney can have confidence that the Scottish Government are serious on dealing with the problem of excessive geese numbers”.Mr McArthur said that, while the announcement of measures was welcome, progress on the issue will take time and government must remain committed to finding a resolution.He said: “It is clear that the minister recognises the importance of tackling this issue and the scale of the challenge involved. While the package of measures announced by SNH today is welcome, it is also clear that it is going to take time to achieve the objective of bringing greylag goose numbers down to a sustainable level.“That is why it is so important that the Scottish Government now stays the course.

According to SNH, this study will consider the practicalities, cost and location for a number of possible measures bring the birds# population down.SNH also elaborated on a previous announcement of an expansion to the licence to shoot the birds, with a new Orkney-specic licence to cover the period from February  to June  — outside the open shooting season and the time covered by the General Licence, which allows Greylag geese to be shot from July  to August  and during the open season from September  to January .This means farmers will no longer be required to apply to the SNH Licensing team for an out-of-season licence but can make a quick call to the Kirkwall office for permission.The new measures include volunteer shooters being available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.SNH is considering further changes to licences, in particular, a mechanism to increase bag limits, and a possible extension to the General Licence, currently available in July and August, to include May and June.Finally, volunteer shooters will be available again this year in August and September to undertake goose control on farms which are experiencing issues with geese.Graham Neville, SNH’s Northern Isles and North Highland area manager, said: “We understand increases in greylag goose numbers have seriously impacted on farmers and crofters on Orkney.

The concern is that, although resurfacing and general maintenance continues to be done, this may not fix the issue in the long-term.OIC has now engaged a specialist team to look at the issue, who#ll be deploying state of the art equipment to take radar readings through the causeway down to sea level, providing valuable information on its deep make-up.This data will then be used to come up with options for short and long-term maintenance of the road, with general inspections and periodic minor repairs continuing until the results of the survey are fully considered.Due to the nature of the work, there will unfortunately be road closures and a convoy system in place on the evening of Monday  July. The work has been scheduled for between .pm and .pm to minimise disruption, by ensuring that traffic from the last Pentland Ferries arrival has passed through. Delays of up to  minutes are possible.The work will begin with coring taking place, which sees four small cylindrical sections of the road removed, analysed and then replaced. This allows the contractors to identy the make-up of the top layers of the road and calibrate their equipment accordingly.The second stage of the work sees a specialist vehicle driven at usual traffic speed across the barrier a number of times, taking video and radar footage as it moves.The third and final stage sees a piece of hand-pushed equipment moved across the barrier at walking speed taking Ground Penetrating Radardata of the full depth of the structure as it goes. The GPR system emits short duration pulses of electromagnetic energy. These pulses or scans are transmitted into the road and reflections from material boundaries or embedded featuresare detected by a receiver. Through analysis of the reflected signals a continuous D model of the Barrier can then be provided, determining material thickness and construction changes.  This should therefore determine what,any, underlying defects there are within the matrix of the causeway. The survey allows data to be taken down to depths of five metres.The video survey will provide a high resolution and spatially referenced video to enable the visual condition of the surface to be assessed to sub-metre accuracy. This will be matched with the GPR survey to produce a visual model to pinpoint anomalies in the surfacing.John Wrigley, OIC roads and environmental services manager said: #As a key element of Orkney#s travel network, we keep a keen eye on the state of this road.#Our ongoing monitoring has shown that the surface continues to deteriorate despite previous interventions — which would suggest that resurfacing is not going to fix the problem in the long-term.#We now need to carry out this important piece of work to seethere could be a more deep-rooted reason for the issues — which should lead us to an appropriate and cost-effective solution.##Previous survey work has given us detailed information on the top layers of the road, but this new survey will look deep into the construction for voids or other potential failures.  We apologise for the delays that this survey will cause on the night of  July # but we#re sure that local road users will understand that this is necessary as part of finding a long term solution to improving the structure of the road.  We#d ask that road users take their time in the vicinity on the night and would also take the opportunity to remind people of the mph advisory speed limit that already exists on the first Barrier.#East Mainland, South Ronaldsay and Burray councillor, Andrew Drever added: “I accept the concerns that have been raised over a period of time, particularly by motorcyclists, and I am pleased to see this piece of work getting underway.#Once we have the survey results, we’ll be able to look at options and hopefully find a way forward in a short a timescale as possible.#copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The aim of the pilots was to reduce goose impacts by managing their numbers and by selling goose meat locally.SNH has said the studies confirmed that resident greylag goose populations can absorb substantial losses without any effect on their conservation status.The sale of the meat and funding have also been extended for the Western Isles.Sally Thomas, SNH’s Director of People  Nature, said: “Wild geese are an important part of Scotland’s nature, but their rapid rise in numbers has been challenging for farmers and crofters. We understand it’s still an issue in some areas, with a dficult balance between conservation, farming and hunting.“Our goal is to give farmers and crofters the tools they need to safeguard their crops, by giving them the control to manage goose numbers sustainably through sport shooting, other control, or selling goose meat for profit.”The pilots are now being extended until the end of . The  transitional Challenge Fund will help local goose groups develop business models to generate income from the sale of resident greylag goose meat in the long term.SNH has also said that they and local goose management groups are also exploring other options together, such as more flexible licences when necessary, a review of bag limits in some areas, and egg-oiling.The pilot studies cost about £, over five years to March  and an additional £, to March . SNH is now offering a Challenge Fund of £, to support sustainable management, as well as an additional £, for counts and productivity estimates.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They say numbers around Shetland have doubled in the past two years, with boats working ever closer to the coastline and restricting access for other vessels - sometimes across hundreds of square miles.The situation, which is legal under EU laws, has raised concern over the increasing amount of lost gear entering the ocean, where it poses a major threat to marine wildle and can cause damage to boats.The Shetland Fishermenrsquos Associationhas reported scores of local boats hauling up fine mesh twine in their own nets, while others have had to abandon work andto port for costly repairs after entanglement. ldquoAt a time when the public is rightly concerned about the amount of plastic dumped in the sea it is particularly galling for our skippers to be forced off local fishing grounds by vessels that leave so much rubbish behind them, said Simon Collins, executive officer for the SFA. ldquoWe urge the Scottish government to regulate these vesselsrsquo access to our waters as soon as it can do so once we leave the Common Fisheries Policy, as part of the normal cycle of negotiations between coastal states. ldquoIn the meantime we need the authorities to use the powers they do have to limit the damage.Fishing is one of Shetlandrsquos key industries, worth nearly £ million a year.Gill nets and longline gear are no longer used by Scottish crews as they are considered less environmentally friendly than other methods. The local fleet - around  vessels - is made up of mainly trawlers and seine netters, with a similar number of longliners and gill-netters coming in from overseas.James Anderson, skipper of the Alison Kay, said: ldquoWersquove been fishing here for the last  years, but this year there was a line of three boats with enough nets to cover the whole area.ldquoAll in all there were  German-flagged Spanish boats with no track record of fishing here, taking up, I reckon,  square miles.ldquoIn years gone by they may have been here but there were fewer of them and they were much further out, much deeper. Theyrsquore aggressive too, telling us: lsquoThis is the area we fish, keep clear for  days.rsquoldquoWersquove lost a lot of fishing because of this, and because they leave the gear we get caught in it and have to haul it up. Itrsquos fine mesh plastic, a right mess.ldquoThe Icelandic and Norwegian governments have severely limited this type of fishing, and itrsquos about time the UK and Scottish governments did so too.Mr Collins says the situation is sparking run-ins between the fleets.Nick Underdown, from sustainable fisheries campaign group Open Seas, says conflict at sea is always ldquobad news and highlights the need for better management.He added: ldquoOur environment is the major victim, whether itrsquos ghost fishing from set nets or damage to the seabed by bottom-trawling. ldquoIt exposes the urgent need for improved management that allocates fishing opportunity preferentially to the most sustainable fishing methods. ldquoLeaving fishermen to sort things out for themselves is no way to run a sustainable fishery and unfairly penalises those who are fishing legally and following good practice.A gill net acts like a giant curtain around a huge area of the seabed, catching anything within its boundary.The nets are often left in place for up to three months, effectively fencing off huge swathes of a fishing ground.Longlining is a slow-capture form of fishing involving a single line hung with hundreds - or even thousands - of baited hooks.Without careful management the method can unintentionally capture non-target fish, seabirds and other marine le such as sharks, which are attracted to the bait.A spokesman for the Scottish Government said: ldquoWe use a range of resources, including our network of coastal offices and experienced compliance officers, to manage the monitoring of vessels, and aircraft to investigate and enforce compliance.ldquoScotland continues to lead the way in protecting our marine environments and we are committed to improving monitoring and tracking technologies as outlined in the Programme for Government.ldquoIn the event of an EU exit, our relationship with fleets of dfering nationalities will be considered by negotiators.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"the proof that the private sector cannot secure just transition to green economy richard leonard","story":"Leaving decisions about the transition to a net-zero carbon economy to the vagaries of the market will not work, so an interventionist role by governments is an absolute necessity, writes Richard Leonard.The Extinction Rebellion movement serves as a timely reminder that protest is power, that non-violent direct action is an important part of the democratic process and that the climate emergency is the most pressing issue of our time and requires urgent action.Campaigners who camped outside the Scottish Parliament, in the week that the Climate Change Bill was being debated, are calling on a target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the UK by . This is hugely ambitious but when we are talking about the future of our planet we should, of course, be ambitious and we should be impatient as well. Humanity’s impact on the planet has taken centuries to be understood and reversing the damage done will take time to put right. That is why Scottish Labour has supported the target set by the Committee on Climate Change of net-zero carbon emissions by  which we believe is an ambitious, but realistic, timetable to meet. If we can meet it earlier, we should. Beyond that, across the UK, Labour is calling for a Green Industrial Revolution which means a plan for industry to put the environment at the heart of our economy. It cannot be jobs or the environment, it must be both or neither.: Why are Scottish windfarms being built , miles away instead of Fe  – Dr Richard Dixon: Some facts to tell Extinction Rebellion next time they block the road – John McLellanIn our  UK General Election manesto, Labour also recognised that interim targets are crucial, and we committed to ensuring, when in government, that  per cent of the UK’s energy demand in electricity and heating comes from zero-carbon or renewable sources by . This plan was backed by evidence, based on science and would deliver an energy revolution around the four key areas of energy efficiency, offshore wind, onshore wind and solar power. In Scotland, we have been arguing for a  per cent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by that point, to play our part in bringing UK emissions down.Reintroducing public ownership into the energy market would also open up the potential to accelerate the timelines for zero emissions. As private, shareholder-owned and profit-led entities, today’s energy companies are poorly placed to lead the way for a wholescale change of focus.While we cannot simply legislate our way to sustainability, the market will not get us there either. Businesses, particularly big business must play their part. That’s why, Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell announced last week that a Labour Government would hold those companies, which do not meet a minimum standard of commitment to the climate emergency, to account. He suggested that one sanction could be to delist them from the London Stock Exchange and so cut off their access to capital investment. This radical approach would ensure that the private sector is forced to play a meaningful part in creating a sustainable economy. We also have the opportunity, in Scotland, to ensure that the necessary switch to green jobs is undertaken in a way that prevents working people becoming the casualties of the sustainable economy we must create. We believe there should be a statutory and representative Just Transition Commission rather the adhoc, temporary one the Scottish Government currently favours. The Climate Change Bill provides us with an opportunity to secure this and so take a planned approach to the radical economic transformation which we need to make.The economic opportunities of a green society go well beyond the role of iniduals as mere consumers to that of re-skilled workers as producers of the energy we consume and the goods and services we make. Trade unions will play a vitally important role in ensuring all industries are ready for the changes ahead. In Scotland, we have a wealth of riches in solar, wind and marine energy still to explore and a workforce with adaptable skills ready to embrace these expanding technologies. Labour’s radical plans to put the environment at the heart of everything we do in government will ensure that our carbon emissions are drastically reduced. But action must start now, and we need leadership from both the UK and Scottish governments to show a new urgency to achieving net zero with action and not just words. That means we cannot go on with green energy contracts, that would support our economy and deliver flagship projects, which are awarded to multinational corporations who then place the manufacturing work overseas.EDF’s proposed Neart Na GaoitheOffshore Wind Farm, worth up to £ billion, will be located  miles off the Fe coast and has the potential to create over , green jobs in the Fe economy. Yet, evidence suggests that the current proposal is for contracts for the wind turbine jackets to be manufactured thousands of miles away in Indonesia rather than at the currently mothballed fabrication yards at Methil and Burntisland where skilled workers stand ready to get back on the job. This would be a double blow to the environment and local economy, which is why we’ve been working with the unions and local community inside and outside Parliament to get this decision reversed and guarantee that the work is placed in the Fe yards. Our new timetable to meet zero emission goals might seem a long way off but by taking to the streets in their thousands, our young people have shown us that the climate emergency deserves all our attention and we, as elected representatives, must go beyond setting targets to taking real and decisive action.It is clear that business as usual will not do. Leaving economic decisions to the vagaries of the market will not work either. We need to plan our way to a sustainable future. So, an interventionist and innovative role by governments is an absolute necessity. That also demands a global perspective that goes way beyond nationalism and the national interest alone.The Labour movement will continue to help lead the way in transforming our economy and so protecting and restoring our environment. We will continue to offer the leadership and solutions required to change our economy to one which is sustainable, puts our planet first and does so in a way that puts people at the heart of the change, protecting jobs and ensuring those with the least are not left to prop up those with the most – and so securing a just transition.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"citizens assembly perfect way to boost scottish independence","story":"A senior SNP MP has claimed the Scottish Government#s planned Citizens# Assembly is #the perfect way# to advance independence, as a pro-Union campaign called on its supporters to boycott the consultation process.The planned assembly of  ordinary Scots is supposed to look at the way forward for the nation as Holyrood ministers set out plans for a possible second referendum on the constitution in the wake of Brexit.David Martin, the former Labour MEP chosen to chair the group, yesterday appealed for the Conservatives and Lib Dems to give it another chance after the parties announced they would not work with it.But attempts to keep the assembly neutral appeared to be underminded when Joanna Cherry, MP for Edinburgh West, shared a video in which she claimed: “I believe this is the perfect way to move Scotland on from the current state of Brexit paralysis created by Westminster and to move us towards independence.”Scotland in Unionwarned the assembly could be “misused” by only promoting the idea of breaking away from the UK.The Conservatives’ constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins previously branded the assembly “a Nationalist stunt to kick-start the conversation about independence”.: Pro-Union parties brand Citizens’ Assembly a ‘Nationalist stunt’Pamela Nash, SiU chief executive, said: “Citizens’ Assemblies are growing in popularity throughout the world, and we have remained open minded about the value of this approach in Scotland any space where the views of the public can be examined and taken into account is to be welcomed.“However, given the statements from senior SNP politicians, and the SNP’s consistent record of going against previous public consultations, many have expressed concern that the Citizens’ Assembly could be misused.”Ms Nash continued: “If, before the assembly has been established, the SNP Government is already giving a strong signal that it will not accept the recommendations unless they happen to be in line with its own goal of breaking up the UK, then we cannot see why the Scottish public should have any faith in this process or, indeed, take part.“If asked, unless evidence emerges that the SNP is prepared to act in good faith, we urge our supporters not to participate in the Citizens’ Assembly.” Veteran Labour MEP David Martin, who will chair the assembly, has called for Unionists to drop their boycott. “I think that is a very disappointing move,” he said.“I understand the heat around the whole constitutional issue, but I have taken this on because I believe it is a genuine attempt to find outthere is consensus on some of the controversial issues facing Scotland.”©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"div","story":"A DIVE vessel with  women on board was escorted into port after she began taking in water off Shetland on Sunday. issued a mayday call in bad weather soon after midday when she was approximately eight miles east of Sumburgh Head.

Technology has played its part, but it is a situation where reducing pollution is very, very dficult to achieve given the nature of the industry itself. As the population increases, this will become more relevant in terms of the overall pollution created, and no doubt, something will have to be done. Whether sea based farming of certain foods may reduce the pollution, but much of agriculture is still based on land and the production of meat will still create problems related to greenhouse gases in terms of land used for meat production and or crop production as well.

Assemblyman Paul Frew says the the Department of Infrastructure propose major works at the junction of Sand Road and Woodtown Road.The DUP man, in welcoming the plans, revealed that the cost will be in the region of pound,, adding that he hoped the work would begin ‘very soon’.

He added: “ The primary aim is to change the junction priority from Woodtown Rd to Sand Rd to accommodate the predominant traffic movements. “This will also improve stopping sight distances throughout the approaches. I would like to thank DFI Roads for this upgrade and hope it gets rolled out very soon.”  "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1924670.jpg--.jpg?1561540631000\n","title":"council to conduct door to door survey to help shape services","story":"MID and East Antrim Borough Council are to conduct a door to door survey next week to help shape leisure services in the town.

No formal or transparent selection process was used in her selection for appointment nor was she given a written contract of employment, statement of main terms and conditions or job description.During , following several years of signicant growth, the firm decided to consider promotions from associate solicitor grade to salaried partner. Mrs Mercer and two other colleagues were promoted to salaried partner later that year.However, the following year, when she applied for promotion to the role of an equity partner, she was told she did not meet the eligibility criteria. Mrs Mercer did not find out about the promotions of her comparators at the time they took effect on June , , because they had not been announced internally. Instead she learned about them around  through what she described as the \"office rumour mill\". When she enquired about applying for promotion to the next stage, she was informed that there would be no more movement in the firm for the foreseeable future.Mrs Mercer flagged ious issues about her pay during  and  and the fact that promotions were taking place without any formal or transparent selection process.In June  she informed one of firms partners that she wanted to be paid the same salary as her male comparators and to have her bonus calculated on the same terms as theirs. Mrs Mercer was later told that the firm had decided to defer the issue of her salary and bonus until the end of the financial year as part of a wider review of business and salaries. Following this she lodged an internal grievance, seeking equal pay with her comparators on the ground that she was performing like work with them. Her grievance was rejected as the firm was of the view that her work as a salaried partner was \"not as demanding as that of a salaried partner benefiting from a profit share arrangement\". The legal practice accepted that Mrs Mercer was receiving less remuneration than her male colleagues but did not accept that she was undertaking like work with them. It contended that, although she and her male counterparts were all qualied solicitors, there were signicant dferences in the work they and Mrs Mercer were undertaking both in respect of legal work and other responsibilities.In addition, the respondent contended that,Mrs Mercer proved that she was undertaking like work with her comparators, there were genuine material factors which were not the dference of sex and which explained and justied any dferences in pay.The tribunal found that Mrs Mercer was employed on like work with all her comparators going back six years to June .The firm was ordered to pay her £, in respect of the dference between her gross annual salary of £, and the modied amount of £, going forward. She will also receive £, arrears of annual salary falling six years before the date of her claim in June  along with interest of £, on arrears."},{"url":null,"title":"getting to the open all you need to know","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This would have allowed for extra drinking time as well as longer periods of off-licence sales.Read MoreGetting to The Open... all you need to knowOfficials felt the change in the law would have contributed \"to the success of the event\" as well as improve the prospects of other major events coming to Northern Ireland. It also said the change \"would benefit the hospitality and tourism sectors in Northern Ireland\".A consultation exercise, the department said, demonstrated the \"strong economic benefits\" the change could bring.However, the majority of responses were against the change.  The consultation outcome document states they came from an organised campaign run by Hospitality Ulster - which represents those in the licensed industry.That campaign opposed the changes instead arguing for the proposals to be considered as part of a wider review of licensing legislation.Colin Neill of Hospitality Ulster said there was never the intention \"to damage\" the Open, but rather to highlight their campaign to have the wider issues of licensing law reform examined.He told the Belfasthis organisation informed the department they were removing their objections after the consultation process closed.\"We wanted to support The Open,\" he said,\" and while it is disappointing it is not unexpected it has run into problems further down the line.\"Mr Neill said he has received assurances from the main political parties licencing law reform would be a priority when devolution was restored.One council - Causeway Coast and Glens - and Tourism NI argued in favour of the move saying it would allow Northern Ireland to compete on an international level in attracting events and meet expectations of international visitors and local residents.The UUP MLA  Robbie Butler said The Open was an opportunity for Northern Ireland to put itself on the map for business and the laws needed to be brought into the st Century.\"It will not be a failure for The Open, however, it was a missed opportunity for us to step up and say we are open for business and we reflect modern attitudes to safe drinking.\"This is about increasing the publicity of Northern Ireland and its ability to hold these events... we dont want it to be another  years before The Open s.\"The decision comes just days after a House of Commons Committee criticised the rushing through of legislation in Westminster for Northern Ireland laws on the botched green energy RHI scheme and on other matters.A bill enacting the £billion budget was passed in just two days and in April regulations were made baning the flying of drones over Royal Portrush during the championship.Mr Butler said there was the room and scope to change the drink laws.\"Had there have been a will, they could have found a way,\" he said.\"If the Secretary of State can legislate on passing budgets, cutting RHI payments, making new public appointments, then there is no reason whatsoever why she and the NIO cannot step up to the plate and actually start acting in the best interests of local people and announce that they are in setting in action a move towards a much wider reform agenda for our licensing laws.\"A spokesperson for the Department for Communities said: “With a view to assisting The th Open at Royal Portrush, and other special events, the department launched a public consultation on  March seeking views from the public and stakeholders on whether the department should be given the power to designate an event as a special event.\"In doing so the department would then have the power to y permitted hours for sale of alcoholic drinks and allow certain off-sales at the event.“The consultation ran for six weeks and generated considerable interest with  formal responses. The consultation report was published on  May and it is clear from the responses that a move to amend permitted hours at special events could bring strong economic benefits to Northern Ireland.\"The department for Communities’ preferred approach is to amend the law to facilitate special events should the opportunity arise. However with the Assembly not sitting, and limited time available, it is very unlikely that there will be an opportunity to amend the law before the start of The Open.”"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38273866.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/Steeple_House_Antrim.jpg","title":"watch 18th century antrim mansion gutted by","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesTop  HospitalityLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday  Tour GuideFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Ireland to support the rights of workers to holiday back-pay.Northern Ireland could face a massive public sector back-pay bill after a tribunal finding that police officers and civilian staff are owed holiday pay dating back twenty years.Trade unions have argued that all workers should be included, from both the public and private sectors.There are about , public sector employees in Northern Ireland, official figures show.The public sector bill would be a huge challenge to Stormonts budgets, especially given the payments that will need to be made to RHI claimants.The British government rushed through a two-year limit on miscalculated claims but no such cap was put in place in Northern Ireland which means the costs could be astronomical.Niall McCarroll, Chairperson of Derry Trades Union Council said DTUC will be at the forefront of the biggest working-class action in a generation, demanding that any worker who has had their rightfully earned money withheld, ed immediately.This is in line with the recent Appeal Court hearing, which ruled that workers were owed money as their holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked including overtime, which in effect breached European law.The court ruled that miscalculations arose because holiday pay had been based on basic working hours, not the actual hours worked, including overtime.Mr McCarroll said: “Since the Appeal Court ruling all we have heard is how much this will cost the tax payer, impacting on our ability toand indeed provide much needed already stretched public services, whilst protecting budgetary integrity.“There has been no reference to the integrity of workers who have been forced to use foodbanks, went into mortgage arrears, struggling to survive during austerity driven pay cuts, austerity, which seems to have benefitted the already wealthy whilst attacking working class communities.”Poverty payThe trade unionist questioned whether workers might have been spared such hardshipthey were given the correct holiday pay.“This shortfall in take home pay could be as much as £ a month, which is a signicant amount for any worker, especially workers within the Derry and Strabane area, who are already in receipt of poverty pay and terms and conditions which deny them a just and favourable standard of living.“For many workers this shortfall could have been the dference between being able to heat their homes and feed their families.”He added: “Of course, so called business leaders and employers have known about this additional holiday pay entitlement for some time which most chose to ignore, and indeed when challenged by the trade union movement they refused to value their employees and pay out.“The establishment in all its parts has once again been exposed in their continuous cycle of treating working class people and their families as being non-entities within society.“All elected representatives and political parties should come out now, publicly and unequivocally showing solidarity and making it clear that they support workers and their families, in their demand for equality and justice, calling for this Appeal Court ruling to be implemente“The full power and influence of the trade union movement will meet head-on any attempts to challenge this ruling and deny workers their rightful entitlement.”Political responseIn statements to the Derry News, NI’s five main political parties have gone on record as saying they believe workers should receive payments they are legally entitled to.The DUP is however mindful of implications for the public purse and Sinn Féin believes payments should be paid over a timescale which “protects the viability of public services and businesses.\"Ulster Unionist Finance Spokesperson, Steve Aiken MLA, said “urgent clarity is needed” but like other parties was concerned about “budgetary implications” for the Northern Ireland Civil Service and its associated public bodies. He also expressed disquiet about the impact on countless business owners.Stephen Farry of Alliance, who was employment and learning minister in , stands over his decision not to introduce a cap to protect taxpayers from backdated pay claims.He insisted he acted honourably and with integrity and believed that imposing the cap would have been \"counter-productive\" as it could have caused an \"articial clf-edge\", leading to a spike of claims before the cap could take effect.And SDLP policing spokesperson Dolores Kelly said when the issue was first identied, action should have been taken to provide certainty, compensate workers for the errors and to insulate budgets from a signicant hitit would impact the delivery of public services.She also pointed the finger at Mr Farry: “It is a matter of profound regret that the Minister of the time failed to raise the issue at the Executive or introduce measures to limit public sector exposure in conjunction with other parties, Trade Unions and workers.”googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshPhoto: Chairman of Derry Trades Union Council, Niall McCarroll."},{"url":null,"title":"one derrys esteemed citizens honoured plaque","story":"A plaque will be unveiled this weekend in honour of a Derry trade unionist who was described as “one of the most respected labour leaders” in Ireland.On Saturday th June , the Derry Trades Union Councilintends to honour former Alderman and Trade Unionist Campaigner James McCarron by erecting a plaque at his former family home in Derry followed by a talk and celebration of his le with fellow trade unionists and family members.James McCarron, a trade union leader and an Alderman on Derry Corporation, was one of  people who perished when the RMS Leinster was torpedoed and sunk by a German U-boat in .RMS Leinster was an Irish ship operated by the City of Dublin Steam Packet Company.

Secondly, the high level of sectarianism in the area.ldquoInequalities still exist between and within communities and they need to be tackledwe are going to improve the lives of everyone and help them fulfil their true potential, said Dr Cross.ldquoWhen you empower people, you transform their lives and you transform society. The David Cross Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation was set up with a commitment to improving community relations and continuing the journey towards a more united and shared society.Dr Cross said The Edge was a beacon in the community, allowing people to become part of a network of support and care, irrespective of age.He continued: ldquoThe charity treats people like they are family. The centrersquos vision is about empowering young people and the wider community to achieve their full potential spiritually, mentally and physically. Itrsquos a vision that resonates with the ethos of The David Cross Foundation for Peace and Reconciliation.The Edge chairwoman, Trisha Brown, explained that staff and volunteers had seen an increase in mental health issues affecting all ages.ldquoPeople are feeling lonely and lost. There has also been a growth in the number of young people self-harming as they feel they donrsquot have a future. So, we still have a lot to do and we run a wide range of initiatives to build community capacity and to support those who are feeling isolated, she continued.ldquoThe Edge is firmly positioned as a space for people to come and feel safe and to share whatrsquos happening in their lives. We bring people together in a cross-community setting and we welcome people of all ages. The team is making great progress though wersquore very conscious that wersquore on a journey, with changing and evolving challenges.The Edge is open five nights a week to accommodate the numbers of young people who are keen to get involved with activities, with the management team working in collaboration with schools.The centre facilitates community events and garden workshops through a community garden and poly tunnel.

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them. This has been carried out in towns and cities across the UK to protect the local heritage.The petition can be found at www.change.org p vale-of-glamorgan-council-save-the-victorian-heritage-of-penarth u .I will continue to work with your local Labour councillors on these issues.

I had hoped to work constructively with them and take their concerns on board.ldquoThose who were elected as Conservatives but have chosen to betray the faith that was shown in them by their constituents should have the courage to resign and face by-elections. They should defend their decisions at the ballot box.ldquoAn establishment stitch up between these councillors and Labour is not in the interest of residents of the Vale of Glamorgan. They have explicitly argued that they know best and that the public should be ignored.ldquoI will be proposing a minority Conservative administration at the Vale Councilrsquos AGM with a plan that delivers on the priorities of local people. I will challenge other councillors to back it.Earlier on Wednesday, Cllr Gray made a statement to Vale of Glamorgan Councilrsquos Conservative group to say he was resigning.In his statement, he said he had ldquoabsolutely no issue with the manner in which Cllr Bailey was elected as the new leader of the Conservative Group,But he said he is ldquoat least partially at odds with Cllr Bailey on three issues ndash the proposed lsquoclosurersquo of Llancarfan Primary School, the Dinas Powys Bypass and the incinerator in Barry.On the Llancarfan School proposal, which would see the primary moved to a new building in Rhoose, he said: ldquoI seconded a motion to have the executive reopen the issue consultation and this was ignored by the then cabinet but now that this dficult decision has been made I fear that any attempt to articially prop up Llancarfan School will take funding away from the budgets of Penarth schools which is something I will not tolerate.Cllr Gray said heremained ldquounconvinced that the proposed bypass around Dinas Powys, linking Cardf to Barry, ldquois an issue with a large base of support in my ward, and the efforts to give it even more prominence and funding would I believe be to the detriment of the residents of my ward.Vale council has been waiting for more than a year for Welsh Government to decide whether the Barry incinerator needs to carry out an environmental impact assessment before it can operate.Cllr Gray said any efforts to ramp up the councilrsquos rhetoric on the incinerator ldquowould do a disservice to those residents who are passionate about the subject.ldquoRaising  hope for headlines is not the reason I stood for local government and I donrsquot want to mark my success by how many column inches we are able to achieve on a wedge issue, he said.       ,params: .pushHe added:ldquoThe structures around the group that Vince is proposing seemed to be geared up to act as an opposition party and not to focus on the work of delivering core services for the benefit of the most vulnerable members of our society.ldquoI donrsquot expect everyone to agree with my decision and I donrsquot take this decision lightly ndash I am sure that there will be a great number of people who have an opinion on whether I have done the right thing or not.ldquoI need to remain true to myself and my belief in acting as a positive advocate for the residents in my ward ndash the issues that get me out of bed every morning to work hard for the residents in my ward are not the way the press views me but how I can make a positive dference to peoplersquos lives. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners. Without fail he played a Beatles track every time he was on air.When Mr Wilce was off-air, he oversaw and maintained broadcast equipment, actively engaged in fundraising and stood as a trustee, assisting with the day-to-day running of the station.Jamie added: ldquoI speak on behalf of everyone at RG to say it was a privilege to know John, not only as a fellow volunteer but as a friend. He always put everyone  first and his patience was beyond words. His music knowledge was phenomenal and the impact he had on everyone he met, not just at Radio Glamorgan has really come to light since his passing.Michelle Fowler, volunteer services manager at Cardf and Vale University Health Board, said: ldquoItrsquos such a wonderful tribute to rename the studio after John. He really made an impact on our wards and with our patients who listened to his shows.ldquoItrsquos such a lovely way to mark not only Johnrsquos birthday but also to mark the contribution he made as a volunteer during Volunteersrsquo Week. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people.

The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for.

We believe it is important that all families feel welcome in the school. Education is a partnership between home and school with a shared responsibility based on trust and mutual understanding and the co-operation and participation of parents with our school in the education of their child is positively encouraged.ldquoA good relationship between school and home builds a childrsquos confidence, aids their learning and helps them to fulfil their potential in all areas.They stressed that the children had an equal say in their education, through the use of techniques like lsquoImmersion Daysrsquo ndash where pupils have a multi-sensory experience of any given topic.These learning opportunities have ied from using LEGO in building new robot designs and solving problems, to visits from STEM experts. businesses and education experts.The pupils develop a basis from these experiences from which to draw questions and interests, while the staff ask for pupilsrsquo ideas about how they would like to learn further.ldquoWe recently we had an Immersion Day on the topic of volcanoes, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoA few of the pupils mentioned ways they would like to learn more about the subject. When we followed their suggestions a few weeks later, they were incredibly enthused ndash it really focuses them, develops their engagement.These pioneering techniques of giving the children an equal say in their education have a proven record.Albert Primary featured in Estynrsquos lsquoRecognising excellence in education and trainingrsquo publication for its innovative approach.The publication said: ldquoThe school provides pupils with an excellent range of high quality learning experiences.Mr Gilbert said: ldquoMost importantly the inspection report captures the ethos of our school and, in particular, it confirmed that we are achieving our aim to make the school a happy and secure place in which pupils grow in confidence and independence.Albert Primary also earned an award for being the top performing primary school in Wales in recognition of their implementation of the Renaissance Reading programme, and the impact it has on their childrenrsquos reading progress.The staff were experienced and enthusiastic. During the tour, I was treated to a brief rehearsal of the schoolrsquos summer production ndash The Lion King. The youngsters performing looked genuinely thrilled to be involved, and were remarkably talented singers.There is plenty of sport provision, with the deceptively spacious grounds playing host to several open tarmac areas and courts. Football, basketball, rounders, cycling and more were on offer, along with chess, drama and music clubs. For those looking to go off school site, Belle Vue Park is feet away from the front entrance, and often works with the school.This year, Albert Primary has been awarded the prestigious Platinum Flag Award after previously gaining three Green Flag Awards thanks to the environmental education programme, Eco-Schools.But no school is without its problems.A major concern for Albert Primary is having to balance a large deficit budget. In order to do so the school has lost a number of agency learning support staff, with the deputy head taking on a greater teaching commitment next year to make up for the shortfall.Another blow came after four years of saving and planning to convert a disused toilet block into a teaching and community centre.The funds, totalling pound,, had to be used to offset the deficit budget instead. The proposal was to refurbish the existing outbuilding to provide a new classroom facility for the oversubscribed main school to use, alongside the community.The governors are currently creating a task group of stakeholders to address future funding sources.But the spirits of the pupils and staff have not been dampened by financial dficulties.ldquoI believe that we are extremely fortunate in Albert Primary to have created such a positive and vibrant environment in which our children can learn, said Mr Gilbert. ldquoIt is the dedication and commitment of its staff and everyone associated with the school that makes Albert Primary the school that it is today ndash successful, happy and continually improving.Albert Primary was founded in  to accommodate all ages of children up to school leaving age.Much of its original character has been preserved and it now holds Grade  listed status. The school has some unusual Victorian artwork by Norton Nante and parts of the school were designed by highly respected Victorian architect J Coates Carter.A Victorian mural on the front of the building shows several children hard at work. One of them is holding a pet mouse on a lead.It is clear that this quirky attitude to learning has been present and successful in the school for a long time.Long may it last. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work. I suspect that Harvey is one of these.The last paragraph of Harveyrsquos letter quotes a chapter from the bible.Again I have no idea of his doctorate, it is obviously not any of the natural sciences,it is in theology then he must know that the Old Testament is the original book of the Jewish faith, from this he has to be aware of the fact that the stories of this testament are based on Old Babylonian lsquomythsrsquo and their belief in the many gods lsquoknownrsquo to them.The multiple gods of the Babylonians and their inidual areas of responsibility were simply squashed down to the One True God.Harveyrsquos lsquoproofrsquo of the modern, scientic fact of evolution is the , plus year old myths supposedly written by Moses and others as the lsquoword of Godrsquo some , years ago.Michael GodfreyPenarthParkinsonrsquos awarenessThis month we mark World Parkinsonrsquos Day.With over , people estimated to be living with Parkinsonrsquos in the UK alone, Irsquod like to take a moment to tell your readers why wersquore passionate to do everything we can to be there for people in need of our support.We understand that living with Parkinsonrsquos can present daily challenges both for the people affected and for those they hold close.We also understand that having the reassurance of knowing that help is at hand really can make all the dference.Thatrsquos why, Irsquod like to take a moment to reassure your readers that they neednrsquot face the challenges that Parkinsonrsquos can bring alone, wersquore here to help.I work for Revitalise an incredible charity that provides respite holidays for disabled people and carers all across the UK.We welcome guests with over  dferent conditions - including Parkinsonrsquos - every year, seeing for ourselves the vital importance of respite in enabling our guests to spend quality time with one another and to continue coping.If you would like to find out more about Revitalise, our breaks, or ways that we may be able to support you and your loved one, please visit: www.revitalise.org.uk or call:   .Stephanie StoneRevitalise article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Abandoned - BlissThe first dog to arrive at the centre was -year-old Spaniel Grace, found by a member of the public at the side of the road. She was taken to the vet immediately, but after an owner didn’t come forward, she was brought to Dogs Trust.Two weeks ago, another Spaniel - aged eight and nicknamed Bliss by the team - was found tied to a fence not far from the rehoming centre. Like Grace, the Spaniel has not been microchipped, which has been a legal requirement for all dogs since  and the easiest way to identy a dog who has become separated from their owner. Shockingly just one week later, a Cairn Terrier - less than a year old, was found by a rehoming centre staff member at the very same spot where Bliss was left. Terrier Rizzo was lucky to be found as she is quite small and it would have been easy to miss her in the long grass.The most recent addition to the ranks of abandoned pooches is Sally, an eight-year-old Collie cross, who was found as a stray by a member of the public and brought to the rehoming centre.Abandoned - RizzoOonagh Philips, Rehoming Centre Manager said: “We want to remind anyone who no longer feels that they can care for their dog to contact their local rescue organisation for support. When a dog is abandoned on the road side, it not only puts them in danger, but also drivers. We are so thankful that all four of these dogs were found when they were.“Grace and Bliss were very shaken up by their ordeal when they came into our care and it took them a couple of days to build trust around people again. We could tell Rizzo hadn’t eaten in a while, which could have resulted in a deterioration of her physical health. Sally is incredibly sweet natured, and just like the others, will make a wonderful addition to the right home.“We are not sure why there has been a recent influx in dogs being abandoned. We always remind people that ‘A Dog is for Le®’ but we understand that le happens, and places like Dogs Trust are there to support any dog owner who experiences a bump in the road and needs our help. Sometimes the most responsible thing we can do as a dog owner is admit that we aren’t coping with our pets, but it is important to ensure they are kept safe and not left to fend for themselves.”If you are interested in adopting a dog please get in touch with the team at Dogs Trust Ballymena on  or visit www.dogstrust.org.uk our-centres ballymenaAbandoned - SallyBikers invited to memorial for

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/bbobb.jpg","title":"coffee chain bob and berts creating  new jobs","story":"Posted on Monday  June  by John Mulgrew A Northern Ireland coffee shop chain is creating  new jobs as its expands it reach across the UK with eight new stores, it has emerged.

North Street Arcade was destroyed in a fire in , which caused severe damage to the floor and glass roof. It’s been sitting empty for  years, but once played host to a range of popular Belfast stores, including DJ and local punk pioneer Terri Hooley’s record shop, Good Vibrations. The plans to redevelop the arcade are included in a revised scheme called Tribeca Belfast – formerly Royal Exchange. UK developer Castlebrooke is planning to redevelop much of the north side of the city centre as part of a £m scheme. It’s made a number of amendments and changes to the development, most notably revising back from a formerly retail-led scheme to one with fewer shops. Tribeca Belfast includes development around Royal Avenue, Donegall Street, North Street, Garfield Street and High Street. Castlebrooke Investments says it is now committed to bringing North Street Arcade back into use in a new format, with space designed for independent retailers. It has also been announced that architectural design firm Squire  Partners has been appointed to work on the amended proposals. The team from Squire  Partners will work alongside conservation architects from Belfast-based Consarc Design Group. Neil Young, chief executive of Castlebrooke Investments, said: “We are very pleased to be able to reveal our proposed amendments to our outline planning application for Tribeca Belfast, changes which we feel demonstrate that we have listened to feedback from the city. “We will continue to listen and today we have launched a voluntary public consultation process into these planned changes ahead of the submission of our application. Our community exhibition will provide an opportunity for anyone interested to see the new plans and we will be revealing more information about this in the coming weeks.” Murray Levinson, partner at Squire  Partners, said: “The mix of uses across the site – designed to attract a iety of retail, restaurant, cultural and workplace tenants – and the creation of new public realm, will ensure this part of Belfast will be active throughout the day and into the evening. Providing a large number of residential apartments with shared gardens, as well as a hotel, will create a new opportunity for people to live in the city centre.” And Graeme Moore, specialist conservation architect at Consarc Design Group, said: “Consarc Design Group is delighted that we continue to be involved with the proposals for Tribeca Belfast to offer our expertise in building conservation. As with the previous proposals, all of the listed buildings within this phase are to be retained, restored and adapted for a sustainable ongoing use within the masterplan, rooting the new development in the unique historical character of this part of the city centre.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/droad_1.jpg","title":"major new apartment building planned for dublin road","story":"Posted on Friday  June  by John Mulgrew The Dublin Road in Belfast A new serviced apartment building could be developed along Belfast’s so-called ‘Golden Mile’ on the Dublin Road, it can be revealed.

Shane Mulholland, senior vice president of marketing and operations at First Derivatives, said: “We’ve been involved with the Fast  programme since it began and have found it to be not only great recognition of every stage of the company’s growth but also a chance to meet peers and like-minded businesses who are striving to be leaders in their own fields.” View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
