Photograph: Alan BetsonRelatives of participants in the 1916 Rising have condemned the Saoradh parade which took place in Dublin on Saturday, describing the group as “criminal” rather than “patriotic”.Families of members of the Irish Citizen Army (ICA) gathered in Dublin’s City Hall on Wednesday to lay wreaths in memory of the garrison of men and women who took over the building on April 24th, 1916. They were joined by Sabina Higgins, wife of President Michael D Higgins, Lord Mayor of Dublin Nial Ring and Siptu general secretary Ethel Buckley. Attendee Robert Norgrove said the annual commemorative event was an important reminder of the “social justice” ideals of the ICA members who were stationed in City Hall. Their fight was not only for the Republic but for the people living in the tenements, the sick and those without access to education, he said. Mr Norgrove’s grandfather Alfred George Norgrove, grandmother Maria Ellen Norgrove, aunts Emily and Anna and uncle Frederick all took part in the 1916 Rising. Asked how his grandparents would feel about the presence of the Saoradh dissident republican group on the streets of Dublin during Easter 1916 commemorations, Mr Norgrove said the organisation was “not representative” of the ideals of participants in the Rising. Saoradh is “more of a criminal organisation than they are a national or a patriotic organisation,” he said. “They’re involved in criminality more than anything else.”“The people who were originally in the Irish Citizen Army and the old IRA, it was for the purpose of its day. Now they would be saying protest, raise your voice and get involved in things like homelessness and education. They wouldn’t be throwing their weight around saying bombs and bullets and arms.”VacuumMr Norgrove added that Northern Ireland’s political “vacuum” was at risk of leading to further instability north of the Border. “When people won’t take their seats and operate a government you have a vacuum. It’s never anything good that fills that vacuum.”Jacinta Stenson, whose grand-uncle John Nolan was stationed at City Hall in 1916, agreed that the ideals of Saoradh and the New IRA could not be aligned with the views of those who fought more than a hundred years ago. “Although a united Ireland is definitely something I would love to see it’s just not the way to go about it. It has to be done through politics peacefully, it cannot be done through violence. We’ve come so far from bombs and guns.”Ms Stenson described feeling “shocked” and “saddened” by the Saoradh march through Dublin’s city centre. “I’m sure the rest of the relatives were sickened because it’s not what we represent. We don’t want this paramilitary element involved. They don’t want to talk to people, they just want to fight with violence. There’s no place for that, it’s going backwards and sadly Lyra paid with her life for that.”Ms Stenson said she and her mother Ann, who also attended Wednesday’s event, were “deeply affected” by journalist Lyra McKee’s death. “It’s so ironic because she was the generation of the Good Friday Agreement. She was born into peace and to be shot down like that, there’s no words for it.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3870550.1556132835!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ads urging increase in building heights paid for by ronan backer","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe advert, which ran in the Times Ireland this week, is an almost exact replica of an image used in a letter sent by property developer Johnny Ronan to the Minister for HousingAnonymous newspaper advertisements calling for an increase in building height limits for Dublin were paid for by a company linked to property developer Johnny Ronan and his financial backer, Colony Capital.The  has learned that the ads, which argued that the existing 39metre height limit for buildings close to transportation hubs “isn’t sustainable”, were placed by Spencer Place Development Company (SPDC). When published, the adverts contained no indication of who was behind them.SPDC is the company behind the development of the Salesforce Tower in the capital’s docklands area, which was featured in the ads and compared to other Salesforce “Towers” around the world, including the 326m version in San Francisco and the 247m version in Chicago.“We’re not talking skyscrapers,” the text of the ad read. “Our global and European neighbours aim high and build high – it’s time for Dublin to raise our game too.”The permitted height for the Dublin tower is 39m. The developer is attempting to secure permission for two extra storeys at the project, most recently going to the High Court in an effort to challenge Dublin City Council’s interpretation of the implementation of new rules on building height introduced by the Minister for Housing, Eoghan Murphy, last year.The image used in the advertisement, which ran in the Sunday Times last week and in the daily edition of the Times Ireland this week, is an almost exact replica of an image used in a letter sent by Mr Ronan to Mr Murphy earlier this month. Legal challengeThe image featured on Ronan Group-headed paper which the letter was printed on. In the letter, Mr Ronan told the Minister “we are… concerned that our efforts, and those of the IDA, are now being put in jeopardy” by the planning law issue. The letter is contained in court papers filed as part of the legal challenge to Dublin council by SPDC earlier this week.The addition of the two extra floors would provide space for an extra 1,000 workers and increase fees paid to CIÉ, which owns the site, by €20 million, the development company has argued. Salesforce, the US multinational, has submitted an observation in support of the extra floors, as has IDA Ireland. Mr Ronan has also written to Minister for Finance Paschal Donohoe, Minister for Transport Shane Ross, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and IDA Ireland. The letter argues that DCC’s interpretation of the planning guidelines is “legally incorrect, but which nonetheless has had the effect of significantly delaying the implementation of the ministerial guidelines to developments in Docklands at a time of exceptional development activity to meet the critical need for housing and offices in the area”.

However they appeared in statements on Wednesday evening to be holding to fixed positions.Fr Magill triggered loud and spontaneous applause in St Anne’s Cathedral when he queried why it took Ms McKee’s murder to bring politicians to a point where they appeared prepared to work together to try to solve outstanding issues. “Why does it take the death of a 29-year-old woman with her whole life in front of her to get to this point?” he said. The journalist and writer died in a New IRA gun attack in the Creggan in Derry on Thursday. After the funeral Ms Foster spoke separately with Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney and with Northern Secretary Karen Bradley about the potential value of holding fresh talks aimed at reinstating devolution.‘Parallel’ talksMs Foster repeated her proposal to bring back Stormont while holding a “parallel” talks process to resolve outstanding differences.Ms McDonald said Fr Magill “in a clear concise way said what I have heard all over Ireland – people want the Executive and the Assembly up and running, people want equality and they want good government they can have confidence in”. “Political leaders should be working together,” added the Sinn Féin leader.“Sinn Féin is ready to play our full part in a serious and meaningful talks process which removes obstacles to powersharing, delivers rights and restores the Assembly,” she said.“The two governments should now meet with urgency through the British Irish Intergovernmental Conference, to provide solutions to the outstanding rights issues, which are at the heart of sustainable powersharing,” added Ms McDonald.Ms McDonald and Ms Foster were among politicians and dignataries from both sides of the Border as well as from Britain at the ecumenical funeral service.AttendanceThe attendance included President Michael D Higgins Queen Elizabeth’s representative in Co Down, Lord Lieut Fionnuala Cooke Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, British prime minister Theresa May, Ms Bradley, Labour leader Brendan Howlin and British Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn.Also at the funeral were DUP East Derry MP Gregory Campbell and party Assembly member for South Antrim Pam Cameron, Sinn Féin leader in Northern Ireland Michelle O’Neill and party MEP Martina Anderson.Also present were SDLP leader Colum Eastwood, Ulster Unionist Party leader Robin Swann, Alliance leader Naomi Long, Greens leader in Northern Ireland Clare Bailey, Mr Coveney, Minister for Children Katherine Zappone and the Scottish National Party leader in the House of Commons, Ian Blackford. PSNI chief constable George Hamilton and deputy chief constable Stephen Martin also joined mourners as did former SDLP leader Mark Durkan, former UUP leader Mike Nesbitt, former leader of the Northern Ireland Women’s Coalition Prof Monica McWilliams and historian Ruth Dudley Edwards.The SDLP mayor of Derry, John Boyle, attended as did former moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland Rev Dr John Dunlop and Methodist minister Rev Harold Good, who with the late Fr Alec Reid oversaw IRA decommissioning in 2005.

What will you be talking about?I’m going to talk about my research, and how immunology could help us figure out more about the earliest stages of Alzheimer’s disease.Tell us more about that, what have you been researching in the brain?My research looks at very important cells in the brain called microglia. Their job is to protect other brain cells we call neurons, which send information around the brain. We think in Alzheimer’s disease the microglia become exhausted and they can’t function as well as they should, and this could be linked with the damage that happens to the brain as Alzheimer’s disease progresses.Where does the immune system come in?In Alzheimer’s disease, the immune system in the brain appears to be compromised. We also know that if people who take medicines to dampen an immune response called inflammation for other medical conditions, it seems to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s. So I was interested to see if the microglia cells in the brain act like a type of immune cell called a macrophage, which protects the body from bacteria and other invaders by gobbling them up.Why might a change in the microglia cause a problem?We think a normal function of microglia might be stopping the build-up of a protein called amyloid beta. An accumulation of amyloid beta is a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, and we think that early in the development of the disease microglia might become exhausted and so they can’t process amyloid beta in the usual way.What have you been finding?We can see that the microglia change in a lab model of Alzheimer’s disease, for one thing the cells now take up lots of iron. You can detect iron using MRI, so we hope to track the changes in microglia over time. I am also really interested to see if the microglia switch their metabolism, or how they burn energy, much like macrophages do in the immune system when they become activated.Science is something of a family affair for you, isn’t it?Yes, I developed an interest in science mostly because of my parents. My father was a vet, I would go out with him and I would ask what treatments he was giving and why. My grandfather and mother were both pharmacists and I enjoyed listening to the conversations they would all have.My husband (Prof Kingston Mills) is an immunologist, our son Tim is an engineer and our daughter Evanna is an immunology researcher in Harvard University. I am collaborating with her at the moment, she is going to examine the metabolism of the microglia cells.And finally, how do you take a break?I walk to and from work every day, and that is my serious switch off time.

Photograph: Alexei NikolskyEPAKremlin pool.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un met Russian president Vladimir Putin on Thursday at a summit designed to show that Washington is not the only power able to set the agenda on Pyongyang’s nuclear programme.The two men embarked on a day of talks on an island off the Russian Pacific city of Vlaostok two months after Kim’s summit with US president Donald Trump ended in disagreement, cooling hopes of a breakthrough in the decades-old nuclear row.Putin and Kim, in their first ever face-to-face encounter, smiled broadly and shook hands outside the summit venue, a university campus.They then stood side by side on an escalator, chatting with help from interpreters, as they made their way to an upper floor to begin their talks.In brief opening remarks in front of the media, Putin said he hoped Kim’s visit would “help us better understand by what means we can reach a settlement on the Korean peninsula, what we can do together, what Russia can do to support the positive processes now underway.”“Without question we welcome your efforts to develop dialogue between the Koreas, and to normalise North Korean-US relations,” Putin said.Kim, who had arrived in Vlaostok a day earlier on board his armoured train, told Putin the meeting would help strengthen and develop ties between Russia and North Korea, which share a long history of friendship.“As world attention is focused on the Korean Peninsula, there will be very meaningful dialogue for us to jointly assess the Korean peninsula policies and share, coordinate and study our views,” Kim said.The summit in Vlaostok provides Pyongyang with an opportunity to seek support from a new quarter, Russia, and possible relief from the sanctions hurting its economy.For the Kremlin, the summit is a chance to show it is a global diplomatic player, despite efforts by the United States and other Western states to isolate it.But with Moscow committed to upholding sanctions until the North dismantles its nuclear programme, analysts said the summit was unlikely to produce any tangible help for Pyongyang, beyond a show of camaraderie.Kept waitingPutin has a track record of making world leaders wait for him, but on Wednesday the Russian leader arrived at the venue around half an hour before Kim showed up, according to a Reuters reporter at the scene.Putin’s last summit with a North Korean leader was in 2002 when his counterpart was Kim Jong Il, Kim Jong Un’s father and predecessor. Kim Jong Il also met in 2011 with Dmitry Medvedev, the Putin lieutenant who was then Russian president.Thursday’s summit was taking place on the campus of the Far Eastern Federal University, a complex that back in 2012 played host to an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.Classes were going on as normal and students were walking a few metres from the building where Kim and Putin met. Members of the Russian president’s security detail were dotted around the campus.Buildings were decked out with the Russian and North Korean flags. A concert is planned for the two leaders later in the day, and an orchestra was rehearsing in the hall where they were due to perform."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3870547.1556137938!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"tory mps ask theresa may to set out resignation timetable","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFirst minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon: will introduce legislation allowing for a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if Brexit goes ahead. Photograph: Jane BarlowPA Conservative MPs have asked Theresa May to set out clearly when she will resign but they rejected a proposal to allow a confidence vote in her leadership as early as June. The backbench 1922 Committee voted against a change to the rule that leaves the prime minister immune to a leadership challenge before next December.“We looked at the fact that the prime minister gave a very firm timetable for her departure as leader a few weeks ago in the eventuality that the withdrawal agreement is passed in parliament. We have resolved to request that she sets a similarly clear timetable or schedule for her departure as leader in other circumstances. So real clarity for colleagues in parliament and for the Conservative Party in general,” the committee’s chairman Graham Brady said.Mrs May promised her backbenchers last month that she would resign in time for a new leader to take charge of “the second phase of the Brexit negotiations”. After the House of Commons rejected the withdrawal agreement and the EU agreed to delay Brexit until the end of October, the prime minister’s allies suggested that she would stay in Downing Street until her Brexit deal was approved.Brexit party threatShe is now under pressure to outline what Sir Graham called a “roadmap” towards her resignation, which some Conservative MPs believe will become inevitable if the party contests European Parliament elections on May 23rd. Polls point to a collapse in the Conservative vote as supporters switch to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which announced on Wednesday that former Tory frontbencher Anne Widdecombe will stand as one of its candidates next month.Chancellor of the exchequer Philip Hammond told a Commons committee on Wednesday that the legal default remained leaving the EU without a deal at the end of October. He said that business investment in Britain was 20 per cent below the figure expected before the 2016 referendum.Scotland’s first minister Nicola Sturgeon said she would introduce legislation allowing for a second referendum on Scottish independence by 2021 if Brexit goes ahead. But she declined to set a date for a referendum and said she would establish citizens’ assemblies to\u0026nbspconsider Scotland’s constitutional future.“We have seen in Westminster what happens when parties fail to work together when leaders take a ‘my way or the highway’ approach and when so many red lines and inflexible preconditions are set that progress becomes impossible,” she told the Scottish parliament.SNP isions“This place was established with the hope that it would be a new type of parliament. We can show that we are able to put the interests of the people first. So if others across this chamber are willing to move forward in that spirit, they will find in me an equally willing partner.”Opposition leaders accused the first minister of seeking to paper over isions within her Scottish National Party (SNP) about a second independence referendum rather than uniting Scotland.“Nicola Sturgeon is using her office as first minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country,” Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said.\u0026nbsp“Her statement today is not about Brexit this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacify her party members and backbenchers ahead of the SNP conference. The chaos of Brexit throws into sharp relief the challenges of leaving a political and economic union. Leaving the UK would lead to unprecedented austerity for Scotland’s public services.”Deal or No Deal: countdown to Brexit continues as the deadline for crashing out of Europe fast approaches.

Early childhood is a period of rapid physical and cognitive development and a time during which a child\u0027s habits are formed.The recommendations go much further than recent guidance from the UK\u0027s chief medical officers.This recommended a break from screens every two hours for all children. It also said phones should be banned from meal times and overnight. At a glance | WHO guidelines on physical activity for childrenThe guidance, which will be launched at the European Congress for Obesity in Glasgow this weekend sets out different advice for children of different ages, up to the age of five. It stresses the importance of avoiding sedentary screen time, in a bid to ensure children get sufficient exercise. One in five children in England are overweight or obese by the time they start primary school, rising to one in three by the time they leave. But some experts said parents were being given conflicting advice based on limited evidence. In January the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health shied away from recommending a limit, but said children should not be exposed to screens for at least an hour before bedtime. Tim Smith, Reader in Cognitive Psychology, Centre for Brain and Cognitive Development, Birkbeck, University of London, said: “In recent months UK parents of 0- to five-year-olds and early-years practitioners have been bombarded with conflicting recommendations and guidelines about how and whether they should be managing their children\u0027s screen time and sedentary behaviour, e.g. from the RCPCH and Chief Medical Officers.“The release of new WHO guidelines does not help to clarify the situation, as its specific recommendations with regards to \u0027sedentary screen time\u0027 and their negative impacts on physical, cognitive and psychosocial health are, by its own admission based on \u0027moderate to very low-quality evidence\u0027.Duty of Care CampaignBrexit latest news: Britain must accept that its empire is dead and buried, leading MEP claimsExtinction Rebellion: Activists glued to London Stock Exchange and on top of train at Canary Wharf - latest updatesAnzac Day 2019: How the Gallipoli battle helped forge Australia and New Zealand\u0026#39s national identitiesWho were the Sri Lanka bombers?

But almost none have been there since 2016, according to a study in Wednesday’s Antarctic Science.The breeding pair population has increased significantly at a nearby breeding ground, but the study’s author said it is nowhere near the amount missing at Halley Bay.We’ve never seen a breeding failure on a scale like this in 60 years, said study author Phil Trathan, head of conservation biology at the British Antarctic Survey. It’s unusual to have a complete breeding failure in such a big colony.Emperor penguin chicks at Antarctica\u0026#39s Halley Bay, 2010Black-and-white with yellow ears and breasts, emperor penguins are the largest penguin species, weighing up to 88 pounds (40kg) and living about 20 years. Pairs breed in the harshest winter conditions with the male incubating their egg.Scientists blame the sharp decline on climate and weather conditions that break apart the fast ice - sea ice that’s connected to the land - where the emperor penguins stay to breed. They incubate their eggs and tend to their chicks - one per pair - on ice. After breeding and tending to the chicks, the penguins move to open sea.In 2016 and 2017, there was no breeding in Halley Bay and last year there was just a bit, the study found.The nearby Dawson-Lambton breeding area, which had been home to a couple thousand pairs, increased to 11,117 pairs in 2017 and 14,612 pairs in 2018, the study said.While that’s encouraging, it doesn’t make up for all that was lost at Halley Bay, Trathan said. Not everybody has gone to Dawson Lambton yet, he said.What’s troubling isn’t that part of the colony has moved to Dawson-Lambton, it is that scientists thought of Halley Bay as a climate change refuge in one of the coldest areas of the continent where in the future you expect to always have emperors, Trathan said.David Ainley, a marine ecologist and penguin expert at the consulting firm H.T. Harvey \u0026amp Associates, worried that some people will be more alarmed than they need to be because many of the penguins didn’t disappear, but just moved. While not as scary as it may sound initially, with climate change long term, it’s another question as alternate breeding sites likely will become harder to find, said Ainley, who was not part of the study.The study makes sense, and sometimes dramatic environmental change can cause a breeding failure like this, said Stephanie Jenouvrier, a penguin expert at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution who wasn’t part of the study.Trathan said a super strong El Nino - a natural cyclical warming of the central Pacific that changes weather worldwide - melted sea ice more than usual and exposed the fast ice to wind and waves, making the breeding home less stable.

However, some suggestions - such as scrapping free bus passes and TV licences - have sparked a backlash from charities.Age UK said that young people should not be helped “at the expense of the older generation”.In a bid to tackle tax and spending issues, the Committee said that while “age-based benefits and allowances were justified in the past to tackle pensioner poverty”, many pensioner households are now on average better off than many working age households. This is in terms of both income after housing costs and household wealth.To reflect this increased prosperity, the peers are calling on the Government to remove the triple lock for State Pensions and instead uprate it in line with average earnings and phase out free TV licences based on age before deciding if it wants to subsidise TV licences based on household income.Members of the House of Lords also suggest that free bus passes and Winter Fuel Payment should only be available five years after a person becomes eligible for the State Pension and that better off workers over the State Pension age should pay National Insurance while they continue to work.Caroline Abrahams, Charity Director at Age UK said: “We are pleased the Committee found evidence of continuing strong intergenerational bonds across our society, especially within families, and this reflects what we hear too.”Table - How much does the government bring in in fines?However she added: “Young people may well need more help but we disagree that this should be at the expense of the older generation.  “This underplays the extent of need among older people, and skates over the great difficulty of ensuring a targeted approach  which actually reaches those older people who are the most vulnerable.“All the evidence suggests that means-testing, for example, results in significant numbers of very poor older people missing out. More profoundly we reject the notion that helping younger and older people is an ‘eitheror’ in practice many at both ends of the age spectrum need our society’s support and an advanced twenty first century economy like the UK is well placed to provide it.”Dr Anna Dixon, Chief Executive, Centre for Ageing Better said that with levels of pensioner poverty on the rise for the first time since 2010,  the ‘triple lock’ on the State Pension provides “a vital safety net” for people at risk of poverty in later life.“Nor should we be complacent about changes to benefits, given the level of inequality amongst people in later life,” she added. “This includes access to affordable transport, which is critical to many people’s ability to get out and about and access essential services.”But none of this is as potentially catastrophic as failing to build decent, accessible homes that meet the needs and aspirations of our ageing population, or making our workplaces fit for our longer working lives.”Lord True, Chairman of the Committee, said: “Young people told us they feel short changed by the housing market, so we are recommending policies to deliver a significant increase in the supply of social and private housing and recommend protections to give renters long term security be backed a new regulatory framework.“We also need to change how we view education and training. Longer working lives mean older workers need support to reskill and continue to contribute in the workplace and younger people, particularly those who do not go to university need the government to prioritise and fund further education and vocational training.”House of LordsExtinction Rebellion: Activists glued to London Stock Exchange and on top of train at Canary Wharf - latest updatesAnzac Day 2019: How the Gallipoli battle helped forge Australia and New Zealand\u0026#39s national identitiesBrexit latest news: Theresa May urged to set a date of departure by the \u0026#39men in grey suits\u0026#39Who were the Sri Lanka bombers?

But a further update could come before 2019 is over, one of which might bring a whole host of features.One of the new models of AirPods will include an all-new form factor design, according to usually reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. For that, there will be an increased price, according to the same report, which was first revealed by Macrumors.It is not clear what features those new, upgraded AirPods could include. Rumours have suggested that Apple is working on health tracking through the ears, noise cancelling to stop sound getting in the sides, and other features.The current AirPods already cost $159 with their normal case, or $199 with the wireless charging one. The other pair of AirPods will build on those existing earbuds and presumably cost the same.Both of them will also come with new designs on the inside, which will allow Apple to make them more easily and cheaply. But it\u0027s not clear what the new ones will look like or how much they will change.Apple only released an updated version of the buds last month, though it did not refer to them as AirPods 2 and they stayed largely similar. The new earphones feature Apple\u0027s brand-new H1 chip for improved wireless connectivity, increased battery power, and the ability to start Hey Siri at any time.And Apple-owned Beats also introduced its new Powerbeats Pro earphones at the beginning of this month. Though they feature the Beats branding, they include many of the same features, at a higher cost and with improved battery life.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable. While Captain Marvel may not revolutionise the studio’s formula, the superhero\u0027s debut outing provides a platform to show off her Thanos-annihilating powers.  Thanks to a smart script, it also offers some of the very best character development in the MCU.While Spider-Man’s miraculous arrival in the MCU came with Captain America: Civil War, it was not until Homecoming that we truly got to know Peter Parker. Tom Holland’s incarnation swings past Andrew Garfield’s version, thanks to the film’s lower-stakes high school story allowing for intimate moments with the character. Along with including some great comic performances (Jacob Batalon as Ned stands out), Michael Keaton’s Vulture makes for a terrifying villain, and the twist is superbly done.While isive among Marvel fans, Shane Black’s superhero outing – with the writerdirector’s sharp, stinging dialogue – brings Tony Stark\u0027s story arc to an end (or what should have been its end) with humour and heart aplenty. As Robert Downey Jr’s genius, billionaire philanthropist deals with PTSD and struggles with his robotic creations, we see an actor giving his all. While Civil War and the Avengers films dragged him back into action, fingers are crossed Avengers: Endgame will give the character a similar emotionally satisfying send-off.Completely transforming the Thor franchise in a single, effortless move, director Taika Waititi injected new energy into the MCU. Ragnarok is perfectly balanced both as a standard Marvel movie, with all the right heroics and world-building intact, and as a work belonging exclusively to Waititi, filled with the humour and charm he’d previously displayed in What We Do in the Shadows and Hunt for the Wilderpeople. By finding a way to incorporate inidual voices into its massive franchise machine, Marvel found the secret to true long-term success.Where it all started. Iron Man subverted expectations by not only reintroducing Robert Downey Jr to the world, but by showing that a relatively unknown B-character could be at the centre of a blockbuster. Other cinematic universes fail because they attempt to introduce too much (a mistake made in Iron Man 2). The first Iron Man, though, had a self-contained story that only hinted at a bigger world – a world that would eventually become a multi-billion-dollar franchise. 2021 s of the Galaxy Blasting the Marvel universe into space for an adventure with a truly ragtag group of heroes, including both a talking racoon and a sentient tree-creature, s of the Galaxy is arguably the biggest risk the franchise ever took. And it paid off in spectacular fashion, with director James Gunn giving the superhero genre a light coat of B-movie glee. It also transformed Parks and Recreation star Chris Pratt into the major box office draw he is today.Although Black Panther still dutifully fulfils all the requirements of a Marvel film, providing a bridge to films both past and future plus ending in a cinematic battle filled with CGI trickery, Ryan Coogler’s achievement as a director is to use a familiar framework to tell a radical story within mainstream filmmaking. In the strife between Chadwick Boseman’s T’Challa, the ruler of Wakanda, and Michael B Jordan’s Killmonger, he provided a nuanced, layered commentary on colonialism and black identity. It’s a film that triumphs both within its genre, bringing new perspectives to the superhero story, and outside of it, satisfying purely as a piece of narrative drama.Iron Man 2 barely holds together. Rather than act as a straight sequel to the surprisingly successful Iron Man, Marvel Studios decided to overstuff the film with universe-building references (Black Widow, Nick Fury and SHIELD’s Agent Coulson all make appearances) and two-dimensional villains (played by Sam Rockwell and Mickey Rourke). The result is a film without any direction that serves as a Trojan horse set-up for the Avengers.When the Thor franchise lost its director Kenneth Branagh between the first and second films, it also had to kiss goodbye to the Shakespearean theatrics that had lent it a sense of goofy charm. Directed by Game of Thrones’s Alan Taylor, The Dark World prioritises its VFX effects above all else. It’s a dull affair: Christopher Eccleston’s Malekith is (by far) Marvel’s worst villain, being a pile of prosthetics with zero personality, while Chris Hemsworth’s Thor completes one of the most unrealistic London Tube journeys in all of cinematic history.Edward Norton’s version of the smashing Hulk often gets forgotten by Marvel fans – and for good reason. Whereas Mark Ruffalo’s bumbling interpretation of the character has a gravitational charm, Norton’s moping monster is void of any charisma. With Liv Tyler phoning in her performance as love interest, Betty Ross, the film falls emotionally flat and serves only as a by-the-numbers origins story.421 Avengers: Age of UltronJust in case we’d forgotten that the Disney corporation is an all-consuming titan that owns half of Hollywood, the sequel to 2012’s Avengers decided to sneak in a little corporate synergy: when Iron Man accidentally creates a sentient robot (voiced by James Spader) who decides the earth’s only salvation is through the destruction of humanity, he announces his grim plans with accompaniment of a little citation of the classic “I’ve Got No Strings” from 1940’s Pinocchio. It’s a moment that exemplifies how Ultron feels like a cold, calculated operation from Marvel Studios. It’s merely tick list of obligations to move us on to the next chapter of the MCU.Although Kenneth Branagh’s introductory outing for Marvel’s God of Thunder fared perfectly well on release, it’s suffered massively from the MCU’s dramatic sense of progression over the years. Certainly, Tom Hiddleston’s Loki is a strong, well-crafted character right out of the gate, and his plot against his adoptive father (Anthony Hopkins) is delightfully heightened. Yet, it arguably took until Thor: Ragnarok for Chris Hemsworth’s hero to develop much sense of character beyond the initial “fish out of water” trope.A self-centred wealthy white man ventures to a distant land and realises his superhero potential – sound familiar? That’s because Doctor Strange and Iron Man are basically the same story, except one uses magic and the other explosives. Benedict Cumberbatch’s Marveldebut impresses with kaleidoscope visuals but lacks the heart of Robert Downey Jr’s hero, leading to a film that wastes the talents of both Tilda Swinton and Mads Mikkelsen. 721 s of the Galaxy Vol 2The first s of the Galaxy was a risky Star Wars-inspired romp through space, following a bunch of a-holes who form an unlikely familiar bond. For the second film, James Gunn decided to turn everything up to 11, cramming half a dozen interweaving storylines, leading to Chris Pratt’s gaunt Star Lord getting side-lined. The sequel did, however, introduce the now beloved line “I’m Mary Poppins, y’all”, shouted by Yondu as he gracefully falls from the sky. A wonderfully comedic moment in a film that misses on another half-dozen punches.Marvel’s first crossover film was an unparalleled cinematic event – one that arguably changed Hollywood filmmaking forever, now that every major studio seems to be attempting the “shared universe” approach to franchises. Although the MCU has refined the template since, The Avengers still established the focus on humour, character, and heart that would come to define the success story of Marvel Studios. It’s a blockbuster that feels large on all fronts, delivering thrills not only in the “Battle of New York” finale, but in the creation of a team of characters that feel perfectly balanced and complementary.Despite Captain America: Civil War (AKA Avengers 2.5) featuring Iron Man, Black Widow, and Ant-Man (as well as introducing Black Panther and Spider-Man), the film remains first and foremost about Captain America. And that’s perhaps why the stuffed blockbuster works – were it not for a central focus, Civil War could have fallen into the trappings of other Marvel sequels in being too convoluted. The Russo Brothers also direct one of the best actions scenes in Marvel history so far, the airport scene, which looks as if it leapt straight out of a comic book.1021 Ant-Man and the WaspWhile the first Ant Man was a mirror image of its star Paul Rudd, essentially delivering a studio comedy dressed in dex, the second found a new trick up its sleeve in the form of Evangeline Lilly’s Hope van Dyne – a smart, capable female hero who didn’t simply exist to serve as a caretaker for the male characters.Ant-Man should not have worked as a film. Just look at the title! Ridiculous to think a movie about a man with ant powers should work – let alone be a blockbuster success and part of the biggest cinematic universe going. Yet, despite production problems (Edgar Wright was initially meant to helm the film), Peyton Reed directs this hilarious heist film with aplomb, taking the Marvel world a little less seriously than others. Marvel redefined cinematic narratives once more in 2018, creating a single culmination to a decade’s worth of films. While it plays as total nonsense to anyone who’s a newcomer to the franchise (if that’s possible), it was, for fans, an unmatched emotional release. The Russo brothers faced the monumental task of making each crossover – from the s of the Galaxy to the kingdom of Wakanda – work in a way that feels natural, while also ushering the MCU’s biggest villain, Thanos, into centre stage. Epic both in its sense of scale and stakes, Infinity War also stages one of the most memorable finales in blockbuster history.With or without the beard, Steve Rogers aka Captain America has now become the brooding centre of the Avengers, but there was once a time when he was all about the old-fashioned heroics. Director Joe Johnston stayed true to the film’s 1940s setting in a film that embraces that pulpiness of early comic book history, as Steve punches Nazis and romances military officer Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), although her character is thankfully never relegated to the role of damsel in distress.Despite centring on a super-powered American nationalist, the Captain America trilogy has the most consistent quality in the MCU. Its crowning moment comes with The Winter Soldier – an adrenaline-fuelled conspiracy thriller that features a spectacular twist and provokes questions regarding modern day surveillance. However, given The Russo Brothers root the rest of the movie in realism, the bombastic CGI-heavy ending is a little ridiculous. Brie Larson gives a superpowered performance as Carol Danvers, the actor playing a hero that\u0027s both relatable and aspirational, strong but vulnerable.

Among the leading candidates are Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey, and BoE chief economist\u0026nbspAndy Haldane and deputy governor Ben Broadbent.Mr Hammond said: “Finding a candidate with the right skills and experience to lead the Bank of England is vital for ensuring the continuing strength of our economy and for maintaining the UK’s position as a leading global financial centre.”The chancellor also paid tribute to Mr Carney’s leadership.He said: “His steady hand has helped steer the UK economy through a challenging period and we are now seeing stable, low inflation and the fastest wage growth in over a decade.“And under Mark’s leadership the Bank of England has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable.”Candidates must be able to commit to an eight-year term, rather then the five years that Mr Carney had agreed.The governor chairs the Bank of England’s three central committees: the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates the Financial Policy Committee, which monitors risks in the financial system and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates the biggest financial firms.Critics have said the governor’s role has become too politicised in recent times, notably since the EU referendum in June 2016. Threadneedle Street has come under fire, particularly from Leave supporters, for its gloomy economic forecast in the wake of the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I think breaking through it on its first attempt any time this month in unlikely. What is most likely to happen is that it will test $6,000, fail and head back down towards $4,000.I would expect the price to break through $6,000 on any second or third attempt and from there the aim would be to get back to $10,000.Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsBe inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

He sounds like a medieval general. He makes vans.\u0026nbspHis name is Xu Qiuhua. He is another of those “big” personalities you always find in the car business –\u0026nbspHenry Ford, Ferdinand Porsche, William Morris, Lee Iacocca, Soichiro Honda, Sergio Marchionne, Dieter Zetsche, Carlos Ghosn… Xu Qiuhua, who runs the Maxus ision of the Shanghai-based SAIC Motor, will go far.Such combative views on the Darwinian realties of survival in the car industry, even in private, are rare. Perhaps if such an uncompromising and single-minded approach had been taken by the chaps who\u0026nbspused to run our own “native” car businesses,\u0026nbspbrands such as Austin, Morris, Hillman and Triumph would still be pouring out of British car factories. \u0026nbspIt is rather like visiting a parallel universe, travelling as I did to see\u0026nbspthe Chinese car industry and the showcase Shanghai Motor Show – at which only a portion of the country’s 72 car makers are represented. It is an answer to the question: “What might have happened to what was left of the ‘indigenous’ British motor industry if it had had a huge dose of investment and the latest technology injected into it?”\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch. Show all 12Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.The short answer is SAIC\u0026nbsp(Shanghai\u0026nbspAutomotive Industry\u0026nbspCorporation), which, by a variety of chance circumstances has ended up with MG\u0026nbspRover – rebranded and repronounced after legal issues as Roewe and LDV, which used to make the Maxus van.\u0026nbspA half-century ago these famous names or operations were all part of the British Leyland Motor Corporation, at that time one of the biggest motor corporations in the world (fifth, in fact, by revenues, making over a million vehicles per annum\u0026nbsp–\u0026nbsphuge by the standards of the time).By the 2000s after a terrible saga of decline, it has been dismembered. Now Jaguar Land Rover is (mostly) successful as part of the Indian-based Tata Group, and BMW, after a brief stewardship of the old group, has revitalised Mini (albeit both UK businesses face those notorious Brexit uncertainties). They’re still mostly in Britain.\u0026nbspExcepting a small engineering and design presence in Birmingham and London, however, the other surviving brands are in China under the ownership of SAIC, the parent company of SAIC\u0026nbspMotor UK Technical Centre (SMTC UK), which looks after the “British” brands.They are doing well too, which just adds to the sense of schadenfreude. After all, Sweden, Germany, France and Italy all managed to somehow hang on to national champions with extensive activities in high-cost western Europe – why not the UK?What might have been…and also what might have been under the owners of MG Rover in the first decade of this country, who had a (slim) chance of securing a partnership with a Chinese group such as SAIC or Brilliance China Automotive, but instead found themselves pursuing some distractions of their own.SAIC\u0026nbspis\u0026nbsphyperactive, launching a starry array of new models, many now independently developed by the Chinese group. Like the Japanese and Koreans before them, such local assembly operations facilitated transfer of technology and know-how into the local industry – Nissan once built Austin Cambridges, and Hyundai manufactured a version of the Ford Cortina.\u0026nbspSAIC too started out learning how to make vehicles decades ago through joint ventures with VW and General Motors, making obsolescent Santanas and Buicks. They also transported the assembly lines for the old Rover 75 and the LDV Maxus van from Birmingham over to China a few years ago.Now SAIC makes 7\u0026nbspmillion cars a year, and with total revenues of $133.6bn (£103bn), yielding\u0026nbspprofits of $5.3bn (£4bn). By comparison, the entire UK car industry makes about 1.5 million cars, and the Chinese, even going through a bit of a downturn, buy as many new cars in one month as the British do in a year.Jaguar owner posts thumping loss in another blow to UK car industrySet SAIC against Toyota, say. Toyota makes around\u0026nbsp9\u0026nbspmillion cars a year, but has proportionately larger margins on its upmarket and more sophisticated products selling in developed, mature markets. Hence Toyota’s superior profitability – $23bn\u0026nbsp(£17.8).SAIC, and the Chinese industry’s best hope of global dominance, is to leapfrog the German and Japanese-based firms to win the race for leadership in electric cars and autonomous driving, both areas where China has an early lead. It has the biggest lithium ion battery production in the world and has secured many of the minerals needed for the new technologies, such as cobalt and rare earth minerals. And we all know about Huawei’s controversial 5G expertise.So China’s increasing technological strength means its cars have moved on from being cheapish facelifts of ageing designs such as the Rover 75 and LDV Maxus van, a vehicle that goes back to a joint venture with Daewoo nearly two decades ago.\u0026nbspThat van is actually still in production at SAIC, as the Maxus V80, the assembly line having migrated from Poland to Birmingham and thence to Nanjing. There’s a nifty little camper van they’re promoting on this familiar shape. Some have been exported “back” to the UK.\u0026nbspYet lately it has been used by SAIC to test hydrogen fuel cells and driverless technology (which makes most sense for local van deliveries).Now the old LDV design has been superseded by a smart all-new “V90”, which, like the Mercedes V-Class even offers buyers front- or rear-wheel drive, as well as petrol, diesel or electric propulsion, and a variety of body styles.As unveiled at the Shanghai show, it appears class competitive with the likes of the Ford Transit – though only active use will determine whether it is durable. There are also question marks, as there have long been, about the safety of Chinese-engineered vehicles, a factor in their slow acceptance in\u0026nbspricher markets.Even so, the developments are continuing apace. SAIC is making the most of its portfolio of badges. Maxus, for example, has become a marque in its own right – with a new big people carrier, the D50, a rather slabby affair in the tradition of the Renault Espace, Kia Sedona and Toyota Picnic. This one-box family motor may have gone out of style in the west, but in China the relaxation of the so-called “one child” policy, plus an ageing population, may produce a stronger demand for such a vehicleWith MG, too, the Chinese firm is pushing its British roots ever more powerfully, using the Queen, the Beatles and Benedict Cumberbatch in its promotional efforts. The twist is an implication that this venerable but knackered British brand had to be rescued by Chinese technology.There is something in that, I’ll admit.Nowadays MG stands for “my glamour”, and is the sporty, funky end of the range. They’ve even revived the old “X-Power” and “Trophy”\u0026nbsp performance\u0026nbsp sub-brands from the Longbridge era. The latest slogan is: “Make MG Great Again.”\u0026nbspTheir new HS larger SUV and electric MG EZS make a case for that.\u0026nbspSAIC is, then, a typical Chinese motor company – massive but you might have never heard of it. It makes a huge range of vehicles, from a gigantic and well-appointed luxury SUV made with Roewe (the descendant of Rover) and MG badging through to utilitarian vans, lorries and, who knows, smaller electric and autonomous city cars in the future.The Chinese are also busily developing hydrogen fuel cell technology – another zero-emissions method of propulsion, though arguably less energy efficient than pure battery power from mains electricity. They have a plant abroad, in\u0026nbspThailand, plus the usual test tracks, research and wind tunnel facilities. They can do most things on their own, with only transmissions being a major buy-in.The only thing that is really holding the Chinese industry back is to achieve modern advanced standards of build quality and durability, and to catch up with the western makes in terms of secondary safety – protecting passengers in a smash. SAIC’s rival\u0026nbspGeely, a private sector Chinese firm, has\u0026nbspacquired Volvo, famed for its attention to safety, which should help.Dongfeng\u0026nbspMotor Group has taken around a 14 per cent stake in Groupe PSA (formerly PSA Peugeot Citroen), and SAIC Motor has about a 1 per cent holding in General Motors.Daimler, parent of Mercedes-Benz, already owns a 10 per cent stake in BAIC, the Beijing Automotive group, and BAIC holds 10 per cent of Daimler. They have a joint venture to produce Mercedes-Benz cars in China, and the mutual advantages to build scale and ersity, reduce risks and costs and exchange technology is apparent.\u0026nbspSo the links – financial, corporate and technological – between China’s rapidly advancing auto companies and the west’s more established brands are gradually growing tighter and more intricate. It is, for now, a more balanced relationship between east and west. Underneath, it is still a Darwinian struggle, though.\u0026nbspOnly the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

They were told in no uncertain terms to get to work or lose a month’s pay. They had no choice but to get to work.Just one hour later, the eight-storey Rana Plaza collapsed on itself, its weak structures no longer able to carry the generators illegally placed on its roof to avoid the frequent power cuts disrupting workflow. They brought down the entire rickety building floor by floor taking thousands of workers with them. The final death toll was 1,134\u0026nbspwith a further 2,500 injured.Modern slavery is not just a developing world problem. It is a problem largely driven and largely sustained by us in the west. And modern slavery is not just a problem created by multinationals that are seeking to maximise their profits, whatever the cost. They do it because we, as customers, want them to keep up with our insatiable appetites. In the retail world, “fast fashion” means demand for more and more clothes that get discarded quicker than ever which in turn means that factory owners have to find ever newer ways of keeping up.Increasingly in the west it’s businesses that are being held to scrutiny for having driven practices we have in the past simply turned a blind eye to. This is coming through employee activism – people not wanting to work for a company perpetuates these barbaric standards – but also from the rise of the ethical millennial consumer. We’ve yet to see much evidence of shareholder revolts over the matter but businesses tend to respond when competitors gain competitive advantage.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.Modern Slavery in the UK Show all 13Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.NCA has launched a touring photographic exhibition which aims to portray the signs of slavery and exploitation.

He has no protective gear on, and we can see the extreme tiredness that leads him to a place of anxiety and distraction, where he doesn’t care about whether he’s operating machinery safely, or putting himself at risk.”The exhibition comprises a series of large, freestanding cubes displaying images capturing snapshots of life within different types of modern slavery - in agriculture, construction, maritime, cannabis farming and food processing, child trafficking for sexual exploitation and forced prostitution.At Thomson Reuters, Monique Villa has initiated a Stop Slavery Awards programme through the company’s foundation which celebrates those businesses that have rigorously interrogated their supply chains and taken action when they have found them to be lacking.But modern slavery is by no means just a matter of sweat shops in developing countries. There are approximately 13,000 known cases of people living under modern slavery conditions here in the UK that we are aware of which of course means the real number will be significantly higher.\u0026nbspThe main routes are from Nigeria (domestic and sex workers), Vietnam (nail shops) and Albania (car washing). I recently became high sheriff of Greater London and this will be a core focus of my year in office as the majority of human trafficking and modern slavery practices are conducted in the capital.Organisations like the Human Trafficking Foundation are working with the politan Police and local authorities to help them detect where it is taking place, often in homes and businesses in our neighbourhoods.\u0026nbspThe Modern Slavery Act was introduced in 2015, making it easier to prosecute traffickers and to not prosecute victims of slavery for crimes they were forced to commit. It also commits big businesses to report how they are tackling the problem in their supply chain. The legislation is currently under review and Baroness Lola Young is among the many parliamentarians seeking to give it more teeth.So far little has been done to engage SMEs\u0026nbsp(small and medium-sized enterprises) in this conversation and that needs to change. It’s of course easier said than done but the process of engagement has to start as businesses often need persistent nagging to behave better. A decade ago, I attended a Business in the Community conference on climate change and the role we all had to play. We were all asked to sign a pledge by the Prince of Wales and so we did and then later read what the pledge obliged us to do, the main component of which was to ask ten companies in our supply chain what they would do to reduce their carbon emissions.\u0026nbspI wrote to 10 of our suppliers and not one of them replied.\u0026nbspBut today, in a world where Greta Thunberg walks into parliament and takes down MPs for failing to act earlier on the environment and where retailers risk losing customers if they have no plan for eliminating single use plastic, we see that it takes a movement of noises over time to drive change.\u0026nbspPublic-facing SMEs often see human trafficking and modern slavery as phenomena that affect other businesses and not theirs. It will require more than employee activism to trigger action on this front. It will need consumer activism and the threat of shopping elsewhere.In the meantime, the next time you’re having your nails done or your car washed, look around you. Watch for bruises and exhaustion in employees, look out for sleeping bags in the corner and if you see anything suspicious around you, there are numbers to call like The Salvation Army’s response unit.Businesses of all sizes are likely to be complicit in such evil. We need to be better held to account if we’re not confronting it.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Among the leading candidates are Financial Conduct Authority chief Andrew Bailey, and BoE chief economist\u0026nbspAndy Haldane and deputy governor Ben Broadbent.Mr Hammond said: “Finding a candidate with the right skills and experience to lead the Bank of England is vital for ensuring the continuing strength of our economy and for maintaining the UK’s position as a leading global financial centre.”The chancellor also paid tribute to Mr Carney’s leadership.He said: “His steady hand has helped steer the UK economy through a challenging period and we are now seeing stable, low inflation and the fastest wage growth in over a decade.“And under Mark’s leadership the Bank of England has been at the forefront of reforms to make our financial system safer and more accountable.”Candidates must be able to commit to an eight-year term, rather then the five years that Mr Carney had agreed.The governor chairs the Bank of England’s three central committees: the Monetary Policy Committee, which sets interest rates the Financial Policy Committee, which monitors risks in the financial system and the Prudential Regulation Authority, which regulates the biggest financial firms.Critics have said the governor’s role has become too politicised in recent times, notably since the EU referendum in June 2016. Threadneedle Street has come under fire, particularly from Leave supporters, for its gloomy economic forecast in the wake of the Brexit vote.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our data lets us look beneath the headline figures at what is happening to young people from different backgrounds, in different parts of the country, and with different qualifications, and, for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not a good news story.“We are breaking a fundamental promise to young people in this country. We tell them: \u0027Study hard, get your qualifications and good jobs will follow\u0027.“For many young people this is true, but for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it isn\u0027t. They are less likely to get those qualifications, and even when they do, less likely to benefit.”Stefan Speckesser, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which helped with the study, said: “By showing regional and local differences in the employment gap, we find evidence that some local areas are more successfully tackling the negative effects of disadvantage, which are unrelated to education success, on young people\u0027s school-to-work transitions.”The findings, involving 18 to 24-year-old Neets in England, are drawn from Education Department data.Shadow employment minister Mike Amesbury said: “This report must act as a wake-up call to the Government. Young people who have grown up in poverty can face significant disadvantages when they come to look for their first job.“The Tory Party is failing young people, who are too often trapped in low-paid and insecure work, but the Government is refusing to track whether or not its flagship youth employment programme, the Youth Obligation, is working.”Mark Hawthorne, of the Local Government Association, said: “The Government needs to consider LGA proposals for an integrated employment and skills service led by local authorities.“Devolving careers advice, post-16 and adult skills budgets and powers to local areas would allow councils, schools, colleges and employers to work together to improve provision for young people so that they can get on in life.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

When the house was sold after his death in 1993, the archive was moved to Manchester, where it is being catalogued by the International Anthony Burgess Foundation.Burgess himself described the work as a “major philosophical statement on the contemporary human condition”, outlining his concerns about the effect on humanity of technology, in particular media, film and television.Created with Sketch.40 books to read before you die Show all 40Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England. For every lucky Elizabeth, who tames the haughty, handsome Mr. Darcy and learns to know herself in the process, there’s a Charlotte, resigned to life with a driveling buffoon for want of a pretty face.240 The Secret Diary of Adrian Mole, Aged 13 ¾, Sue TownsendRead this one when you’re decrepit enough, and chances are you’ll die laughing. No-one has lampooned the self-absorption, delusions of grandeur and sexual frustration of adolescence as brilliantly as Susan Townsend, and no one ever will. Beyond the majestically majestic poetry and the pimples, there’s also a sharp satire of Thatcherist Britain.It’s not often an idiom coined in a novel becomes a catch-phrase, but Joseph Heller managed it with his madcap, savage and hilarious tour de force. War is the ultimate dead-end for logic, and this novel explores all its absurdities as we follow US bombardier pilot Captain John Yossarian. While Heller drew on his own experience as a WWII pilot, it was the McCarthyism of the fifties that fueled the book’s glorious rage.440 Tess of the d’Urbervilles, Thomas HardyA good 125 years before #metoo, Thomas Hardy skewered the sexual hypocrisy of the Victorian age in this melodramatic but immensely moving novel. Tess is a naïve girl from a poor family who is raped by a wealthy land-owner. After the death of her baby, she tries to build a new life, but the “shame” of her past casts a long shadow. Read this if you want to understand the rotten culture at the root of victim-blaming.A classic exposé of colonialism, Achebe’s novel explores what happens to a Nigerian village when European missionaries arrive. The main character, warrior-like Okonkwo, embodies the traditional values that are ultimately doomed. By the time Achebe was born in 1930, missionaries had been settled in his village for decades. He wrote in English and took the title of his novel from a Yeats poem, but wove Igbo proverbs throughout this lyrical work.The ultimate piece of dystopian fiction, 1984 was so prescient that it’s become a cliché. But forget TV’s Big Brother or the trite travesty of Room 101: the original has lost none of its furious force. Orwell was interested in the mechanics of totalitarianism, imagining a society that took the paranoid surveillance of the Soviets to chilling conclusions. Our hero, Winston, tries to resist a grey world where a screen watches your every move, but bravery is ultimately futile when the state worms its way inside your mind.A timeless plea for justice in the setting of America’s racist South during the depression years, Lee’s novel caused a sensation. Her device was simple but incendiary: look at the world through the eyes of a six-year-old, in this case, Jean Louise Finch, whose father is a lawyer defending a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Lee hoped for nothing but “a quick and merciful death at the hands of the reviewers”: she won the Pulitzer and a place on the curriculum.Dickens was the social conscience of the Victorian age, but don’t let that put you off. Great Expectations is the roiling tale of the orphaned Pip, the lovely Estella, and the thwarted Miss Havisham. First written in serial form, you barely have time to recover from one cliffhanger before the next one beckons, all told in Dickens’ luxuriant, humorous, heartfelt prose.940 The God of Small Things, Arundhati RoyRoy won the 1997 Booker Prize with her debut novel, a powerful intergenerational tale of love that crosses caste lines in southern India, and the appalling consequences for those who break the taboos dictating “who should be loved, and how. And how much”. Sex, death, religion, the ambivalent pull of motherhood: it’s all there in this beautiful and haunting book.In an astonishing act of literary ventriloquism, Mantel inhabits a fictionalised version of Thomas Cromwell, a working-class boy who rose through his own fierce intelligence to be a key player in the treacherous world of Tudor politics. Historical fiction so immersive you can smell the fear and ambition.1140 The Code of the Woosters, PG WodehouseIf you haven’t read PG Wodehouse in a hot bath with a snifter of whisky and ideally a rubber duck for company, you haven’t lived. Wallow in this sublimely silly tale of the ultimate comic double act: bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his omniscient butler, Jeeves. A sheer joy to read that also manages to satirise British fascist leader Oswald Mosley as a querulous grump in black shorts.Shelley was just 18 when she wrote Frankenstein as part of a challenge with her future husband, Percy Shelley, and Lord Byron, to concoct the best horror story. Put down the green face paint: Frankenstein’s monster is a complex creation who yearns for sympathy and companionship. Some 200 years after it was first published, the gothic tale feels more relevant than ever as genetic science pushes the boundaries of what it means to create life. 1340 Lord of the Flies, William GoldingAnyone who has ever suspected that children are primitive little beasties will nod sagely as they read Golding’s classic. His theory is this: maroon a bunch of schoolboys on an island, and watch how quickly the trappings of decent behaviour fall away. Never has a broken pair of spectacles seemed so sinister, or civilisation so fragile.The protagonist of Rushdie’s most celebrated novel is born at the exact moment India gains independence. He’s also born with superpowers, and he’s not the only one. In an audacious and poetic piece of magical realism, Rushdie tells the story of India’s blood-soaked resurgence via a swathe of children born at midnight with uncanny abilities.You will need a cold, dead heart not to be moved by one of literature’s steeliest heroines. From the institutional cruelty of her boarding school, the “small, plain” Jane Eyre becomes a governess who demands a right to think and feel. Not many love stories take in a mad woman in the attic and a spot of therapeutic disfigurement, but this one somehow carries it off with mythic aplombThis is a richly satisfying slow burn of a novel that follows the lives and loves of the inhabitants of a small town in England through the years 1829–32. The acerbic wit and timeless truth of its observations mark this out as a work of genius but at the time the author, Mary Anne Evans, had to turn to a male pen name to be taken seriously. Stick another log on the fire and curl up with this dark, peculiar and quite brilliant literary murder tale. A group of classics students become entranced by Greek mythology - and then take it up a level. Remember, kids: never try your own delirious Dionysian ritual at home. A subtle and engrossing look at racial identity, through the story of a charismatic young Nigerian woman who leaves her comfortable Lagos home for a world of struggles in the United States. Capturing both the hard-scrabble life of US immigrants and the brash isions of a rising Nigeria, Adichie crosses continents with all her usual depth of feeling and lightness of touch.An absolute unadulterated comic joy of a novel. Stella Gibbons neatly pokes fun at sentimental navel-gazing with her zesty heroine Flora, who is more interested in basic hygiene than histrionics. In other words, if you’ve “seen something nasty in the woodshed,” just shut the door.Dedicated to the “Sixty Million and more” Africans and their descendants who died as a result of the slave trade, this is a cultural milestone and a Pulitzer-winning tour de force. Morrison was inspired by the real-life story of an enslaved woman who killed her own daughter rather than see her return to slavery. In her plot, the murdered child returns to haunt a black community, suggesting the inescapable taint of America’s history.Evelyn Waugh bottles the intoxicating vapour of a vanished era in this novel about middle-class Charles Ryder, who meets upper-class Sebastian Flyte at Oxford University in the 1920s. Scrap the wartime prologue, and Charles’s entire relationship with Sebastian’s sister Julia (Dear Evelyn, thank you for your latest manuscript, a few suggested cuts…) and you’re looking at one of the most affecting love affairs in the English language. You can almost feel your mouth dry with thirst as you enter the world of Frank Herbert’s Dune and encounter the desert planet of Arrakis, with its giant sandworms and mind-altering spice. It’s the setting for an epic saga of warring feudal houses, but it’s as much eco-parable as thrilling adventure story. Rarely has a fictional world been so completely realised.Will there ever be a novel that burns with more passionate intensity than Wuthering Heights? The forces that bring together its fierce heroine Catherine Earnshaw and cruel hero Heathcliff are violent and untameable, yet rooted in a childhood devotion to one another, when Heathcliff obeyed Cathy’s every command. It’s impossible to imagine this novel ever provoking quiet slumbers Emily Bronte’s vision of nature blazes with poetry.The savage reviews that greeted F Scott Fitzgerald’s third novel – “no more than a glorified anecdote” “for the season only” – failed to recognise something truly great a near-perfect distillation of the hope, ambition, cynicism and desire at the heart of the American Dream. Other novels capture the allure of the invented self, from Stendhal’s The Red and the Black to Thomas Mann’s Confessions of Felix Krull, but Fitzgerald’s enigmatic Jay Gatsby casts a shadow that reaches to Mad Men’s Don Draper and beyond. From the moment we meet Alex and his three droogs in the Korova milkbar, drinking moloko with vellocet or synthemesc and wondering whether to chat up the devotchkas at the counter or tolchock some old veck in an alley, it’s clear that normal novelistic conventions do not apply. Anthony Burgess’s slim volume about a violent near-future where aversion therapy is used on feral youth who speak Nadsat and commit rape and murder, is a dystopian masterpiece.Banned from entering the UK in its year of publication, 1955, Vladimir Nabokov’s astonishingly skilful and enduringly controversial work of fiction introduces us to literary professor and self-confessed hebephile Humbert Humbert, the perhaps unreliable narrator of the novel. He marries widow Charlotte Haze only to get access to her daughter, 12-year-old Dolores, nicknamed Lo by her mother, or as Humbert calls her “Lolita, light of my life, fire of my loins. My sin, my soul.” Cloaking his abuse in the allusive language of idealised love does not lessen Humbert’s crimes, but allows Nabokov to skewer him where he hides.2740 Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Philip K DickHere be Roy Baty, Rick Deckard and Rachael Rosen – the novel that inspired Blade Runner is stranger even than the film it became. Back in an age before artificial intelligence could teach itself to play chess in a few hours better than any grandmaster that ever lived, Philip K Dick was using the concept of android life to explore what it meant to be human, and what it is to be left behind on a compromised planet. That he could do it in 250 pages that set the mind spinning and engage the emotions with every page-turn make this a rare science-fiction indeed.2840 Heart of Darkness, Joseph ConradInspired by Conrad’s own experiences of captaining a trading steamer up the Congo River, Heart of Darkness is part adventure, part psychological voyage into the unknown, as the narrator Marlow relays the story of his journey into the jungle to meet the mysterious ivory trader Mr Kurtz. Although debate continues to rage about whether the novel and its attitude to Africa and colonialism is racist, it’s deeply involving and demands to be read.Whatever passed between Irish theatre manager Bram Stoker and the Hungarian traveller and writer Ármin Vámbéry when they met in London and talked of the Carpathian Mountains, it incubated in the Gothic imagination of Stoker into a work that has had an incalculable influence on Western culture. It’s not hard to read the Count as a shadowy sexual figure surprising straitlaced Victorian England in their beds, but in Stoker’s hands he’s also bloody creepy.3040 The Catcher in the Rye, J D SalingerIt only takes one sentence, written in the first person, for Salinger’s Holden Caulfield to announce himself in all his teenage nihilism, sneering at you for wanting to know his biographical details “and all that David Copperfield kind of crap”. The Catcher in the Rye is the quintessential novel of the adolescent experience, captured in deathless prose.Dashiel Hammett may have been harder boiled, his plots more intricate but, wow, does Raymond Chandler have style. The push and pull at the start of The Big Sleep between private detective Philip Marlowe, in his powder-blue suit and dark blue shirt, and Miss Carmen Sternwood, with her “little sharp predatory teeth” and lashes that she lowers and raises like a theatre curtain, sets the tone for a story of bad girls and bad men.All the teeming life of 19th century London is here in Thackeray’s masterpiece, right down to the curry houses frequented by Jos Sedley, who has gained a taste for the hot stuff as an officer in the East India Trading Company. But it is Becky Sharp, one of literature’s great characters, who gives this novel its enduring fascination. As a woman on the make, Becky is the perfect blend of wit, cunning and cold-hearted ruthlessness. Try as film and TV might to humanise and make excuses for her, Becky needs victims to thrive! And she’s all the more compelling for that. The only novel written by the poet Sylvia Plath is a semi-autobiographical account of a descent into depression that the book’s narrator Esther Greenwood describes as like being trapped under a bell jar – used to create a vacuum in scientific experiments – struggling to breathe. Almost every word is arresting, and the way that Plath captures the vivid life happening around Esther, news events, magazine parties, accentuates the deadening illness that drives her towards suicidal feelings. Plath herself would commit suicide one month after the novel’s publication in 1963.3440 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Roald DahlHarry Potter may be more popular, but Willy Wonka is altogether weirder. From the overwhelming poverty experienced by Charlie Bucket and his family, to the spoilt, greedy, brattish children who join Charlie on his trip to Willy Wonka’s phantasmagorical sweet factory there is nothing artificially sweetened in Roald Dahl’s startling work of fantasy. Andrew Davies’s recent TV adaptation of War and Peace reminded those of us who can’t quite face returning to the novel’s monstrous demands just how brilliantly Tolstoy delineates affairs of the heart, even if the war passages will always be a struggle. In Anna Karenina – enormous, too! –the great Russian novelist captures the erotic charge between the married Anna and the bachelor Vronsky, then drags his heroine through society’s scorn as their affair takes shape, without ever suggesting we move from her side. The most deliciously wicked experience in literature, this epistolary novel introduces us to the Marquise de Merteuil and Vicomte de Valmont, who play cruel games of sexual conquest on their unwitting victims. The Marquise’s justification for her behaviour – “I, who was born to revenge my sex and master yours” – will strike a chord in the #metoo era, but emotions, even love, intrude, to the point where Laclos’s amorality becomes untenable. Sexy but very, very bad. 3740 100 Years of Solitude, Gabriel Garcia MarquezThe energy and enchantment of Garcia Marquez’s story of seven generations of the Buendia family in a small town in Colombia continue to enthrall half a century on. Hauntings and premonitions allied to a journalistic eye for detail and a poetic sensibility make Marquez’s magical realism unique.“Someone must have been telling lies about Josef K…” So begins Kafka’s nightmarish tale of a man trapped in an unfathomable bureaucratic process after being arrested by two agents from an unidentified office for a crime they’re not allowed to tell him about. Foreshadowing the antisemitism of Nazi-occupied Europe, as well as the methods of the Stasi, KGB, and StB, it’s an unsettling, at times bewildering, tale with chilling resonance.The second Mrs de Winter is the narrator of Du Maurier’s marvellously gothic tale about a young woman who replaces the deceased Rebecca as wife to the wealthy Maxim de Winter and mistress of the Manderley estate. There she meets the housekeeper Mrs Danvers, formerly devoted to Rebecca, who proceeds to torment her. As atmospheric, psychological horror it just gets darker and darker. Published posthumously in 1958, Tomasi di Lampedusa’s novel is set in 19th century Sicily, where revolution is in the air. The imposing Prince Don Fabrizio presides over a town close to Palermo during the last days of an old world in which class stratifications are stable and understood. Garibaldi’s forces have taken the island and a new world will follow. It’s a deep and poetic meditation on political change and the characters that it produces.140 Pride and Prejudice, Jane AustenIt is a fact universally acknowledged that every list of great books must include Pride and Prejudice. Don’t be fooled by the bonnets and balls: beneath the sugary surface is a tart exposé of the marriage market in Georgian England.

For nearly twenty years I wanted to use it as the title of something... It was a traditional trope, and it asked to entitle a work which combined a concern with tradition and a bizarre technique.”Netflix to adapt classic novel One Hundred Years of SolitudeThe 40 best books to read before you dieBurgess also used the work to address the several controversies surrounding Stanley Kubrick’s 1971 film adaptation of the novel. The movie, which starred Malcolm McDowell as the violence-obsessed Alex, was banned by local UK councils after being blamed for inspiring copycat crimes.The news arrives ahead of the launch of a major Stanley Kubrick exhibition at the Design Museum in London, which will include material from the film.Professor Andrew Biswell, director of the International Anthony Burgess Foundation, said: “This remarkable unpublished sequel to A Clockwork Orange sheds new light on Burgess, Kubrick and the controversy surrounding the notorious novel.“The Clockwork Condition provides a context for Burgess\u0027s most famous work, and amplifies his views on crime, punishment and the possible corrupting effects of visual culture.”The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Spike Lee\u0027s Clockers saw one of the director\u0027s most disappointing performances at the box office, taking just $13m from a $25m budget.Peter Berg\u0027s real-life drama fell more than $30m short of its $156m budget, a shame considering it\u0027s one of the Friday Night Lights creator\u0027s best films to date.Donnie Darko grossed just over $7.5m worldwide on a budget of $4.5m, not helped by its marketing campaign featuring a plane crash weeks before 911.Upon release, this cult horror was a commercial and critical failure, grossing $26.7m on a $60m production budget.There was something of a controversy surrounding David Fincher\u0027s Fight Club, which aided in making a modest profit of just under $40m at the box office. It\u0027s opening run, though, was markedly underwhelming.While far from being a catastrophic flop, The Good Dinosaur struggled to reach the heights of other Pixar releases. The film grossed $332m worldwide against a $175m budget.This entertaining 1990s thriller had such poor box office takings in the US, it was released straight-to-DVD in other countries, including the UK.Michael Cimino\u0027s drama is notable for being one of the biggest box office bombs of its time, losing the studio an estimated $37m (over $114 million when adjusted for inflation).Martin Scorsese\u0027s charming family film was a commercial failure, grossing just $185m against its $150–$170m budget.While acclaimed by critics, Michael Mann\u0027s drama – starring Al Pacino and Russell Crowe – never made back its $68m budget.Despite being one of the best animated films of all time, The Iron Giant was a victim of Warner Bros scepticism towards the genre after the failure of previous effort, Quest for Camelot. Future Pixar director Brad Bird\u0027s film made $31.3m worldwide against a budget of $70–80m.While not a major flop, the classic underperformed at the Christmas box office due to stiff competition from other big films.Elaine May\u0027s maligned comedy, which is being reassessed with every passing year, became a notorious failure at the box office.2335 The King of Comedy (1982)Although Scorsese\u0027s drama was well-received by critics, it bombed at the box office. Lead Robert De Niro said that the film maybe wasn\u0027t so well received because it gave off an aura of something that people didn\u0027t want to look at or know.This unfairly maligned Disney release was a box office bomb, grossing only $260.5m worldwide against an estimated $225–250m production budget and an additional $150m in marketing costs.2535 Man on the Moon (1999)This Jim Carrey film from Milos Forman cost Universal a lot of money after it failed to make back its $52-82m budget.While making its money back, polarising reviews meat that Darren Aronofsky\u0027s psychological horror settled for a $14m profit.It\u0027s considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, but David Lynch\u0027s head-scratcher failed to make back its $20m budget.Despite positive reviews from critics, this spoof grossed just $9m, failing to meet its budget of $20m.  2935 Scott Pilgrim vs the World (2010)Edgar Wright\u0027s beloved cult was a box office bomb, grossing $47.7m against its production budget of $85–90m.This Stephen King adaptation was a box office disappointment, earning only $16m during its initial theatrical run. It would later get re-released and earn $58.3m.This fun action film starring Clive Owen recouped far less than its $39m budget.This Oscar-nominated noir didn\u0027t meet its budget despite sitting at a paltry $17m.It wasn\u0027t until its home entertainment release that this mockumentary became the beloved classic it is today. 3435 Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets (2017)Valerian grossed $225m worldwide, but due to its high production and advertising costs, it was considered a commercial failure.3535 Willy Wonka \u0026amp the Chocolate Factory (1971)This beloved Roald Dahl adaptation starring Gene Wilder made just a $1m profit upon its original release in 1971.135 Children of Men (2006)While it\u0027s now revered as one of the best films of the 21st century, Alfonso Cuarón\u0027s dystopian thriller failed to make its money back at the box office at its time of release in 2006.235 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen (1988)This Robin Williams comedy grossed just $8m against its $46m budget, losing the studio a staggering $38m.Ali opened in the US on Christmas Day, 2001, and grossed a total of $87.7m worldwide – and still lost an estimated $63.1m.435 The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007)Andrew Dominik\u0027s lyrical western only just made back half of its $30m budget in 2007, but found love upon its release on DVD.Despite starring Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron, this drama was a certified bomb at the box office, making a total of $19.6m from a $75m budget.Steven Spielberg\u0027s Roald Dahl adaptation grossed just $183m against its $140m budget – a low profit by Disney\u0027s standards.Michael Mann\u0027s cyber thriller was a box office bomb, earning only $19.7m at the box office against a budget of $70m.Just like Ridley Scott\u0027s original flopped, this lengthy sequel from Denis Villeneuve grossed just $259m worldwide and is considered a flop.This Orson Welles film may be a beloved classic, but at the time release, it failed to recoup its costs at the box office.

Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature, writes Erica WickersonClick to followThe IndependentLove Means Love: Cordelia visits her ailing father King Lear, who feels ashamed of falling for the £350m-a-week promises made by his elder daughtersThe chaos of politics, the searing isions through society, the promised demise of faith in democracy: it might look like the country is in an unprecedented state of strife and upheaval over Brexit. But writers have been talking about this stuff for centuries.King Lear’s shuffle into dementia as he tears apart his kingdom on a vain whim. Dickens’s revolutionary bloodshed in A Tale of Two Cities conjuring tensions within and across borders. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman challenging the imperialist march of the Nazis in Casablanca. How does culture sort out the bloody mess of social, political\u0026nbspand geographical isions? Politicians and bureaucrats don’t have the answer. The man down the pub doesn’t have the answer. So maybe it’s time we look to literature.Ali Smith’s Autumn – the first in her seasonal quartet (the third in the cycle, Spring, has just come out) – is perhaps the first “Brexit novel” (what a terrifying label!), written in the immediate wake of the 2016 referendum. Its opening lines wave to Dickens: “It was the worst of times, it was the worst of times.” Too right, Ali. “That’s the thing about things. They fall apart, always have, always will.” Here a nod to Yeats’s A Second Coming. Yeats, Smith, Dickens, Shakespeare: they’re all rife with images of separation, objects torn asunder. Yeats writes:Things fall apart the centre cannot holdAll too apt for today. In last year’s National Theatre production, Ian McKellen’s King Lear actually tears up the map of his kingdom in a haphazard, manically whimsical way. Dickens’s evocation of “Madame La Guillotine”, sensuously and seductively worshipped by the revolutionaries in A Tale of Two Cities, replacing crucifixes and covering the streets with blood, is an object that literally and metaphorically separates. And this is a thread taken up by Smith in the literary descriptions of collage art scattered across Autumn: beautiful and haphazard like fallen leaves, but also artistically juxtaposing separation and difference.Created with Sketch.The 25 best books by women Show all 25Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire. Pride and Prejudice, then, sees her at the peak of her powers. Through the eyes of Elizabeth Bennet, her sharp-witted protagonist, we witness upper-class Regency England as both a dream and a farce. Not all is as it seems, and society betrays its holloweness when it deems that money should trump love. Despite the fact that Hurston was a key figure in the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s and 1930s, Their Eyes Were Watching God was largely rejected by her peers. It was during the 1970s and 1980s that her novel was essentially rediscovered, with many contemporary black feminists heralding the genius of her work. The novel focuses on Janie Crawford, a black woman who refuses to give in to bitterness or sorrow, as she navigates three marriages and a life marked by poverty. It’s a story bursting with passion and soulfulness. 325 The Lottery and Other Stories – Shirley Jackson Jackson probed the darkest corners of the American psyche during the 1940s and 1950s, all thanks to her collections of ghost stories, including 1959’s The Haunting of Hill House, which was recently adapted into a Netflix series. With several novels and over 200 short stories for readers to get lost in, there are very few horror writers like her. That’s especially true when it comes to (arguably) her greatest work, 1948’s The Lottery, which traces a small town’s annual tradition to its sinister conclusion. A Pulitzer Prize winner, To Kill a Mockingbird has carved its place in history. Its depiction of racial injustice in the American Deep South was startling frank for the 1960s, in a way that undeniably had a social impact at the time – it became an instant sensation and is now widely taught in American schools. Lee writes about the world’s cruelties with an honesty and compassion that still resonates, with the character of Atticus Finch becoming a enduring model of integrity for the legal profession. Butler was a key figure in sci-fi history, expanding the boundaries of what the genre could achieve and what it could come to represent. First published in 1979, the book still feels as fresh as ever in its first-person account of a young black writer, Dana, who through strange circumstances, finds herself travelling between her own reality and a pre-Civil War Maryland plantation. It’s through this unusual theme that Butler can explore the lasting trauma of America’s history on African-Americans today. Jane Eyre feels, in many ways, thoroughly modern today. Although originally published under the pen name “Currer Bell”, it feels likes a e into the mind of Brontë herself. The story is told through a first-person narrative that feels so psychologically intimate, it’s as if she’s sharing the secrets of her own world with us. We follow Jane through her school years, all the way to her later employment by Mr Rochester, a tortured soul who she falls madly in love with, with many aspects of her journey reflecting elements of Brontë’s own life. 725 Half of a Yellow Sun – Chimamanda Ngozi AdichieAdichie, who was born in Nigeria, is considered one of the most original literary voices of her generation. You can see why this is when reading Half of a Yellow Sun, which depicts the brutality of the Nigerian Civil War of the late 1960s, as seen through four different perspectives: twin daughters of a wealthy businessman, a British citizen, a professor, and a houseboy. It’s history via an achingly human lens. Smith remains a modern titan of the British literary scene, thanks partially to White Teeth, which is considered one of the most sensational fiction debuts of all time, becoming an immediate bestseller and sweeping up multiple awards. It’s a tale of two men – Bangladeshi Samad Iqbal and Englishman Archie Jones – who become friends after being stationed together during WWII. Their return to London sees the book examine British post-war attitudes to those from formerly colonised countries, although Smith ensures the subject is approached with both heart and a sense of humour. 925 The Hour of the Star - Clarice LispectorLispector was a literary innovator. The Hour of the Star, published posthumously in 1977, invents a narrator named Rodrigo SM, who in turns tells the story of Macabéa, a poor young woman who hails from Alagoas, where Lispector’s family first settled when they immigrated to Brazil. However, the way Rodrigo perceives Macabéa, and reckons with her story, itself creates a dialogue between the two characters, calling into question notions of identity and authorship. One of literature’s sharpest minds and inspiration to the feminist movement in the 1970s, Woolf not only helped pioneer the use of the stream of consciousness as a narrative device, but utilised it to speak openly about sexuality, mental illness, and gender roles. The novel largely follows the inner thoughts of two characters, Clarissa Dalloway and Septimus Smith, one a high-society woman in post-WWI England and the other a veteran suffering from shell shock. 1125 A Good Man Is Hard to Find and Other Stories – Flannery O’Connor O’Connor wrote hard stories for a hard world. Her unsentimental, sardonic use of the Southern Gothic style helped weave her own take on the parable, in which the morally weak often face violent, painful punishment for their misdeeds. That said, the door is always open for transformation and spiritual awakening by the story’s conclusion, with her work frequently confronting ideas of morality and ethics through the lens of her own Catholic faith. At times, it seems less like Persepolis is a story. Satrapi’s graphic novel, published in two volumes in 2000 and 2004, feels more like an invitation, as she takes our hand and leads us through her childhood and early adult years, so that we can see through the eyes of a curious, funny, smart young girl who must face the personal repercussions of war and religious extremism in Iran during and after the Islamic Revolution. It’s the political seen through the personal, but it’s always Satrapi’s own spirit that shines the brightest. Many have now come to consider Shelley’s Frankenstein as the first pure work of science-fiction, with a central narrative driven a character’s exploration of a world beyond what we already know. Not only is it significant for its later influence on culture, but Shelley’s work, initially published anonymously, is astonishing in both its emotional vitality and its philosophical implications. It’s a work where we both feel the anguish of the misunderstood, while also reckoning with the concept of man’s unbridled power. Beloved takes its inspiration from the true story of Margaret Garner, who escaped slavery in Kentucky in 1856 and fled to Ohio, a free state. However, the story itself focuses on a protagonist named Sethe, a former slave, whose home is haunted by a malevolent presence that she believes is her eldest daughter. It’s through this vivid sense of magical realism that Morrison can confront the unfathomable trauma that slavery has inflicted on the African-American collective memory.Although the book has received increased attention thanks to Hulu’s critically acclaimed TV adaptation, it’s all thanks to the fierceness of Atwood’s critical analysis of gender politics. Her 1985 book, which imagines a near-future New England controlled by a totalitarian state, in which women are completely subjugated to men, has only become increasingly relevant – and prescient. Her work provides a continued reminder that it doesn’t take much for our world to slip into complete dystopia. Mary Anne Evans, amongst other concerns, feared that her work, Middlemarch, would be dismissed entirely due to the notion that women’s writing was strictly light and romantic. And so, instead, it was published in eight instalments across 1871 and 1872 under the name George Eliot. The book is far from light set in the fictitious Midlands town of Middlemarch, it follows a vast, sweeping narrative that encompasses subjects of religion, idealism, and political reform. Ng writes about American suburbia with an astounding clarity, perhaps partially because she considers the act of writing about one’s hometown as a little like “writing about a relative”, with an attachment that perceives both their greatest attributes and their flaws. Little Fires Everywhere is her second novel to take place in Shaker Heights, Ohio, where she grew up, and focuses on a new arrival to the town, who sense of mystery disrupts its residents’s obsession with structure and rules. Famous for its popularity with teenage girls, Plath’s work speaks to clearly to an adolescent precisely because it makes no attempt to sugar-coat the prospect of the entrance into adulthood. The book’s protagonist, Esther, a young woman attempting to establish herself in New York, feels more like a front for Plath to discuss her own experiences of struggling with mental health, especially in the context of the 1950s, when women’s concerns were so rarely paid attention to. There is an honesty to Esther’s frustration that has been a comfort to many. My Brilliant Friend is only one part of Ferrante’s four-book series, known as the Neapolitan Novels. As the first chapter, it is, de facto, the most well known of the series, but it’s also an invitation to such raw intimacy that readers will be unable to resist delving into the rest. Ferrante serves as a pseudonym, allowing the books to illuminate with candor the friendship between two women, born in Naples in 1944, who try to find peace in a world of violence and misogyny. 2025 The Age of Innocence – Edith Wharton Edith Wharton captures with vigour both the opulence and the suffocating claustrophobia of New York’s Gilded Age, as two future newlyweds – in every other way society’s perfect vision of man and woman – find their union disrupted by the arrival of a cousin shrouded in scandal. The Age of Innocence is a wistful, romantic novel that still succeeds in treating society’s hypocrisy with an acute sense of disdain. Marking a rare mastery of the epistolary novel, The Color Purple focuses on the experiences of black women living in the US South during the 1930s. Although it deals with themes of abuse and violence, the honesty in Walker’s voice is disarming in a way that opens us up to her protagonist’s journey towards self-realisation and personal freedom. It’s no wonder that the book’s continued relevance saw it both adapted into 1985 film, directed by Steven Spielberg, and a Broadway musical. Rebecca remains one the finest examples of Gothic literature, despite the fact that du Maurier wasn’t writing within the confines of some drafty Victorian castle rather, she was examining the world of spirits during the interwar period. In its story of a woman whose whirlwind courtship with a widower turns sour when she becomes haunted by the lingering presence of her husband’s first wife, Rebecca is a book filled with suppressed desires, loss, and a looming sense of threat. 2325 The God of Small Things - Arundhati RoyAs Roy’s debut novel, it’s an extraordinary first outing. Roy contrasts the innocence of childhood, as seen in the book’s protagonists, fraternal twins Rahel and Estha, with the rising political turmoil in Kerala during 1969. It also features a non-sequential approach to narrative, with the novel intricately weaving between the twins’s reunion in 1993 and the lengthy flashback and sidetracks, all painted with a massive sense of scope and imagination. 2425 Murder on the Orient Express - Agatha ChristieWe may know every twist and turn of Christie’s best works by now, but there’s still a frisson to how intricately and confidently she pulls the rug from underneath readers. Murder on the Orient Express still feels like her most enthralling work, as famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot finds himself in the midst of a murder scene, after his train is blocked by the heavy snowfall and a passenger is found dead, making the rest of those on board all instant suspects. 2525 The Tale of Genji – Murasaki ShikibuThe oldest book on this list, this classic of Japanese literature was written by Shikibu, a noblewoman and lady-in-waiting, in the early 11th century. Although the original manuscript no longer exists, what’s been passed down to us now was translated initially into modern Japanese, with English translations being published at a later time. An account of the life Hikaru Genji, the son of the emperor, it’s a masterful work of psychological portraiture, which offers a rare glimpse into the cultural customs of post-classical Japan.125 Pride and Prejudice – Jane AustenAusten remains one of history’s greatest masters in two tricky literary fields: the world of romance and the world of social satire.

Politics. Class. Nationality. Age. A Brexit checklist.There is a widely held perception that it was the baby boomers who swung the 2016 referendum in favour of Leave, the older generation who have a lot less to lose. This generational ide reverberates through cultural depictions of ided nations too.Brexit: The Uncivil War review – an engrossing second draft of historyShakespeare’s King Lear is a play about madness and politics, shown through the failings of a father. Lear decides to bequeath his three daughters different portions of his kingdom according to how much they love him or rather, how convincingly they can express their love for him. Literature is all about conflict. So perhaps it’s unsurprising that not all of Lear’s daughters go along with this display of pride and vanity.The first two, Goneril and Regan, egged on by their greedy husbands, eagerly flatter their father. But when it comes to the third, Cordelia – the youngest and the favourite – the voice of reason prevails. She tells her father that she loves him just as much as a dutiful daughter should but that there’s no need to flatter his delusion of a good Brexit deal. Ahem. The need for a healthy sized dowry with which she can attract a good husband.King Lear is so convinced of his worth and his children’s performance of love for him, that he makes the biggest booboo possible just as he’s on the decline: he chops up his kingdom and pisses off his loved ones. The UK is so convinced of Europe’s desperation to be friends, we’ve made the booboo of expecting an Ali Baba Cave of Wonders with the Brexit deal. And it’s about as realistic an expectation as Ali Baba’s treasure.A Tale of Two Cities\u0026nbspis in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across bordersA Tale of Two Cities is also, in effect, about politics and madness, and how the shadows of the older generation linger over the young. It’s set during the reign of terror, late\u0026nbsp18th century Paris and London, the French Revolution. And this period is conjured through the twisted fate of a father, daughter, and two men who bear a striking physical resemblance to one another but are diametrically opposed in character. Like Shakespeare, Dickens also shows the father being cause of his beloved daughter’s despair, but, in his case, it is unwitting. It is the father’s accidental testimony that ultimately leads to the death sentence for his son-in-law, Charles Darnay.Ali Smith’s Autumn is a quiet elegy to a Europe in demise, and the condemned, precarious young who have to watch it falter. It effectively picks up the ShakespeareanDickensian tale from the perspective of the daughter. The protagonist, Elisabeth Demand: 32 years old, no-fixed-hours casual contract junior lecturer at a university in London, living the dream, her mother says, and she is, if the dream means having no job security and almost everything being too expensive to do and that you’re still in the same rented flat you had when you were a student over a decade ago.Stryver at Tellson’s Bank, from a scene in ‘A Tale of Two Cities’\u0026nbsp(Getty)In many ways, she epitomises a generation, or at least part of it.\u0026nbspElisabeth loves and desperately clings to her dying friend, the 101-year-old former émigré, Daniel Gluck – the personification of a disappearing Europe, a cultured, sensitive, intelligent man, full of possibility and mystery. By contrast, Elisabeth has a strained relationship with her mother – a woman more interested in going to the pub than getting to know her neighbours.These stories show the fuck-ups of the older generation condemning the young to a life of lost possibility – the lost possibility to travel, to live, to love as we want.But it was also overwhelmingly the case that non-graduates were far more likely to vote to leave the EU than those with degrees. And this brings up the question of class and privilege.At the heart of A Tale of Two Cities is a raging class war, a class war of caricatured evil. The Marquis St\u0026nbspEvrémonde, the aristocrat who needs no fewer than four servants to prepare his morning hot chocolate while people starve in the streets, speeds through Paris in his voluptuous carriage and hits a small child, killing him instantly. He insults the crowd, calls them dogs, curses them for delaying him and not taking better care of their children. Then he goes on his way, barely ruffled. In this climate, the bloodthirsty rising of the proletariat seems to have a pretty strong justification.A Tale of Two Cities is in part about control: who is in charge? Who sets the law? But it isn’t just a battle within France, it’s also across borders. One of the factors that damns the hero, Charles Darnay, is his decision to live in exile in England. He explains this as an economic immigration: in France, he has no means to live.A Tale of Two Cities and its modernised re-telling in Casablanca both resolve the turgid concoction of political and romantic tensions (semi-spoiler alert) through acts of self-sacrifice. One person trades places with another. We see this kind of doubling in King Lear too with the half-brothers Edmund and Edgar, alike in name but polar opposites in character. And, much like Harry Potter and Voldemort (a DickensianShakespearean echo?), it seems that in each of these pairs, one must die so that the other may live.King Lear\u0026nbspshows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?)This isn’t really a satisfactory solution to today’s problems. There isn’t the possibility of some kind of self-sacrifice that will ensure continued life in another sense. Maybe a soft Brexit looks like that: a Brexit in name but with all the benefits of the customs union and free movement. But it now seems inevitable that the country is going to be fundamentally ided no matter what the political developments may yield.But it’s worth remembering that all of these works are also basically love stories – though not necessarily about conventional, romantic love.King Lear shows all too tragically how the public performance of affection is prized over the genuine and sincere feeling of love (and what is the Brexit game if not a monstrous public performance of who has what to offer?).\u0026nbspA Tale of Two Cities shows an impossible love triangle between upstanding French émigrés and disaffected, drunken Brits that cannot end happily. There aren’t enough visas for all the protagonists to escape France, so who will make it out?Casablanca is a classic romance that transcends geographical borders. As Ilse (Ingrid Bergman) looks into Rick’s (Humphrey Bogart’s) eyes and tells him she can never leave him again, but she does need the two blank visas that will enable escape from Casablanca and the Nazis, the tears feel real, the kiss feels passionate, the violins soar. Later, Rick sees this moment in a different light. He suggests it was a way of manipulating him into aiding the escape.Bros)And so, we go back to King Lear. His elder daughters make eloquent expressions of their love for him, but it’s clear to everyone other than Lear himself that these are opportunistic overtures with one thing in mind: hope for geographical reign and economic power.The problem for the UK is that the EU isn’t as senile and blinded by vanity as Lear, nor as romantically sentimental as Bogart’s Rick or Dickens’s Sydney Carton. Expressions of love won’t get us through passport control any faster in the post-Brexit world.So what does Ali Smith’s Autumn suggest? Unlike Edgar and Edmund in King Lear, Charles and Sydney in A Tale of Two Cities, Rick and Laszlo in Casablanca, there is no straightforward doubling in Smith’s Autumn. But perhaps that’s part of the point. Elisabeth and Daniel are opposites in many respects. And yet they are drawn together in a touching, benevolent, platonic bond.The 25 best books written by womenThere’s a problem with the way we idolise drunk male writersThe most powerful lines of poetry ever writtenConservatives and Labour reveal plans for key Brexit votes- liveCummings found in contempt of parliament over ‘fake news’ inquiryIn Autumn, the man in the post office, a frustratingly unhelpful clerk positively filibustering Elisabeth’s attempts to do the “Check \u0026amp Send” service to renew her passport (all a huge great metonym for anxieties about identity, nationality, freedom to travel, etc), sees Elisabeth as many of this generation are seen: demanding like her name.“Is your surname really Demand? he says.Uh huh, Elisabeth says. I mean yes.A name you live up to, he says.”The contrasting way of seeing things is a point worth pondering in the light of Brexit and the fog of politics. In Casablanca, Laszlo and Rick are both in love with Ilse. But they see her in very different ways. When she tries to explain herself, her past, her motives to each of them in turn, she is confronted with totally contrasting responses. Laszlo: “You don’t even have to say it. I’ll believe.”\u0026nbspCompare with Rick: “I wouldn’t believe you, no matter what you told me. You’d say anything now to get what you want.”Isn’t this really how most of us feel about politicians? They represent these dualisms. And nothing epitomises this quite like the Brexit debate. People choose their side then believe all or nothing, depending on who’s talking. £350m\u0026nbspfor the NHS. Whether or not it was true seemed to depend more on the listener than the facts.In reality, there is no possibility for self-sacrifice or a deus ex machina to sort out the cataclysmic mess of parliament, Brexit\u0026nbspand national ision. The older stories, Shakespeare and Dickens, are tragedies. Someone has to die. Casablanca is more open, though still pretty heart-wrenching. Remember the famous closing line: “I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship”. And maybe Ali Smith picks up where Casablanca leaves off. A beautiful friendship. But the ending is left open. This is where we are now. Watching our relationship with Europe die. But at the end of Autumn, Europe’s personification rallies, he wakes up, asks what Elisabeth is reading, smiles. There is still time.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is. It\u0027s where it is\u0027 and this long clawed Squat lobster is in a perfect position to make a memorable image. The author, instead of \u0027blasting\u0027 it with light, has gone in the opposite direction by restricting the strobe into a snooted spotlight in order to illuminate just the features of the lobster and the dainty sea loch anemones. It\u0027s an example of \u0027Isolation lighting\u0027 at its very best. A great deal of uw photographers invest their time in what they want to illuminate. This is an example which in my opinion illustrates features that they do not want to illuminate, hence the punchy black background and the soft delicate hues of dark sand, facial features topped off by the sea loch anemones. - Martin Edge (Judge)What a chin, what a forehead, what a character. This picture has portrait written all over it, and such a fascinating species ideally suited to this close focus wide angle approach. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Marine Conservation. The problems of plastic pollution and ghost fishing are both illustrated by this struggling loggerhead turtle. I am happy to learn this inidual was lucky enough to survive this deathtrap thanks to the photographer - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Behaviour and overall winner. I worry that this image will refuel the public\u0027s imbalanced perception of sharks but as an image capturing behaviour it has drama, adrenaline, grace, beauty and finality. That\u0027s a very rare combination in one image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Winner: Portrait. Superb impact from the very first moment it was presented. Perfect composition within the image frame and the understated colours. To top it off the authors comments above say it all... a Smiling Happy Angel\u0027s Face. One of my favourites from the entire competition. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Winner: Up \u0026amp Coming. Beautiful split shot with both a perfect under and over split. A very strong favourite with all the judges and one of the best examples I have seen of this type of image for some time. Just Superb! - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: Wide Angle. The first moment I viewed this image I knew it would be a strong contender. For me it\u0027s the symmetry of the Humpback and the balance between the er and calf. Everything about it is in perfect alignment. The shape of the tail in relation to the four corners of the frame, not to mention the position of the free er and calf. Superb imagery at its very best.  Many congratulations Francois. - Martin Edge (Judge)    Winner: Black \u0026amp White. It must be 11 out of 10 for this groundbreaking image. Conception, interpretation and perseverance coupled with black and white’s ability to concentrate on the key elements. It gets better with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Grey seals are a perennial favourite in UPY as one of the UK\u0027s star wildlife attractions. This upside-down portrait is quirky and cute and easily won the affections of the judging panel. Great to see an overseas photographer coming to the UK to show us how it\u0027s done! - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: Compact. This image was a very popular choice between the panel. Ideal for a split rendition. What makes this a winner for me, not withstanding the double exposure is the sympathetic balance of light \u0026amp colour connected  between the top half and bottom of the image frame. - Martin Edge (Judge)Winner: British Waters Compact. Does British ing get any better than a fun encounter with a grey seal pup? This youngster’s relaxed and curious face is captured perfectly by Martin, making us all want to be there too. - Alex Mustard (Judge)Winner: British Waters Living Together. Images tell stories but well thought out and executed ones speak volumes. This is such an example which feeds the eye with tales of the seaside on summer days, lively marine spectacles and excited human interaction. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: Macro. Fabio’s use of long exposure and panning has turned a classic portrait of a Sepiola into an unforgettable one. The sharp and ghosted images of the bobtail squid balance pleasingly in the frame and combined with the outstretched tentacles give the feeling of the cephalopod lunging for its prey. An innovative and most deserving category winner. - Alex Mustard (Judge) 1445 Isles of Scilly, UKWinner: British Waters Wide Angle. Photographers often feel competition shots must be packed with new tricks to win. At UPY we always appreciate classic technique when it raises the bar of what has been done before. Rob\u0027s full technicolour wide angle scenic reveals the richness of UK seas with an elegant simplicity that is incredibly challenging to pull off in British conditions. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Winner: Wrecks. So simple yet so powerful the additional lighting of the turret and the main er perfectly positioned. This was a very strong category this year with a deserved winner and it\u0027s refreshing to read the acknowledgement to Leigh Bishop\u0027s pioneering work. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) The iconic silhouette of a seahorse is a graphically powerful picture. Here Zarina has raised that to another level with the addition of a red filter to her snooted strobe, reminiscent of a rim-lit animal at sunset. - Alex Mustard (Judge) All the judges found this to be probably the most distressing image to view but its uncompromising message must be seen by as many people as possible. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)As a subject we have seen our fair share of these colourful characters but this one shone through and the eggs almost look as if they have been inidually lit! - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Superb image with a perfect line across the split. Good exposure both above and below the water line and such an ideal subject to cap it all off. Excellent work. - Martin Edge (Judge)This is an excellent example for this category. It takes a tried and trusted angle but completely lifts it by using the fabric. It becomes more than an image a concept, a transition, a rebirth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)2145 Isles of Scilly, UKThis image stood out on many levels. Composition, colour vibrancy and contrast combined with an unusual angle kept us coming back to it and helped it rise in the rankings with each viewing. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Perfect control of angle, light and focus. This was always up there with all of the judges. A clear favourite just like Nick Park’s genius creations. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I\u0027ve seen many images of eel and shrimp around Indonesia, however you have taken this two steps forward. 1) With your excellent idea to snoot the eye and 2) with your backlight on the shrimp. You can expect many photographers to practice your technique in the months to come. Congratulations for your vision. Very well thought out and executed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It’s not what you’ve got, it’s what you do with it. The split may have been elusive but well worth the effort. This is a deceptively subtle excellent delivery. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)I have witnessed this behaviour from the surface with its high velocity \u0027testosterone and tonnage\u0027 and I remember thinking how happy I was to be in the boat. To have the presence of mind to time this shot whilst one\u0027s senses are being bombarded is heroic in my view. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) What an amazing moment. From the expression on the face of the unicornfish fleeing for its life, to the hunting pack of sharks, especially the leader with its mouth snapping open that fan out diagonally across this composition. And that is without considering what a great challenge it is to shoot these images of split second action, in the dead of night, underwater. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  There is so much energy in this image. If you look at it long enough you can begin to see just a hint of movement of all the fish around the coral. The colours are realistic and this top down shot works well.  - Martin Edge (Judge)A jaw-dropping wide angle scene with sharks, rays and mountains. A winning combination in the Up \u0026amp Coming category. - Alex Mustard (Judge)2945 Loch Long, Argyll and ButeThis is a subtle image with light and detail that are a delight to explore. The sunset, trees and underwater scene combine to create a wonderful feeling of the place. We particularly like how the composition allows the line of the shore to be continued underwater by the seaweeds.  - Alex Mustard (Judge)Photographing pike underwater is one thing but finding your own underwater artistic stamp is quite another matter. With this particular image the author has done just that! By using a slow shutter speed of 18th sec and a panning technique from right to left gives the impression of movement whilst the pike is pin sharp. - Martin Edge (Judge)Arthur’s image scores with both its foreground and background. The deadman’s fingers soft coral make an attractive foreground, enhanced by the crab sheltering within, and the striking sunbeams create beauty and atmosphere in the background. I also love the feeling of depth created by the legs of the jetty reaching up for the surface. - Alex Mustard (Judge)In recent UPY competitions UK macro images have lacked their overseas counterpart\u0027s flair and imagination but this magnificent shot raises the bar for everyone else to follow. World class from the UK at last. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Memorable photographs of people underwater are deceptively difficult and require both the photographer and model to be at the top of their game. The simplicity of the composition works to highlight the delicious details in the girl\u0027s pose. - Alex Mustard (Judge) This is a timeless scene that communicates a detailed story. The cavern, the silversides sheltering, the tarpon hunting and the er kneeling reverentially, taking it all in. It is a fabulous use of black and white to tell this story of shadows and light. - Alex Mustard (Judge) Sometimes it is the small detail which contributes so much. The white of the eye and the row of teeth in what could be construed as a smile convey mischief and menace in equal measures. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Once again Tobias you have succeeded in capturing one of the most photographed wrecks in the Red Sea and photographing it in a completely different way. You push the boundaries of wreck photography and I congratulate you for your vision and forward thinking of new ideas. - Martin Edge (Judge)  Perfect composition and framed against the stark black background. However it\u0027s the contrast of white on black which attracts the eye again and again every time this particular image popped up to greet us. The colour of the nudibranch was sufficiently bright enough to raise our senses again and again as it proceeded through the competition.  The soft delicate treatment of the snooted flash is also very well managed. - Martin Edge (Judge)    This shot puts you right in the picture and records a special encounter in a very special place. Every element contributes and the lucky or intended curve of the split creates great spatial depth. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Symmetry, graphic simplicity and for once in UK waters a black background which contributes to a positive outer worldly delivery. A mould breaker. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) I see and judge many images of the sockeye salmon but this is one of the best. The alignment of the two salmon not to mention the composition within the frame.  The surgy peak of the action is in perfect symmetry with the window which provides the viewer with topside influences of the trees against a vivid blue sky. There is so much image depth in this example. - Martin Edge (Judge)    It is hard to imagine what it must have been like to have experienced such a large scale natural spectacle as this but this image, perfectly composed and timed, gets close. - Peter Rowlands (Judge) Such a delicate image yet so full of emotion. There are times when there are no more words needed. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)UPY loves seahorse photos! Especially when they capture a fleeting behaviour, such as this. But we hadn\u0027t realised during judging that this was a new species of seahorse, nor did with know the incredible backstory behind this picture, we just loved the moment. - Alex Mustard (Judge)  Whether or not you like fashion photography underwater you would be hard pressed to see a more beautiful combination of complimentary colours and a very elegant pose. A very well executed image. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)A portrait must leave you in no doubt. Simple lighting, illuminating all that is needed, captures this character. - Peter Rowlands (Judge)Winner: British Waters Macro. A mantra of mine is \u0027It\u0027s not what it is.

He added: Usually we think of crabs as big animals with broad carapaces, strong claws, small eyes in long eyestalks, and a small tail tucked under the body. Well, Callichimaera defies all of these ‘crabby’ features and forces a re-think of our definition of what makes a crab a crab.”The fossilised creatures, recovered from the Andes Mountains in Colombia, once lived in a shallow coastal sea during the Cretaceous period. Researchers recovered over 70 of the specimens in soft clay, together with hundreds of other crustaceans like shrimps and lobsters.\u0026nbspThe unique Callichimaera perplexa crab had fin-like legs allowing it to swim, and large eyes, believed to enable it to hunt at night (Oksana Vernygora, University of Alberta)While the fossils are no bigger than a coin, Dr Luque explained their exceptional degree of preservation allowed researchers to pick out fine details including their paddle-like legs and large eyes, suggesting the crabs spent their lives swimming, rather than crawling as most modern crabs do today.Dr Luque said Callichimaera’s “unusual and cute” appearance, including its small size, large compound eyes with no sockets, bent claws, leg-like mouth parts, exposed tail, and long body are features typical of pelagic crab larvae. He said this suggests several of the larval traits seen in the species might have been retained and amplified in miniaturised adults via changes in the timing and rates of development. This process is called “heterochrony,” and is believed to lead to the evolution of novel body parts.Last known female of rare turtle species dies in China zooNew species of 4ft ancient human discovered in Philippines cave\u0027Treasure trove\u0027 of new animal species found at Chinese fossil siteNew species of snake which can stab sideways discovered in west Africa“It is very exciting that today we keep finding completely new branches in the tree of life from a distant past, especially from regions like the tropics, which despite being hotspots of ersity today, are places we know the least about in terms of their past ersity,” Dr Luque said.\u0026nbsp“It’s an incredible amount of detail, and we’ve been able to reconstruct them like they were living yesterday.”The high quality of the fossils has even allowed researchers to create a detailed 3D model of the crab.“It’s common to find novel body forms in older rocks, for instance from the Paleozoic when life was exploding into many new forms,” said Dr Luque.\u0026nbsp“This discovery, from the mid-Cretaceous, illustrates that there are still surprising discoveries of more recent, weird organisms waiting to be found, especially in the tropics. It makes you wonder ‘what else is out there for us to discover?’”The study appears in the journal Science Advances.Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Taylor Swift fans believe there are good chances her next album will be all acoustic, after the singer delivered a stripped-down set at the Time 100 gala.Swift sang some of her best known songs on Tuesday night, accompanying herself with either a guitar or a piano. The set list, made up of\u0026nbspStyle, Delicate, Love Story, New Year\u0027s Day and Shake It Off, covers a wide  of Swift\u0027s career, going all the way back to 2008.The singer\u0027s acoustic set contrasted with her Reputation aesthetic. For that album, as well as for the accompanying tour, Swift seemed to fully lean into her pop star persona, while still acknowledging her country roots during live performances.Swift\u0027s style on Tuesday (a long, vaporous strapless gown and a romantic hairstyle) was also a departure from the edgier outfits she favoured during the Reputation era, and can be seen as a throwback to earlier, pre-pop stages in her career.These changes haven\u0027t gone unnoticed by the singer\u0027s ever-observant fans, who now believe that Tuesday night\u0027s appearance could constitute a preview of what\u0027s to come when Swift releases her next album – which they currently refer to as TS7.Created with Sketch.The best albums of 2019 (so far) Show all 21Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 421 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.521 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1321 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1421 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1721 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2121 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)It’s not uncommon for an artist to be influenced by the place they grew up in. Yet few are likely to have as much inspiration to draw on as India-born, Zimbabwe-raised and now Peckham-based artist Rina Mushonga.On Deerhunter’s eighth album, frontman Bradford Cox takes on the role of war poet, documenting the things he observes with a cool matter-of-factness, and heart-wrenching detail. Death is everywhere on Why Hasn’t Everything Already Disappeared?, as much as others may refuse to see it.After a period of tumult, Sharon Van Etten’s fifth album is a reinvention. But beneath its hazy synths and electronics are songs of endurance and inner peace, of settling after a flurry of activity. 421 Bring Me the Horizon  – AmoBMTH frontman Oli Sykes wants to assert the fragility of the boundary between love and hate. Amo is a way of exploring that, even down to the title itself.521 Nina Nesbitt – The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will ChangeNesbitt is back with her second LP, switching to a brand of soul and R\u0026ampB-fused pop that feels bang on time, and suits her far better. The Sun Will Come Up, the Seasons Will Change has slick, polished production from Fraser T Smith (Adele), Lostboy (Anne-Marie), Jordan Riley (Zara Larsson), and Nesbitt herself.This self-titled record, a loose but beautifully crafted collection of folk-rock songs, explores the kinds of anxieties intrinsic to the modern age – the longing to be at once noticed and invisible the paralysing effects of limitless information, and the desire to do good versus the desire to be seen doing good.The album is packed with personal confessions for the fans – “Arianators” – to pick over. It lacks a centrepiece to match the arresting depth and space of Sweetener’s “God Is A Woman”, but Grande handles its shifting moods and cast of producers (including pop machines Max Martin and Tommy Brown) with engaging class and momentum. One minute you’re skanking along to the party brass of “Bloodline” the next floating into the semi-detached, heartbreak of “Ghostin’”, which appears to address Grande’s guilt at being with Davidson while pining for Miller. She sings of the late rapper as a “wingless angel” with featherlight high notes that will drop the sternest jaw. (Helen Brown)The perma-brilliant James Blake has flooded his fourth album – Assume Form – with euphoric sepia soul and loved-up doo-wop. His trademark intelligence, honesty and pin-drop production remain intact. But the detached chorister vocals of a decade in which he battled depression have thawed to reveal a millennial Sam Cooke crooning: “Can’t believe the way we flow, way we flow, way we flow...”While he recognises his roots and includes plenty of nods to grime, AJ Tracey\u0027s magpie’s eye for a good melody or hook extends far beyond that. With the help of stellar producers like Cadenza (Kiko Bun), Swifta Beater (Kano, Giggs), and Nyge (Section Boyz, Yxng Bane), Tracey incorporates electronic music, rock, garage and even country on his most cohesive work to date.The album title of the year gives us an image of Brexit Britain trashed by Old Etonians David Cameron, Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg, but the fifth studio work from the punk duo has more than social commentary to offer. There’s some of that, as vocalist Jason Williamson skewers documentary-makers who take advantage of the poor in “Kebab Spider” – “the skint get used in loo roll shoes” – but elsewhere this is a record that expands the idea of what Sleaford Mods could be.“Do you still have that photograph? Would you use it to hurt me?” asks Australian indie rocker Julia Jacklin, against the menacing throb of “Body”. The tension is stormy: imagine a mid-period Fleetwood Mac song, covered by Cat Power. It’s a masterclass in narrative songwriting.With praise from Kendrick Lamar, five EPs released by the time she was 21, tours with Lauryn Hill, collaborations with Gorillaz and two critically praised albums – including 2017’s excellent concept album Stillness in Wonderland – fans and critics alike wondered what else Little Simz could do to find the kind of mainstream success enjoyed by so many of her male peers.1321 Solange – When I Get HomeSolange Knowles has never been coy about the intent behind her music. Beautiful arrangements and seamless production notwithstanding, you get the sense, each time she drop a project, that it serves a distinct, zeitgeist-shifting purpose.1421 Foals – Everything Not Saved Will be Lost (Part 1)FoalsMerging their asymmetrical early math pop with the deep space atmospherics of Total Life Forever and Holy Fire, plus added innovations – ambient rainforest throbs on “Moonlight”, deadpan EDM on “In Degrees”, Afro-glitch Radiohead on “Café D’Athens” – they’ve created an inspired album of scorched earth new music that, in all likelihood, will only really be challenged for album of the year by Part 2. (Mark Beaumont)Tracks are at once astute and deeply personal in how they capture vignettes of everyday life and spin them into important lessons. “Black”, the most recent single from the record, considers what that word means to different people around the world, as well as to Dave. “Voices” has him singing over an old-school garage beat, fighting off personal demons.At her best, Sigrid throws out precision-tooled high notes like icicle javelins into vast, blue Scandi-produced skies. Then she growls like an Icelandic volcano preparing to disrupt western civilisation until we sort ourselves out.1721 Karen O and Danger Mouse – Lux PrimaLux Prima was born just over a decade ago from a drunken phone call from Karen O to Danger Mouse – real name Brian Joseph Burton – during which the pair vowed they would work on something together. It wasn’t until after O had given birth to her son, though, that recording finally began, and there is a beatific sense of contentment on songs like “Drown”, with its Kamasi Washington-like choirs and stately horns.This is an ambitious creation, meticulously crafted and assembled. For a start, the range of guest performers is a cornucopia of contemporary soul and hip-hop collaborators: vocalists Moses Sumney, Roots Manuva, Heidi Vogel, Grey Reverend and Tawiah strings player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, and keyboardist Dennis Hamm – both of whom have worked with Flying Lotus and Thundercat.Rose – who found fame in the UK’s indie-folk scene as an unofficial member of Bombay Bicycle Club in 2010, only to walk away amid the band’s growing hype – is darkly compelling on No Words Left. Assisted by producer Tim Bidwell, who worked on Rose’s last record Something’s Changing, she sounds braver than she ever has before. There are moments that recall her Communion labelmate Ben Howard, on his latest album, Noonday Dream, and others that nod to the quiet stoicism of Joni Mitchell and Neil Young. (Roisin O\u0027Connor)The record is loosely conceptual insomuch as it’s punctuated with mock adverts for “WWAY HEALTH, our 247 care programme”. But don’t be put off: Miss Universe is a brilliant collection of songs, an expansive melange of indie, jazz, pop and trip-hop that flits between a lo-fi sparseness and something The Strokes would play. Yanya – who is of Turkish-Irish-Bajan heritage – grew up in London on a mix of Pixies, Nina Simone, The Libertines and Amy Winehouse, and this unlikely combination is certainly reflected in the sound. (Patrick Smith)2121 Jenny Lewis – On the LineHere, Lewis does what she does best: adds the glossy sparkle of Hollywood and a sunny Californian sheen to melancholy and nostalgia, with her most luxuriantly orchestrated album yet. Even when she’s singing, “I’ve wasted my youth”, it’s in that sweet voice, with carefree “doo doo doo doo doo doos”, and at a pace that’s so upbeat that it masks the sentiment. It’s a bittersweet mourning of her past. (Elisa Bray)Based on her acoustic performance at Time 100, I think that Taylor will DEFINITELY be incorporating more guitar in her album, one person tweeted.\u0026nbspIf Reputation is her experimental album (like Lady Gaga\u0027s Art Pop), then TS7 will be a stripped down album (like Lady Gaga\u0027s Joanne).So Taylor sang acoustic versions of old songs last night, WHAT IF TS7 IS A SOFT ACOUSTIC MOOD, someone else wrote.One person suggested that Swift\u0027s next album could even be comprised of acoustic covers of some of her most popular tunes.Swift appeared to tease forthcoming new music earlier this month, when she shared a mysterious countdown to 26 April on social media.She has since continued posting one photo per day on Twitter, always with the message 4.26. All the images feature soft pastel hues in keeping with Swift\u0027s look on Tuesday night – painting a more complete picture of the aesthetic she might deploy on her next album.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxThe best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It will likely result in a corresponding dip after the eventual departure date as companies slow down production while they run down the stocks they’ve built up.Some have suggested that this will result in a mini-recession as the UK’s already slow rate of economic growth tips into a decline.However, is there a possibility that such an effect would be more than offset by companies who feel finally able to turn on the taps of investment after more than three years of uncertainty?Could the fabled “Brexit bounce” or a “deal idend” really rescue the UK’s struggling economy?Created with Sketch.Tariffs in the event of a no-deal Brexit  Show all 15Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.There will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs on pork in order to protect British farmersThere will be tariffs in place on some cheeses including €22.10100kg of cheddar, €19.10100kg of processed cheese and €18.60100kg on some blue cheesesThere will be no tariffs in place on milkThere will be no tariffs on car parts imported from EuropeThere will be no tariffs on alcoholic drinks - except on some rums due to ingredients used in their distilling processThere will be tariffs on beef in order to protect British farmersThere will be no tariffs on many types of fish including cod, haddock, salmon and sea bass915 Fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on almost all fruit and vegetablesThere will be no tariffs on chocolate or other cocoa productsThere will be tariffs on poultry in order to protect British farmersThere will be some tariffs in place on ceramisThere will be no tariffs on steelThere will be no tariffs on coalThere will be tariffs on the meat of sheep in order to protect British farmersIt is certainly the case that companies have held back billions of pounds of investment in new offices, factories, machinery, training and technology since the June 2016 referendum. The exact amount is hard to quantify but the available data points to a significant sum.\u0026nbspWith consumers for the large part continuing to spend despite uncertainty and meagre wage increases, it has been a lack of business investment that has been largely responsible for holding back growth to the tune of around £800m a week – £40bn a year – since the vote.This makes sense. Many consumer decisions are small scale and have so far, apart from the effects of higher inflation, have been largely unaffected by the vagaries of trade deals.\u0026nbspNorway-plus, Canada-plus, no deal or the Swiss option matters little to most people when weighing up options for a new washing machine or doing their weekly shopBut the differences between the possible trade deal outcomes could be huge for a company looking at a multimillion-pound investment in the UK that will pay off (or not) over several years. As a result, firms have understandably not made those decisions, or have chosen to invest elsewhere.Is a customs union really ‘the worst of both worlds’ for the UK?Ignoring the younger generation may prove perilous for businessIs Brexit making the eurozone’s economic problems worse?The flip side of this, so the argument goes, is that when executives and small business owners are given certainty as to what our trading relationship with the EU will look like, the floodgates will open and billions of pounds of pent-up investment will gush forth.Sadly it is not as simple as this.According to Bank of England interest-rate setter Jonathan Haskel, British business investment will probably stay weak for the next few years because uncertainty is likely to continue, at least for the 21-month transition period and potentially beyond.“The longer-term question is whether investment will eventually bounce back after uncertainty is resolved,” he said, adding that the answer to this depends on the perennial, unanswered question of what trade deal is to be struck and how high trade barriers will be.“At least for the next few years the prospect of low investment seems possible.”Got an unanswered question about Brexit?

Despite ministers’ attempts to explain away food bank use, the\u0026nbspTrussell\u0026nbspTrust is very clear that cuts to social security and the five-week wait for universal credit payments are key reasons for the rise,” she added.The\u0026nbspTrussell Trust said the main reasons for people needing emergency food were benefits consistently not covering the cost of living (33 per cent), and delays or changes to benefits being paid, and urged ministers to scrap the five-week wait for a first universal credit payment.Emma Revie, chief executive of the charity, said: “Our benefits system is supposed to protect us all from being swept into poverty. Universal credit should be part of the solution but currently the five-week wait is leaving many without enough money to cover the basics.”She urged the government to ensure benefit payments reflected the true cost of living and that work was secure and people were paid the real living wage, to help ensure everyone is “anchored from poverty”.\u0026nbsp“As a priority, we’re urging the government to end the wait for universal credit to ease the pressure on thousands of households,” she added.“Ultimately, it’s unacceptable that anyone should have to use a food bank in the first place. No charity can replace the dignity of having financial security.”Universal credit to blame for soaring food bank use, government admitsA study by the Resolution Foundation in February found that child poverty risked hitting a record high by 2023-24 unless the government implements substantial changes to universal credit and other benefits.The UN’s special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights meanwhile warned in November that policies and drastic cuts to social support were entrenching high levels of poverty, and that Brexit was exacerbating the problem.Campbell Robb, chief executive of the independent Joseph Rowntree Foundation, attributed the rise in food bank use to the government’s “consistent failure to get to grips with poverty”.\u0026nbsp“When the use of food banks reaches a record high we are beyond the language of warning signs and wake-up calls. Unless we take bold action to solve poverty we risk undermining what we stand for as a country,” he added.“Low pay, insecure work, high cost of living, especially housing, and an ineffective social security system are holding people back from a decent life. At a time when we are deciding the future of our country we must redesign the systems that lock so many people in poverty.”Created with Sketch.UK news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Engineers from the Canal and River Trust repair a leak at the base of a deep 200 year old, Grade II listed lock in Gloucester, where the tidal River Severn meets Gloucester Docks in the city and a specially manufactured steel dam is now holding back the river water, with more than 100 tonnes of accumulated silt being removed from the damaged area of the lock so that the team can undertake repairsAmateur James Cahill celebrates beating snooker world number one, Ronnie O\u0027Sullivan, in the first round of the World Championship.

Ms May saw off an attempt to topple her\u0026nbsplast December, meaning another vote cannot take place until the end of the year.Eurosceptic critics of the prime minister had asked the 1922 Committee executive to change the rules to allow another vote\u0026nbspto be held six months after the first. Executive members\u0026nbspheld two meetings to discuss the proposal but eventually decided not to support it.Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the committee, said the issue was now “settled” and that there was “not a mood to revisit this matter in the near future”.However, he said Ms May will be asked to provide “clarity” on when she plans to step down if she is unable to get a Brexit deal through parliament.The decision of the 1922\u0026nbspexecutive was announced at a meeting of Conservative MPs on Wednesday evening.Created with Sketch.Who could succeed Theresa May as Conservative leader?

How we deal with it will be crucial for our prosperity and for our security.”Cabinet minister Liz Truss said Huawei involvement should not be ruled out, telling the BBC: “We need to decide on a case-by-case basis based on the security advice, but that should be led by the UK – we shouldn’t be deciding on the basis of what the Americans think or what the Australians think.”Ciaran Martin, head of GCHQ’s National Cyber Security Centre, told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme that the review was “about the fundamentals of how to keep these networks safe from any attacker” and not just Huawei.“Some of the 5G infrastructure is built over existing networks so it’s not as if we are completely reinventing the wheel here,” he added.“We’ve set out that objective independent technical assessment of what’s needed and I’m confident ministers will reach a decision that will provide for the type of safer 5G networks that we need.”A Downing Street spokeswoman said: “We don’t comment on NSC discussions.”The reported decision came after a number of senior security figures warned publicly of the risks involved in allowing a Chinese firm access to the UK’s critical communications network.MI6 chief Alex Younger has said Britain needs to decide how “comfortable” it is in allowing Chinese firms to become involved, while Mr Fleming, has spoken of both “opportunities and threats”.Some critics have expressed concerns that the Chinese government could require the firm to install technological “back doors” to enable it to spy on or disable Britain’s communications network.Last month, a government-led committee set up to vet Huawei’s products said it had found “significant technological issues” with its engineering processes posing new risks to the UK network.Huawei has denied having ties to the Chinese government, but critics question how independent any large Chinese company can be, with a legal obligation on firms to co-operate with the state’s intelligence agencies.The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There is also a majority in this chamber for that position and polling evidence suggests a majority in Scotland want a choice on independence, though opinions vary on timing.“There are some who would like to see a very early referendum others want that choice to be much later.”May-Corbyn Brexit deal would ‘make country poorer’, Sturgeon saysRejecting calls for a referendum this year, she continued: “To rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow for an informed choice to be made. However, if we are to safeguard Scotland’s interests, we cannot wait indefinitely.“That is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered in the lifetime of this parliament.“If Scotland is taken out of the EU, the option of a referendum on independence within that timescale must be open to us. That would be our route to avoiding the worst of the damage Brexit will do.”Ms Sturgeon said the UK’s decision to leave the EU had changed the circumstances since the last Scottish independence referendum.Created with Sketch.

The first minister said she was acting now so “we won’t squander valuable time ...\u0026nbspin a standoff with a UK government that may soon be out of office”.She added: “Those who oppose independence are of course entitled to argue that case, but it must be for the people to decide.“If we are successful in further growing the support and the demand for independence,\u0026nbspthen no UK government will be able to deny the will of the people or stop that will being expressed.”The latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxThe latest news on Brexit direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Though the US president has welcomed Brexit and originally said he would offer the UK a “large scale” trade deal after it left, he has since cooled after the shape of the UK’s exit became clear.\u0026nbspIn November he embarrassed Ms May by saying her Brexit plan meant the UK may not be able to trade with the US after it left the EU, and that it sounded “great” for the European Union.The issue of a possible US-UK trade deal has been controversial in Britain because of warnings from trade expects that the US might insist on opening British markets to American food standards.\u0026nbspCreated with Sketch.

Our data lets us look beneath the headline figures at what is happening to young people from different backgrounds, in different parts of the country, and with different qualifications, and, for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds, this is not a good news story.“We are breaking a fundamental promise to young people in this country. We tell them: \u0027Study hard, get your qualifications and good jobs will follow\u0027.“For many young people this is true, but for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds it isn\u0027t. They are less likely to get those qualifications, and even when they do, less likely to benefit.”Stefan Speckesser, of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, which helped with the study, said: “By showing regional and local differences in the employment gap, we find evidence that some local areas are more successfully tackling the negative effects of disadvantage, which are unrelated to education success, on young people\u0027s school-to-work transitions.”The findings, involving 18 to 24-year-old Neets in England, are drawn from Education Department data.Shadow employment minister Mike Amesbury said: “This report must act as a wake-up call to the Government. Young people who have grown up in poverty can face significant disadvantages when they come to look for their first job.“The Tory Party is failing young people, who are too often trapped in low-paid and insecure work, but the Government is refusing to track whether or not its flagship youth employment programme, the Youth Obligation, is working.”Mark Hawthorne, of the Local Government Association, said: “The Government needs to consider LGA proposals for an integrated employment and skills service led by local authorities.“Devolving careers advice, post-16 and adult skills budgets and powers to local areas would allow councils, schools, colleges and employers to work together to improve provision for young people so that they can get on in life.”Only the best news in your inboxOnly the best news in your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Our aim is to stop Brexit democratically.We want to connect people across the country to their MPs, so they directly hear from their voters, the majority of whom want to have a real debate on Brexit before our options are taken off the table, including the option to stay and lead in Europe.Mr Soros sparked anger earlier this year when it emerged he was helping to fund the group.The billionaire hedge fund tycoon is known for funding political causes all around the world, including his native Hungary and his adopted home of the US.Best for Britain was previously also supported by Gina Miller, who took the Government to court to force them to give MPs a say on Brexit"},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/CHARLENE-PIC-3.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"universal credit slept married man christmas day","story":"A SINGLE mum left so destitute by Universal Credit that she sold herself to a married man for £ on Christmas Day has revealed she has been unable to escape prostitution.Charlotte, , from South London, says she feels trapped by poverty and cannot afford to quit sex work.Charlotte fell into the dire situation after running up debts while waiting five weeks for her first Universal Credit payment.As part of The Suns Make Universal Credit Work campaign, we are fighting to slash the five week wait to two weeks.The Sun first revealed her tragic struggle on the new benefit system in December, telling how Charlotte was left with just £. a day to live on after bills.She began selling sex for as little as £, and at times she performs sexual favours on up to  men a week while her son is at school.At times I have had to sleep with men for some change - just £ or £ so I can buy some food in Iceland, just so my son doesn’t go hungry, she says.Charlottes story is far from unique, with increasing numbers of women turning to sex work to support their families.Last month MPs announced a new inquiry into women turning to prostitution because of Universal Credit - which has been dubbed survival sex by campaigners.And while working families can claim back up to % of their childcare costs, they must find the money to pay for childcare upfront - we’ve heard of families waiting up to  months for the money.Working parents across the country told us they’ve been unable to take on more hours - or have even turned down better paid jobs or more hours because of the amount they get their benefits cut.Thats why The Sun has launched our Make Universal Credit work. We demand the Government makes the following changes to help hard-working famililes before its too late. We want you to:Together, these changes will help Make Universal Credit Work.Things have not improved for the former housekeeper, who has been forced to borrow money to pay for furniture and did not have enough cash to celebrate her eight-year-old son’s birthday.“I got my son a little truck for his birthday but that was it, she said. “He was happy to get something as I’ve had to sell the toys he has just to charge the electric and the gas,”Charlotte charges men £ for sex and other favours - bringing in around £ every week. She sees one client whenever she can as she appreciates the “regular” work.In fact, the mum feels so let down by the Government she claims her clients are the only people she can trust.Charlotte, who lives on an estate, had to give up her job when she had her son because she couldnt afford childcare.She moved onto Universal Credit in January  but fell £ behind on her rent while waiting for her first payment and was threatened with eviction.She says: “If I didn’t have to wait so long for my first payment, I would have been OK.“Something always goes wrong - five weeks is too much. I’m still just about managing now.“Winter has been hard, I’ve had to keep the house warm and the lights on, but it’s been so expensive to do.Her sons dad pays nothing towards his upkeep and while she received a £ loan from the government to tide her over when she moved onto Universal Credit last year, she claims she wasn’t told by her local job centre that it would need to be repaid.“That was the final straw when everything changed, and I saw how much debt I was in… the payments and the household bills, it all built up,” she says.Charlotte now receives £-a-month in Universal Credit after her rent has been paid to her landlord and her debts, including the £ furniture loan, are taken off.At one point, after shed paid the rest of her bills, she was left with just £. a day for her and her son to live on.Other women have also claimed that a long wait for their first Universal Credit payment has forced them into sex work.Julie, , from Merseyside told the BBC she had been left “so ashamed” after being forced to turn to sex work after an EIGHT-week wait for her Universal Credit payment.“I didnt go out looking for it, I said no at first ... it wasnt until about three weeks later that I said OK, yeah, because I thought I need to, because I need money’,” she said.Its something I never ever thought I would be ever capable of doing.”Apply for an advance - Claimants are able to get some cash within five days rather than waiting weeks for their first payment. But its a loan which means the repayments will be automatically deducted from your future Universal Credit pay out.Alternative Payment Arrangements- If youre falling behind on rent, you or your landlord may be able to apply for an APA which will get your payment sent directly to your landlord. You might also be able to change your payments to get them more frequently, or you can split the paymentsyoure part of a couple.Budgeting Advance - You may be able to get help from the government to help with emergency household costs of up to £youre single, £youre part of a couple or £you have children. These are only in cases like your cooker breaking down or for help getting a job. Youll have to repay the advance through your regular Universal Credit payments. Youll still have to repay the loan, evenyou stop claiming for Universal Credit.Cut your Council Tax - You might be able to get a discount on your Council Tax or be entitled to Discretionary Housing Paymentsyour payments arent enough to cover your rent.Foodbanks - If youre really hard up and struggling to buy food and toiletries, you can find your local foodbank who will provide you with help for free. You can find your nearest one on the Trussell Trust website.Women like Charlotte are often too ashamed to tell their families that they have resorted to prostitution to survive.“I can’t talk to anyone. It’s the guilt mainly. My family don’t know - they wouldn’t be happy. They’d be angry, furious, upset. They would be so judgemental.My son still doesn’t know about what I do for money either.”“And I’m sure there are other women out there in worse situations than me.”Charlotte is struggling with her mental health at the moment and is having therapy for a second time – but she hasn’t admitted what she “does on the side” as she doesn’t think her counsellor would understand.She is considering going to college to do a course as she wants to be an author, but feels things are stacked against her.“I know I’ve got lots to work on, but it’s too much sometimes,” she says.“I keep thinking, why is this happening “They say Universal Credit is working, but who is that for Why are people getting poorer but the government don’t care  Evensomething changes, I can’t erase what I’ve done now.Officials say that advances are available from day one on Universal Credit - and that Brits can get up to  per cent of their cash upfrontthey need it.But delays getting the welfare payments are causing women to rack up debt and some are selling their bodies while they wait for help, charities have said.We know from the stories of women that have contacted us that the delays in processing universal credit and the drop in benefits is financially crippling.It is essential that the vulnerable are protected and their welfare is paramount.”A representative for Beyond The Streets, which works to help women who have suffered sexual exploitation, said: We welcome the investigation in to failures in universal credit and the increase in survival sex.In October, MP Frank Field shocked the House of Commons when he revealed women in his Birkenhead constituency were selling themselves for sex for the first time as a result of hardship caused by the introduction of Universal Credit.After The Sun shared Charlottes story with Mr Field, he said he would write to Department for Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd about her case.Here we have yet another awful example of Universal Credit pushing vulnerable mothers, who are trying to protect their children, to rock bottom and beyond, he told The Sun.The DWP insists safeguards are in place to make sure all repayments are affordable and sustainable.It also aims to give people help to find routes out of the sex industry, with personalised work coaches in place to help people looking for alternative roles.The department insists it has responded quickly to feedback on Universal Credit by continuing to pay Housing Benefit for two weeks after people move on to the new system. Other legacy benefits will follow suit shortly.Ms Rudd has responded to the Suns campaign, saying shes listening to Sun readers as she tries to improve Universal Credit for working families.A DWP spokeswoman told The Sun: We’re committed to getting help to people when they need it most, and advance payments and budgeting support are available.Work coaches are trained to spot vulnerable people, including those working in the sex industry, and offer appropriate support.”*Charlottes name has been changed.  Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

This was not a poll of wider Tory voters but of people who pay an annual subscription to the party.If this group of around , people are not prepared to vote for their own party, then what chance have the Tories in attracting votes from the wider electorate But it gets worse — even elected Tory representatives are planning to rat on their party in the European elections.A Survation poll suggests that four in ten Conservative councillors are planning to back the Brexit Party too.Loyalty, it used to be said, was the Tories’ secret weapon.Not any more.The party has become like an army whose frontline troops have started burrowing beneath enemy lines — not in order to plant explosives beneath its positions, but in the hope of joining it in its trenches.No Conservative leader will find it easy to turn around the situation, but at least a new face, with some new ideas and a fresh perspective on how to solve the Brexit impasse, would have a chance.Anything would be better than being led round and round in circles by a Prime Minister who has become tired and stuck.Every time May comes to the despatch box after some new, devastating vote in the Commons, I find myself thinking: Surely she must have a fresh strategy now.Then I find myself groaning to learn that no, still she seems to think that the answer is to keep on plugging her failed deal.To huge numbers of British people, May has become a large part of the problem.What was once seen as her greatest asset — resilience — is now seen as plain stubbornness.It has become impossible to imagine any satisfactory outcome to Brexit until she is gone.Sadly, I fear that May herself cannot see this.Like John Major in the last, wretched years of his premiership, I fear she has convinced herself that she is an asset to her party and her country when almost everyone  can see that the opposite is true.As with Major in the mid s, every day that May remains in Downing Street is adding to the scale of defeat the party faces at the ballot box.The only dference is that then the beneficiary was the moderate Tony Blair.This time around, an unpopular but stubborn Tory leader is adding rocket fuel to the chances of an unreformed Marxist, Jeremy Corbyn, becoming Prime Minister.I know May is desperate to achieve some sort of legacy before she leaves Downing Street, butshe resists much longer her main achievement will be an indirect one — it will be to let in a Labour government which s Britain to the sort of punitive tax rates which drove a brain drain of iniduals and businesses from the country in the s.It is a great shame that May did not resign last December, when  of her MPs voted against her in a confidence vote.Her margin of victory — she won  per cent of votes — would have constituted a substantial mandate in an open leadership contest.But this was not a leadership contest.It was a no-confidence vote in a sitting Prime Minister, in which anything less than a resounding victory would have been unsatisfactory.Given that more than  Conservative MPs are members of the Government — and were therefore duty bound to support their Prime Minister in a confidence vote — May failed even to carry with her a majority of her backbenchers.And that was before the multiple Commons defeats for her deal, which have led to open rebellion in the Cabinet.Were such a vote to be held now, it is inevitable that many ministers who reluctantly backed her in December would no longer feel they needed to do so.Under the Conservative Party’s rules, May cannot be challenged again in a no-confidence vote for a full  months after the last one. But there are rumblings to change this rule.Graham Brady, Chairman of the  Committee, which represents backbenchers, is reported to be planning to visit May next week to tell her to resign before the end of June.But that won’t be soon enough. Before then, the Tories face twin wipeouts in the local and European elections. The latter may be utterly pointless but nevertheless, a derisory performance is still going to be deeply traumatic when it happens.Theresa May’s ministers have dutully supported her in the past.Her duty is now to step aside immediately, before she accidentally ends up leading her party to an even greater humiliation in a general election than the one it suffered in .Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Why kill the innocents ”An obvious question from all right-minded people. But when you’re a murdering psycho, you want to wreak terror not just on those present, but in the minds of millions around the world.And the way they do that is to target innocent people in the normal, everyday scenarios we can all identy with.Attending a church or mosque with family and friends, taking our kids to a concert or a busy shopping mall at the weekend, cheering on marathon runners, queuing for breakfast at a holiday hotel . . .Who among us has not read about Sneha and her friends . . .  or the heartbreaking stories of the British father who lost his we and two children . . . or the Danish man who lost three of his four children . . . and thought of how we would copefaced with the same situation That’s terrorism. It projects fear on to the masses and seeks to make us alter our behaviour accordingly.With every fibre of my being, I want to resist the power of this pernicious tactic, but of late I’ll admit I have struggled.On Friday night, our -year-old attended a Shawn Mendes concert at London’s O arena with a friend and her mother. We wrestled with whether to let her go or not, then felt anxious from the moment she set off until she ed home.Equally, when she expressed a wish to meet her friends at a vast mall last week, we urged her to give it a miss and browse the shops locally. Irrational, yes, but that’s what terrorism can do to your mindsetyou let it.You don’t want to be that grieving family, so you try to minimise the chances of it happening.The truth, of course, is thata suicide bomber decides to board your train carriage, or walk in to your community centre, or drive a car that blows up just as you’re walking past — there’s not a damn thing you can do about it.But what we can do is stand together in our firm belief that these attacks — be it on churches or mosques — have nothing to do with religion.Just hours after the coordinated bombings in his country, the Sri Lankan minister of state for defence said preliminary investigations have shown, “this attack was carried out in retaliation for the attack against Muslims in Christchurch [New Zealand]”.Meanwhile, reports have emerged of young Christian men walking the streets near Sneha’s home of Negombo carrying long sticks and “looking for Muslims”.Again, this us-against-them mindset is what terrorism seeks to inflame.But this isn’t about Christianity versus Islam.The attacks in Sri Lanka, New Zealand, Manchester and London — to name but a few — are the actions of a warped few who have distorted the teachings of wholly peaceful religions to suit their own, murderous ends.We mustn’t allow one drop of poison to contaminate an ocean of humanity.DR GAIL BRADBROOK is the co-founder of Extinction Rebellion, the eco action group that brought central London to a virtual standstill last week.She says: “I think our protests have been awesome.“We’re making history at the minute, people are having a fantastic time on the streets and we really welcome people to come join us.”Yes, I’m sure workers on zero hours contracts would relish the opportunity to lose a day’s payto join her, so too the nurses whose arrival at nearby St Thomas’ hospital each day is critical to the wellbeing of thousands of patients.Dr Bradbrook may have a PhD in molecular biophysics but one fears she and her merry band of protestors may have skipped lessons in common sense.Why  would they glue themselves to public transport that encourages people to leave their cars at home while simultaneously causing air polluting traffic jams And why  would they stage a sit-in aimed to make the politicians take notice when the House of Commons rose on April  for recess and didn’tuntil yesterday  Duh.The majority of the population supports action on climate change, but this virtue-signalling nonsense only detracts from the cause by irritating ordinary people just tryingto earn a living. Begging the question: Why only now HOLLYWOOD star Anne Hathaway says she’s giving up alcohol until her son is .She’s a stronger woman than me.Meanwhile, she has also abandoned veganism after admitting that she “just didn’t feel good or healthy”. She says she immediately felt betterafter eating a fish dish from Iceland.I know what you’re thinking . . . was it the £ prawn ring as advertised by Kerry Katona No, Anne’s le-changing fish experience was a sustainably sourced salmon at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Reykjavik.Easy mistake to make though.“HEALTH tourism” is still an ongoing issue, with reports that ten people a day are jetting to the UK to have their babies delivered on the NHS.The bill for caring for , foreign maternity cases was around £.million in  , with only £.million of it clawed back.Meanwhile, three-year-old Victoria Komada, from Norwich, was born with twisted legs and faced a double amputation.And thanks only to the generosity of the local community in Norwich and those in Poland’s Szczecin, where her parents grew up, £, was raised for her to fly toFlorida for an operation to help her walk. Each week we see the plight of desperate people trying to raise money for treatments the NHS won’t fund.Just think of how many of them that unrecouped £.million might have helped.Some days, it feels like we in the UK have  of them.CERTAIN IVF clinics are exploiting older women whose chances of having a baby are very poor, the fertility regulator has warned.Since , the number of -plus women having IVF has doubled, with some clinics “trading on hope” despite a success rate of just one per cent for a woman of  using her own eggs.A spokeswoman for the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authoritysaid she would like these clinics to be honest about the low statistics.She’s right, but one suspects the number of older women opting for IVF will remain high.Because when you’re desperate for a child, even in a fertility lottery of just one per cent, there still lies the hope that it could be you.Fast forward years and they’re still performing though, despite a healthy diet and regular exercise, the batteries are running noticeably lower. Particularly as there’s now only three of them on stage.Howard,  this weekend, is a former breakdancer and perhaps the fittest of them all.But while his body is making all the right moves, his face is positively screaming: “Is there much more of this  Line Of Duty’s on in a minute.”Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He kept pushing me about, telling me I had no effing right to be here and who the eff was I to come in and complain.Ill never forget, he called me frivolous and vexatious.Mr Fitzgibbon’s ersion around the village has doubled theof his commute.He added: “I used to drive through the village to get to work -- but now I have to drive around Galbally, which adds on  miles in the morning and  in the evening.Thats an extra  miles a day,  miles a week,  miles a month, and , miles a year - all because of speed bumps that are too high for my car.I know Im not the only person these bumps affect - my boss has complained to me about them, but he doesnt want the attention.He claims the speed bumps have caused £, worth of damage on his VW Passat including the tow hitch, bumpers, shock absorbers, drop links and springs.When he told Limerick City and County Council they needed to pay for the damage – he was told his continued persistence was causing “considerable disruption” to staff.A letter from Leahy Reidy Solicitors on behalf of the council said: We refer to our clients letter to you dated the st of February .In the letter they clearly indicated to you that you were not to engage on any future occasion with our clients by telephone.Furthermore, you are not to call their offices as your activity is causing considerable disruption to the running of the business of the Council.Limerick City and County Council dispute Mr Fitzgibbon’s claim the bumps are six inches high and insist it is about half that.A spokesperson said: The speed ramps cushions that were placed in the Galbally this year were put in as per Limerick City and County Councils Traffic Calming Policy Document are only mm high and were placed on the R.We have received no other complaint in relation to them.A traffic survey carried out prior to installation indicated high levels of speed through the village and non-compliance with existing speed limits.The introduction of the measures has resulted in a safer village for all.Similar speed cushions were introduced in other areas of the county without issue."},{"url":null,"title":"madeleine mccann gerry kate thank supporters anniversary","story":"A revamped Facebook page, run on behalf of Kate and Gerry, has posted a new message stating: Thank you for continuing to have hope and helping us in the search for Madeleine.The couple will remember Maddie, who vanished as a three-year-old during a family holiday in Portugal in May , during a poignant outdoor prayer service in their home village in Rothley, Leics, in nine days.Accompanying a post on the official Find Maddie Campaign website is a saying: “You never run out of optionsyou have hope” with pink flowers and a butterfly — representing Maddie’s favourite colour.The youngster was snatched from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz while her parents were dining in a nearby tapas restaurant with pals.

It should not be controversial.”Houston Independent School District policy allows schools to establish standards for student attire and grooming, but no policy exists concerning parents, the Chronicle reported. District administrators did not respond Tuesday to a request by The Associated Press for comment, and a message left for Outley Brown was not ed.“Parents, we do value you as a partner in your child’s education.

I dont have a fixed way of doing it, its really just trying things out until I like what I see.“Everything is very DIY, the only equipment is the camera and a tripod, the rest is just piles of books, sticky tape, other random objects to hold things in place and then mostly natural light and long exposures.“At such a close distance a lot of things are dficult to handle the focus changes all the time, you make the slightest movement of the object or camera and the shot is ruined.”"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon scottish independence referendum","story":"The First Minister reacted to fierce pressure from SNP activists by saying Scotland should have IndyRef by March .But the PM’s official spokesman immediately said both sides agreed the  vote was “once in a generation”.And he added: “Our position hasn’t changed.

We have assembled a erse group of candidates from across the political spectrum, from former Tory Ann Widdecombe to left-wing grandee Claire Fox.We are all unied in our desire to pressure Westminster to deliver what the people instructed.It is vital we restore parliamentary democracy. Through my service with the Royal Marines and the Special Boat Service, I witnessed the Arab Spring first-hand and saw the horrors suffered by a people with no representation in their political system.I never thought our political class would deliberately undermine the people.But they have done so by failing to deliver on the  referendum. This after the  General Election manestos of the Conservative and Labour parties clearly pledged to honour the result.Voters on all sides have been betrayed. The final straw for me was seeing the men who sent me to a questionable war in Afghanistan — Tony Blair, Lord Adonis and Alastair Campbell — conspiring to undermine the people.They have been colluding with other governments in Europe to stop Brexit.It is vital we stand up against the damage this hardcore group who want to create an EU super-state are inflicting on British democracy.It is deeply saddening to see the isions across our country. People voted to Remain and Leave for a range of legitimate reasons.We are in this position due to John Major and Tony Blair’s arrogance in not consulting thepeople on the treaties that embedded us in the EU — Maastricht, Amsterdam, Nice and Lisbon.The public should have been consulted on these major transfers of power from Parliament towards the supranational structures of the EU.We are now left with this political mess as their legacy.One of the greatest testaments to Britain is that so many people are willing to take huge risks to come and live here, to be free and prosperous.My ancestors came to the UK from Ireland in the th century to escape famine and persecution. They settled in Greenock in the Scottish Lowlands.I am deeply disturbed that Brexit has now come to focus on identity and immigration, instead of on democracy and who runs our country.We should celebrate immigrants as the heroes who want to be British and part of the national ­success story. Brexit is not a right-wing project. Five million Labour voters and a third of ethnic-minority voters backed Leave.Yet from some of the rhetoric spouted, you would think that Brexit voters are all ignorant racists.  The result is that the Leave voters feel patronised, insulted and ignored. Look at the  Labour MPs — many of whom represent Leave-voting constituencies — who voted for a second referendum to overturn the first.The contempt they show for the ordinary people who put their faith in the democratic process is breathtaking.If politicians fail to deliver the result of the referendum, they will be guilty of selling out the people and undermining Britain’s international credibility as a stable and free liberal democracy.The backlash from the public would be unthinkable.Beyond Brexit, I see an opportunity to implement the strongest animal welfare and environmental legislation in the world. It is a chance to reset our relationship with nature, away from the Common Agricultural Policy.I strongly disagree with those who want to weaken environmental policy.Yet the beauty of an accountable liberal democracy is that those decisions can be made in our own Parliament.A vote for the Brexit Party will send shockwaves across Westminster, reminding them that the people are in charge.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

More than , people have signed Age UK’s Switched Off petition calling for the licences to be preserved.Royle Family actor Ricky Tomlinson and former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown have supported the fight. In a report published today, peers on the on Intergenerational Fairness and Provision Committee say it is “inappropriate that the BBC should be tasked with funding the social policy goal of supporting older generations”. They add: “If the Government wishes to subsidise the licence fee, the BBC should not carry the cost.” However, the -page report also calls for free TV licences, currently worth £., to be means-tested so only the worst-off households continue to receive the benefit. “In our submission, free television licences for all over a certain age should be phased out,” says the study. “Those who can afford to pay for a television licence should do so. “The poorest may be subsidised directly by the Government,it so chooses.”  National Pensioners’ Convention general secretary Jan Shortt said: “The Lords are absolutely right that it is the Government’s responsibility – not the BBC’s – to fund and administer part of our social policy. “Do we really want teams of bureaucrats in the BBC checking people’s details to see who is eligible for a free TV licence and then perhaps sending out the detector vans to take away licences from the over s  “The BBC’s role is to educate and entertain – not carry out the role of government.” Currently all households with someone aged  or over are entitled to a free licence.

Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn are attending the official goodbye to a -year-old woman whose too-few words always made more sense than their own. Perhaps they will have the self-awareness to note that the Brexit they have, between them, wanted for years handed her killers their best recruitment tool in decades. The threat of border controls has sown resentment and belligerence in a handful of hearts, and the old Provos are now able to persuade young idiots to join them.While May and Corbyn wrestle the intellectual issues like two recalcitrant ducks, two new parties have formed to fight the upcoming EU elections. One is Change UK, which has a funny tinge of twats about it. The other is the Brexit Party, which has not so much a tinge as an absolute shower of precisely the sort of morons you thought Britain had decided to ignore.Step forward travelling DJ Nigel Farage, whose recent lack of attention on international speaking tours has led him to throw himself before the TV cameras in an attempt to get his last job back.  If you think hating the EU would logically lead to boycotting it, think again. Farage made £, a year out of the organisation while failing to take part in much of its work. No-one appears to have asked him how, exactly, he thinks being re-elected to an institution he loathes will destroy it, but perhaps he self-identies as a virus now.Or maybe heaposs trying to recoup the £, he was docked for mis-spending EU funds. Money which came from the UK taxpayer, originally.

The Commons committee called for the Government to set out its timetable to address the breaches identied by a UN committee monitoring womenaposs rights. It comes after a report found that Northern Irelandaposs powersharing crisis had led the devolved government to fail to respond to international human rights obligations. According to the committee, the report also found that the absence of a Northern Ireland Assembly means there are no scrutiny bodies to make sure policies are working well nor any scrutiny of the use of UK Government funds for women and girls seeking an abortion in England. Since the collapse of the powersharing executive in , there have been several signicant developments relating to abortion in Northern Ireland. A UN committee found grave and systematic breaches of womenaposs rights, and the UK Supreme Court identied a breach of human rights in relation to cases of fatal foetal abnormality or where the pregnancy has resulted from rape or incest.    The UK Government also introduced funding for women and girls to access free abortion services in England. Committee chairwoman Maria Miller said the committee heard evidence from a wide range of witnesses both in Northern Ireland and in Westminster. These included doctors, nurses and midwives, lawyers, ministers and officials, organisations representing a range of views, and women who spoke to us about their own experiences, she said. The lack of clarity about the current legal situation is creating confusion, fear and inequality. Our report sets out action which the Government must take to address this. The report calls for the UK Government to set out a timetable within the next six months so that an inidual victim, such as a victim of rape or incest, does not have to take a case to court.    The report also recommended that the Government Equalities Office should publish its legal advice on the scheme funding women and girls from Northern Ireland to access abortions in England. It also stated that the Department of Health for Northern Ireland should reissue guidance for healthcare professionals making it clear that referring patients to the funded scheme is not unlawful. Ms Miller added: We heard of doctors facing a potential conflict between their duty of care to their patients and the law, and between their duty of confidentiality and the law. They still have not been given guidance on referring women to the UK Government-funded scheme providing free abortions in England - which started in . This must be published immediately.    Amnesty International UK and the Family Planning Association welcomed the report and called on the UK Government to take immediate action. Grainne Teggart, Amnesty Internationalaposs Northern Ireland Campaign Manager, said: Devolution does not relieve the UK Government of their obligation to protect and promote the rights of women in Northern Ireland. Inaction is no longer an option. The UK Government cannot remain complicit in the harm caused by the existing abortion regime - the time for change is now. Sarah Ewart, a woman who was forced to travel to England for an abortion after being told her pregnancy had a fatal foetal diagnosis, brought her case to Belfast High Court with support from Amnesty. The judgment is pending on this case. Ms Ewart said: Northern Irelandaposs archaic abortion laws have left women like me suffering for far too long. The UK Government has turned a blind eye and ignored the hurt caused to me and others in my circumstances.

Bowie is fine and resting in his habitat and we will not euthanize him because of the accident.    Jonathan said: “There are many photographs showing me having close contact with a iety of animals when they were young or ones that I had raised.

But the frugal billionaireaposs mean streak was evident long before the famous kidnapping, which has been turned into both a film and a TV series.  The oil magnate’s love of money over family extended to his terminally ill son. Timmy’s tale is perhaps the truest reflection of Getty’s frugality. He was the son of Getty’s fth and final we Teddy Getty Gaston, who died last April aged . In her memoir, the American singer revealed the extent of Getty’s tight pockets. The American-born ­industrialist moaned about having to foot Timmy’s medical bills when he went blind from a brain tumour. While Timmy battled for his le, Getty failed to see him for four years.  The miser missed his son’s birth and, when Timmy died at the age of , Getty did not attend the funeral – sending Teddy a note apologising for being busy. Timmy idolised his father, however. In her book, Alone Together, Teddy remembers Timmy’s love for his father during his dying days in heart-breaking detail. “He was full of love for his dad,” she writes. “ He never knew he was the richest man in the world. He’d heard it but he’d say, ‘That’s what the world sees. I see him as my own darling daddy, whom I love’. How he missed Paul.” She adds: “Sometimes I sat ­quietly beside him while he seemed to be ­thinking and he’d suddenly say, ‘When will he come home  I wish I had a daddy like other boys have. Do you think he really loves me  I wish I could talk to him.’  “‘Well, let’s talk to him,’ I’d say, and we’d call Paul. He’d tell everyone then for days that he’d spoken to his father. He never asked for any material things, all he wanted was to see his dad. He never begrudged the fact that Paul never came. He was too loving… and yet in his heart he needed a father.” So Getty was as absent as he was parsimonious. Teddy never forgave him for failing toto his American home from England during Timmy’s illness, citing it as the reason for their orce in .  In letters sent in the years leading up to Timmy’s death, Teddy pleaded with her husband toand comfort their son. But he never did. Teddy wrote to Getty in : “I know now that you aren’t coming home to us, because I know you don’t want to, and so I have come to the tragic realisation that you have no real concern for Tim or me.” At that time, in , Getty was ­negotiating the groundbreaking deal to secure oil rights in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, which would see him become America’s first billionaire. But not only did Getty refuse tohome – he cruelly built up  hope in his little boy’s mind. He regularly promised to visit Timmy in New York hospitals after his ­operations, but again never did so.  The Getty Oil boss was even heartless enough to complain about doctors’ bills on the phone to Teddy as Timmy lay screaming in pain in the room next door. Teddy remembers bursting into tears and hanging up the call, feeling alone and afraid as she battled the toughest years of her le without her husband. “Timmy needed his father,” she says in her memoir. “I needed him, too. In the days after Timmy’s initial brain tumour diagnosis aged six in , many members of the family, including Teddy’s brother Ware, nephews, nieces and Timmy, excitedly gathered to wait for Getty as the Queen Mary liner pulled into New York, told by the tycoon that he would be on board. But a message from the captain confirmed he had never fulfilled his promise of travelling across the Atlantic. Getty had not only failed to board the ship – he had not even bothered to let his family know.  Two days later, Timmy had to undergo one of his countless operations, hopes dashed of having daddy by his side. Later that year Getty wrote a letter from the Ritz Hotel in Paris which would be callous from a pauper, but was positively cruel from a billionaire. He said: “I hope Timmy can keep away from doctors, except for a  visit. I don’t think doctors can do much for him now, except for a check-up, and that shouldn’t be more than  unless the doctors charge on the ability to pay and not on a tarf and I avoid such doctors.” He told Teddy the money she paid for a pony to comfort Timmy must come out of her own purse.  Teddy died when he was just -years-old. But it was the abduction of his -year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III, that showed the world just what a miser J Paul really was. The free spirited -year-old was living in Rome with his father, J. Paul Getty II when he was kidnapped. He had apparently been trying to woo a Belgian go-go dancer in the Piazza Navona in Rome when he disappeared before dawn on July , . Paul was buying a comic book at a newsstand when he was abducted by three men who knocked him out by hitting him with a gun.  The men drove him to a cave in the southern part of the country and tied him up while they probed the Getty family for the hefty ransom which shockingly his grandfather refused to pay. No-one knows exactly the sequence of events but a ransom note read: Dear Mother: I have fallen into the hands of kidnapers. Don’t let me be killed! Make sure that the police do not interfere. You must absolutely not take this as a joke… Don’t give publicity to my kidnaping.” At first police didnapost believe the boy had been kidnapped but they realised it was no joke when the kidnappers called to say they would send the boyaposs mother one of her sonaposs fingers and demanded million from his grandfather.  Initially J Paul Getty reportedly refused to pay - commenting that he had  other grandchildren. He was quoted as saying that he opposed paying the kidnappers in principle, because it only encourages kidnapping as a criminal practice.

The restaurant, called Under, is in big demand - with more than , people already booked to eat there. But it isn’t the only unusual restaurant where you can dine in style. Toilet humour - Shangai    If you can stomach it, More Than Toilet in Shanghai’s theme is, you’ve guessed it, toilet humour. The dining tables are bathroom sinks topped with glass, and the seats are of course toilets. The food is served in toilet-themed receptacles too. Milk tea is served in urinal shaped mugs, and chocolate ice cream is dished up in toilet-shaped bowls. Not one for the squeamish. Tall order - Kenya    At Giraffe Manor in Nairobi, Kenya, diners have to be happy to get up close and personal with the restaurant’s friendly resident giraffes. The herd of Rothschild giraffe’s delight in sticking their heads through the windows into the dining room whilst guests eat in the hope of being fed some tasty treats.

The idea is that guests are taken on a complete sensory journey where they have to rely on their other senses and embrace the experience without their sight. They even have to go to the loo in the dark. Dead quiet - India  At the New Lucky restaurant in India diners break bread amongst the dead. The diner is built on graves - which the owner believes is a lucky charm. Safe sex - Thailand  Cabbages and condoms was launched in Thailand by Mechai Viravaidya. He said: You can go to any shop around Thailand and you will always find cabbages... condoms should be like cabbages which are ubiquitous and accessible to everyone.” And so the name Cabbages  Condoms was conceived. Mr Mechai believed that condoms should not be seen as taboo but as a necessity, which could save people’s lives from dangerous STIs including HIV AIDS as well as unwanted pregnancy. There are now branches in Bicester and Cheltenham - and after their meals diners are encouraged to take free condoms home with them rather than after dinner mints. Plane crazy - Bolton  In a quiet corner of Bolton sits a Boeing  which houses the restaurant aptly named Steaks on a Plane. The wings have been removed and the plane has been cut in half - but the cockpit is still intact and tables and chairs have replaced the airline seats. The quirky restaurant has been attracting diners from across the country since it took off in . Chop and drop - New York Don’t expect a peaceful meal at Ninja New York. Here Ninjas fly in from all directions whilst you eat, creeping out of cupboards or jumping right in front of you as you nip to the bathroom.

The North Korean leader met Russian President at a summit designed to show that Washington is not the only power able to set the agenda on Pyongyangaposs nuclear programme. Putin wasted no time in telling Kim that he welcomes his efforts to normalise US-Koren relations - saying that Russia would like to help support efforts to resolve the North Korean nuclear standoff. But he also warned thereaposs a lot that needs to be done to develop trade ties between the countries. Putin also said that he expected Kimaposs visit to Russia would help the two countries understand how to reach settlement over the Korean peninsula and develop bilateral ties.  For his part Kim said that the summit will help jointly assess the Korean peninsula issues an coordinate their stances. He added that the talks should help better understand what Russia could do to support negotiations. Mr Kim congratulated Mr Putin on winning another six-year term in last yearaposs election. He noted that their talks will give a chance to exchange views on the situation on the Korean Peninsula.  The two men sit down together on an island off the Russian Pacic city of Vlaostok two months after Kimaposs summit with U.S. President Donald Trump ended in disagreement, cooling hopes of a breakthrough in the decades-old nuclear row. The summit in Vlaostok - the first ever between Putin and Kim - provides Pyongyang with an opportunity to seek support from a new quarter, Russia, and possible relief from the sanctions hurting its economy. For the Kremlin, the summit is a chance to show it is a global diplomatic player, despite efforts by the United States and other Western states to isolate it. Mr Kimaposs first trip to Russia comes about two months after his second summit with President Donald Trump failed because of disputes over US-led sanctions on the North. Mr Putin meanwhile wants to expand Russiaaposs influence in the region and get more leverage with Washington. We welcome your efforts to develop an inter-Korean dialogue and normalize North Koreaaposs relations with the United States, Mr Putin told Mr Kim.  But with Moscow committed to upholding sanctions until the North dismantles its nuclear programme, analysts said the summit was unlikely to produce any tangible help for Pyongyang, beyond a show of camaraderie. In an interview with Russian state television as his train made a stop off on the journey to Vlaostok, Kim said he was looking forward to useful talks. I hope that we can discuss concrete questions about peace negotiations on the Korean peninsula, and our bilateral relations, he said through an interpreter.  Making his first trip to Russia as North Korean leader, he arrived at the train station in Vlaostok on Wednesday on board an armoured train -his preferred mode of international transport. After a brief delay while the train had to be repositioned to line up with the red carpet laid out on the , he disembarked and headed in a convoy of limousines and minivans across a bridge linking mainland Vlaostok to Russky island, the summit venue.

This area of Argyll is the most fragile in the region. The people of Argyll, businesses and visitors deserve no less.Forget the squandering of £m on unreliable, mitigation measures trying to justy a flawed decision made many years ago to use the Old Military Road as a ersion which has failed on many occasions and now has a landslip between the two roads. Forget the expensive excavation of pits by the A rather use the cuttings into the hillside to form a two lane road protected with a flow over canopy with closed outer edges at the four problems gullies. If the contractors on the present scheme can work without any road closures then the flow over canopy option would not lead to closures as many officials and some politicians claim.This is a red herring postponing #a proper solution#. When this is option is completed it will save on the expense of manning the ersion route involving - personnel and - vehicles, replacing expensive nettings, delays whilst the farmer clears his animals and collect his fees. A scandalous waste of public money. Solve The Rest Landslides and stop wasting on mitigating measures.Like Brendan O#Hara I#m neither an engineer or geologist but both of us are blessed with plain common sense. If the Faroese can build a tunnel at £.m per kilometre surely a simple open sided m canopy would cost considerably less. In  at Dawlish .km of double tracked railway and .km of sturdy seawall was built at a cost of £m in eight weeks. Why have we in Argyll after nine years, four dferent Transport Ministers and £m spent and still have no guaranteed safe passage   on The Rest and Be Thankful Follow the Argyll Advertiser#s campaign #Invest in the Rest#. Transport Minister Michael Matheson, Transport Scotland and our Government must abandon their obsession with mitigation measures and fund a permanent solution. We demand no less.Sir,Calls for assurances that the Rest and Be Thankful section of the A will be improved to resist future landslides were made during a session of Transport, Infrastructure and Connectivity questions in the Scottish Parliament.I quizzed transport secretary Michael Matheson, about what was discussed at the last meeting of the A Taskforce in November , and asked what assurances the Cabinet Secretary could give to local residents and businesses who rely on the A being open at all times.The Rest and Be Thankful was closed off for nine days in October  following the largest landslide in a decade, forcing road users to either take a major ersion, or to use the Old Military Road during certain hours of the day.A number of petitions were created during the period of the incident, including one by myself, calling for a permanent solution to the Rest and Be Thankful.The transport secretary said that the meeting was #full and frank#, and that there would be a #review of the potential for additional landslide mitigation measures at the Rest and Be Thankful#, and that this would be discussed at the next A Taskforce meeting in March .There was also a commitment that Argyll and Bute would be #prioritised# in the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.I welcome the assurances by the transport secretary that there will be a review of any additional measures for the Rest and Be Thankful, and that Argyll and Bute will receive priority at the next Strategic Transport Projects Review.Donald Cameron, MSPReserve forcesSir,Last issue#sletter raising concerns about the UK government’s proposed use of the army’s reserve force in the event of a no-deal Brexit is timely.In case anyone out there still thinks a no-deal Brexit is a good idea it’s worth noting that the legal authorityof Reserve Forces Act  allowing the Secretary of State to take this step requires him to establish that it is necessary #for the alleviation of distress or the preservation of le or property in time of disaster or apprehended disaster#.Enough said.Frances Roberts, Ardrishaig"},{"url":null,"title":"strathlachlan cup attracts players from all over argyll","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe annual Strathlachlan Cup Open Pairs indoor bowling competition took place on Saturday February  at Strachur Memorial Hall.There was a good turnout of  pairs with members from Cairnbaan, Colintraive, Connel, Innellan, Inveraray, Kilmun as well as the host club  Strathlachlan.There were some close games in the qualying rounds and the lucky four pairs to reach the semi-finals were Tom Paton and Moira Robertson, Strathlachlan Myra Campbell and Duncan Lauder, Innellan Fulton Ronald, Connel, and Robert Scott, Cairnbaan, and John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs Senior, Strathlachlan.The finalists were Strathlachlan#s John #Joe# Campbell and Ross Speirs v Fulton Ronald and Robert Scott, with the visiting team going into the last end one shot up.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"athletes tackle the crinan puffer","story":"Laura MaxwellUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowOver  pairs of running shoes were strapped on for this year#s Scottish Sea Farms Crinan Puffer on Sunday March .Athletes from as far as Dunoon, Campbeltown, Mid Argyll and beyond came to join the race # billed as one of Scotland#s friendliest and most inclusive running events.

Plans to buy council-owned Dam Park are at an advanced stage. The club, currently top of the Tennent’s Premiership, hope the bold switch will take them to the next level. Ayr would earn a multi-million pound jackpot by hiving off their own land for housing, with builder Cala Homes believed to be preferred bidder for the site. And they plan to use part of the cash for a £, synthetic surface to be laid at their new home. Club chiefs have spent the last year in talks over a move and hope to seal the deal soon.  If the switch is rubber-stamped by South Ayrshire Council Ayr could be playing out of Dam Park as early as . One source said: “It is the move that makes sensethe club is to continue growing. “Next season sees the start of the Super Six set-up with games to be broadcast live on television. “It is potentially a great  for Ayr and bringing the club into the heart of the town can benefit so many.” The switch would see Ayr Seaforth Athletic Club on the move to a new sporting centre planned for Craigie. And junior side Whitletts Victoria couldto the heart of their community with a revamp of the old activity complex on the cards. Ayr rugby supremo Billy McHarg said talks on the move are progressing well.  He said: “Discussions to this point have been positive. “We’re keen to work with all parties to find the right solution and one which will benefit the whole town. “We feel that Ayr Rugby Club coming into the town centre would be a big step forward.” Club members would still have to approve such a move. Ayr have been at scenic Millbrae since . Prior to that they played out of Newton Park, Dam Park, the Old Racecourse and King George V playing fields. Whitletts chairman John Dalton said: “Talks have been very positive and we are currently looking at alternative options. “The football park at Whitletts is the obvious route to go down and would represent ahome to our roots. “A lot of water is still to go under the bridge but as Ayr’s junior football club we are viewing this as a positive opportunity.” Craigie councillor Ian Cavana said: “It may be that a deal is close but nobody will be moving anywhere until the new sports centre at Craigie is up and running. “Work is due to start on that next summer and that’s when we should see real progress.” A council spokesman said: “Discussions on the future of Dam Park are ongoing.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnSouth Ayrshire CouncilAyr NewsAyrAyr Rugby"},{"url":null,"title":"canoodling teens blight playpark kids","story":"NewsCanoodling teens blight playpark for kidsAnger at the Ayr seafront beackparkShareByEdwin Lawrence:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsTeen frolics on the chute - crime prevention boss Alec Kelly hits out \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailTeenagers fooling around at a playpark spoiled the fun for younger kids. An alarmed grandfather heard his nine-year-old grandson shout for help at the Ayr seafront playpark. The wee boy had gone for a shot on the £, tower complex, which has several chutes. But canoodling teens made the youngster climb over a ledge to get past them. And then they pushed him down the chute, prompting his cry for help. Grandfather Alex Kelly, who is chairman of South Ayrshire Crime Prevention Panel, said: “It was Saturday night about  o’clock and we had been for chips in Ayr. “My grandson wanted to go down to the seafront for a shot on the new tower. “I thought I would just stay in the car and let him go ahead but I could see there were a few teenagers, aged  or , hanging about. “My grandson was off and running and away up the inside of the tower. “The next thing I knew he was shouting for help at the bottom of a chute.” Alex added: “He told me what had happened and I wasn’t too happy. “I also saw a dad take his wee girl from inside the tower as she was intimidated by the older kids on it. “I didn’t want to confront the teenagers but I did phone the council. I don’t think it’s acceptable to let teenagers intimidate children in these circumstances. “There should be some kind of supervision that doesn’t involve the police, although the council seems to think the police should be involved.” Alex, of Maybole, reckons there were six young teenagers at the top of the tower, three boys and three girls. He said: “In the good old days we had park keepers to deal with this kind of thing.” A council spokesman said: We are happy that our play parks are popular, but anyone using them should act responsibly. There are plenty of places for parents, s and carers to supervise their children in the play park.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":null,"title":"dynamite plan give ayr great","story":"NewsDynamite plan to give Ayr a great futureAll sorts of buildings such as Matalan, Odeon and Waterfront pub would come downShareByStephen Houston:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsBack in use - the old rail bridge would become an inner ring road \"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA radical plan to rescue Ayr town centre has been published – and it’s sure to provoke astonishment. That’s exactly what the creators of the Bruce Plan want in a bid to stimulate a real future for the stricken town. The #AyrDeservesBetter campaign want people to sign up to the cause for real action. And Rob Close, chief writer of the -page document, said: “We want real action not yet another expensive consultant’s report. “We have written this for free – now we want our elected leaders to actually do something.” The details of the Bruce Plan – named after King Robert who routed English troops from Ayr – can only now be revealed. The controversial idea, devised by Rob, a Mastermind contestant and Radio  Brain of Britain finalist, involves flattening buildings throughout the centre. And that includes working businesses: ● Matalan ● Mr Basrai’s World Cuisines ● The Odeon ● Sports Direct ● The Tam o’Shanter petrol station ● The Waterfront bar restaurant Wrecking balls will also be brought in to demolish the old Orient cinema Babylon nightclub. This is a key part of the new inner ring road which would utilise the old rail bridge over the River Ayr and replace a traffic system regarded as bonkers. The railway station would finally be annexed from the old hotel and built several hundred yards south at the old Townhead yard. The group see this as “critical” to the future of Ayr. It is thought Network Rail would favour this as certain s at present cannot take the extra long trains now required on the route. The bus station would be relocated to the Matalan Sports Direct site.And the Stagecoach bus station would become part of a new culturalquarter.Rob Close, an historian and architectural author, is working closely with architect Pat Lorimer, the spokesman for #AyrDeservesBetter. Rob said: “I appreciate some may disagree and that I have made no attempt to cost it. “But the cost of doing nothing and allowing the town to crumble in the face of unrelated decisions by successive South Ayrshire Council administrations is much more of a risk – financially, socially and aesthetically. “I feel this plan begins to look like a town that many more of us will want to live in. “People can have a go at itthey wish, but at least it gives us something to focus minds on.” The -strong #AyrDeservesBetter are a think-tank of Ayr partisans. Miller Road and Fort Street would become part of the inner ring road, with the historic Sandgate largely access only. This ring would slice through the Orient cinema site, cut through the Aldi car park, the Waterside bar and into Fort Street. Seven piers of the old fishmarket railway bridge still exist and could provide the support for a new structure The Bruce Plan has drawn ideas from a  map of the town centre. Unlike some towns there are physical constraints such as the river, bridges and railway line that cannot be moved.The #ADB advocates the entire bottomend of the High Street no longer beinga shopping area, and all businessesclustered from the centre towards the top of the town, anchored by the Ayr CentralMall.Businesses in Miller Road including LA Bowl would be encouraged to relocate to the central core and for it to become largely residential again. South Ayrshire Council has already advocated demolishing the Citadel pool and sports hall and creating a new one at the Kyle Centre. The group proposes the Station Hotel becomes council offices and the railway buildings on the other side of the track to become social enterprises. #AyrDeservesBetter say the town centre developed piecemeal over the past  years without an overal plan. With  empty shops and buildings there is now need to have compression rather than an expansive retail area.Matalan or even Marks  Spencercould become tenants in the Hourstons building.Details of the Bruce Plan also call for no methadone prescriptions in the town centre. A free bus would operate to include the river and seafront and parking for the first three hours would be free. Extra parking could be created on the old Afflecks factory via Sandgate. It is mooted a public competition to re-design Burns Statue Square after the Odeon and Burns House are brought down. A cultural quarter of town would include the Gaiety Theatre, Mecca Bingo, the nightclubs of Arthur Street and the Mercure Hotel. The Plan states: “Some of the ideas for rescuing Ayr could be re-located here, such as LA Bowl and Fury’s from Nile Court.” Rob hopes the ideas can gain traction and adds: “I know such a scheme will come to fruition onlythe council, and our national governments, show the will and find the money.” And Pat Lorimer acknowledges it might be pie in the sky, but said: “It is very important pie in the sky. “At the moment people are twiddling their thumbs and thinking about putting a traffic island here or there. “This is radical.” To get behind the new movement email info@ayrdeservesbetter.org.uk.

It is feared either below par casting or a low quality bronze may be causing problems for Icarus. For the past  years the bronze sculpture has adorned the entrance to the Scottish International Aerospace Park at Prestwick. Thousands of drivers pass him every day - and some think he’s a double for former Celtic striker John Hartson. It was commissioned by the now defunct Enterprise Ayrshire and created by the firm where Kelpies sculptor Andy Scott was lead designer. An expert who brought his fears for the sculpture to the Ayrshire Post said: “This should not be happening and my eye can also see cracks that have obviously had some filler work done. “This should not be happening. Good bronze should last without issues for generations. I just wonderon a cost basis the foundry used low quality bronze.” Untrained eyes can see rust developing on the back of Icarus’s wings and on the globe he stands on. Between his feet the surface seems dimpled and stained. One theory is it could be bronze disease, similar to what rust is on iron-based material. The matrix of copper and tin that forms bronze is attacked by hydrochloric acid which can combine with chloride in sea water. On most days Icarus is hit by salty moist air from the sea just half a mile away. In Greek mythology Icarus flew too close to the sun and his wax wings melted. He fell into the sea and drowned. An academic at Brown University at Rhode Island said: “If left untreated, bronze disease will continue to eat away at the metal to the point of complete destruction of the artact.” A study into the condition of Icarus is now to take place. A spokeswoman for Scottish Enterprise said: “The statue at Prestwick Airport was commissioned some  years ago by the local enterprise company, Enterprise Ayrshire. “We have instructed an inspection of the statue and remedial work will be undertakenrequired.” Icarus sculptor Andy Scott now lives in the US and was keen to look at images of him. He said: “Icarus was sculpted by my former company Scott Associates Sculpture  Design and I was lead sculptor. “It was cast in bronze by Beltane Studios in Peebles. It was based, I remember, on a design drawn by a local school pupil. I’ve not personally seen the sculpture for some time. Last time I did it looked just fine. Bronze does not rust. It patinates with time, and the color does alter in the environment.”Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnJohn HartsonPrestwick AirportUniversities and CollegesEducationAyr"},{"url":null,"title":"new 40m leisure centre ayr","story":"NewsA new £m leisure centre for Ayr High Street will open in Arran Mall is earmarked for flagship facilityShareBySarah Hilley:,  APR Updated:,  APR NewsCitadel Leisure Centre Ayr\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA new £ million leisure centre for Ayr High Street is due to open in  the council has revealed.

A project co-ordinator will be hired to oversee the ambitious venture at a cost of £, for four years. A report on the plan said: The creation of a leisure hub would increase footfall and extend the active hours of this area of the town centre, allowing more nightle to thrive and more community activities to take place. A design brief will start within the next few months and engagement with stakeholders is about to kick off. South Ayrshire Council estimate the design and construction of the Citadel replacement would take three years.

It is one part of the councilaposs town centre strategy and action plan, which was given the green light by Leadership Panel councillors this week.

That’s because Joe, who has died aged , was a one-man citizens’ advice bureau. Joe was incredibly well-versed on how local government works. And he knew the right people to contact in a range of agencies, including South Ayrshire Council. In recent years, Joe was best known as chairman of Riverside Tenants and Residents Association. But he was equally weel kent in the Lochside and Wallacetoun areas - working passionately to improve the housing stock. Joe seemed to be involved in everything pertaining to housing and community issues. He worked alongside Shelter, learning about legislation on homelessness. He also had close links with Riverside Evangelical Church and the Salvation Army - respecting the wonderful work they do in the community. Joe was also involved with the John Pollock Centre, the Mainholm Advice Centre and was on the Community Planning Board. He was a member of the late lamented Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forumwhich provided a focal point for five communities in Ayr. Joe Lafferty hailed from Newarthill, Lanarkshire, and was a choirboy in his youth. He loved singing right up to his untimely death, being a member of the Ayrways Choir, which helps people with breathing dficulties. In his late teenage years and throughout his s, Joe worked abroad for much of the time. He was a project manager on building sites in countries including Nigeria and Pakistan. Joe ed to Scotland after his marriage to Jean, and became aware of the need for communities to have a voice. This became the driving force in the second half of his le. David Burns, South Ayrshire Council’s former head of housing, said he was sorry to hear of Joe’s passing. Mr Burns added: “He was a wonderful gentleman, always taking a keen interest wherever he felt there was a benefit for the community orhe felt ideas would have a detrimental impact on people. “He also made sure I kept my feet on the ground and often said, ‘Don’t change your ability to listen to the community boy, and you’ll do just rightly.” Joe was highly thought of by many senior SAC managers, and often engaged in banter with them, to make his point. Colleague and friend Pauline Mackie said of Joe: other. “He was never a man who shied away from his own past mistakes and was always very courteous and generous about others as well. He was never a man to bare a grudge. “His wisdom and knowledge along with his sense of humour made him legendary . People were drawn to him even though it meant not getting much of a word in once he got started. He was always courteous and never lost his sense of humour. “Joe also believed in sharing the knowledge he had gleaned over  years, believing knowledge would empower people and communities.” Pauline added: “ Joe, myself and Jackie Lennon considered ourselves the Three Musketeers in the Wallacetoun and Newton Regeneration Forum. “I believe we did make a dference to a lot of people, but sadly the project came to an end.” Joe’s funeral service will be held at noon at Masonhill Crematorium on April  - which would have been his st birthday. He is survived by Jean and their sons, Jack and Jamie, of whom he was immensely proud, and who, like their dad, have worked abroad.Like us on FacebookFollow us on TwitterDaily NewsletterTheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordSubscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribeMore OnAyrAyr News"},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article14564550.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/0_18934953.jpg","title":"partick thistle chairman shares tweet","story":"NewsPartick Thistle chairman shares tweet showing injured wrist after celebrating Jags win against Ayr UnitedJacqui Low led from the front as Partick gained a massive win in their battle to beat the drop.ShareByStuart Wilson:,  APR NewsJacqui shows off her injured hand, left, and chats to boss Gary Caldwell before last nights clash\"Get the biggest daily stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA football chairman took one for the team last night - after injuring herself celebrating a vital three points.

Corum say: “It would ideally suit the large family or indeed those clients downsizing from a larger property given the facility of all on the level accommodation.” There is broad reception hall, formal lounge, family TV room, large games room with full size snooker table, rear dining room or extra bedroom. A handy office has a window to the rear and there are three double bedrooms, one of which is en-suite. The modern family bathroom has a bath and separate shower. The loft is floored so feasibly there is room to supersize. Outside the mature gardens offer a pleasant mix of soft and hard landscaped areas including extensive lawn with mature trees and borders. The monobloc carriage drive gives access to a double garage with remote control access. And the agents point out the back garden enjoys south westerly sunlight.

The event involved a successful partnership between South Ayrshire Council, Scottish Rowing, University of West of Scotland and Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. And it’s believed to be the first time in  years that an organised water-based activity has taken place on the River Ayr. The event was designed to encourage young people to interact safely with the river and get fit and active at the same time. Many of the participants will be undertaking Duke of Edinburgh Gold Awards in the summer and this event was the perfect warm-up. All the young adults were given a safety briefing by representatives from Scottish Rowing, the council and South Ayrshire coastal rowing clubs. They were then allocated their equipment before the group all had the opportunity to try out a single scull, open canoe and a costal boat, setting off along an m course. During the day they all received expert tuition from experienced rowers and instructors. Belmont Academy pupil Alex Crooks, aged , said: “It was something new, a new experience. “I’m doing canoeing for my Duke of Edinburgh award, so it’s about getting experience of the water and the river. I enjoyed it.” Ben Gilmour, aged , a pupil at Prestwick Academy, said: “It was good. “We get out and do free things and it’s good way to spend your time, instead of playing the X-Box! “I do sailing and I do figure skating but I’ve never come out and done loads of watersports . “This has been good and you get to meet new people as well.” It’s hoped that the programme will spark renewed interest in rowing and watersports, given the River Ayr’s proximity to Ayr Academy. Backing the event was the RNLI , who through their Respect the Water campaign, were able to reinforce the key messages about staying safe. The participants were also given a waterproof mobile phone cover, along with literature about water safety, as a thank-you for taking part. Tess Crooks who goes to Belmont Academy said: “It was a fun and enjoyable day, I would like to do more and get to learn new skills on the water.” Ryan Matthews, an apprentice from GE Caledonian, said: “It was a very enjoyable experience and good training for my DofE Gold canoeing expedition later in the summer. “It also made me realise the fitness required for this type of activity and how I need to get fitter.” Councillor William Grant, Children and Young People Portfolio Holder for South Ayrshire Council, said: “South Ayrshire has outstanding natural resources available to everyone. “This is a great way for young people to explore nature, increase their confidence and learn new skills at the same time. “We need to respect all our waterways but rivers should also be enjoyed and the young people taking part clearly had a great time thanks to the expert supervision.” Vincent McWhirter, RNLI Volunteer Community Safety Officer said: “We have  miles of coast line from Barassie to Ballantrae with four main rivers and numerous lochs all of which are very attractive but can also be potentially dangerous, so it was really worthwhile to teach the young people new skills and at the same time learn about the hazards but in a fun way.” If you are interested in taking up rowing, you can contact Scottish Rowing https:www.scottish-rowing.org.uk , Ayrshire Coastal Rowing Clubs: Troon

This mast should provide an lsquoemergency servicersquo for all the local residents and businesses should our land lines fail, as they frequently do.ldquoThere have been many occasions when accidents have happened with no means of getting help.ldquoThis will also be a great asset to tourists and traffic passing through our valley.The local branch of the National Farmers Union, which counts  members, has also thrown its weight behind the proposals.In a support letter, Selkirk branch secretary Rory Murray writes: ldquoIt is vital that in todayrsquos connected world, basic services now include the provision of a reliable mobile network, and not just for the obvious benefits to rural safety, should people be stranded without signal.ldquoA solid G signal will transform many agricultural-based businessrsquo ability to complete basic tasks that are now exclusively online, as the time constraints poor mobile phone signal and broadband signal places on rural businesses is a very real worry for our members.Despite this, Scottish Borders Council has received nine letters of objection to the plans, with objectors citing the height of the mast, the impact on the landscape and the potential detrimental impact on property prices.Mr Brian Russell, of Selkirk, writes in his objection letter: ldquoThat the Ettrick valley must have mobile masts is disappointing to those of us who came here to escape such things.ldquoOf course escape is now becoming impossible anywhere on this island, but at the very least we had hoped to be allowed to live far enough away from a base station not to be adversely affected.ldquoHealth concerns for masts and cell phones are largely discounted now, but itrsquos as well to remember that the questionable safety of very profitable technologies may not come out for decades after their introduction, e.g. in the s and s there was widespread use of agrochemicals. I was a farmer at that time and was told they were perfectly safe. Many of the chemicals we were using then have now been banned as unsafe for one reason or another.ldquoI fear the same sort of thing will happen with mobile technologies, the overuse of which masts like this one will encourage ndash technologies which are described as essential but are more often than not simply recreational or convenient.In a submission to council planners, the developers have tried to address some of the issues raised by the objectors.Damian Hosker, the principal planner at WHP Telecoms, writes: ldquoG connectivity enables iniduals and businesses to work and ecommerce effectively from home.ldquoThis means that car travel can be reduced which has a positive effect on the environment.ldquoMobile connectivity creates a sustainable community and promotes environmental issues.ldquoThe proposal is set against the backdrop of the forest.

A local tradition claims that the name Markle is actually a corruption of the word miracle, a reference to this legendary intervention of the saint on that day.This event is now seen as the lsquobirth of the Scottish flagrsquo, the Saltire thereafter becoming the flag of Scotland the tale is well told by the Scottish Flag Trust in the doocot by Athelstaneford Kirk, which has been wonderfully adapted into the Flag Heritage Centre.But why was it St Andrew who came to the aid of the Picts and Scots on that day and not, say, St Columba  The answer to this question may begin in a ,-year-old crypt in Northumberland.This crypt lies underneath the abbey of Hexham, a town in northern England. The crypt is an amazing survival from Anglo-Saxon times, built in the seventh century, more than  years before the Battle of Athelstaneford is said to have taken place.The crypt was part of a monastery built on the orders of the then abbot Wilfrid and it had a special purpose.Wilfrid was a passionate devotee of St Andrew. He had travelled to Rome and ed with a relic connected to the saint. Christianity at this time had not yet fully established its dominance, and Wilfrid was determined to create a great Christian holy site to encourage the spread of his faith.And what better way to do this than use a relic of St Andrew, an Apostle of Jesus himself So he established St Andrewrsquos monastery at Hexham in AD , and in the crypt below there was a shrine, in which the relic of the saint was kept.Pilgrims began to flock to the site and, although small, the design of the crypt gave an intense religious experience.The entrance was by the high altar of the church, with dark passageways for the pilgrims to file towards and pay homage to the relic of St Andrew.Even today, the now-empty shrine has the atmosphere of a sacred inner sanctum. The ancient feel of it is added to by the fact it was constructed with stones taken from abandoned Roman buildings, as Hexham is close to Hadrianrsquos Wall and the Roman garrison town of Corbridge.But what is the connection with the miracle at Markle The connection begins with Wilfridrsquos successor Acca, who became the abbot of St Andrewrsquos in Hexham in AD . He had travelled with Wilfrid and shared his devotion to St Andrew. It is said Acca acquired his own relics of St Andrew and added them to the collection at Hexham.But Acca the abbot was an evangelising monk. In AD , he left Hexham and journeyed beyond the old crumbling Roman wall and further north.It was around this time that East Lothian became part of Northumbria. But the kingdom beyond the seawas the land of the Picts.The story tells us that Acca met with the Pictish king Angusat a place called Kilrymont in Fe. Here, we are told, Acca gave the Christian Pictish leader some relics of St Andrew he had taken from Hexham and urged the king to create a new centre of Christian pilgrimage for the saint.From the limited historical accounts available, it does seem that it was indeed around this time that the religious site of St Andrews in Fe was established, at the place previously called Kilrymont.Further evidence of this is the amazing St Andrews Sarcophagus, which was discovered at St Andrews in the early th century. It can now be seen in the cathedral museum, where it is described as ldquoone of the finest examples of early medieval sculpture in Europe. It dates from the mid-s and was almost certainly commissioned by Angus for his own burial. He died in AD .And so the veneration of St Andrew in Scotland had begun well before the miracle at Markle, with King Angus resting at St Andrews in his magnicent sarcophagus. No wonder, then, when a later King Anguswas in need of ine intervention in AD , the saint he prayed to was St Andrew, who is then said to have replied in such a legendary, dramatic fashion.Here is the connection between the crypt at Hexham and the miracle seen at Markle: the relics of St Andrew brought to Fe which began the Scottish attachment to the saint may well have been part of the Hexham collection.But wait a minute! Thatrsquos not the story I have always been told when I go to St Andrews. The oft-told legend is that it was St Rulewho brought the relics to Fe in the fourth century. He was the bishop of the Greek city of Patras, where St Andrew was crucied.The story tells us he had a dream in which he was told that the relics of the saint, which he was the custodian of, were in danger and he must set sail with them. The dream told him that wherever he was shipwrecked, there the relics would find their new home.After months at sea, his ship was wrecked at Kilrymont in Fe. And so he established a new shrine and re-named the place St Andrews. No mention of a Northumbrian abbot, or relics from Hexham in this story!What are we to believe  There is often a haze between history and legend and they sometimes meet in a place too misty for us to see. Historical truth can be an elusive creature. You think you have grasped it when suddenly it slips away, leaving you searching once again. And sometimes a lost historical truth is to be found hidden in a legend.In the tale of St Andrewrsquos relics, history will side with the abbot, I suspect, but the romanticised and dramatic tale of St Rule has become the more popular and well-known explanation.But the reason for this is another story in itself.With thanks to Anna Blair, whose tale lsquoSaint and Saltirersquo inspired my research into this story."},{"url":null,"title":"council-planners-accused-of-having-a-lack-of-knowledge-of-their-own-policy","story":"A planning application to build the three-bedroom home and a detached garage on the outskirts of Camptoun Holdings, a small hamlet two miles north of Haddington, was refused by the local authority for the second time in five years.However, the applicants have now lodged an appeal in which they claim the planning officer who turned them down did not understand the policyused to make that decision.They claim that the house, which would be built on land currently occupied by derelict agricultural buildings, should be classed as an ldquoenabling development because they say it would improve the area.In an appeal which will be heard by the councilrsquos Local Review Body next month, they state: ldquoThe planner, in the pre-application response, did not accept that the proposed development was an enabling development.ldquoHowever, it is submitted that this conclusion only serves to demonstrate the lack of knowledge of the development process.ldquoTo allow for the removal of derelict buildings and reclamation of an unkempt siterequires third-party intervention.ldquoThe applicant is submitting a proposal for a single dwelling house and garage absorbing the costs of demolition and reclamation.ldquoThe development will bring substantial improvements to this rural brownfield land and improve landscape quality as well as visual and residential amenity.East Lothian Council has a planning policy which bars new housing in the countryside unless exceptional circumstances can be established.The plans for a house at Camptoun Holdings were first lodged with the council in .On that occasion they were refused and the Local Review Body rejected an appeal.Agents for the applicants this time around will argue that there has been a change in circumstances at the site, which has deteriorated further over the years.The Local Review Body meets in Haddington on Thursday, May ."},{"url":null,"title":"new-exhibition-highlights-history-of-musselburgh-athletic-fc","story":"The display was officially opened by Billy Brown, a former Hearts and Bradford City manager, who comes from Musselburgh and is a former Musselburgh Athletic manager, at a reception in the Old Town Hall.On show at the High Street museum is a iety of memorabilia relating to lsquoThe Burghrsquo, including trophies, medals, strips, pennants and photographs.

possibility of creating a ldquopavilion with toilets in the style of the pagoda recently demolished, as well as a series of paths and information cairns.Pippa Swan, chairwoman of the community council, was ldquosurprised to receive an email highlighting an upcoming meeting, which is due to take place on Wednesday, where discussions will take place on the plans for the park.She pointed to the public consultation which took place last year in the townrsquos Bleachingfield Centre.At that time, a display featuring a series of images and information boards highlighted potential changes to the park, including new seating and picnic benches, as well as a maze and parkour course.Long-term aspirations also included the suggestion of creating a replacement pavilion with access to public toilets.Winterfield Pagoda, also known as Winterfield Pavilion, which had stood in the park since the s, was torn down by East Lothian Council in March .ldquoIn general, there was no massive enthusiasm for proposed changes, adding paths or parkour, or anything , said Mrs Swan.ldquoI was taken aback that East Lothian Council had seen fit to continue with a masterplan.Mrs Swan, who was previously DELAP chairwoman, also noted that budgets were increasingly tight at the local authority and funding would likely have to come from external organisations.She added: ldquoI still feel immediate priorities should be addressed first and scarce resources addressing immediate wishes of the community as expressed in the first instance.A spokeswoman for East Lothian Council said work to develop ldquoa programme of improvements for the park had been ongoing since .She said: ldquoFrom the outset it was made clear that financing any improvements would be challenging but that in itself was not justication for ignoring the need.ldquoThe benefit of having a masterplan in place means thatopportunity presented itself, either by way of outside funding or sources of materials, inidual elements of the plan could perhaps be delivered without detriment to the wider plan.ldquoThe council has used this model of planning very successfully on a number of other sites, the most recent being Ormiston Park where signicant improvements have been delivered.ldquoFollowing the most recent meeting to discuss the draft masterplan, the council was advised by the steering group that, although work was still required on what the plan should contain, the general principles of delivering improvements were still widely supported by the local community."},{"url":null,"title":"seven-year-old-praised-for-taking-action-to-stop-dog-fouling","story":"Seven-year-old Ava Lily Davidson, a P pupil at Stoneyhill Primary School, was inspired to make

Even after the Damascene conversion of arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg, who used to described her deal as ldquovassalage, her final attempt to get a stripped-down Withdrawal Agreement through Parliament failed on Friday by a substantial majority. You have to give May full marks for her consistency: everything she touches turns to dust, even her own resignation.But thatrsquos by the by. As everyone has been saying: we are where we are. And where we are is extremely uncomfortable. Brexiters are gearing up to have a belly laugh at the opposition MPs, who will do their best throughout the coming week to find a compromise. Who do they think they are  Playing at being a provisional government  ldquoItrsquos like allowing the whelk stall to be run by the whelks, according to the Tory MP Sir Bill Cash. Butno-one  is able to run the eponymous stall, then all power to the whelks.Last weekrsquos indicative votes suggested that MPs are broadly in favour of a Brexit that keeps Britain in the EUrsquos economic loop while leaving the political institutions. Curiously, the SNP, who have been arguing for soft Brexit in two white papers and an election manesto, decided not to vote for the ious options, even the Norway model that they have long extolled. The SNP did, however, vote for the proposal from the Labour MP Margaret Beckett for a confirmatory ballot, and this option got the largest number of votes, much to everyonersquos surprise. This must be a serious possibility now that Parliament has failed to resolve the Brexit conundrum.However, this is not a Peoplersquos Vote as some have styled it. A confirmatory vote is not a rerun of the  referendum, but strictly a chance for voters to give their views on whatever deal Parliament agrees . The Kyle Wilson Amendment originally envisaged putting the Prime Ministerrsquos deal to a popular vote, assuming it was passed by Parliament. However, this confirmatory referendum might be dficult to schedule because it could collide with three other elections: a Tory leadership election, the European elections and a General Election. Brenda from Bristol will be in despair.EvenMPs fail to come up with a working compromise, they can still block a no-deal Brexit. The majority against leaving the EU without a deal is overwhelming. This means May, or her successor, will have to go cap-in-hand to Brussels in the next few days and request another, longer delay to Article . This would mean Britain participating in the European elections in May, which excites the Independent Group of Tory and Labour rebels, but is looked upon with dread by the main parties. Brussels too is worried about populist contagion spreading to other EU countries like Italy, but they are legally bound to make British participation a condition of any further extension to AVoter wrath, particularly in Labourrsquos leave constituencies, could lead to a dramatic revival of Nigel Faragersquos Ukip, or worse. The Svengali behind the  Vote Leave campaign, Dominic Cummings, is gearing up for the fight and reportedly suggesting a new party to fight for the right to leave. ldquoTell them again is the favoured slogan. The European elections might themselves turn into a kind of second referendum on Brexit.The Tories will presumably have a new leader by then, since Theresa May will surely go now there is to be the long extension she has resolutely opposed. Mind you, it is impossible to guess the Prime Ministerrsquos thought processes. She said she would goher withdrawal deal passed on Friday. But her gambit didnrsquot work. Even the opportunity to dispense with Mayrsquos services was not sufficient inducement for the Democratic Unionist Party to come on board. The joke doing the rounds last week was that she tried to fall on her sword and missed.But these things have a momentum of their own, and the Tory leadership election has already begun. Boris Johnson is the narrow frontrunner, but that could change. He might win the membership, but under Tory rules the parliamentary party has to agree the two candidates put to a postal ballot. The remainers in the Tory benches might use this as an opportunity to foil the hard Brexiters by keeping Boris off the list.Of course, what should happen when a government fails to get its most important legislation through Parliament is not a leadership election, but a General Election. The government cannot govern and, even with the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this should lead to a General Election via a vote of no confidence. Some Conservatives might prefer to fight a General Election than European elections they had promised would never take place. But events are now out of everyonersquos control.Everyone, that is, except the EU, which now holds Britainrsquos future in the balance. Itrsquos trying not to crow about Britainrsquos abject national humiliation, but the , not the UK Parliament, will now decide the UKrsquos immediate future: deal or no deal. If MPs agree this week to back a soft Brexit involving the customs union and alignment with the single market, Brussels has promised to fast-track it in a matter of days. But the alternative, a long extension, will also suit the European Union.That means more money from Britainrsquos budget contribution, and serves as a warning to other EU countries about the dangers of trying to leave the Union. It also holds out the possibility of Britain remaining in the EU,a referendum is eventually staged.Well, that remains to be seen. What is perhaps more likely is that Britain gets stuck indefinitely in a long extension. It emerged last week that the Democratic Unionist Party, which again voted against Mayrsquos withdrawal deal, could live with a long extension. Indeed, they signalled that they could live with a customs union ndash as long as it ensured no border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. The DUP may be Brexiters, but they are ardent Unionists first.A soft Brexit may now be the best way of keeping the UK together. But it should be put to the people in a confirmatory vote,for no other reason than this was not what most people thought they were voting for in . MPs have the opportunity to decide this tomorrow.How and why Theresa May failed to seek the only kind of Brexit that could get through Parliament will be left for historians to judge. One of her own Cabinet ministers, quoted on BBC Newsnight, gave the provisional verdict: ldquoShersquos the sole architect of this mess because of her inability to engage in the most basic human interaction.

However, speculation about optimal currency arrangements after independence is, well, precisely that. Scotland has yet to decide that it even wants to be independent, and debating the minutiae of monetary policy is not going to win many converts. Whatever Nicola Sturgeon says today about the new road map to Scottish independence, we know itrsquos not going to happen for some time. Not until the dust has settled on Brexit, at the earliest.That leaves a host of monetary imponderables. What will Scotlandrsquos relationship be to the UK  Will it be broadly confederal, as envisaged in the  Independence White Paper, or totally separate  Will the UK still be in something like a single market with the European Union  Will Scotland have a single market with the UK, or will there be a hard border at Gretna  Will the UK Government make le dficult for an independent Scotland, or might Westminster offer incentives to keep Scotland in the broad UK financial orbit Then therersquos the euro, which was hardly mentioned in last yearrsquos Sustainable Growth Commission Report, the SNPrsquos bible on managed independence. To join the euro requires, in theory at least, the possession of an independent currency. However, the EU would likely be so keen to ease the path of Scotland into the EU that it could make the terms for joining very attractive. Terms Westminster might want to match, who knows.Everyone seems to think that an independent Scotland would be a bit of a basket case, like Greece in , or Ireland in the s, or even Venezuela today. This is carrying national pessimism, and Unionist propaganda, too far. Greece and Ireland were economically backward countries who joined fixed currency arrangements with more productive neighbours. That left them with an over-valued currency, which made their exports uncompetitive, and the state burdened with debt it couldnrsquot inflate away.Scotland is a wealthy country with high earnings and labour productivity, bankable natural resources and a sophisticated financial sector. Indeed, the problem for an independent Scotland, were it to introduce its own stand-alone currency, might be that the currency appreciates too rapidly, making Scottish exports uncompetitive the other way, rather as happened to Denmark in the s.International finance is aware of the  billion barrels of known oil reserves in the North Sea, evenUnionist politicians donrsquot talk about it in front of the children. Scotland is emerging as a world leader also in renewable energy, possesses formidable intellectual capital in her world-class universities and has a flourishing tourist industry. Scotland also has, by the by, a commodity that accounts for nearly a quarter of all UK food and drink exports: whisky.The fear that Scotland, even with the spending deficit left by the Barnett Formula, would be seen as a bad financial bet is almost certainly . This isnrsquot Venezuela or Nigeria, or Ukraine or Greece. Scotlandrsquos posture towards the international financial markets should be one of strength and confidence, and not fearful insecurity.And while a stand-alone currency might give maximum financial control, a currency union should not be dismissed as incompatible with independence. France and Germany are in a currency union but they are still independent countries. There is a reason why small countries like Slovakia, Slovenia and Latvia, are enthusiasts for the euro, even though it diminishes national sovereignty. This is because it makes for currency stability and ensures a level playing field.However, toto my initial argument: talking about currency is getting the financial cart before the constitutional horse. Therersquos a good practical reason why most countries seeking independence betray a studied vagueness about currency arrangements: they just donrsquot know how things are going to pan out.Read more: People more open to case for independence over Brexit, says Nicola SturgeonWhen the Czech Republic and Slovakia decided to go their own ways in the Velvet Divorce in , they thought initially that a currency union would make sense. It rapidly became clear that it didnrsquot. So they split in a fairly improvised way ndash at one point sticking stamps on bills to indicate which country they belonged to. But it worked. After initial disruption ndash and letrsquos be honest, any financial separation involves disruption ndash Slovakia powered ahead, with a devalued currency and flat taxes. It has been one of the fastest-growing countries in the EU ever since.Slovakiarsquos is not a course that social democratic Scotland would probably wish to emulate, but then it wouldnrsquot have to. Scottish independence,and when it arrives, will anyway be a process not an event, and will take place over a number of years, perhaps decades. When Australia became ally independent, along with Canada, following the Statute of Westminster in , it pegged its currency to the UK pound, and then evolved its own.The row in the SNP is essentially about austerity, not the merits of an independent currency. The First Minister has broadly accepted the Unionist argument that Scotland would be burdened with a pound billion deficit upon becoming independent, and that it would have to reduce that by curbing public spending for a decade. Her critics, led by the former MP George Kerevan and the Campaign for an Independent Currency believe that Scotland would be chained to the Bank of England and that the spending constraints would be similar to George Osbornersquos in . But even Mr Kerevan accepts that adopting a new currency would take time ndash about five years.It is commendable that the SNP should be thinking about the mechanics of currency, but it canrsquot do so in the abstract. There are many ways to skin the currency cat.

But does that necessarily make him the person you want to be prime minister  I would venture not.Mr Kerr suggested Mr Johnson had never cultivated an image among Scottish voters, who did not view him as an attractive figure. Indeed party sources have suggested to The Herald that during the  independence referendum campaign the London MP was deliberately kept out of Scotland for fear his presence would have a negative effect on the No campaign.The Stirling MP warned thatScottish Tories did not create enough of a distinctive brand, then they could become ldquoabsorbed in some of the backwash from having Boris Johnson as leader.Although he made clear that the ldquostop Boris mood within Tory ranks at Westminster was such that he did not believe the -year-old politician would succeed Mrs May as leader. Indeed, Scottish Tories have established ldquoOperation Arse to try to prevent Mr Johnson from ever becoming PM.Stressing this was his own personal view, Mr Kerr said the Scottish party should already be a distinctive entity and have a relationship to the UK party similar to Germanyrsquos right wing CDU CSU parties.The backbencher added: ldquoWersquore Conservatives who share some of the same common principles and values but we are distinctive because we are Scottish Tories and Unionists.

The SNP is still frozen in the headlights, hoping for some sort of deliverance to show up from an external source.Scottish Socialist Party co-convener Colin Fox, who was part of YesScotland in , added: ldquoThe First Minister continues to preicate over IndyRef and seems at a loss to make a more compelling case for Independence than hitherto. It looks more like a tool of party management than a step to winning independence.Ms Sturgeon also announced aCitizensrsquo Assembly, based on examples in Ireland, in which a cross-section of Scots under an independent chair would debate Scotlandrsquos future. But she failed to sayit would shape the next independence prospectus.Brexit Secretary Michael Russell will also ask the other party leaders at Holyrood to enter cross-party talks on devolving more powers.The First Minister urged the parties to consider the challenges posed by Brexit ldquoopenly, not dig in behind a ldquofixed position, but the Tories said they would boycott the exercise.Backed by a - vote of MSPs, Ms Sturgeon first requested a Section  order for a second referendum in March , but Mrs May refused.After SNP losses in the snap  general election, Ms Sturgeon ldquoreset her plans, and promised a ldquoprecisetimescale on Indyref by autumn of , when the terms of Brexit were supposed to be clear. However she repeatedly delayed an announcement because of Brexit uncertainty.Although that uncertainty remains, Ms Sturgeon said she could not wait ldquoindefinitely to protect Scotlandrsquos interests.She said Brexit threatened Scotlandrsquos economy and its workforce, and hence the tax revenues needed to pay for vital services such as health and education.She did not offer a date, or explain how she could extract a Section  order from London, but said preparations needed to get underway to allow a vote by .She claimed most Scots wanted a vote on independence ldquoalthough opinions y on timing. Recent polls suggest most Scots oppose independence and oppose a vote in the short-term, although a majority would accept one after a decade.She told MSPs: ldquoOne point of clarity has surely emerged over the past three years, even for the most ardent opponent of Scottish independence: the Westminster system of government simply does not serve Scotlandrsquos interests and the devolution settlement in its current form is now seen to be utterly inadequate to the task of protecting those interests. In other words, the status quo is broken.She went on: ldquoMy job as First Minister is to reach a judgment, not simply in my partyrsquos interest but in the national interest. In doing so, a key priority is ensuring that we learn the lessons of Brexit.ldquoTo rush into an immediate decision before a Brexit path has been determined would not allow an informed choice to be made. However,we are to safeguard Scotlandrsquos interests, we cannot wait indefinitely.ldquoThat is why I consider that a choice between Brexit and a future for Scotland as an independent European nation should be offered later in the letime of this Parliament.ldquoIf Scotland is taken out of the EU, the option of a referendum on independence within that timescale must be open to us. That would be our route to avoiding the worst of the damage that Brexit will do.However she acknowledged Holyrood could not hold currently a referendum.She said: ldquoWe do not need a transfer of power such as a Section  order to pass such a framework bill, though we would need it to put beyond doubt or challenge our ability to apply the bill to an independence referendum.ldquoThe UK Governmentrsquos current position is that it will not agree to transfer power, but I believe that that position will prove to be unsustainable.ldquoBy making progress with primary legislation first, we will not squander valuable time now in a standoff with a UK Government that might soon be out of office.ldquoWe will seek agreement to a transfer of power at an appropriate point during or shortly after the billrsquos passage, on the basis that it will be exercised when this Parliament - and no other - considers it right to offer the people of Scotland a choice.Western Isles SNP MP Angus Brendan MacNeil predicted a referendum in autumn , telling the Herald it was good that the First Minister had ldquoput the focus back on independence after appearing to prioritise a Peoplersquos Vote.His SNP colleague, Tommy Sheppard, the MP for Edinburgh East, added: ldquoThere is no point waiting until disaster happens before planning how to survive it.ldquoIndependence offers Scotland the best way to survive Brexit and,nothing changes at Westminster, we need to be ready to move fast.A Downing Street spokesperson said the  No vote should be respected, as both sides said they would do that and ldquothat is what needs to happen.Acting Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw said that, despite her spokesman describing it as ldquoinclusive, the First Ministerrsquos speech was ldquoinherently isive.He said: ldquoAstonishingly, the First Minister thinks the way in which we come together is for the people of Scotland to be plunged into another isive referendum within the next  months.ldquoIt is a ridiculous and even disgraceful skewing of her priorities with the real priorities of the country.ldquoThe SNPrsquos plan is clearly to ide families, workplaces and communities all over again, and for the foreseeable future. That is not what the majority of Scotland wants.ldquoPeople have had enough of constitutional politics and ision. Yet, with the SNP, more of this is now inevitable.Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said: ldquoThe timing of this statement is nothing to do with where we are in the chaos of Brexit. It has nothing to do with where the polls are on the creation of a separate Scottish state.ldquoThe timing of the statement has everything to do with the First Ministerrsquos party conference taking place in just three daysrsquo time. The First Minister is using this parliamentary  as a party  and, in doing that, she is devaluing the office that she holds.ldquoThe First Minister knows fine well that there is no evidence whatsoever that the people of Scotland want another independence referendum, and that is no wonder when the chaos of Brexit throws into sharp relief the challenges of leaving a political and economic union.Scottish LibDem leader Willie Rennie added: ldquoThe First Minister hasnrsquot done the one decent thing that people in Scotland want her to do, which is to take her campaign for independence off the table.ldquoNicola Sturgeon should look at the damage caused by Brexit and the ision it has caused and learn a lesson. Breaking up is hard to do.The last thing the country needs is another isive independence campaign. We should not repeat the mistakes of Brexit. The First Minister should make it stop now.Greens MSP Alison Johnstone said: ldquoWe have always believed that Scotlandrsquos future should be in Scotlandrsquos hands, as an independent nation at the heart of Europe. The Brexit shambles has only confirmed our belief that we would be far better governing ourselves.She welcomed the Citizensrsquo Assembly, but warned it must not ldquosimply be a talking shop and said her party would put pressure on SNP ministers to ensure the new body shaped government policy.Scottish Secretary David Mundell said: ldquoPeople in Scotland voted decisively in  to remain part of the UK, on a promise the referendum would settle the issue for a generation.ldquoInstead of respecting that result, Nicola Sturgeon continues to press for isive constitutional change when it is clear that most people in Scotland do not want another independence referendum. The UK Government will stand up for them.ldquoNicola Sturgeon needs to listen to the views of the Scottish people and concentrate on improving Scotlandrsquos economy and schools, not continually trying to orchestrate upheaval and ision.Caithness LibDem MP Jamie Stone said the First Minister was the ldquohostage of the extremist wing of her party.Edinburgh South Labour MP Ian Murray added: ldquoNationalism is killing our country but the SNP will not stop until it gets what it wants at any cost.

But I suspect the party faithful will realise this announcement furthers their cause not a jot.Martin Redfern,Woodcroft Road, Edinburgh.THE political situation in the United Kingdom is a veritable Pandoras Box of misunderstandings, unravellings, hubris, nostalgia and gross incompetence.It truly takes a careful observer patience and acuity to work their way through the morass.Observers from outside the UK watch with disbelief as the Conservative Party tries to hold itself together against the assaults of its internal and external opponents.The disdain that has been shown by the Conservative leadership to the European negotiators is only equalled by that shown to the other nations of the UK.Now in Scotland, we find ourselves on the cusp of a new stage of political development which will go forward despite the opponents mantra of \"too wee, too small, too poor\".The previous three years have shown such levels of Government incompetence and inhumanity that there has been a clear sht in Scottish self-awareness. Despite the chorus of hostility against the Scottish Government by all the major parties who support the Union, it is being seen by many outside the UK that Westminster is a busted flush.The Conservative Partys policies of the two-child family, the bedroom tax, the hostile environment of the Home Office to the Windrush generation and other BAME families have exposed Westminster as deeply uncaring. The treatment of low-paid British workers and benefit recipients has been beyond belief for someone like me who was born at the end of the Second World War.Nicola Sturgeon has been promoted by many as a competent and humane leader. She has throughout the Brexit negotiationstried to find solutions that embraced the economic and social needs of the whole of the UK and of European citizens of the UK and UK residents in Europe.She is not without faults. Her support for the Growth Commission has caused many pro-independence supporters to feel disappointment. There are many of us who want to see the great opportunities that control of our own economy and currency can bring.The currency debateis a healthy one.

Far from having a banana republic currency, a Scots pound would be stronger than sterling. The top-secret McCrone Report of the mid-s said that Scotland would have one of the strongest currencies in the world. It would still be strong today because Scotland has a balance of trade surplus, while the UK runs a deficit of around pound billion a month.

Off-sales have been approved from am to pm Monday to Sunday.However, among ious conditions imposed by the licensing standards team, it was also agreed that the outdoor space to the rear of the premises will not be utilised by customers until a full licence is granted.The licensing board heard from Audrey Junner of agents Hill Brown Licensing that BrewDog had no intention to trade by way of occasional licences for an extended period of time.She added: “We would like to reassure members that a provisional premises licence has been submitted… for the avoidance of doubt my clients wholly accept that no assumptions can be made about the grant of that provisional licence.“They have undertaken the fit-out works at the business entirely at their own risk.”But licensing standards officer Lisa Gordini reminded the board that while a provisional licence had been applied for, it would not be discussed until the board’s June meeting and could receive representations or objections which could impact on BrewDog’s operation.She maintained there was an argument that the board should not be granting any occasional licences which may “conflict with the consultation process” of the provisional licence application.After considerable debate, board member Robbie Withey proposed refusal of the application, saying the authority expected a six-month consultation period to process applications and that the company – which operates  bars around the world – should have applied sooner.data-src\"https:images-o.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.inverurieherald webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Andy Beattie will be honoured with a new road named after him at Midmill Business Park\"  Honour for football manager viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"INVE | Article Teaser\"But admitting that the application was “a dficult one”, Gwyneth Petrie proposed making an “absolute exception” to usual practice and proposed approval."},{"url":null,"title":"strong demand at thainstone sale","story":"Over , buyers and sellers attended Thainstone#s collective sale of plant, machinery and equipment on Saturday, April .The sale saw an outstanding , lots forward, and the auction team sold  per cent of all items entered both on-site and online.Commenting Mark Barrack, Head of Specialist Auctions at ANM Group, said: “A strong crowd of buyers was present last week at our April collective auction, which saw consistent prices achieved for good quality lots across all categories.“The day’s leading prices came from two JCB CX excavators which were purchased using our online bidding  and sold to a buyer in England.

We know that breastfeeding can be challenging, but we also know that a problem shared, is often a problem halved. Ensuring that all breastfeeding mums have a reassuring and supportive network is vital.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

People in Orkney have waited long enough.

In the event of any archaeological discoveries of interest, SSEN Transmission has said it is committed to ensuring these are fully documented, preservedpossible, with the findings shared with interested parties.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Whether she’s done enough to satisfy her followers remains to be seen, but it is clear Sturgeon understands the dangers for the independence cause of losing another referendum and the importance of waiting for consistent signs of majority support in the polls.: Nicola Sturgeon calls for independence referendum by It’s fair enough that, as a Scottish National Party First Minister, she should make plans for a referendum – the clue is in the title. But surely everyone in Scotland, on both sides, can agree that Sturgeon must not take the ‘Theresa May approach’ to losing a vote – just keep repeatedly asking the same question. That’s not worked on MPs with May’s Brexit plan and think of the dismay and isionScotland finds itself facing up to IndyRef in a few years’ time. So those plans should stay on the shelf until there is a sign of a substantial sht in public opinion. On the other side of the argument, it is a mistake for the Conservatives and other Unionist parties to simply try to wish independence away. They need to make an active case for the Union and Scotland’s place in it.Scottish Tory MSP Murdo Fraser recently called for the constitutional make-up of the UK to be changed following the country’s departure from the EU to create a ‘quasi-federal’ United Kingdom. Whether that is right or not, he is at least trying to think of ways to make the Union more appealing to Scots, to seek a settlement that could turn out to be a lasting one.: Kenny MacAskill: Sturgeon did NOT just call for independence referendum by This is still a relatively finely poised debate. If a no-deal Brexit is thrown into the mix, it may well boost support for independence, particularlythe economic damage to the UK is severe. The softer the Brexit, the lower the price will be and the greater the chance that Scotland will accept le outside the EU despite voting - per cent in favour of Remain.The next few years are likely to be heady ones and so perhaps the most important thing is not actually Brexit or independence, but this: remembering to be respectful, considerate and kind to each another.

Elaine C Smith will sit on its board, which will be chaired by former Nationalist MSP Dave Thompson.: Nicola Sturgeon calls for independence referendum by The launch comes a day after Nicola Sturgeon set out her plans at Holyrood for a second independence referendum by . It has been set up by the Scottish Independence Conventionafter a fundraising drive last year. A small team will be hired to develop and run campaigns, carry out research and to support other grassroots independence organisations across Scotland.: Recap: Nicola Sturgeon makes statement on IndyRef to MSPsItformally launches at the Scottish Storytelling centre on the capital’s Royal Mile this morning.Ms Smith, who chairs theSIC said: “The UK is in the middle of a political crisis and we’re launching because, important as the views of politicians are, there are many more voices in Scotland which need to be heard as we debate our future.“About a third of those voices are definite independence supporters and about a third are definitely not. We’re all about opening conversations with the third of people who are in the middle, who are undecided or are doubting their previous opinions.”Although pro-independence, the body describes itself as non-political and will seek to generate “big, open conversations” with the aim of winning over wavering Scots.The launch comes just two days ahead of the SNP conference in Edinburgh on Saturday, but both the SIC and Voices for Scotland are keen to distance themselves from the party machines.Mr Hegarty said: “It’s a genuine privilege to be involved in a grassroots organisation that’s all aboutlistening to the aspirations and concerns of the people of Scotland, and especially one that’s committed to having these open conversations in such a respectful way. “I look forward to hearing many of those conversations, and to working with such a talented and committed group of people as those involved in Voices for Scotland.”Polls show that support for Scottish independence has not moved signicantly since the  referendum when % voted Yes.The new body is largely funded by small donations from the public. Its board members include Greens co-leader Maggie Chapman and human rights lawyer Aamer Anwar. The bodyhas pledged to speak “without a party political accent” but instead listen to the concerns of voters and how they can be persuaded to vote Yes.But Pamela Nash, chief executive of Scotland in Union, said: “This is yet another anti-UK campaign group that will only be talking to a minority of people in Scotland.“Regardless of how many campaigns to leave the UK are established, they will be unable to produce a positive vision for breaking up the UK because there isn’t one.“The majority of people in Scotland know we are stronger together and want the SNP and its allies to drop plans for a isive and unwanted second independence referendum.”For all the latest Scottish news, sport and features click here, or head to our Facebook, Twitter and Instagram pages.©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"nicola sturgeon issues rallying cry for indyref2 within next two years","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...Nicola Sturgeon has issued a rallying call to Nationalists to help build a majority for independence as she unveiled plans to hold a second referendum within the next two years.It came as the SNP yesterday launched a revived “Yes” campaign intensying the prospect of a repeat of the  referendum in response to the Brexit turmoil.: Poll: When would you like indyref to be held The First Minister’s plans were branded “absurd” by opponents at Holyrood yesterday, who accused her of seeking to stoke up grievance and ision just five years after the last vote on leaving the UK.Ms Sturgeon also faced claims that she was seeking to placate Nationalists ahead of the SNP conference in Edinburgh this weekend.New legislation will be brought forward at Holyrood by the end of the year which would provide the framework for the vote, the SNP leader announced yesterday.But the Scottish Governmentwill hold off seeking a Section  order from Westminster which has control over the constitution, including referendums.

It will beon the statute book by the end of the year, with Constitution SecretaryMike Russell to set out the details next month.Ms Sturgeon added thata section  order from Westminster would only be required further down the line to apply the bill to anindependence referendum. TheFirst Minister branded the UK’s government’s refusal to grant Holyrood the authority to hold such a vote as “unsustainable”.But she added: “We won’t squander valuable time now in a stand off with a UK government that may soon be out of office.“We will seek agreement to a transfer of power at an appropriate point during or shortly after the bill’s passage, on the basis that it will be exercised when this parliament and no other - considers it right to offer the people of Scotland a choice.”But Downing Street last night gave short shrt to the prospect of a Section  order being granted which would transfer authority to Holyrood to stage another referendum.“As we have repeatedly made clear, Scotland already had an independence referendum in  and voted decisively to stay in the UK,” the Prime Minister’s spokesman said.“This should be respected.“Our position hasn’t changed. Both sides agreed to respect the result of the  referendum - that is what needs to happen.”The Scottish First Minister has slammed the breakdown of Westminster politics as the Brexit date of Match  was missed amid widespread factionalism, resulting in a six month extension agreed. She added: “The Westminster system of government does not serve Scotland’s interests.“And the devolution settlement, in its current form, is now seen to be utterly inadequate to the task of protecting those interests.”An attempt to seek consensus with pro-union opposition parties was also set out by Ms Sturgeon as she insisted there wascommon ground on a the attack on Holyrood’s powers in the recent Brexit bill and over the impact of potential hardline migration restrictions on Scotland after Brexit.“The fact that we do not agree on Scotland’s ultimate destination should not stop us travelling together as far as we can,” Ms Sturgeon added.Mr Russell has been asked to explore with other partiesareas of agreement on constitutional and procedural change.A “respected and independent inidual” may also be recruited to broker discussions.“I will write to party leaders today and Mike Russell will be in touch with their nominated representatives thereafter to consider how these discussions might be progressed,” the SNP leader said.“And this should be an exercise –parties can find it within themselves to do so – this should be an exercise that doesn’t start with the fixed positions of any of us – but one that considers the challenges Scotland faces and what solutions might help us to address them.“If serious and substantial proposals emerge, this Parliament could then present them to the UK government in a unied and united way.”Scottish Conservative interim leader Jackson Carlaw insisted there was no majority among scots for a second referendum - a condition the First Minister had previously attached to “Whatever the First Minister says about being ‘inclusive’, her statement is inherently isive,” Mr Carlaw added.“Astonishingly, the way Nicola Sturgeon thinks we can come together is for Scotland to be plunged into another isive referendum within the next  months.“That is frankly absurd. The SNP’s plan is clearly to ide families, workplaces and communities all over again, and for the foreseeable future. That is not what the majority of Scotland wants.“People have had enough of constitutional politics and ision. Yet, with the SNP, more of this is now inevitable.”Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard insisted the statement yesterday was about placating SNP members ahead of the party’s conference this weekend. Nicola Sturgeon is using her office as First Minister to put the interests of the SNP before the interests of our country,” Mr Leonard added.“Her statement today is not about Brexit, this is about Nicola Sturgeon trying to pacy her party members and backbenchers ahead of the SNP’s conference.“The chaos of Brexit throws into sharp relief the challenges of leaving a political and economic union. The Brexit shambles has only confirmed our belief that we would be far better governing ourselves.“Leaving the UK would lead to unprecedented austerity for Scotland’s public services.“The political iding line in Scotland is clear: investment with Labour with a focus on fixing our public services and economy or another decade of austerity with the SNP and the Tories with a focus on isive and destructive nationalism.”But Alison Johnstone, co-leader of the pro-independence Greens said her party was ready for a second referendum campaign.“Scotland’s future should be in Scotland’s hands, as an independent nation at the heart of Europe,” Ms Johnstone said.“The Brexit shambles has only confirmed our belief that we would be far better governing ourselves.“The vision currently being considered by the SNP looks more like the failed economic model of the UK, a vision which has led to cuts to public services and increasing child poverty, than the bold vision for independence the Greens campaigned for and believed in.

Chief whip Maurice Golden said: “Like all the other warm-worded stunts the Nationalists suggest, the chances are this will have no positive impact at all. Citizens have already voted for an assembly – it’s called the Scottish Parliament.”Citizens assemblies have been used in countries including Australia, Canada and the US to address a range of complex issues. The Irish parliament established one to address abortion after a decision had been made to have a referendum on the issue. That assembly, which involved  people meeting in Dublin over a series of weekends, considered the country’s abortion laws over a five-month period in - and produced a report which ultimately helped to shape the proposals that country’s abortion law.In the UK, several groups and politicians have suggested adopting a form of citizens’ assembly to find a way to break the Brexit impasse. Former prime minister Gordon Brown has said the extension to Brexit would allow time for assemblies across the country be established to develop new approaches and re-establish trust lost between MPs and their constituents.AskedScottish Labour backed the idea, a spokesperson said: “Scottish Labour backs more powers for the Scottish Parliament, a federal UK and a reformed House of Lords, so we’ll always take part in constructive, meaningful debate – as we did during the Smith Commission.”Alison Johnstone of the Scottish Greens said she welcomed the idea, but added: “This body cannot simply be a talking shop. We will put pressure on the Scottish Government to ensure that this body is listened to and shapes government policy.” Labour MP Stella Creasey who backs an assembly to look at Brexit, has said Citizens’ Assemblies “help politicians hear what the public think, not replacing parliamentarians but producing reports to inform the decisions elected representatives make”. ©JPIMedia Ltd. .Cookie Settings"},{"url":null,"title":"scottish independence first minister held to sturgeon test of indyref2 support","story":"Sorry, were having problems with our video player at the moment, but are working to fix it as soon as we canWaiting for Video...The First Minister has been urged to stand by her own #Sturgeon Test# on holding a second independence referendum as she prepares to address MSPs on her plans for a second vote on leaving the UK.

Let’s therefore hope that this week the First Minister stands by her own words, and doesn’t cave in to her activists ahead of SNP conference.“Nicola Sturgeon should uphold the Sturgeon Test. Scotland doesn’t want yet more referendums – we want to move on and focus on the things that matter: improving our schools, making our streets safer and growing high quality jobs in Scotland.”A stand-off currently exists between the Scottish Government and Westminster over a second referendum. Power over the constitution lies with the UK government and Prime Minister Theresa May has so far rejected Sturgeon’s demands insisting, ‘Now is not the time.’A poll by the pro-independence Progress Scotland organisation earlier this month concluded that support for independence had fallen to below  per cent.But SNP deputy leader Keith Brown, who has been tasked with preparing the case for a second independence campaign, said Brexit turmoil has seen a backlash against the pro-Union parties in Scotland.“Since , across Westminster, the SNP have often been the only adults in the room, the only party focused on offering a serious sensible way forward out of the Brexit mess,” he said.“The Scottish Tories have completely sold out Scotland’s interests over Brexit and are happy to let Westminster do whatever they want to Scotland. “Meanwhile, Labour are quietly signing up to deliver a Tory Brexit – against the wishes of the people of Scotland – and without putting the issue back to the people. Labour and the Tories no longer have a positive vision to offer the people of Scotland. They are running scared of any debate over Scotland’s future.Sturgeon’s comments at the manesto launch came before the Brexit vote later that year which saw a majority of Scots vote to remain in the EU as the UK voted to leave.

I do not suppose former councillor Jonathan Wills would care to comment nor for that matter Gary Robinson, the former Council Political Leader. #Nota Bene#, yesterdays men to the fore as they say every picture tells a story!!!.So after the country voted to leave these clowns think we should vote again with remain or remain on the ballot. No leave option.#Put it to the people#.!Thought they did ..!Very proud of the Shetlands for making a stand. If only every town in the UK stood as tall. Well done Shetlands!!#The Shetlands# did they have a march there too First of all, I would like to say # I am European #. The Brexit fiasco is nothing more than for this government to have a trade deal with the USA, by sanctioning the EU referendum to distance ourselves from Europe and to be more culturally linked to the USA. Nothing could be further from the truth. The psychological brainwashing of the xenophobic political uprising has brought to the fore the extreme, darker and fascist aspects of our society and how we are slowly but surely destroying the very fabric which makes up our society of every creed, colour, nationality, gender orientation and the iety of many aspects which we regard as the makeup of society. Brexit, by its very nature, erodes these values we hold dear and directs us into a more extremist political way of thinking. This is not what we should be advocating for our society and our future.The last time I looked the UK was still physically attached to the continent of Europe . As well as being English , Welsh , Scottish or Northern Irish we are all European . We # leavers # like Europe a lot, we strongly dislike being part of the dictatorial , undemocratic , unaccountable European Union . OK  The official EU view on independent Scotland EU membership:“The EU is founded on the Treaties which apply only to the Member States who have agreed and ratied them. If part of the territory of a Member State would cease to be part of that state because it were to become a new independent state, the Treaties would no longer apply to that territory. In other words, a new independent state would, by the fact of its independence, become a third country with respect to the EU and the Treaties would no longer apply on its territory.”i.e we shall be automatically out of the EU # with #NO DEAL# # from Independence Day.Have the EU’s treaties changed, meanwhile  No.However, it#sjoining rules have changed. It will take us, at least, ten years to rejoin, accepting the euro, the Common FIsheries Policy and austerity invoking budget restrictions to manage our large budget deficit.So why is the SNP stamping about, #greetin der een oot#, about Scots #being dragged out of the UK against their wishes#, when their defining policy, independence, will take us out, unlikely, ever to rejoin Humbug!# EA_Scotland_and_the_EU#Whether or not one is in favour of Brexit, how many people truly knew what they were voting for in   Misinformation and disinformationflew about like panic stricken puffins and some politicians loved it.So much of what was involved came to light over the time which has elapsed and STILL confusion reigns. Thank goodness the leadership during the Second World War was not as pathetic as the present incumbents are.Meanwhile, those nations over the other side of the English Channel must be wondering why the Brits are allowing themselves to be so humiliated ..What about the  that stayed away# So very true today.Spot on Ian !! Voters don’t always get the chance to change the government, but they may want the chance to change their mind.You may be cheering the overturning of the democratic vote now, butthey get away with it we will all be losers. Be careful what you wish for you may just get it.Well, the #Put it to the People# march was in London in that there England, so I#m unsure why Quitters are making an issue of the numbers. The debate afterwards was billed as an open debate, and only one cockney Quitter spoke, so make what you like of that.Why go to the unnecessary effort of changing my mind  Parliament, the commentariat and most of the mainstream media seems perfectly happy to do that for me. And while they’re at it why not move the goal posts, change the game and rewrite the rules as you go along. Quintessentially EUropean modus operandi.Our major export markets are Japan and China. That is unlikely to change either.British markets of old will not be ing to the past and arguments made that this will happen is extreme naiveté.The commonwealth is far bigger than Australia. Much of it developing economies expanding far far faster than Australia is or ever will. You are right though Oz will have to keep selling to China because China owns vast swathes of Ozzy industry and mining. I for one will be delightedwe have a much closer links with Australia, New Zealand but they are hardly super stars of economic growth.I do not know of a single UK made item in any of my families ious homes.Ali says “ theyget away with itwe will all be losers”. Boo-hiss! Really  If Boris, Farage, Rees-Mogg and chums get away with it most folk will be worse off, with the few laughing all the way to their offshore banks. And that’s the point # them taking control to profit from their vision of a backwards looking low-tax-for-the-rich Britain of biddable serfs. Ali should be careful whose bidding he is doing by defending May’s hollow deal.Perhaps my previous point might distress Ali lessI rephrased it. Not all of the electorate who seek a change of government achieve this at election time. That’s parliamentary elections for you, particularly under first last the post. We get one day of enjoying the freedom of maybe changing the government and have to put up with the outcome for some years before the next time. However, in the terms of this referendum # brought on to placate those ideologues who bankrolled lawbreaking in their dishonest campaign, well # some folk might have changed their minds + days on. Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever. Why not make sure we really want it Peter, you so waffle on! Ignoring your obviously obsessive-compulsive dogma, reference Boris, Farage,biddable serfs and assorted socialist claptrap, I will take issue on one point only here. Your  statement,#Unlike an unpopular government, Brexit would be forever#, that is manest nonsense. After Brexit, Europe will still exist. The EU, on present developments, may well implode at any minute. Spain, Greece, Italy even Franceseem to be moving away from the suffocating mire of Brussels, Junker, Barnier and undemocratic cabals of theEU. Brexit would never be forever It is just the start of an equitable move towards democratic change and true democracy in Europe, not the present cartel of faceless unelected bureaucratic parasites and overpaid freeloaders.You keep harping on about Boris, Nigel and Jacob asthey were the only proponents of brexit. You steadfastly ignore the other . million people because of course you obviously are so much smarter and nicer than them so their votes don#t count. What I wonder is what will the political elites decide to ignore next time we votethey get away with it this time. How about we have a vote about the SCT andwe don#t like the outcome we vote again until we do get the result we want. Or may until they get the result they want which is contrary to what you want. How does democracy work in your fantasist mind Marc Petit, Superstars! I love Aus but economic Superstars, what planet are you on  Australia has a masive land mass, fantastic mineral resources yet is so outperformed financially by India, Canada, and with half the GDP of the UK . As my Aus brother would say, #A few stubbies short of a six-pack. A few sandwiches short of a picnic#. Now get real your comment marc,#we are superstars of growth # it must have been a petit and low starting point  years back.@Mark Petit,Thanks for that, very interesting. Do you think that the Australia-Japan Economic Partnership is helpful by removing tarfs from Japanese goods imported into Australia and vice versa for your agricultural exports to Japan  Whereas having no trade deal with the EU presumably means that goods from both parties are subject to tarfs  The EU is very protective of its agriculture.I#m assuming Australia would find a UK trade deal helpful by removing UK tarfs on your agricultural produce e.g. fruit and wine, and making British goods much cheaper to Australians than they are now What a wonderful attitude and comment from Marc Petit, #These goods Japan et al are cheaper and generally regarded as better .# as our goods are all manufactured under EU protocols and Marc claims are clearly poor quality, just another really good reason to move on. I quote, World Financial Review # Australia has become one of the first countries to finish signing off trade deals with Britain# and The Financial Times, #Australia to fast-track UK trade pact in event of no-deal Brexit# so you see petit comments from Mr Petit,are just that and no more.!!So, Boris Johnson has now changed his mind. Let’s respect his right to do so, but couldn’t the public have done so too And May took her deal twice to the Commons,but she won’t take it once to the commoners. At least you know where you are with the Tories # kind of.Only % of voters think May’s deal is a good deal, but we are meant to shut up and swallow it,her party can back it,she’ll go. How dare anyone speak up against this insulting nonsense Ali’s alt-right guided jibes are remarkably handy. Non-fantasist Ali draws a telling distinction between self-interested Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Jacob Rees-Mogg on one hand, the “political elite” on another hand,and the millions who fell for the demonstrablelies of the Brexit campaign cheats on yet another hand still. I am not of course forgetting those voters. I’m pointing out who misled them and why.To adapt Roald Dahl: these laddies from the upper crust. Does he really not see that they are political and elite  It’s troubling.Ali might care to note I am not calling him a member of the alt-right here, buthe continues to unthinkingly parrot their offensive arguments conclusions will be drawn. Non-obsessivecompulsive Ian might similarly do well to dwell on the benefits of avoiding ad hominem arguments. Whilst he has managed at times to play the ball not the man, Ian sadly is more than habitually inclined to foul, and thereby be judged foul in turn. If he repeatedly takes the same self-defeating approach and expects a dferent result# well conclusions may also be drawn. Can’t these lads raise their game Again you only want democracypeople vote the way you tell them. That#s not democracypeter has got it wrong again there was no cheating in the leave side#What started out as a witch-hunt by the political establishment in what they thought was the largest political scandal investigating Cambridge Analytica and Goddard Gunster’s alleged involvement in the Leave.EU referendum campaign, has today been proven to be . Instead, the Electoral Commission fined us on technicalities and an overspend of £,, not the £, originally presented by them on £ million overall spend. The fines were reduced and the Judge accepted the technical breaches were ‘mistakes’ rather than calculated wrong-doings and crucially held there were ‘no findings that Leave.EU had been dishonest.#”#.Does Ian mean the .m who were lied to by self-serving cheats  Ian might be interested in this from the Chair of The British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee:The referendum result was NOT #the will of the people# # certainly not following the revelations since.Thank you for asking the people to vote again.Can we also put it to the people in Shetlandthey still want to live inside a windfarm  How many times do we get to vote Past comments on referendums from David Davis MP could soothe or enrage frustrated Leavers. Speaking to parliament in  he said: We should not ask people to vote on a blank sheet of paper and tell them to trust us to fill in the details afterwards. For referendums to be fair and compatible with our parliamentary process, we need the electors to be as well informed as possible and to know exactly what they are voting for.#theyworkforyou says former Brexit Minsiter Davis received £, for  hours work for JCB this year, and that he generally voted against a statutory register of lobbyists. Coincidence  Maybe not. Does Ian still insist rich and powerful Brexit-backers aren#t out for themselves #neo-fascist German AfD party leader# revolting female, but elected to the German Parliament, I repeat elected!!! Now, Peter, can you see the reason we need out. Even you must now see what the E Union is doing with its Proportional Representation and revolting political systems. Neo-Nazi elected into the German Parliament, enough said.Fascism cannot be defeated by nationalist-navel gazing. The far-right are cooperating across Europe, trying to heighten a sense of crisis and undermine confidence in the institutions which they hope to control. Ian#s approach isn#t simply ahistoric. It is dangerously naive. His phrase #revolting female# normalises misogyny.Recognising the threat, not allowing ourselves to be ided and working with our neighbours to the greater good is the only way to keep the far-right at bay internationalism, standing together, kindness, respect. It is less than two years since Farage was speaking at an AfD rally. Ian should be more skeptical about the real motives of the brains behind Brexit. The David Davis#s quote shows they knew what they were about. Rich financiers, newspaper magnates and populist politicians have schemed together to break electoral law, lie to and manipulate the public to bring Britain to this precipice. Meanwhile all some have had to add is jeers. That said, Ian did manage to make his last ill-considered contribution without needless insult. Hopefully, now that he can see who has been pulling his strings, he will be able to accept he has been had. The referendum wasn#t won. It was stolen. Dangerous days are ahead.##and who keeps the far left, or even just the left for that matter, at bay Extreme left, extream right. Two sides of the nastextremist coin There is no dference, the sad thing is what Alice Weidel said was and isperfectly true on this occasion. If the European Union#sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable , way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for. The reality #the brains behind Brexit# or rather the driving force, that would be Tony Blair, Osbourne, Cameron, Junkers, Barnier, Tusk, Salmond. Sturgeon et al. They are the ones that did so much to alienate the UK public. They are still doing just that.Aprime example today from Junker, # April is the ultimate deadline for approval of the Withdrawal Agreement by the House of Commons,# Juncker told the European Parliament. #A #no-deal# at midnight on the th of April is now a very likely scenario. It is not the outcome I want. But it is an outcome for which I have made sure the EU is ready.# Just food for thought does that mean Junker has a special place in Hell reserved as Tusk previously intermated !!!Er, dunno Michael. Of late the whiter-than-white far-right have distracted the nation away from dwelling on the harms of austerity with a isive, dishonest Brexit campaign that’s resulted in unparalleled spikes in hate crime, Muslims attacked at prayer, Europeans and U.K. born citizens told to go back to where they came from, malicious devices left of train tracks, a plot to murder an MP and the murder of another. The left largely seem intent on taxing the rich, investing in public services, ending poverty, housing thehomeless, reducing demand on food banks and educating the ignorant. If that ever becomes a problem I’ll give Michael’s question some thought. Until then equating the left with the far right doesn’t seem quite fair.Btw. has anyone heard Ian describe Farage as a repulsive male  Farage might be described a repulsive person or man but never a repulsive male.For some reason the term “female” in Shetland social media is chosen as a pejorative.There is quite a bit of work to be done before the repulsive elements of the present era are behind us.Meanwhile the rich are set to increase their share of global wealth from % to % by .So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Non-revolting Ian attacks the leader of German#s AfD, then agrees with her.He holds that Cameron wasn#t given enough concessions by the bad EU to feed his far-right Tories, and that Cameron is also to blame. You can#t weaken fascists by giving them what they want. Its not in the nature of the beast.Labour MP Rosie Cooper, target of a neo-Nazi murder plot, was praised in the House of Commons yesterday by the Home Secretary and the Leader of the House. In her speech she thanked the organisation #HOPE not hate# who campaign against racism and fascism, who helped to save her le.The title highlights the far-right#s aim to create the sense of alienation which Ian so willingly feeds. Ian has outed himself. Little more needs said, other than that at least with PR the far-right do their work in plain sight. In the UK they lurking within the Conservative Party and tell themselves they#re free thinkers.Dennis Skinner, Tony Benn, George Galloway, Kate Hoey etc etc etc according to Peter these are far right racists for wanting to leave the undemocratic euAccording Bernie Sanders,an open door immigration policy is incompatible with a welfare state. According to Peter this makes him a far right fascist.It is such a shame Peter Hamilton has to lie so. His words #So there it is, in his own words: Ian Tinkler endorses a far-right approach to Europe. Ian has outed himself.# Please, Peter, make an effort at simple honesty! The fact I agreed with a few words from Alice Weidel does not wed me to her views and rancid opinions which you are not so very stupid as not to know. So stop being so pathetic and be a little less disengeneous.O dear me, Peter is rather wandering off the point with his petit and puerile criticisms. I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I share some of his, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to John S Bercow#s comments on a repulsive male, Alt-Right football thug and ex-convict Tommy Robinson,. Bercow#s words in the House# Tommy Robinson as #a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent inidual#. Now there we have a repulsive maleon the right sadly there are more than enough violent and repulsive Marxist–Leninist terrorism, both male and female on the left. As I previously stated, extreme left and right, opposite sides of the same nasty coin. Revolting females and revolting male are plenty on both sides. Revolting people of both genders exist, only Peter with his pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation as,#Hisphrase “revolting female” normalises misogyny.Peter Hamilton, for your information, I do not regard Farage as a repulsive male, I indeed share some of his views, although not all. Nowyou want a repulsive male look to Alt-Right, football thug, Tommy Robinson. To mimic House Speaker, John S Bercow, #Tommy Robinson is#a loathsome, obnoxious, repellent male. There are repulsive males and females on both sides of the political spectrum. Gender is not an issue! Only you, Peter Hamilton with your pseudo-political correctness would make such a facile and infantile observation referencing my comment about a truly revolting female.. One whom is an active racist, white supremacist, elected to serve in a European parliament.What explains right-minded Ian’s double standards  Doesn’t he realise Farage and Weidel are both far-right extremists  It appears there is little to set Weidel and Farage apart except that one is a bigoted German woman and the other a bigoted English man.Hopefully Ian will want to reconsider his appreciation of Farage.I have no particular appreciation of any politician however I would just say I appreciate honesty, not your strongest gt Peter Hamilton!Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians as any reasonable person can see. Just because they do not share your own particular brand of left-wing zealotry does not make them right-wing bigots. I would advise you to look at the definition of a bigot and then take a long hard look in the mirror! Before anyone states the obvious, I am intolerant of racists, Islamophobics, sectarianism and anyone who subverts democracy with disinformation and dishonesty. Sadly there is plenty of all that sht around. If that makes me intolerant towards those holding dferent opinions,they are those as mentioned earlier, I rejoice in that.Will Ian really not condemn Farage’s racist anti-migrant poster   What evidence does Ian have to show Farage and Weidel are not the same brand  It’s a poster the AfD would have been equally proud of. Is Ian really now saying Weidel is not a right-wing bigot  It’s no time since he said she was “revolting”. It’s a word I’d rather apply to Farage’s poster and the views it represents. How does Ian justy applying it to Weidelnot for behaving in ways similar to Farage  I would not think any less of Ian were he to show himself capable of changing his mind about Farage as fresh information emerges. Any reasonable person would. Perhaps Ian yet believes Farage was never a racist. Presumably Ian doesn’t simply find Farage’s views tolerable because heas a white British nationalist is an all round good bloke  Where does Ian stand on Farage’s warm embrace of the views of Le Pen   Will Ian really not condemn that poster,not the man behind it  It’s ok to be intolerant of racism Ian, it really is.I consider your silly poster, I do not like it at all! I also dislike some of the dishonest troop on the photos on this blog. For example Gary Robinson for his dishonest campaign for the Council . Jonathon Wills for his dishonest statement that I alone held up Viking Energy . Yes Peter, it, however, takes more than one poster to show the merits of a person. I recommend Farage for his stand against Islamophobia and leaving UKIP, once UKIPbedded Tommy Robinson. If Farage is Xenophobic he has a strange choice for a we and girlfriendI condemn most of all your dishonesty and  statements above.Weidel, Farage and Tinkler all agree “If the European Union’sBrexit negotiating strategy had been reasonable, way back when Cameron was rebuffed before the referendum Brexit may never have been voted for.“ Weidel, Farage and Tinkler have a shared appreciation of what is reasonable # giving the far-right what they want. Cameron got concessions, just not enough to appease the far-right ERG tail that’s been wagging the Tory dog and Farage. It’s really not the EU to blame for getting us into this mess, but that is what Tinkler, Farage and Weidel want us to believe. Cameron should have stood up to those on his right like John Major did before him. Instead he appeased them and somehow Europe is to blame  This buckpassing feeds into a neo-fascist narrative. Rees Mogg called Weidel’s speech “interesting”. What’s interesting is that Tinkler falls for an argument Rees Mogg highlighted and then tried to distance himself from. What’s interesting is that Ian blames mainstream politicians, not the far-right for alienating the public. Can he really not see their game  “Farage and Weidel are not the same politicians”. Really Ian  Do you still think that It is not yet clear whether politically correct Ian needs to learn more about Farage before he will condemn him in the same terms as he did “revolting female” Weidel. The facts suggest both deserve an equal opportunity to wither under Ian’s singular brand of enlightened scorn. Ian may or may not be revolted by Farage’s thoughts on the prospect of having Romanians for neighbours or on Farage’s anti-Semitic attacks on George Soros. Ian will likely recall seeing posters defaming that philanthropist during Ian’s own well publicised whoop whoop visit to Hungary. These posters, which portray Soros as an untrustworthy Jewish money lender, were paid for by Hungary’s far-right racist party which has taken control of the Hungarian media and parliament. Anyone wondering whether Farage dfers much from Weidel need wonder no more.If Ian is looking for revolting enemies of democracy he could look back at the ious characters I have provided him with information about over the last few months in the not quite Pygmalion hope that, underneath it all, Ian is a rational human being who can be reasoned with, and can therefore change both his mind and potentially even his unapologetically needlessly confrontational counterproductive approach.Peter@s obsession seems now to be about me now!. My #Whoop whoop# visit to Hungary was not an SOE mission but to a Hungarian friends wedding!Hungarian political posters, I understood not one all were in Hungarian! . Peter talks about antisemitic views. Peter#s beloved Labour party has well publicised anti-semitic views that appear far worse and more contemporaneous than any comment Farage may or may not have made. I note Peter claims thatHungary has a far-right racist party, well Peter that is all part a parcel of the EU and I understand was democratically elected. The thing that I find amusing here is Peter so compulsively obsessively references, his words, #neo-fascist#! It may interest him to hear I have received threats of violence from # neo-fascist right wingers online# of which a police response resulted. . Now Peter, just calm down a bit dear,I visited the USA also. I understood their posters and did not honour Trump, although I find him about as obnoxious as Corbyn, however an improvement on Salmond, Whoop whoop!!! Both have so very much in common.Trump, Salmond so very similar. just note their alleged courtship rituals . Trump pays the girls silence with his own funds, Salmond uses crowdfunding and sits on his own £millions, wonderful man to represent Scotland.Ian’s approval of Farage is the matter at hand. Farage attending an AfD rally should be enough to concern Ian. Farage distancing himself from Tommy Robinson scarcely makes Farage Mr. Clean. To be clear, it was Farage’s poster, not mine, and to call it “silly” trivialises Farage’s use of racist tactics in the referendum. This period saw a spike in racially motivated assaults and other hate crimes: a serious matter.Ian’s poster boy’s racism cannot be disproven by his choice in partners. The French and Hungarians are not regarded as lesser humans by those who think that revolting way. Farage’s abuse of Romanians # which even The Sun called racist # is another factor Ian chooses to ignore, and we don’t need to consider what Farage means by “defending Judeo-Christian values”.For Ian, Farage now saying Farage isn’t Islamophobic is good enough. Considered together with everything  Farage has said and done that is a pretty low bar. No amount of evidence will enable Ian to realise he has been taken in by a member of the far-right.Of course pointing all this out to Ian sees him again calling me obsessive. Doesn’t make him right about Farage though.A more positive role in the enacting of decisions on important topics of vital national interest needs to be found for the voters. Just casting our ballot once every few years for a representative of a political party and them going off to Westminster, Edinburgh or Brussels has been revealed by the present crisis to be nigh on meaningless. Once chosen and having shipped out the MP, MSP or MEP develops dferent priorities. The acquisition, maintenance and development of power takes precedence over local concerns and often personal ethical and moral concerns are sublimated to the service and survival of the Party. The present political stramash is the perfect example of what I am talking about. Mud slinging and arguing is getting us nowhere. Let’s look for the way forward.Careful Andrew. Well argued points are rarely welcomed here. Try being more extreme and ill informed, clueless but convinced YOUR opinion is the only correct opinion. Then tear the opposing opinion up for toilet paper.Mr Holt, this is the best on-the-button analysis that I have ever read on the Brexit process. The Brexit debate has laid bare a much deeperpolitical crises, that is ,the existential crises of future democracy in the UK itself and I do fear for that future .I am intrigued as to the motive behind Brexit, and what advantage this would be to the Conservatives and their agenda   What political advantage would there have been in leaving the EU as opposed to remaining for the Conservative Party, and is this the real reason why there was an EU Ref.in the first place Was the EU Ref. politically or economically advantageous to the Conservative Party regardless to what the people of the UK voted for      The people voted, but did they vote knowing what the aftermath would be in its entirety    The advantage to the Tories, in the short term at least, was to shut up those on the right who were agitating, causing a ided party defecting to further right associations attracting further right sympahisers support. It backfired on them though, they didn#t expect #Leave# to win, they were relying on #Remain# winning to silence the dissent. #Leave# winning caused the whole establishment to descend in to a silent panic they#re still in shock and denial from, hence the total pigs ear of the last few monthsI voted believing #Leave# in the belief it meant exactly that, close the door, walk away, build a wall up the middle of the North Sea Channel, call it what you like. Back to pre # status for everything, no exceptions, no bits and pieces held on to and dragged with us that have been conceived while part of the EEC EU.I did not know we were going to end up stuck in an eternal country destroying limbo that Westminster has dragged us in to and seem hell bent on keeping us in.Only politicians could try and convince the public they#re acting in the national interest while doing everything to destroy the country.I totally agree with your comments, Michael. It certainly has put the Conservatives into a situation where it has caused ision and political mayhem within the government as well as affecting, to a degree, other political parties. It has also weakened the basis for leaving the EU, and the aftermath, politically and economically, and the mess which has occurred thereafter. On the outset, from what I know, it did not make economic sense to leave the EU, based on the feedback, prior to the EU Ref from many British companies trading within the EU, and the possible damage it would cause  I believe % of British trade was directly with the EU, and now this figure could be vastly reduced as a consequence We are, the UK, in uncharted waters, so to speak, and it could, possibly, take years to smooth out or cause greater calamity with the EU. I hope the future relationship with the EU, does not have a negative impact on trading relationships######time shall tell, as they say. It has put the future of the EU in doubt, as other countries within the EU, also wanting to have referendums  A big problem was using a referendum to answer a complex question. Should we ban smoking in public places#  Yes No. Easy. Should we leave the EU  It’s not as simple as some pretended. Did it mean leaving in every respect  It wasn’t entirely a Yes No question. Were all the knock-on consequences clear from the start No. Some politicians are reluctant to harm the economy. Most believe Parliament is sovereign. Switzerland takes many decisions by referendum. Britain doesn’t. The public were sold a lie from the outset # that politicians would put the result above the national interest. They were sold others later, including by “trustworthy” Farage. For some, not cutting our nose off to spite our face is a matter of principle. For others, we can only get Britain back to its former splendour by going it alone # which might not turn out to be that viable. But there is financial itself interest at work for the pro-Brexit mega-rich who want a low-tax Britain, and they don’t mind turning up the volume on intolerant rhetoric to strengthen their position. Brexit or not, they’ve now strengthened their position # worrying given their aims and the repulsive means they willingly embrace.You mean the mega rich that made their fortune by evading tax and suing the NHS because they didn#t get a contract  folk like Richard Branson the prominent remoaner. Or geldof who lives in the UK tax free under non dom status Or Osbourne, Cameron, Salmond, Blaire!! I wish I was poor like them!It was a simple question. Only those who do not like the result try and pretend otherwise.#Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union #If #leave the European Union# somehow, as you try to convince us, can be interpreted as only leaving certain bits of the EU, then the same must also apply to the alternative choice of#remain a member of the European Union# and it be interpreted as only remaining within certain bits of the EU. Which would have made asking the question in the first place meaningless and pointless, as regardless which way anyone chose to vote it meant the same thing.#Leave the European Union# and #remain a member of the European Union# can only be interpreted one way, as per the dictionary definition, as the question contains no caveats. Besides, being the good old Socialists that they are in their mission to list, label and micro manage everything, you#re either a full member of the EU or you#re not. There is no mechanism or precedent to sorta half leave, but not leave everything, like you suggest. Fully in, or fully out, them be the choices.Anotherthe pro-Brexit mega-rich Torie Peter, # The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP tweeted that he would supporting the Brexit Party #for one-time only# as he wants to secure the UK#s departure from the EU.# Head out of tail end time perhaps!!!I think Michael will have to agree it doesn’t appear to be a question Parliament wanted this answer to! Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more. It’s a really big tangle because ultimately for the U.K. it is Parliament that is sovereign. For Scotland apparently it is the people that’s sovereign, so there may be a clash ahead. I’m not sure how many people voted to break up the U.K. Maybe the only solution now will be to have a confirmatory vote.#Fully in or fully out: thems not the choices no more#.Really  What are the choices then  Like I said above, those are the only two available where the EU is concerned. Which is a goodish chunk of the reason some of us voted out, you either accept everything that Brussels dictates, or reject everything Brussels dictates, participating in the things that work in your country and rejecting those which don#t isn#t an option. The EEC EU worked up to a point while some level of give and take was possible with such things, now that its not, the EU are on a fast track to implosion civil war, whichever arrives first.“What are the choices ” No idea, but, from the news, No-Deal is now No-Go.Sorryfolk were misled, but why is no-deal seemingly now no-go  Its because we vote for MPs, and they do what they think they should, not what we want. It’s a sair fecht, but most MPs seemingly want to spare the country needless economic damage the people didn’t knowingly vote for. That’s then doing their jobs btw.Lets wait and see nowa compromise emerges that Parliament can live with, orthey can agree a question they need to put to the people.MPs are our representatives, put there to do what they think is best. They are not our servents put there to mindlessly do our bidding. This key fact allows them the wriggle room they need to change their minds once the facts change. This reality behind our representative democracy illuminates the lie that was Cameron’s “advisory referendum” which, funnily enough, he promised to obey. You’ve got to love those Tories# or not. No-deal was a fake promise, which, happily for some, still distracts attention from the many harms of needless austerity. Let’s face it, Brexit never really meant Leave.Maybe the times really are changing. The Tories are in the process of self-destruction, Corbyn#s labour has never been more extream, proven racist anti-semitic with a gutless leader failing on so many levels. The Liberals more or less wiped out, the Greens one MP has a Ph, D in Elizabethan sexual practices and the SNP leader under investigation for breaking the Ministerial code and former leader and strong man on , charges of alleged attempted rape and multiple sexual assaults! All at the same time as the eco Lunatics are super glueing themselves to trains. Hard to make that lot all up. The one good point is that UKIP having jumped into bed with Tommy Robinson and his anti-Islamic White supremacists are being wiped out by Farage and the Brexit party. Well, every cloud has a silver lining. Strange times indeed!!!Strange times indeed # the founder of The Brexit Part had to resign last month for racist and anti-Islamic statements. And these are the new #moderates# Aberdeen university has just shown the same islamiphobia by taking the sultan of Brunei#s degree from him for being a good muslim and implementing islamic law in his country.For the benefit of some, especially Peter Hamilton and David Spence, one of your very own, wealthy Torie and meg rich man, ” The former Respect Party leader and Bradford West MP, George Galloway.Tory  The word is derived from the gaelic or Irish,meaning an outlaw,brigand,or thief, very descriptive of the modern day Conservative party is it not.Another example of the language being used in everyday speech but George Gallowaymmm a de ken,the jury is oot on that ane!Tory  That name derives from ! I think some of us have moved on a bit since then, Graham Fleming, but there will always be a place for infantile name-calling, especially when a depth of comment is so shallow.Ali’s statement is not one everyone would post. Aberdeen University was rejecting the autocratic imposition of a particularly hard-line act of Islamism. Such Islamism is not Islam. Resisting the Sultan’s imposition of restrictions on the freedoms of others is not Islamaphobic, as Ali may already know. Conflating these issues into a  statement, whilst describing the Sultan as a good Muslim, is something an islamaphobe might do, but pointing this out in neutral terms will probably see me attacked for being intolerant.There are hard-line inflexible dogmatic literalists in all major faiths, and the assembled texts of any faith are often contradictory. There are also people who hide their malicious agendas behind statements that might be designed to appear innocuous at first glance. It may seem a little pointless trying to make this kind of thing clear to closeminded hardliners, but the tricks extremists use to influence others have to be exposed. Otherwise we’ll have to live in the kind of society they want, and heaven help us then. It may help to remember that Scotland only abandoned trying to “cure” homosexuality with electro-shock therapy as recently as . Securing a tolerant global community required international cooperation: hence the EU.Sadly Islamophobia is alive and kicking on Shetland. I had to forcefully point out to one of my former, supposedly rational patients, that her extreme views on immigrants were pure fiction. Her online rant  claim being that our immigrant population were full of infectious diseasesand a danger to ourcommunity. That is a total fiction promoted by a malicious racist. She was mirroring a neo-nazi website sadly with the backing of several Shetland folk. She became very agitated when I pointed out to her oral and general health was no better nor worse than many of my overseas immigrant patients. Needless to say, I was cascaded with a barrage of insults and threats. Thankfully she and her like-minded bigots blocked me on Facebook, thank God for small mercies!"},{"url":null,"title":"footballers portraits to be auctioned as fundraiser for under 12s ","story":"Four paintings of footballers are available in the auction with all money raised going towards travel costs for the Shetland under-s trip to Glasgow for the Glasgow City Cup.Artist Balazs Onhausz with his football-inspired art. page.People can bid for the works up until th May with coaches hoping to raise around £, or £ per artwork.

And with the likes of midfielder Ciaran Kellett and goalkeeper Joe Russell having come off the back of impressive campaigns in the under-s league for Lochalsh, the mainland team could prove a tougher nut to crack this season. #We haven#t lost any players, which is a huge step forward, and we are very lucky to have so many young players.#After missing out on the title in a dramatic play-off against Mallaig, the  champions will fancy their chances of mounting another championship charge with a settled squad that is full of experience. Kyleakin will also hope to add to their trophy haul in the cup competitions having claimed the GF MacRae Cup with a - win over Mallaig in June .David Butcher has handed the captaincy to defender Chris MacLennan this season, while the Kyleakin coach will also look to blood youngsters into the side with the likes of Aaaron MacBeth and Nathan Stewart earmarked for inclusion.With a blend of seasoned performers and exciting young talent, Kyleakin are almost certain to be amongst the teams in contention for the title yet again.#It always has to be the league for me # anything  is a bonus.#Having entered the Skye and Lochalsh league as an unknown quantity last season, the reigning champions will start the  campaign as the team to beat.The side will have to adapt to the loss of outgoing player-manager Jamie MacGregor whose contribution on the pitch was understandably overshadowed by his abilities on the touchline as he guided his team to an unexpected championship title.Neil Cameron will take up the mantle of manager and, while the transition might not be an instantly seamless one, the Blues have a large squad of talented players to choose from including a solid spine of goalkeeper Mark Johnston, captain Jamie Young and the attacking talents of Ross Douglas and Andy Cunningham.Defending a title is iniably harder than winning one, but discount Mallaig at your folly. #The lads all know what they are capable of so it#s down to them to do the talking on the pitch.#Graham Campbell#s side look to be a stronger proposition this season having added two players to the squad as well as retaining the players from last season. The also have a goldmine of youngsters to pick from in the shape of the victorious under-s side.Midfielder Angus #Sconser# MacDonald s to the team after a period away in New Zealand last season and is expected to add energy into what is already a dynamic young team.The addition of Robbie Cameron could be a game changer for the Clan Donald Cup winners. Having caught the eye leading the line for Portree during a dficult campaign, Cameron#s killer instinct in front of goal and ability to play as a lone target man might be the perfect tonic for a side whose performances at times lacked a cutting edge. #We were disappointed with our sixth-place finish last season, although we did end strongly. We will be looking to move up the table this season, and will be targeting a top-four spot.#After an arduous season last year, Portree will begin the  campaign under the guidance of new player-manager Mark Macleod.Although the loss of Robbie Cameron will be felt by the side, MacLeod has added a raft of players such as Kenny Palmer, Billy Kehoe and Ali MacKenzie to boost the squad. Youngsters Aaron MacKinnon and Kyle Dick will also provide competition for places as the club look to embark on a new era. #We are obviously building a new team, so our main goal is to bring back those high standards that are expected of Portree. I#m confident there is a cup final in this team this season.#After an exciting end to the last campaign which saw them compete for the title right until the last day of the campaign, Portree Juniors are looking to rebuild their side with an accent on youth.First-team regulars Chris McNab and John Murphy have indicated that they are likely to be available # but pribably on a limited basis. While the loss of last year#s Skye and Lochalsh young player of the season, John Gillies, to Sleat will be keenly felt, Juniors are taking an exciting approach to reshaping the team for the future by blooding the next generation of players.Phil McCaherty says his side could have at least six of the under- team to call upon, including Ryan MacAskill and Connor Gilpin.McCaherty#s ability to bring players together and foster a good team spirit is likely to stand Juniors in good stead for the season ahead. #Our aim is to be competitive. However, the club is fully prepared for the potential inconsistency in performances that playing youngsters may bring.#Two cups and a title charge that lasted until the final day of the season constituted a very good  for Sleat, but DL MacKinnon#s competitiveness means the bar will be set even higher this season for the south Skye side.With the addition of John Gillies to a squad already containing the likes of Ben and Connaire Yoxon and Lachlan MacInnes, it is hard to imagine that Sleat will not go as closenot better than last year in their attempts to capture the league title.The loss of captain Martin MacKinnon, who is convalescing from a serious injury, is a big blow to Sleat. However, the performances of Fraser Graham and Peter MacCusbic mean there is no shortage of defensive quality in the squad. Having impressed with a glut of assists in the under-s league for Broadford, Alex Tully could be the pick of the youngsters emerging for Sleat. #My expectations are as always to win everything in our league and go as far as possible in the Highland Amateur Cup.#Mallaig v Portree # kick-off . pmGA United v Kyleakin # kick-off  pmPortree Juniors v Glenelg # kick-off pmSleat and Strath v North West Skye # kick-off pmGlenelg v Kyle # kick-off pm"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/homeinthehighlands17-2-360x100.jpg","title":"skye resident tries to fathom naval","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineA resident of Waternish on the Isle of Skye has reported seeing a submarine moving around in continuous circles in Loch Bay for several hours today. after spotting the submarine this morning from his home in Waternish.He said: “We have never seen one in the bay before, we noticed it at about  o’clock this morning and thought it was going out but for most of the morning it has just been circling around.“To be honest, I thought it might have been caught in a lobster pot # I know that sounds silly – now it is just virtually stationary.Michael, who lives in close proximity to Loch Bay, said the submarine was visible through the naked eye from his house but after spotting it he had been keeping tabs on the boat with a pair of binoculars.“I am not a marine expert, but it appears like the engine or whatever is propelling it is spinning, but it looks as though it’s stuck. “When we watched it earlier there were two torrents of water coming out the left and right of the rear astwo engines were running but now it would appear there is just one running and it is just throwing up a lot of water spray.”“I don’t know technically what is wrong with it, but I#m getting the feeling something is amiss here because I can’t see why it would just be where it is.”He added: “We have seen a lot of ships, so I was just assuming that it has something to do with the exercise going on just now.NATO has been carrying out the #Joint Warrior# exercise off the west coast of Scotland since Saturday th March.

The Ballymenawanted to know how Morris came to be in the band. Morris tells how his grandmother had a small hotel in Carnlough and every Saturday night a “Sing Song” was held in the bar. It was mainly Ballymena people attendance.  He remembers Johnny Mitchell, who worked in the Waveney Laundry, bringing his friends every week. Johnny also brought musicians from Ballymena to play including Nellie King on piano and George Kernohan on accordion. Morris said: “George, who had a barber shop in Harryville would leave his accordion during the week with his grandmother. He would let me try to play it, upside down as I remember my first attempts! “During the summer months George’s brothers used to visit as well. ACCORDION“They were great singers and often talked about how well other relations were doing who had emigrated and formed a group called the Irish Rovers in Canada. The first time I heard “Bonnie Kellswater” sung was by an older man called Jimmy Fullerton. Great days, great times and a great introduction to performing music.”He continued: “Eugene O’Dornan from the Braid and I played as teenagers in our first band together. Eugene’s sister Maureen entered, or more properly bluffed me into entering a talent contest as I was very shy and horried at the thought. “Anyway the competition went well and from it I joined a Ballymena based band called “The Countrymen” managed by Harry Lynn and George Dillon.  Leo McCaffrey was the compere at the competition. Leo became a great friend and mentor and a major influence on my music career.”In  Morris went with Leo to play in the famous “Blarney Stone” in Vancouver. Members of the Irish Rovers would come into the Blarney Stone as they knew Leo well. Morris said: “I became great friends with Wilcil McDowell, the Irish Rovers’ Accordion player. I was already a fan of Wilcil’s playing as he too occasionally visited my grandmother’s hotel in Carnlough.“It was through Wilcil that I started to play keyboards on Irish Rovers recordings and take part as a guest musician on some of their videos.” When Morris retired from his day job he was delighted to take up an offer in  by George Millar, the bandleader, to join the Rovers. He said: “When Wilcil decided last year to stop touring with the band I moved from keyboards to playing accordion. Touring Canada with the band also meant I was able to meet up with some other Ballymena musicians now living there.“Paul Fynes who was in the Countrymen with me, and Kevin Erwin who played with Leo. Kevin was ill during my last visit and sadly passed away last year. One of the most talented people I have ever played with.”CONCERTCommenting on the concert which took place in Ballymena on March  Morris said: “It was lovely to perform in what I knew as Ballymena Town Hall.“ It was a great concert and I was so pleased it was a such a success, especially for George and Ian Millar. “Never easy playing in your home town with your relations sitting in the front row!“It never ceases to amaze me that after  years the Irish Rovers continue to play to sell out shows throughout Canada and the USA. They are a fabulous band and brilliant people to work with. “George and Ian are proud of being from Ballymena and the town is mentioned at every show. “The Irish Rovers videos, which are broadcast on American television really show off the local area and the Antrim glens. I’m sure this has a real positive impact on Tourism here. “The warm reception in the Mayor’s parlour just before the concert I think is a well deserved honour for the Millar family and it was an honour to attend it.” "},{"url":"http://www.ballymenaguardian.co.uk/resizer/600/315/true/GN4_DAT_1733277.jpg--.jpg?1555495901000\n","title":"ballymena city of the eight towers","story":"Local children have created a new fantasy tower to add to Ballymena’s famous ‘crest’ !And it is one of a number of striking features on is new imagination-fuelled mural which has appeared asby magic in Bryan Street, with the help of Artists Leo Boyd, Laura Nelson and local children.Workshops were held in The Braid Arts Centre on the theme of comics and cartoons and, as a result, local children have delivered a new fabulous monster sized artwork for the town centre.The Bryan Street painting, which is part of a larger arts project called Opening Doors being delivered by the Arts Service of Mid and East Antrim Borough Council, was supported and partnered by BID, which is the Ballymena Improvement District.BID and Councils Arts Service identied some sites in the town centre for re-imaging and engaged professional mural artists to deliver workshops for local children.

He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable.

They know they are in the UK but don’t realise they are on a dferent land mass to England. We provide basic information on housing, hospitals, police serviceand run walkabouts and talk-abouts to bring people around and show them basic things like buying a bus ticket or using an ATM. These are things that you and I take for granted.“Our other main thing is the reach to resilience programme. We deliver family support across Belfast. This can be everything from learning to say no, IT skills, safety on the internet and workshops.“The European employment service programme also provides information on free movement on labour across Europe, something which is attracting huge interest given the threats of Brexit.”It is perhaps the John Hewitt Bar, located just around the corner from the Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre, which is the hidden gem of the organisation.Not many people know that the BURC own the bar as a social enterprise, meaning all profits go back into funding their key projects outlined here.The bar was the first social enterprise bar set up in the north and continues to run as a competitive business in the Cathedral Quarter, serving food and it is very popular for its range of beers.Aisling says the location of the BURC is beneficial for service users and hopes their programmes will continue to benefit those who need them.“These programmes are hugely important. The centre is located on the outskirts of the city centre, people can come all over. We can reach a wider network of people and bring the programmes to them.“We are also keen to deliver programmes in their own areas before they feel safe to come to the city centre office.“Our overall aim is to try and bring people back into the local community.“One such challenge today is some people coming to us to report incidents of racism because they don’t feel comfortable going to police. We can help support them and give them advice on how to deal with such an issue and not just accept it as an everyday occurrence.“Overall, the general feedback from people has been very positive. For mothers, learning how to say no is an important issue. We want to give people the confidence, skills and knowledge to try things a bit dferently and explore the way they react to things.“Many of our programmes have come out of other ones – all our work is led by the inidual and other service users.“We want to give people skills of a community leader to empower themselves and help them in every way possible.”Belfast Unemployed Resource Centre,- Donegall Street Place,Belfast,BT FNTel:   Email: info@burc.org or esol@burc.org For more information, visit www.burc.org"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"paddy and nigel taking success in their stride","story":"SINCE he first took up his guitar and hit the stage back in July last year, West Belfast internet sensation Paddy Rafferty has been selling out venues across the city. Fans of the Brooke-based Paddy ‘Raff’ have lapped up his BT alter ego ‘Nigel’ in online sketches such as ‘Nigel at the Christmas Market’, ‘Nigel the BT Tout’, as well as the storming stage performances of ‘Paddy and Nigel Act Their Postcodes’.Set for yet another sell-out run of four shows at the city centre’s Limelight venue, Paddy told the Andersonstown News that he is “gobsmacked” at the response to his on stage routines and that of ‘Bravo Tango er’ Nigel. “It’s class,” said Paddy, “I remember when the hosepipe ban was in full effect last year, thinking what kind’ve voice would go with someone who would tout on his neigbours and their over-use of their hose pipe. “The character of Nigel started with a Snapchat filter. This to me looked like some kind’ve posh dude, the mullet, the aviator glasses and moustache. Luckily it was one you could replicate easily as a lot of the filters are quite contorted. “The first one went viral and featured on BBC Trending NI. At the time I didn’t think it would be a recurring character but people really responded to it, they were like ‘you gotta do more with that posh guy’, I just kept going back to it, it’s a pure fluke how it came about,” he said. Since Paddy took to the stage at the Palm House in Belfast and Derry’s Nerve Centre, he has performed to thousands of comedy fans during a series of three sold-out shows at the MAC theatre in March.  “I remember when the MAC tickets went on sale, I checked the tickets and the map was completely grey, I thought ‘maybe I’ve got that the wrong away about ’, but a second show was penciled in and within two hours of that going onsale we put on a third one. “The Limelight is  people capacity and three of the shows are already gone, the fourth one is approaching sell-out. I’m blown away. Basically I’m responding to the demand that’s out there.”Paddy spoke of how he is working with producers to develop ideas for TV both here and across the water. “I’ve a massive, massive list of ideas for more sketches. I’m sort of a one man band, still a full-time dad and it’s like anything it’s getting the time. I’m making the time for it now, it’s not a nine-to-five job in that you are at the desk. My we and I have fantastic support from our families so that is great to have. “I’ve achieved more than I ever thought I would, it’s not even been a year since the first solo show. I’ve put a lot of effort into this show and want to let as many people come to see it before moving on. At the minute I’m looking at a bigger venue for a new show, possibly towards the end of the year.I’ve loads of ideas and it’s been great to have received the support and reception the show has so far to date had.”Paddy and Nigel at the Limelight takes place on Sunday May .

The President will deliver a speech to mark the historic occasion as the £. million three-storey building in the Gaeltacht Quarter prepares to open its doors to visitors for the first time. Director of Fáilte Feirste Thiar, Harry Connolly, told the Andersonstown News that it was an “honour” to have the President open the centre.“James Connolly lived on the Falls Road just yards away from the location of the new Visitor Centre,” he said. “He was a man of formidable ideas and remarkable vision. Over  years after James Connolly was executed, his values, his ideas and the example he gave us in le are as inspiring and relevant as ever.”Harry Connolly said: “It is entirely fitting and appropriate that the President of Ireland will officially open the James Connolly Visitor Centre and pay tribute to Connolly’s colossal contribution to our nation and to the lives of so many across the world.” As well as the President’s visit,  trade union leaders from  dferent unions have also arrived in the city to attend the opening including General President of the Labourers’ International Union of North AmericaTerry O’Sullivan and Rocco Davis, Vice President and Regional Manager of Pacic Southwest Region of . James Connolly travelled to the US and is strongly linked with the trade union movement in the States.Harry continued: “The realisation of Áras Uí Chonghaile is another major step forward for the success story that is West Belfast tourism. Supported by the Connolly family and funded by Belfast City Council and the US Trade Union Movement, this new visitor centre will have a major social and economic impact on Belfast’s Gaeltacht Quarter, attracting thousands of visitors from across the globe every year. “We are inviting everyone to take part in the James Connolly Parade, leaving Conway Mill at pm on Good Friday and parading along the Falls Road to arrive at Áras Uí Chonghaile at .pm. “Outside the front of the centre a number of guest speakers headed by President Higgins will speak, and Irish singing star Frances Black will perform live along with renowned Belfast balladeer Terry ‘Cruncher’ O’Neill. “We are saying to everyone, from the Falls Road, from Belfast, from across Ireland and from further afield, come along and take part in the parade and attend the opening ceremony outside Áras Uí Chonghaile.

Situated in Antrim’s hills, the Crumlin derives its name from the Irish ‘An Cromghlinn’, meaning The Crooked Glen, which is the name adopted by one the town’s most exciting new pubs.Headed up by North Belfast businessman Laurence Burns and his brother Damien, The Crooked Glen is bringing the original meaning of the name Crumlin back into everyday use in the town and breathing new le into one of the Main Street’s most prominent buildings.Laurence has spent the last -years leading operations at the popular city centre nightclub, Thompson’s Garage, and has also worked on a number of the city’s biggest events and festivals, including our own Best of the North awards ceremony. However, when the opportunity to run his own bar and restaurant arose he jumped at the opportunity, and while aiming to bring something new to the area he said paying homage to the town’s Irish-speaking heritage was vital.“I was always trying to keep my ear to the ground so that when a pub came up I would be in contention for it,” he said.“I had done that through Jeeves Limited and then the opportunity came up just before Christmas.“There was an opportunity for me to take it on – along with my brother who is my business partner – and give it a wee bit more care and attention.“It had been O’Connor’s twice before under two dferent businesses. The previous owner was O’Connor and the guy who took it on firstly was O’Connor, so I didn’t want to be the third O’Connor’s and that’s where the Crooked Glen came into it. There’s a big Irish speaking community up in Crumlin and I just thought they would appreciate that the name came from Irish origins. That’s where the name came from and it has gotten a really good response.“I got a logo and then used the boys from North Belfast Graphic to implement the artwork outside on the walls, the menus, and all the rest of it.”He continued: “I fell in love with it the first time I came into it. I just loved the character of it.“The first time I came in was as a customer, I sat downstairs and had a bit of craic with a few of the locals who are now my regulars. They were giving me a bit of stick and saying thatyou’re eating in here you have to keep the fire filled up. We were just having a bit of banter – I actually did get up and put a bit of coal on the fire. I hadn’t even seen upstairs at that stage, but I had my lunch and said to Damien that I had a really good feeling about the place. I knew I liked it right away, I had a feeling for it and I could see the potential.”In terms of its space, The Crooked Glen has it all – a cosy fireside bar, a beautul upstairs restaurant and a fantastic outdoor area. In the short six weeks since taking over the venue, the Burns brothers have implemented an exciting new menu, improved service standards and have lined up a number of talented artists for their weekly live music sessions.“The responses and reviews that I’m getting is that we’ve taken a bit of creativity from Belfast and brought it up into Crumlin – that’s no disrespect to anything that was already up here,” Laurence said.“It’s the first time that things have been done in this way up here. In the restaurant it will be a bit more of a service led experience, downstairs is your good hearty pub grub with the music, the fire and the pints, upstairs you have a bit more of a refined dining experience.”By offering everything from food to live music and sports, The Crooked Glen aims to have “something for everybody” in the town.“I don’t think Crumlin has had that calibre of musician here on a regular basis. We want to bring the best of what we can afford here, we can’t charge on the door, but we’ll put on the best music possible with a ied selection on Friday, Saturday and Sunday.”He added: “Crumlin sometimes feels like you’re in Donegal because it has that country village feeling, but you’re also on the doorstep of Belfast, so people are used to going in and out of the city and sampling what it has to offer.“We’re trying to take the good things that are in Belfast and the good things of village le in Crumlin and combine them into what should be a strong brand in the Crooked Glen.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/bmg-logo-latest-300x92.png","title":"the pen is mightier than the sword","story":"Address by Father Martin Magill at the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Anne#s Cathedral.May I speak in the Name of the Living God.First of all, I want to thank Dean Stephen Forde for his kind invitation to give this reflection today. I have no idea what you Sara, Lyra’s partner must have felt on Thursday night when those shots rang out and Lyra was hit and fell to the ground.I can’t begin to imagine what you Lyra’s mum, and you her sisters and brothers must have gone through when Sara phoned to tell you Lyra had been shot. I can’t imagine the agony of your drive to Altnagelvin hospital knowing that Lyra had died.Many of us here in this cathedral have been praying for you since we heard the dreadful news and will continue to do so.Since the story of Lyra’s murder broke on Holy Thursday into Good Friday, there has been an enormous sense of grief and solidarity with you from many people at this huge injustice. Many, many wonderful things have been said about her including the warm and deserved tributes paid to her by the Secretary of State and by MPs of all parties in the House of Commons yesterday evening. In death Lyra, has united people of many dferent backgrounds, as further evidenced by this erse congregation at her funeral.Like so many others I couldn’t believe it when I heard the am news on Good Friday morning that Lyra McKee had been shot dead the previous night. I’d met Lyra on several occasions, we had kept in contact by phone, ‘what’s app’,and Twitter. I would however have to confess that I wasn’t aware of her great love of Harry Potter. I hadn’t heard the term ‘Hufflepuff’ until I did an internet search and found this definition # ‘Hufflepuff is the most inclusive among the four houses valuing hard work, dedication, patience, loyalty, and fair play.’ It struck me that the definition could just as easily have been about Lyra. Whilst Harry Potter didn’t feature in our conversations what did and it was our last exchange on Twitter at the end of March when Lyra tweeted me with a photo of herself dressed in a nun’s veil with a glass of cider accompanied with these words: ‘Got roped into performing as part of a Sister Act tribute act for Foyle Hospice. Hey @MartinJMagill, you need any help with mass tomorrow ’Let me give a brief overview of Lyra’s le. She was born on st March . She attended Holy Family PS just off the Limestone Road. In her early days at school, she struggled with reading and required extra support.Things changed dramatically when one of her teachers, Mr O’Neill began to read to her class The Twits by Roald Dahl. This was the spark that got Lyra interested in reading and then thanks to her granny Patricia Lawrie buying her each of the Harry Potter books as they were published this led to her le long interest in Harry Potter and later on to exchanges in social media with JK Rowling.Lyra’s love of reading was further nurtured when she went to St Gemma’s High School, just off the Oldpark Road also in North Belfast. Her interest in journalism began at the age of  when she wrote for the St Gemma’s school newspaper.Shortly afterwards Lyra became involved in a charity called “The Headliners’ which gives young people a voice by using journalism and media as a tool for learning and campaigning. This project played an important part in her being awarded the Sky News Young Journalist Award . After school and further education, Lyra studied online journalism at Birmingham City University graduating with an MA degree. Over the years her writing has won her much acclaim such as her letter when she was  to her  year old self about growing up as gay in Belfast. In , aged just , she was acknowledged internationallyas an exceptional achiever with an exciting future by Forbes magazine in their  under  listbecause of her work as an investigative reporter.Last month thefeatured Lyra in an article considering the  rising stars of Irish writing. Her memory also lives on in her TEDx talk, #How uncomfortable conversations can save lives”, about the  Orlando nightclub shooting. Her book on the murder of Rev Robert Bradford, the Member of Parliament for South Belfast, called Angels with Blue Faces was due to be published later this year.Lyra came to see me as part of her research on a book she was working on called Lost Boys. We met on several occasions and kept in contact. I knew absolutely nothing about  year old Thomas Spence and  year old John Rodgers, who vanished at a bus stop onthe Falls Road in West Belfast in November . They were both living in St John’s Parish at that time where I am presently the parish priest and it was for this reason Lyra came to see me. By the time Lyra had told me their story and what she hoped to do, I was fully behind her. Nichola her sister who spoke earlier described Lyra like #a dog with a bone’ when she had found something that interested her.I certainly experienced her gentle, determined doggedness. When we exchanged greetings on New Year’s Day and I wished her well not only in the writing of Lost Boys but also in her search for the remains of the boys which she made clear to me was very important to her. She replied in this way: ‘If that#s the only thing that comes out of this, it#ll be worth it. It#s the only thing I really want out of it, to find them and the others.’In the course of her investigations, Lyra had discovered that other children had disappeared and she had wanted to find their bodies.I pray that her work will be taken up and that their bodies will be found and even more importantly that there will be no more ‘lost boys’ or ‘lost girls.’When I consider Lyra’s determination, it strikes me that she was the embodiment of the St Gemma’s school motto: ‘truth and charity.’ On Good Friday, the day on which Christians all over the world recall the suffering and death of Jesus Christ we also wrestle with the mystery of suffering. For you Lyra’s nearest and dearest, you came to know the experience of Good Friday in your own lives. For those of us who follow Jesus, we believe that the shedding of his innocent blood on the cross was enough # in the words of the hymn: ‘the cross has said it all’. We don’t need any more innocent blood to be shed.The irony could not be more poignant when we consider the signing of the Good Friday agreement which was about ensuring there would be no more deaths like Lyra’s. Earlier in this service, we listened to Matthew’s account of the Beatitudes which was chosen by her family in remembrance of Lyra learning these by heart when she was a pupil at St Gemma’s. The beatitude ‘Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God’is very timely. Many of us will be praying that Lyra’s death in its own way will not have been in vain and will contribute in some way to building peace here. Since Thursday night we have seen the coming together of many people in ious places and the unying of the community against violence. I commend our political leaders for standing together in Creggan on Good Friday. I am however left with a question: ‘Why in God’s name does it take the death of a  year old woman with her whole le in front of her to get us to this point ’ As Christians recalled the death of Jesus on the cross, we remembered that his death was not in vain but was for us the doorway to eternal le. I dare to hope that Lyra’s murder on Holy Thursday night can be the doorway to a new beginning. I detect a deep desire for this. One of Lyra’s friends was reported as saying: ‘We have had enough. There is a younger generation coming up in the town and they don#t need guns put in their hands.They need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ To those who had any part in her murder, I encourage you to reflect on Lyra McKee journalist and writer as a powerful example of ‘The pen is mightier than the sword’.I plead with you to take the road of non violence to achieve your political ends. It was encouraging to see that those who provide a political analysis to the organisation responsible for her death chose to call off their parade on Easter Monday following the call from Fr Joe Gormley, the parish priest in Creggan where Lyra was killed. To those still intent on violence, I ask you to listen to the majority of the people on your beloved island of Ireland who are calling on you to stop. I pay tribute to the courage and determination of the women who in a very powerful gesture of non violence,one by one placed their hands in blood red paint on a wall and said loudly ‘we are not afraid.’ I commend the + people in Creggan who have contacted the police. There is a rule in many of our communities that we do not, we should not, give information to police and that, to do so is to become a ‘tout.’ But that was one of a number of rules # rules that also said that it was OK to brutalise children for petty crimes, or rules that say you can live in the locality until you are told you can’t or rules that said that the only way we could gain ‘freedom’ was by other fellow-human beings losing their lives. But this week I have seen these rules turned on their head. I have seen many people stand up and condemn this culture of violence and coercive control. We need to send a very dferent message and so I appeal to those who have information about Lyra’s murder but who haven#t yet come forward to do so now. If you want to see an end to these brutal rules, and see a new society built on justice and fairness, on hope and not fear, then you can help build that society by letting the police know what you know. There will be special measures put in place to ensure your safety and where you will not be intimidated by coercive controllers,you do so.To the many politicians present in this cathedral today, let me say again those words which one of Lyra’s friends had said: ’the younger generation need jobs, they need a better health service and education. They need a le, not a gun put in their hands.’ As politicians you will be familiar with the first report of the Independent Reporting Commission published last October which examined in depth paramilitary style attacks and found a clear correlation between these attacks and areas of social deprivation. Lyra’s friend is right in pointing out that our young people need jobs, and education and training to get those jobs. All our young people need a le that gives them an aspiration for the future. As our politicians we need you to be working together to make that happen so that especially for those living in deprived areas that they will feel the peace process is working for them as well – and especially for young people living in these communities. To the press and media which Lyra was so proud to be part of – I ask you to report on what is being done in these areas – to praise good work where you find it and report when it is not happening. I know you as politicians have a very dficult job to but then so too did Lyra. There is another valuable lesson from her le # she was like ‘a dog with a bone’ when she believed she could make a dference. When it comes to our peace process, I would love to see this dogged attitude to the rebuilding of an Assembly that works for the common good. As I listen to the radio every morning, all I seem to hear about ious initiatives in Northern Ireland are these words, ‘without a minister, this can’t be taken forward’. I pray that Lyra’s murder may be the catalyst needed for parties to start talking, to reform that which was corrosive in previous Assemblies and to begin anew.

It is technically a Gospel song with a refrain that was made popular by George Beverly Shea during the great Dr Billy Grahams religious crusades.It was voted the UKs favourite hymn in the BBCs Songs of Praise, second only to Amazing Grace, which was included by the US magazine Christianity Today in its list of best-loved hymns of all time.Amazing Grace was written in  by former slaver John Newton, who later became a Christian and was ordained as an English cleric.This magnicent hymn of forgiveness and redemption is reckoned by experts to be sung millions of times each year.Amazing Grace was the closing hymn in yesterdays service, at which Father Martin Magill gave one of the most powerful speeches ever heard in St Annes as he pointedly challenged the senior politicians present to do something to end the violence. After doing so he was given a standing ovation.The other parts of the service were also right for the occasion, with the cathedral choir, under music director David Stevens, singing Howard Goodalls version of Psalm , better known to millions as the theme tune to The Vicar of Dibley. data-dfpadtargeting--_new__I.JPGThe short readings from the Gospels of St Matthew and St John brought reassurance and hope in the midst of death, while the tribute to Lyra by Dean Stephen Forde, and also the brief prayers, conveyed a great deal in a few words with the maximum effect.At the end A Gaelic Blessing, written by contemporary composer John Rutter and sung by the choir, was gentle and comforting in such an intense and emotional atmosphere.The final organ voluntary, played by Jack Wilson, was an improvisation on the great th century hymn Now Thank We All Our God by the German Lutheran cleric Martin Rinkart.It provided a fitting musical background as Lyras coffin was carried on its final journey."},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38048914.ece/30317/BINARY/_1FW54X-_Read-Only_.jpg","title":"applause tears and laughter at a farewell like no other to lyra mckee","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But they also couldnt have missed the venting of pent-up anger and frustration from ordinary people during the funeral at the political impasse of the past two years.The Belfast priest, a friend of Lyra, didnt even have to finish a sentence before mourners erupted in applause as he asked why it had taken the New IRAs murder of the journalist to unite politicians.Fr Magill took two attempts before he could complete the question: \"Why in Gods name does it take the death of a -year-old woman with her whole le in front of her to get to this point \"Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSet data-dfpadtargetingThe coffin of journalist Lyra McKee is taken out of the church after her funeral at St Annes Cathedral on April ,  in Belfast, Northern Ireland.Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar and Prime Minister Theresa May pictured at the funeral and service of thanksgiving for the le of journalist Lyra McKee and Prime Minister Theresa Mayleave St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April , , after attending the funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee \"Irish Prime minister Leo Varadkarand Prime Minister Theresa Mayleave St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April , , after attending the funeral service of journalist Lyra McKee \"Irish President Michael D Higgins consoles Sara Canning, partner of the murdered journalist Lyra McKee as her funeral takes place at St. Annes Cathedral  and Irish President Michael D Higgins pictured at and at the funeral.

Lyra McKee was murdered in Creggan in Derry on Thursday th April.Photo by Kelvin Boyes   Press Eye.\"The funeral of Journalist Lyra McKee takes place at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  \"Mourners begin to gather for the funeral of Lyra McKee at St Annes Cathedral in Belfast on April th  In a response redolent of what happened at Princess Dianas funeral in London in , hundreds of people who had gathered outside the cathedral also clapped as they listened to a relay of the priests words in Donegall Street, where from early morning it was obvious that Lyras send-off was going to be a funeral like no other.Young people dressed in the colourful garb of Harry Potter characters and comic book heroes came in their hundreds to say their painful farewells, but also to give thanks for their slain friend, who they called \"a girl in a million\".Some mourners carried rainbow flags in honour of Lyra, a committed campaigner for LGBT rights.Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn took time out from their fraught Brexit negotiations to join Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach Leo Varadkar to pay tribute to Lyra.Few disputed the north Belfast author and journalist was destined to write herself into the annals of the great wordsmiths, but sadly she made headlines of horror and heartbreak across the globe after being killed by dissident republicans.One friend said she hoped the message from yesterdays funeral that would go out around the world would be how the murder had crystallised the fact that there was for once at least a united Ireland - united in abhorrence of Lyras murder by a New IRA gunman.However, the tears of sorrow yesterday for Lyra were also fused with tears of laughter as her friends and family celebrated her remarkable le that, they said, was full of fun and joy. And compassion and love.People from a myriad of backgrounds, from all generations, of all sexual orientations and from all religions and none, showed the world - which Lyra had at her talented feet - an unmistakable and unshakeable determination that they will not allow her death to have been in vain, and that as in her le, her passing must make a dference.It was also a powerful message that the New IRA must listen to the demands that it should give up violence once and for all.Even the choice of St Annes Cathedral for the service was powerfully symbolic in itself, a recognition of an all-too-rare shared space in what has been a ided city.Only pre-eminent churchmen, sports stars, business leaders and musicians are usually accorded funeral services in the historic building.And normally they have been older men and women who have lived their lives, not a young woman who was still on the threshold of hers and who wasnt even born of the Protestant persuasion.The service was broadcast live by the British-based  hour news channels and dozens of photographers and journalists from English newspapers were in attendance.Lyras murder may have catapulted her into the public domain, but at her funeral her love for her family was also underscored by inspiring addresses about the private side of the daughter who would phone her mother Joan  times a day to check that she was all right - \"even when she was upstairs\".Lyras sister Nichola Corner spoke on behalf of herself, her distraught mother, her sisters Joan and Mary and brothers Gary and David.Nichola told mourners that Lyra had been buried with a flower in her hair in response to her love of the Scott McKenzie song San Francisco.She said the family didnt have Dumbledores time turner to change the past.\"But within each of us we have the power to create the kind of society that Lyra envisioned,\" she added.\"In the words of Lyra herself, we must change our own world, one piece at a time. Now lets get to work.\"Lyras friend Stephen Lusty - a self-avowed \"middle-class, middle-aged Protestant heterosexual British male engineer\" - told the congregation that she had told him just hours before she died that she was going to propose to her partner Sara Canning in New York.\"She showed me pictures of the ring she had bought for Sara and told me of the fabulous plans she had of her proposal in May,\" said Mr Lusty.\"She made me put a date in my diary for the wedding in Donegal in  and gave me strict instructions to wear my kilt, which she always wanted to borrow, adorn it with some Harry Potter, and to find or refind my own version of Sara.\"He laughingly referred to the questions she would ask him out of the blue about whether it was closer to drive to Derry or Londonderry, or why Protestants ate more vegetables than Catholics.Mr Lusty said that after he introduced the indefatigable Lyra to the late southern politician Brian Lenihan, he described her as a \"star\".But he added: \"I would rather do  rounds in the boxing ring with Paisley than do that again.\"He said that in her online journalistic work Lyra received \"more than her fair share of cyber abuse and trolling, but she never hated anyone\".He said his generation had sung about an alternative Ulster - the words of a song by Belfast punk band Stf Little Fingers - but added that people here should now build an alternative Ulster and make peace a lasting legacy of Lyra McKee.Speaking at the beginning of the service, Dean Stephen Forde said: \"Lyra was a person who broke down barriers and reached across boundaries, this was her hallmark in le, this is her legacy in death.\"As a journalist she pursued truth wherever it took her, never content with the sullen silence of unanswered questions.\"She was a child of the Good Friday Agreement.\"She was a primary school pupil in north Belfast when the Agreement was signed.\"She grew up to champion its hope for a society that was free from the prejudices of the past and open to the possibilities of a new future for the people of these islands.\"In her short le Lyra had amassed an extensive network of friends and influential contacts, especially in the realms of crusading and investigative journalism.And the esteem in which she was held was reflected in the fact that upwards of  writers and broadcasters formed a guard of honour for her as her coffin was carried out of the cathedral.The size of the overall attendance underlined the reality that St Annes was the only church big enough to accommodate everyone who wanted to pay their respects to the diminutive girl with the towering and prodigious spirit from a couple of miles up the road in Ardoyne.For many of the people at the service it was their first ever visit to the Church of Ireland cathedral.Lyras family had requested that everyone should give her a dignied send-off but the -minute service wasnt all about solemnity and sadness. Lyras partner Sara had said on Facebook that the \"love of her le\" would like itpeople would wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel-related items at the service.Her friends didnt let her down and Hufflepuff colours were everywhere on scarves and T-shirts emblazoned with #teamlyra.No one was expecting to see DUP leader Arlene Foster or Sinn Fein vice-president Michelle ONeill wearing Hogwarts outfits.But the fact that they were there at all was interpreted by many as a sign of hope.However, that is what many commentators said when the same duo shook hands at the Requiem Mass for Martin McGuinness in the Bogside just over two years ago.\"And look what good that did us,\" one observer pointed out yesterday.But she added: \"The only dference today is that the calls at the funeral were so vocerous and so unanimous that its hard to see how they can be ignored.\"Famous faces voice support for familyAs hundreds gathered at St Anne’s Cathedral yesterday for the funeral of Lyra McKee, many other prominent voices shared their support on social media.Comedian Patrick Kielty posted: “Today Lyra McKee is laid to rest. She believed in peace, tolerance and equality. The exact opposite of those responsible. They will never win because Lyra will always be the future. And her truth will continue to be told.”Actress Bronagh Waugh said: “Thinking of Lyra’s family and friends and partner Sara who have the unfathomable burden of laying her to rest today.“Thinking of the people of Derry, of Belfast. But most of all I’m thinking about Lyra and what a bright and shining light she was.”"},{"url":null,"title":"boojum eaterie rapped over easter advert","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It was the headquarters for the longest continuous campaign in British military history after troops were sent into Northern Ireland in August  to cope with growing sectarian unrest.What was described as a temporary and emergency move lasted for  years and only ended in , long after the ceasefires by the IRA and loyalist paramilitaries.Organisers say they are disappointed that the Ministry of Defence are not backing their event. They were told by the MoD that they are supporting another Op Banner commemoration which is being staged by the Royal British Legion at the National Memorial arboretum in Staffordshire on Wednesday, August .NIVAs event is being held three days later. And the organisation insist that while their members are concerned about the recent charging of soldiers with historical killings in Northern Ireland like Soldier F in relation to Bloody Sunday, their commemoration on Saturday, August  will be a memorial, not a protest.Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetThe day will start in Lisburns Wallace Park with a drumhead service before a parade around the city where wreathes will be laid at three dferent points including the scene of a  explosion which killed six soldiers ing from a charity fun run in a minibus.Other floral tributes will be left at Lisburns war memorial and at a statue in honour of the UDR.Organisers say all veterans will be welcome at the commemoration, dating right back to the B Specials and the RUC along with ex-members of the UDR and the Prison Service.But representatives of the Garda Siochana and the Irish Army have also been invited to take part.\"Its a completely inclusive programme,\" said Ian Simpson, media spokesman for NIVA and the chairman of the NI Prison Service Benevolent Fund.One of the centrepieces of the NIVA remembrance day will be the display of the names of soldiers, police officers and prison staff that died in Northern Ireland.There will be , names on a big screen and in remembrance books, twice the number of personnel listed in official records as having been killed in terrorist attacks.NIVA say their roll of honour also includes men and women who died as a result of suicides, accidents and stress-related illnesses which developed as a result of the Troubles.NIVA say they are not inviting serving military chiefs or Royal family members to the Lisburn event although a retired Army general will take the salute.Ian Simpson said: \"The VIPs on the day will be the widows or the families of the people who died. All the organisations within NIVA will nominate representatives to take the salute too.\"He said the decision to hold a separate memorial event here rather than to take part in the national one in England was because this is where it all happened.\"There will be veterans attending both events,\" added Ian. \"And we will still be going to a ceremony we hold every year at the Ulster Ash Grove at the National Arboretum in September. But we thought it was important to have a local ceremony to remember everyone who died or was hurt.\"Organisers are hoping that upwards of , veterans will take part in the parade with , relatives and members of the public in attendance.Tens of thousands of service personnel were injured in the conflict which saw , soldiers coming to Northern Ireland over the  years of Op Banner.\"Taking in the police and the UDR you are talking about half a million people who saw service,\" said Ian, who added that while remembrance of the dead will be the main priority, it wont be the only focus of the Lisburn event.Old security forces vehicles and a scout helicopter will be there for people to see in the centre of Lisburn along with private collections of unorms, decommissioned weapons and regimental memorabilia.\"We want it to be a special day,\" said Ian, who has urged opponents of the security forces to respect the NIVA commemoration. We will be there to remember our fallen colleagues in a peaceful and dignied way and we would ask everyone to respect our day. We are not out to offend anyone.\"Organisers say the parade around Lisburn will include  local bands who have been issued with strict code of conduct about what is expected of them with no colour parties or flags on display.The original hope was that the Ministry of Defence would have given their approval for military bands to take part but their permission was not forthcoming.\"We were disappointed especially as so many people who were here during Op Banner were serving the MoD and some gave all,\" added Ian.He insisted that NIVA are hoping to avoid controversy on their day of commemoration, especially in the wake of the charging of retired soldiers with murder.In a statement NIVA said: \"Service personnel have to act within the law of the land. But this does not get away from the fact that veterans justiably feel that the scales of justice are tilted against them and that the likes of Soldier F are being sacriced as a sop to placate Republicans whose latent threat of ato violence is seen by them as influencing government policy.\""},{"url":null,"title":"exmp kinahans country pile sells after three years","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

But as I have since discovered, Im not alone.Instead I am a statistic - an unexpected member of the Boomerang Generation.I am among thousands of potential first-time buyers who have moved back in with their parents to save up enough cash for a deposit.The latest government research shows that more young people are still living with their parents in Northern Ireland than any other part of the UK, so it is reassuring to know that its not only me.I know that living at home is not going to last forever, because there is an end goal in sight.Like most people, my motivation and discipline to save has definitely increased with age.Travelling and regular nights out in my s put serious saving on the back burner - that was always something for my older self to worry about.In recent years I have never been quite sure where I might ultimately end up settling down, and in my chosen career path, it was never certain when unexpected opportunities could arise.For the moment Belfast seems to be the place where I want to settle down as most of my family and quite a few friends are not too far away.With that in mind, the next plan is to finally get a more permanent footing on the property ladder after years of renting.Since a mortgage equals money, thats something I need to gain much more of over the next few months. So living at home seems like my only optionI want to avoid shelling out several hundred pounds a month on a flat share.At this stage in my le renting feels like money down the drain when I could be investing it in a home of my own.By this time next year I should be in the right financial position to make the move out of home permanently.That will require patience, though - something I possess very little of, as my father can attest to!"},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38049187.ece/aa1ae/AUTOCROP/w620h342/concrete2.jpg","title":"massive concreteberg found in northern ireland sewer","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

This is typical of material getting into our sewers from new building works and developments. \"Combined with brick bats, stones and inappropriate rags it can be a real pain to get removed and a very expensive piece of maintenance work.\"Mr McGirr said the dumping could have disgusting consequences. “This act shows not only lack of respect for our network but also for the people living in the area. NI Water would remind all customers that opening a manhole or washing substances into the drainage system is prohibited. By doing this, you are obstructing a working sewer which is designed to take waste away from homes,\" he said.  data-dfpadtargetingNI Water staff at the scene.“By obstructing the sewer in this way, it reduces the pipe capacity and the volume of waste it is able to take this can lead to increased blockages and out of sewer flooding in the street or into a river.

We have all seen the disgusting effects of an overflowing manhole in the street and no one wants to see or smell itbut the reality is, it happens regularly at a cost of millions to NI Water each year.”NI Waters advice is:. Only flush the Ps, pee, poo and Paper – everything  goes in the bin. Do not pour fat, oil and grease down the sink and. Do not place anything down a manhole or wash substances into the drainage system.“In the last ten years, NI Water has spent over £. billion investing in water and wastewater infrastructure but no amount of investment will completely stop blocked pipespeople continue to misuse the sewerage system,\" Mr McGirr said."},{"url":null,"title":"mum tackling fouryear trek for charity due in northern ireland next month","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsLocal Elections NewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeHoliday Guide March Spring EditionCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Limerick had a few half chances, but couldnrsquot convert. lsquoHinch had chances of their own, including Alex Millarrsquos reverse shot which flew inches wide of the net.Millar was in the thick of it again minutes later. This time Stuart Hunterrsquos driving run from midfield found Millar open in the circle. He slipped the ball to the energetic Scott Leetch, who calmly slotted the ball into the goal to make it -.Limerick fought back and got themselves another goal before the half -time interval to make it -.After the restart the game had settled slightly and Ballynahinch started to get into a pattern of maintaining the ball effectively.With that, lsquoHinch were racking up the short corners, seven were won, but for some excellent defending and goalkeeping kept them at bay.With  minutes to go Ballynahinch took the lead again, this time through William Edgar.A few minutes later a piece of brilliance from Edgar made it - after a superb solo run matched with a spectacular finish.As expected, Limerick flooded men forward along with countless aerial passes, making it dficult for lsquoHinch to get out of their half.Limerick pulled one back with a short corner routine with five minutes remaining, but Ballynahinch had the ability to see out the game and lt the trophy for the third time in the clubrsquos history.A big thank you to all the supporters that spurred the men on in Dublin on Saturday, it was very much appreciated. A special mention to chairman Michael Mulholland for organising the transport to the final.Ballynahinch: Aaron Donnell, Rea Coffey, Ashley Brown, Leslie Harrison,Andrew Mulholland , William Edgar, Stuart Hunter, Matthew Martin, Alex Millar, Jason Campbell, Scott Leetch, Luke Curry, Michael Carney, Steven Crean, David Marshall, Josh Higginson.Man of the match: William Edgar.Ballynahinch Limerick IRISH HOCKEY CHALLENGE CUP FINAL.prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Archaeological dig uncovers skeletons dating back to 8th century  ","story":"ARCHAEOLOGICAL material found at Downpatrickrsquos Cathedral Hill dates back as far as  years after the birth of Jesus.Work from a Queenrsquos University Belfast team of archaeologists has dated skeletons buried some  years later, indicating a sizeable community living in Downpatrick at the time.The material was recovered during last Augustrsquos four-week excavation and community investigation which attracted , visitors from around the world.Local volunteers played a major role in uncovering the history of the site and there is another opportunity to get involved in another dig.Newry, Mourne and Down Council chairman Mark Murnin is urging local people, particularly students, to get involved in another dig which is to take place this August.ldquoI visited the archaeological dig on Cathedral Hill several times in August last year and was impressed by the community involvement, the volume of tourist visits and of course the incredible finds being made from our rich early Christian and medieval past, just a stonersquos throw from the traditional site of St Patrickrsquos grave, he said.ldquoItrsquos exciting to hear about the new discoveries that are being made and the Early Christian dates of some of the finds, and I am delighted to announce that a second season of excavation is to be funded by the Special European Union Programmes Body for this August, as part of its PEACE IV Programme, when young people between  and  will be invited to take part in the dig for at least four days. Itrsquos a great experience not to be missed.The material, including the discovery of  skeletons, has thrown up some interesting information on the Benedictine Abbey which occupied the site during the medieval period, as well as tantalising glimpses into the early Christian monastic site that was located there from the eighth century AD.Three trenches were excavated in the immediate vicinity of Holy Trinity Cathedral, two located in the old tennis courts and one located on the grass verge directly in line with the Cathedralrsquos west door, in advance of the replica of St Patrickrsquos Cross being installed.The trench on the verge revealed the existence of a substantial medieval cemetery with  skeletons being uncovered.Three of these were put forward for radiocarbon dating and the dates have recently been ed.The lowermost burial ed a date of - AD which indicates that this person lived and died before the Anglo-Norman invasion of  AD and before the present Abbey church was constructed on the site.This person would have lived at a time when the round tower mdash knocked down when the cathedral was refurbished around  mdash was still in use. The latest burial encountered ed a date of - AD showing that this person lived and died when the site was occupied by the Benedictine Abbey.Analysis of the skeletons is ongoing, but initial results of the latest burial indicate it to be a young, female, adult with severe dental trauma.The excavation in the tennis courts uncovered the kitchen and midden pit of the Benedictine Abbey.Site director Brian Sloan explained: ldquoA rich picture of medieval le was uncovered with masses of animal bone and pottery being recovered. We can use this evidence to build up a picture of the diet and everyday activities of the monks who lived and prayed here. The large pottery sherds have been painstakingly pieced together at QUB giving an idea of the shape, size and decoration of the vessels.He continued: ldquoA rich environmental picture is being established through the processing of the soil samples taken during the excavation. A multitude of blackberry seeds, sloe pips and fish bones have been recovered as well as charred wheat grains.Scientic techniques are now helping to identy and date the finds. An array of metalwork was recovered from the midden pit consisting of copper alloy and corroded iron artefacts, and these have been analysed and x-rayed.

This is undoubtedly the position of Roman Catholicism.ldquoThere are many doctrinal dferences between the Church of Ireland and the Church of Rome, the fundamental dference being that they preach and believe very dferent messages and ultimately cannot be united.ldquoAs Free Presbyterians, we would like to remind both those in the Church of Ireland and the Roman Catholic Church that good works do not save an inidual, the Lord Jesus Christ alone saves.ldquoTherefore, we conclude by beseeching those in St Paulrsquos Church of Ireland who love the Lord Jesus as their Saviour to not participate in any  unity march that would grieve the True and Living God.Fr McKinlay said this was the first time in his memory that there had been a protest against the walk.ldquoI think it is a sad reflection on le in todayrsquos world that men who preach the Christian gospel do not want others to walk with them, he remarked.ldquoI feel all of this is incredulous to say the least. There have never been protests about this walk in my time and I have been in Castlewellan for ten years.Fr McKinlay praised what he described as the ldquoexcellent community relations in Castlewellan and pointed out to a number of initiatives, such an inter-church choir, the Peace Bell and Peace Maze in the local forest park and a cross-community website involving all the churches in the Castlewellan area which was set up two years ago by the International Council of Churches under the auspices of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"From the pages of the Down Recorder%2C April 17%2C 1979  ","story":"EASTER mdash Down District sampled the start of what could be a record year in tourism when hundreds of thousands of day-trippers thronged into the area over the sun-drenched Easter holiday period.The first unbroken spell of sunny weather this year brought motorists flocking into the area mdash and left council tourism officials confident of a summer season boom.Newcastle was one of the biggest attractions over the holiday weekend and it was Easter Tuesday thatdrew the most people as thousands crammed into the resort to see the finish of the Circuit of Ireland Rally at the Slieve Donard Hotel.Forest parks at Tollymore, Castlewellan and Drumkeeragh were also a magnet, as were National Trust properties at Castleward, Mount Stewart and Rowallane Gardens in Saintfield.There were many tailbacks of traffic in many local towns, including Dundrum, Clough, Comber and Newtownards, and there bumper-to-bumper delays in bottleneck areas like Ballynahinch, Downpatrick and Newcastle.The Strangford ferry had the busiest ever period in its ten-year history as thousands of tourists used the crossing to drive up the Ards, or, coming in the opposite way, along the Lecale coast and into Newcastle.The two ferries made a total of  crossings on Monday alone, the highest ever, and it was an applaudable effort from all their staff that things went off without a hitch.Down Councilrsquos assistant tourist and recreation officer, Mr Frank Cunningham, was optimistic that this year would break all tourism records, providing the weather was kind.ldquoWe are all very hopeful for a tremendous year and are expecting some of the biggest ever crowds to converge on our resorts and attractions, he said.DOWNPATRICK mdash The programme for the St Patrickrsquos Festival in Downpatrick in five weeksrsquo time is taking shape and promises to be a dashing four-day bill to suit all tastes.ldquoIt is far from being just another town festival of bits and pieces, said organising committee vice-chairman Frank Connolly.ldquoFrom the opening procession to the open-air carnival four nights later it will be a fast-paced programme with many unique attractions that have neverbeen seen in the area before.The festival will open on Friday, May , with a through-town procession of floats and closes four days later with the carnival in Dunleath Park where the organisers promise that virtually everything thatcan happen will happen as long as it is entertaining.NEWCASTLE mdash Newcastle and District Ladies Circle held a very successful third annual meeting in the Brook Cottage Hotel recently.

He said: “The RHI scheme did not of itself provide any enhanced financial benefits to Moy Park.”Today senior Moy Park executive Justin Coleman appeared before MPs on the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee which is investigating the retrospective slashing of RHI payments.Mr Coleman, the poultry giant’s agri business and live production services director, admitted under questioning from North Down MP Lady Hermon that the company had benefited from RHI.However, when pressed to quanty that benefit he said it was “very dficult to put a number on it”.Lady Hermon doggedly attempted to establish how much RHI had enhanced Moy Park’s profitability.

She has already seen the impact Brexit has had on her work.“Brexit has and will cause major uncertainty in family law, particularly for those with a connection with an overseas jurisdiction.“The enforcement of maintenance obligations and financial orders, and bringing financial claims at all, will be fraught with complexity and increased cost and uncertainty for litigants.“There are likely to be jurisdiction races with the parties seeking to issue first in the jurisdiction most advantageous to their case.“England may no longer be the orce capital of the world, the jurisdiction wives dash to in order to get the best possible financial provision for themselves and their children.” The organisation Resolution, which represents family law firms, had previously warned Brexit was adding pressure to couples on the edge of orce.Sarah adds that she feels it has meant a decrease in orce applications. She said: “I think people are more cautious about separating or orcing when the financial future of the country is so uncertain.Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party holds rally in Sussex amid passionate protests Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"BHI | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"BHI | Article Teaser\"“Secondly, Brexit has affected property values and consequently negotiations around parties who want to buy out their partner’s interest in the family home.“Further, it has impacted my client’s incomes, in particular those clients whose business has a client base in Europe, and pension valuations, due to the dip in the financial markets.”Other issues that may be impacted on relates to same sex couples wanting to rely on the UK being their permanent home in order to apply for orce here.She added: “Brexit will obviously most affect the practice of lawyers who specialise in international family law and cases spanning more than one jurisdiction.”For most peopleyou apply for orce after exit day, the new rules will be in place but you should apply in the same way. However, getting your orce recognised in an EU country after a UK no deal exit may be affected.In regards to matters relating to childrenyou start a case after exit day you should apply in the same way.

Now, the bridge has several operational regulations like alarm levels ndash we canrsquot balance the high level of noise needed for a bridge and the low level needed for a residential area.

Marie Curie also provides support to people in their own homes, and its Information and Support Line now also features clinical nurse specialists who are available for any clinical support needed.The work to create the new cafeacute has been funded by the Hodge Foundation, who also supported the refurbishment of the hospicersquos Day Therapy and Outpatients Unit in .At the opening, cakes from the hospicersquos catering team were showcased, with staff, volunteers and patients joining Suzanne and the Hodge Foundation to enjoy welsh cakes and tea and coffee.Further works at the hospice, funded by a Legacy gt from the estate of Mrs Seaward have included the installation of a Spa bathroom on both inpatient units.There has also been further maintenance work carried out alongside the bathroom and cafeacute works. The works have been unveiled in a year in which the hospice is due to celebrate its th year.Sarah Lloyd-Davies, hospice manager, said: ldquoWe are so grateful to the Hodge Foundation for once again supporting vital work to not only allow us to continue to provide expert end of le care and support to people living with a terminal illness, and their families, but also to help us expand our reach to the community in Penarth.ldquoWe want people to understand more about the work we do here, and are excited to open our cafeacute doors and encourage people to come in and have conversations with us about end of le care.ldquoThank you also to the estate of Mrs Seaward for allowing us to create two relaxing and calming Spa bathrooms for patients, which help elevate the service we can provide at the hospice.Volunteer Ian Spence, who has been volunteering on reception for  years, is now also spending some hours helping in the cafeacute.He said: ldquoIt makes me feel good about myself. I get to give something back to the community, or rather put something into it.ldquoThe hospice is such a warm place to come to and the staff are all fantastic at making everyone feel welcome.Suzanne, who has previously visited the hospice with brother and Olympian Colin Jackson, said: ldquoItrsquos been a pleasure to officially open the new Marie Curie Cafeacute at the charityrsquos Cardf and the Vale Hospice in Penarth.ldquoMeeting the staff, volunteers and families and hearing stories about the care provided here for people living with a terminal illness has been inspiring. I wish the hospice every luck with their new venture, and hope it will encourage more people to talk about end of le with their loved ones.The Marie Curie cafeacute is currently open from .am to pm Monday to Friday, with plans to expand hours with trained volunteers.If you would like to volunteer, contact the hospice on    or visit www.mariecurie.org.uk volunteering article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

So many people say lsquowhy wonrsquot the council talk to us \"Cllr Steffan William askedsports pitches could be ldquofenced off to prevent dogs walking on them, but the councilrsquos operational manager Colin Smith said this ldquocould be quite costly for the council.At the start of the meeting, Mr Smith said: ldquoWe know the majority of dog owners are responsible and we donrsquot want to limit them from the green spaces the Vale has to offer.There were also calls for more dog waste bins throughout the Vale at the meeting.Councillors heard there have been just six prosecutions for dog fouling in the Vale of Glamorgan in the past year.Cardf councilrsquos PSPO against dog fouling will see dog owners fined poundtheyrsquore found without bags or the means of picking up after their pets.But Mr Smith said: ldquoThe legal team were concerned it wouldnrsquot be lawful.

In England the local government budget has seen cuts that are twice as large as here in Wales and school spending has been much better protected.When I met Penarth head teachers I was honest about our choice to protect NHS spending.Health has consistently been the top priority of the public and I still face demands from all parties to spend even more money on the NHS.To deliver signicantly more money for schools and the local government budget would mean taking money out of the NHS.Keeping our commitment to the NHS affects every other public service, including our schools. That is the reality of nearly a decade of austerity.That does not mean that schools have been abandoned.For example the Welsh Government chose to increase funding to our st Century Schools programme. That means more new schools like the Penarth Learning Community and thanks to the budget deal secured by Labour councillors more money to renovate Victorian schools in the Vale.This year changes to teachers pensions by the UK Government have created a multi-million pound hole in school budgets. The UK Government only passed on  per cent of the costs to Wales. The Welsh Government funded the missing  per cent but that is money that canrsquot be spent somewhere .Despite the fact that local government in Wales has a much better funding deal than across the border in England I recognise that our councils have an incredibly dficult challenge setting a budget.We all saw that in the Vale, where nearly half the ruling Conservative group refused to back the budget proposal from their own leadership. There is a choice to be made between reducing services or raising council tax. Even after council tax rises most councils are still reducing services.Education and social services are the largest spending areas for local councils. Each council decides their own spending priorities and dferent councils have made dferent choices.The local funding formula for schools in the Vale was reviewed and simplied by the previous Labour administration and agreed by local head teachers. Itrsquos simpler and more transparent as a result.Itrsquos disappointing that the Vale Council leadership refuses to recognise that it has any responsibility for school funding choices. For example Cardf council has put a larger proportion of its budget into schools than the Vale.I welcome the Welsh Government review into the local authority funding formula. The wider review should provide an updated picture.However that in itself does not mean that there will be more money flowing into school budgets in the Vale.That still comes back to choices about how much money we are prepared to invest in our public services rather than a competition between public services that each of us value. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

He shook my hand, and showed me some of the facilities.I was shown how the ldquoMagic Carpet works, an interactive board on the floor. It lit up with a flower pattern, that moved and shimmered when stood on.I was then invited to the soft play room, where Elias flung himself over the equipment, scampering above me and the assistant. He grinned for the camera.Ysgol Y Deri particularly shines in the creative approaches it takes to putting its students first.In the big school I was shown to ldquoThe Holodeck, a Star-Trek-esque room filled with projectors and touchscreen sensitive walls.There was a French quiz projected across the walls, and the students jumped around the room selecting the correct words.The sensory experience was not only impressively creative, but vital to some studentsrsquo learning.The school has many similar rooms built to offer a multi-disciplinary team approach to the youngsters and offer a fully holistic experience.They have a large team of therapists on site, including nurses, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, physiotherapists, music therapists and play therapists.They also offer a huge range of interventions, designed to put their pupilsrsquo happiness and education at the forefront.They offer yoga, mindfulness lessons, climbing, gardening, wood work, pet therapy, rebound therapy and hydrotherapy, as just a small example. Timetables are crafted to suit inidualsrsquo needs, as some pupils respond better than others to certain lessons.I was shown to a classroom where a group of seven students worked on their laptops.These students were proud of their work and excited to talk about maths.We were then ushered through as a group for a photo with next doorrsquos class, a group with physical disabilities.The students waited patiently as overhead cranes helped those who could not walk into position.Everyone smiled. Thumbs and peace signs were flashed.Afterwards, a Learning Support Assistant tapped me on the shoulder and reminded me to take a photo of Caitlyn.I pointed the camera at her, and Caitlinrsquos smile immediately reached her ears.Maxine, a fellow student, told me how proud her family were of her and her work.The happiness of every one of the pupils is palpable, filling every area of the school, as does the pride of the teachers.ldquoWe have our pupils come back in every now and then, said Stacey Long, the schoolrsquos transition officer.She helps pupils move on from the school and into adult le.ldquoThey always tell me how much the school meant to them, how helpful it was in getting a job.ldquoWe try hard to get pupils ready for adult le where we can.ldquoWe have a coffee shop on campus where several students get plenty of work experience.The curriculum covers both the national curriculum as well as general le skills.One interactive quiz I was shown could be rapidly switched from a lesson on the Great Fire of London, to a quiz on which materials go in which recycle bin.There are plenty of extra-curricular activities on offer too, including choir and youth club and regular trips outside of school.I was given a glimpse into a gym, along with a music recording room with plenty of recording equipment, and the school radio room.Outside, pupils are given a huge playground with an outdoor classroom, space to play sport, a climbing wall and little walled off sections for each of the primary classes.Developer Barratt Homes was also on the site, building a sensory garden for students to enjoy.Last week a group of pupils of ying abilities went on a trip to Paris, where they were involved with ious Comenius [European Union education] projects and forged links with numerous schools in other European countries. Several pupils couldnrsquot wait to tell me about it, showing off photos.Chris Britten, the head teacher of Ysgol Y Deri, said: ldquoWe work with every child. They are all dferent and we treat every one as an inidual. We meet their needs so they can flourish, both in school and after they leave. He is immensely proud of his staff and pupils.Itrsquos easy to see why. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

It included investing pound billion a year in lowering prices by the third year of the deal completing, equating to a % cut on everyday items.Mr Coupe said on Thursday: ldquoThe specic reason for wanting to merge was to lower prices for customers. The CMArsquos conclusion that we would increase prices post-merger ignores the dynamic and highly competitive nature of the UK grocery market. The CMA is today effectively taking pound billion out of customersrsquo pockets.Sainsburyrsquos, Walmart and Asda have now mutually agreed to terminate the transaction. -- vw,vw,px, px\"It is the first major CMA decision since the appointment of former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie as chairman  --Shares in Sainsburyrsquos tumbled over % in morning trade to .p.A merger between the duo, the UKrsquos number two and three supermarkets, would have created a supermarket titan bigger than Tesco with revenues of pound billion and a network of , Sainsburyrsquos, Asda and Argos stores.But fears had been expressed that suppliers could get squeezed as a result, with the tie-up giving the merged entity increased buying power.The move to reject the merger marks the first major decision the CMA has made since the appointment of former Tory MP Andrew Tyrie as chairman.Best known for his role as head of the influential Treasury Select Committee, Mr Tyrie gained a reputation as an effective inquisitor of corporate figures.It remains unclear where the duo go from here, but it is understood that Walmart will continue to look to sell Asda to another buyer.Walmart chief executive Judith McKenna said: ldquoWhile wersquore disappointed by the CMArsquos final report and conclusions, our focus now is continuing to position Asda as a strong UK retailer delivering for customers. Walmart will ensure Asda has the resources it needs to achieve that.Roger Burnley, the Asda boss, said that he is ldquodisappointed in the CMArsquos decision.Unions reacted with delight at the decision, with the GMB and Unite hailing it as a victory for staff amid fears of store closures and job losses as a result of the deal.Attention will now turn toMr Coupe, who is expected to face questions over his future following the breakdown of the deal.The chief executive drew criticism last year after he was caught on camera singing ldquowersquore in the money following the merger announcement.He later apologised, calling it an ldquounfortunate choice of song from the musical nd Street..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagaga, title: Competition watchdog blocks Sainsbury us-Asda merger article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Thoughts are with his family  friends.”A tribute issued on behalf of the Portadown College community said their friend and colleague was a “highly charismatic educator and leader” whose lelong passion for outdoor pursuits and Duke of Edinburgh award expeditions instilled a “love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures”.It is understood Mr Harper was on a walking holiday when he died. The cause of his death is not yet known.The school tribute added: “Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance. Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an Officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.“In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A statement issued by Rathfriland High School paid tribute to Mr Harper Simon as a man of unquestionable integrity.“Simon was a great school leader who had the needs of the pupils at the core of all he did. His integrity was unquestionable. He was true gentleman. He will be greatly missed in the field of education,” the school said.Portadown College community statement in full: On Good Friday,  April , the College Community lost not only our highly esteemed Principal with the untimely passing of Simon Harper, but a much valued colleague and dearfriend too.From attending his very first College event, the  Carol Service before officially assuming the reigns of Portadown College on  April , Simon lived out the College motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” with “Courage and Courtesy” in every aspect of his le.Already a successful and experienced Headmaster on his arrival in Portadown, Simon was a highly charismatic educator and leader. He began his career in  as a Chemistry Teacherin Wallace High School, moving to Regent House School where he later was appointed Head of Chemistry and then to the Principalship of Rathfriland High School. From his early career,Simon excelled not only as a vibrant and engaging classroom teacher, but also as the leader of the largest Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme in the Province whilst at Regent House.Simon brought to Portadown College this lelong passion for adventure and outdoor pursuits by participating in Duke of Edinburgh expeditions and instilling a love of the outdoors in all of the young people who participated in these ventures.A hallmark of Simon’s Principalship was his heartfelt interest in students and staff as iniduals. So as to ensure that each knew their value, he was always ready to offer a gentle word of encouragement and would urge them to, “Do something today that your future self will thank you for”.Regardless of background, belief or personal circumstances, students, staff and parents were received with a warm smile and a sincere willingness to work towards a positive outcome. In all such situations, Simon gave of his time generously and graciously, always setting aside his own priorities to support others.Simon was a strong educational leader with distinctive values which he brought to a range of challenging situations. As a College community, we are indebted to him for the dedication and industry he demonstrated in working alongside the Board of Governors to advocate for the Dickson Plan, consistently placing students at the heart of his educational vision.A man of strong personality and principles, Simon espoused high standards in allaspects of College le and never once shied away from any criticism this might have attracted.Simon’s service to education in Northern Ireland extended beyond Portadown College and included holding office in the Craigavon Area Learning Community, Association of ControlledGrammar Schools and the Post-Primary Principal’s Association. His long standing career had also involved acting as Chief Examiner for A Level Chemistry with the CCEA.A passionate traveller who enjoyed adventures in the most far-flung corners of the globe,Simon was ever keen to share his experiences with students and staff alike, encouraging each and every one to get out into the world, savour its magnicence and seize every opportunity. One of Simon’s most distinctive qualities was that he never lost a childlike sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the world. He took particular delight in his garden at the foothills of the Mountains of Mourne and regularly enjoyed walking these hills with his much loved Irish Deerhound companions, Oisin and Uther.Current and former students will remember with fondness his infectious sense of fun and wicked humour, from his cameo roles in College charity events to a starring role in “PC Happy”. In jovial banter with students, staff and Governors, he also shared his love for sport, in particular his longstanding support for Ulster and Irish Rugby, alongside Coventry City and Crusaders football teams.A man of eclectic taste, Simon derived considerable joy from art and music of all genres - classical, Irish folk and contemporary. Proud of his Banbridge roots and passionate about his Ulster culture, he demonstrated a reverent respect for tradition, as exemplied through his meticulous attention to detail and great pride in leading the College’s annual Act of Remembrance.Indeed, Simon often reflected poignantly on the sacrice of others and had served proudly as an officer in the Royal Naval Reserve for almost a quarter of a century.Students and staff alike will hold dear the sentiment of Simon’s final Easter Assembly, inspired by his many visits to Coventry Cathedral, in which he spoke on the theme of Forgiveness and the message of Hope in the death and resurrection of Jesus themes deeply important to Simon and ones which he sought to enact in his daily le.As a College community, our loss is immeasurable. However, we will endeavour to uphold the College Motto “Fortiter et Humaniter” in Simon’s memory:May the road rise up to meet you.May the wind be always at your back.May the sun shine warm upon your facethe rains fall soft upon your fieldsand until we meet again,may God hold you in the palm of His hand.try catch  TrendingPortadown College principal dies suddenlyTribute paid to Portadown College

We have a business that has very much enjoyed its own expansion and we want to shine a light on our next generation of young professionals”.According to Susan Dunlop, that’s a well refined mantra at GMcG Chartered Accountants. Susan is one of seven directors at GMcG, having joined the firm more than  years ago and who now heads up the firm’s Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Part of planning for the future has been the recent appointment of a new director in Audit and Business Advisory Services, together with an associate director who will head up the firm’s Corporate Finance department. Both are signicant investments at management level and a reflection of the firm’s growth and ambition across its three offices.“As a leading independent accountancy firm, many of our key strengths lie in our ability to get things done, through local decision making, management and accessibility of our people” Susan says.Accessibility is regularly acknowledged as being of great value to the firm’s clients and has become a key component of how the firm does business.“Business owners know they can lt the phone and speak to any of our directors, at any time of the day. For us, that’s just part of our client service, but our clients expect it and they know it can make a huge dference to getting an issue resolved quickly and effectively, allowing them to get on with running their business.”As local businesses face uncertainty and challenges across many fronts, Susan and the management team recognise the importance of being positioned as the complete business advisor and having the expertise, understanding and experience to deliver. “Businesses evolve through dferent circumstances and with dferent requirements. We need to be one step ahead, providing the right expertise at the right time. GMcG can offer this expertise through our service lines which include Audit and Business Advisory, Tax, Forensic Accounting and Investigation, Corporate Finance, GMcG Digital and International liaison, through our TIAG membership.” The firm delivers these services though a team of more than  employees across three offices in Belfast, Lisburn and Portadown. Having initially operated as independent firms in each locationthe GMcG evolution was completed in  when the three firms merged completely under a single GMcG brand. This was a signicant investment and transition for the firm.Gill Johnston, director at GMcG Portadown, says: “It was vital that we didn’t lose focus on the profile and client relationships we had developed over many years in each location. “So we are delighted with the success of the transition and how the shared systems and expertise are adding real value to client service delivery across each location”. GMcG services a broad client base from sole traders to large corporates, including a erse range of businesses and private iniduals, public and not-for-profit sector entities, as well as legal and other professional services practices.For Susan and the rest of the team, the firm’s independence and longstanding client relationships are what bolster the firm’s success.“We have a loyal and growing client base and are particularly proud of the fact that many of these relationships go back decades or transcend generations. We advise many of these clients on succession planning, helping them develop their business through the next stage of its journey. “In our experience, all of this is underlined by the importance of investing in client relationships, getting to know the client’s business, their issues, opportunities and the type of expertise they need.“It can be a long term effort and something that often demands dedication beyond a nine to five working day. But we always view it as a rewarding investment, especially when we see our clients thrive and grow.”As part of the firm’s growth and expansion, GMcG has undergone major investment in its overall strategy, its people, IT systems and recruitment.With no shortage of drive and ambition, it’s very much a case of ‘been there, done that’ for GMcG, having themselves undergone restructuring, appointed new directors, undertaken signicant investment, experienced dynamic growth and transitioned seamless succession planning.“We have done it ourselves, and been through it all,” Susan says. “We have grown our firm and understand many of the challenges and opportunities facing SME clients with real aspirations or plans for business development we have that insight and experience that has really proved valuable in advising many of these clients.”Building on these foundations, the firm today has a strong focus on developing the next generation of its service team. A younger generation of professional advisors are moving up the ranks in the firm, with other new faces joining the expanding management team.Nigel Moore, who started with the firm back in  as a trainee, has been appointed director in the Audit and Business Advisory Services department. Director Stephen Houston also started his career as a trainee and heads up GMcG’s Lisburn office. Robbie Milliken, who has more than  years’ experience across corporate finance and business banking, has also joined the firm to head up its Corporate Finance department.Susan is keen to acknowledge that GMcG is a firm that is proud of its working environment, and that career progression is part and parcel of its ethos.“We give employees every opportunity to progress through the ranks and be rewarded for their success, and we can point to two of our directors who commenced as trainees. We feel this is testament to the experience and environment we offer, and to our commitment to ensuring employees reach their full potential”. “Importantly, achieving the right work-le balance is something we facilitate and promote as much as possible across all grades. We are very aware of the importance of mental health and wellbeing and are delighted to have partnered with a mental health charity for the last two years, with mental health programmes delivered across GMcG’s offices.”GMcG also has the global reach to serve clients wherever the growth of their business takes them, through its membership of The International Accounting Group .Lyn Canning Hagan, who heads up GMcG Tax Services and is one of the firm’s TIAG liaison directors, says:“TIAG, together with its sister alliance TAGLaw, provides GMcG and our clients direct access to accounting, tax and legal expertise across more than  countries worldwide. “This is hugely beneficial to businesses with international markets or operations and many of our clients have already benefited from this global expertise across numerous jurisdictions.”Looking to the Ulster Business Next , which features in this edition of the magazine, Susan Dunlop says many of those small and medium-sized Northern Ireland businesses making the list are exactly the type of clients GMcG is working with.“We’re proud of our track record of helping SME clients across all sectors achieve success through growth, restructuring or expansion, drawing on our own experiences to make a real dference in shaping their future plans.”So, it goes without saying that the future is more than bright for GMcG – a firm with decades of experience, but one which is always looking forward.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ub_11.jpg","title":"we need a sea change and this is just the beginning","story":"Posted on Thursday April  by Ulster Business Ulster Business sits down with a host of top femalebusiness leaders at one of Ulster Bank’s DSE dinners to look at the challenges facing women entering the world of business, what change is needed and how far we’ve already come  ‘This is just the beginning’. That’s a general sense of where Northern Ireland and the UK sits as a whole around female entrepreneurship.But it’s also widely agreed that a sea change is needed, from an early level, to develop the next generation of female entrepreneurs, and address a chasm in gender disparity across the business landscape.Sitting in a room with some of Northern Ireland’s female leaders in business during a dinner at Ulster Bank’s Belfast headquarters, the experience, enthusiasm and depth of knowledge which exudes is very clear.But there’s frustration at the challenges and hurdles which continue to prevent senior business and entrepreneurship being played on a level playing field.The gathering of business leaders in Belfast heard one of the challenges is that many women starting up their own companies, don’t consider themselves ‘entrepreneurs’.There’s issues around access to funding, but not only that, it’s about the lack of awareness of the funds which are out there – for both female and male would-be entrepreneurs.There are also some stark figures and findings, including those in the Alison Rose Review of Female Entrepreneurship.The Rose Review, carried out by Alison Rose, deputy chief executive of NatWest Holdings and chief executive, commercial and private banking, found that just one in three entrepreneurs are women, and cast a light on the disparity and challenges facing women of all ages in business, developing ideas, finding the funding, and expanding.It also predicts that closing the entrepreneurial gap between men and women, and creating a level business playing field, could add an additional £bn to the UK economy. On the ground in Northern Ireland, there are positive signs emerging for those at the very beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. Ulster Bank’s own Entrepreneur Accelerator, headed by Lynsey Cunningham, has already helped a raft of people on the road to becoming their own bosses and driving a concept to fruition – and refreshingly, around % of those using the scheme so far are women.The Rose Review has outlined a range of areas which can help realign and balance the start-up market, including investing in a ‘female entrepreneurs’ code – committing financial institutions to the principles of gender equality and transparent reporting of gender funding data.But there seems to be agreement that this sea change can, and should, start right at school – bringing in more hands-on skills and education, as well as fostering entrepreneurship for both boys and girls at an early age.The challenges facing women also raises the issue of ersity, in general, across business and entrepreneurship. It’s fair to say everyone is in agreement that a wide iety of ethnic, religious or sexual backgrounds can only be a positive element for any business or economy.That ersity should also feed into every element and strand of business – from the support at an early stage, to venture capital funding and further company development.While STEM subjects have gotten a bigger push in recent years, the question was posed – why would a school pupil consider starting a business, straight out of school,it’s not taught, fostered or encouraged Looking to the challenges facing successful women in business already, there’s one case in which a company owner – boasting a multi-million pound turnover – says she still faces both conscious and unconscious bias.There’s also a strong sense of talking about failure, rather than just success. It’s something most agree can be a positive step in any entrepreneurial journey, and that a ‘fear of failure’ can hold people back from taking any steps at all.In Northern Ireland, the top level of business leaders among our biggest companies is increasingly male-dominated. The Ulster Business Top  Companies  showed just two of the businesses on the list were headed by women. That number has actually dropped from six, from just a few years ago.But there is something of a gradual change happening in Northern Ireland and across the UK as a whole, albeit slowly. According to Dell, Belfast is among the top  cities for female entrepreneurship. But there’s still a long way to go.Of course, one of the toughest steps in getting an idea off the ground is funding. Crowdfunder is one organisation helping fuel that, and assists small start-ups in getting backing from everyone from friends and family, to the philanthropic who just want to see an idea succeed. It’s partnered with Ulster Bank parent company RBS, offering up reward-based crowdfunding to help test their business ideas.The conversation always comes back to education, key skills and changing the mindset of young people at an early age. If the next generation of school leavers can leave with a positive entrepreneurial attitude, free from any gender bias, then it could go a long way to balancing the breakdown of men and women in top senior roles in the years to come.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/tont_1.jpg","title":"next  cde global","story":"Posted on Friday April  by Ulster Business For the last  years, Co Tyrone-headquartered CDE Global has designed and installed almost , turnkey wet processing solutions across the world.The business, based in Cookstown and headed by founder Tony Convery, has seen its turnover soar to just shy of £m – rising by more than £m in the space of just  months.

The egg processing business includes big names such as Marks and Spencer and McDonald’s among its customers.Frylite, which started le when Eamon McCay opened a cooking oil business at a small Strabane premises, has seen its turnover increase to £m, with pre-tax profits sitting at £.m. He’s now grown Frylite from a small family operation to an Ireland-wide firm with more than  staff.And helping highlight the firms which are still based in Northern Ireland and retain ownership here, accountancy firm Harbinson Mulholland hosted its inaugural HM Homegrown event in Belfast.Showcasing the top  SMEs here, it highlighted that Northern Ireland boasts more homegrown businesses per head of population than Wales, Scotland and all regions across the north of England.And almost % of them operate in just three sectors – manufacturing, construction and wholesale retail. Of the list,  are based in Co Antrim,  in Co Down, nine in Co Tyrone, eight in Armagh and one each in Co Londonderry and Fermanagh.The firms earned just over £m in operating profit in their last reporting year on a turnover of £.bn, while almost £m in wages and salaries was paid out to , employees.  out of the  businesses are family-controlled.Professor Mark Durkin, executive dean of Ulster University Business School, which carried out the research, says the economic impact of the  companies “is considerable generating as they do £.bn in revenues and wages of almost £m”.“These companies act as key enablers of Northern Ireland’s entrepreneurial ecosystem, an ecosystem that Ulster University Business School is proud to be part of. The results of this research demonstrate that just because businesses are local in origin does not imply, they are not global in ambition that because they are from traditional sectors does not mean they are not modern in outlook. Indeed, local homegrown businesses have a sense of place and origin that can really create competitive advantage.“Northern Ireland has demonstrated its ability to sell its agri-food, manufacturing and construction products and services overseas, but internationally successful companies tend not to emerge in isolation. “Domestic competition drives innovation, efficiency and productivity improvements, which in turn develop businesses which can take on any competitor across the world. As a result, there is merit in Government identying the most appropriate ways to support the continued growth of successful clusters to help power the economy into the future.”And Darren McDowell, senior partner of Harbinson Mullholland said that homegrown businesses were the backbone of the practice’s client base.“The Top  list underlines the vibrancy of this group of companies and the spending power they give to local communities through employment.“Attention is often focused on other sectors, but this research demonstrates the continued importance of traditional businesses and industries to the local economy and the extent to which they can be successful.”There’s also a raft of multi-generational businesses here, which have kept both ownership and controlOne of those is food giant Henderson. It’s now in its fourth generation of the Agnew family, and is undergoing further expansion at its Mallusk headquarters. But while it’s very much a family affair, the company is now the sixth largest Northern Ireland business, according to last year’s Ulster Business Top  – with turnover of £m.Martin Agnew told Ulster Business: “It’s important for us as a family to continue to run our business with the same values on which Henderson Group was established by my great-grandfather, John Henderson. We’re also proud that we have built a sustainable business which continues to proactively develop and expand, and provides employment for over , people in Northern Ireland.”    More than  years ago, John Henderson set up a stall selling butter, eggs and cheese – he was a well-known figure and frequently was a judge of cheese and butter at the annual Balmoral Show.That subsequently progressed into a stall at St George’s Market in Belfast, and then in , the business was incorporated as a limited company.In , William Agnew married John Henderson’s daughter, and in  William joined the company as a salesman, taking a controlling interest when John Henderson retired three years later. A few years later in  John Henderson, founder of the company died at the age of .Now, the company owns a range of brands – notably SPAR and Vivo – and has spent millions in the last few years expanding its operations.Operating out of its head office in Mallusk, it employs , people across Northern Ireland.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/ppb.jpg","title":"powered by talent making return to belfast","story":"Posted on Friday  April  by Ulster Business A host of top speakers will descend on Belfast in May for the second Powered by Talent event.The full day event – taking place at ICC Belfast on May  – has been signicantly expanded this year and will accommodate in excess of  attendees, making it the largest talent-focused conference on the island of Ireland and one of the highest profile events in the UK.Justin Rush, founding member of Powered By Talent and director of Abacus Talent Group, says: “Talent attraction and retention remains one of the biggest challenges businesses face.

Close to a thirdsaid their employer was less committed to achieving gender equality, with womenmore likely to believe there was a need for improvement, versus % of men. Only % of all respondents said their employer was committed to achieving gender equality, with men overwhelmingbelieving this to be the case versus % of women. There’s clearly still a long way to go.Most business leaders are well aware of the merit of employing a erse workforce. Diversity in areas including age, employee background, gender and religion affirms a message of inclusivity within the organisation and to a wider external audience, creating a strong position andHiring methods are an integral element of increasing ersity among employees, and CVs are one of the many ways in which the process can be improved. Many organisations will judge candidates based on their most recent job listing, potentially overlooking talented and competent applicants without a steady course of uninterrupted career progression. This can particularly disadvantage many women in professional sectors who have prioritised childcare at points throughout their career.Whether you believe it or not, we all have unconscious bias built in to our responses to others. So,you could eliminate those biases from the process, would you do so More and more organisations, including many here in Northern Ireland, now recruit based on blind CVs, where information such as age, race and gender is removed to prevent subconscious biases from influencing hiring decisions.Using competency-based application processes assesses essential soft skills such as communication, emotional intelligence, problem solving and self-motivation, rather than testing specic knowledge, which can be learned more quickly than soft skills. The absence of a CV can change the way you prepare questions and open interviews up to discussions that wouldn’t otherwise take place.Favouring competency-based applications or requiring blind CVs is a sign your organisation is taking steps to fairly assess candidates based on their skills and experience. These methods of talent-based hiring also demonstrate a commitment to overcoming the perceived disadvantage of career breaks which will positively contribute to erse representation across all sectors.The practice of blind hiring is not without its shortcomings. For instance a candidate’s personal information can only be withheld during the initial screening process. Once a line manager conducts a one-to-one interview there is no way to suppress a candidate’s gender, ethnicity or age. While applying the principle may result in a wider pool of first-round interviewees employers subsequently be faced with the same ersity challenges, for example, seeking graduates with a first class honours or a high :.At Hays we have trialled blind recruitment at assessment centres for a number internal of appointments. The absence of a CV opened up a depth of enquiry and supporting examples from interviewees where the receipt of a CV might not have encouraged the same level of enquiry and open-mindedness.Demand for transparency around targets and performance is also at an all-time high. So,your organisation is transparent in their ersity reporting, it proves their willingness to make a public commitment to achieving a fairly recruited workforce and makes them accountable for measuring and reporting their progress.  You’ll undoubtedly make some excellent new hires that you may not have appointedyou maintained your traditional processes.View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
