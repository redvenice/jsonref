It is not going to be wall-to-wall sunshine, but it is not going to be a washout each day.\u0027The weather warning means there is a risk of torrential rain, hail, frequent lightning and strong gusty winds in much of England and Wales if intense thunderstorms break out. Downpours could see totals of 1.2in (30mm) to 1.6in (40mm) of rainfall in an hour, with some locations potentially receiving up to 6in (150mm) in three hours. The Met Office added that these would be fairly isolated incidents.Regarding today, Mr Snell said: \u0027The warning does not imply that everyone is going to see them (thunderstorms) - a lot of places will remain dry, sunny and hot - but we will see some fairly severe thunderstorms developing over the course of the day.\u0027Western areas may be more at risk of thunderstorms than regions in the east, but anywhere in the warning area could be struck - and most parts will stay dry, he stressed.The sunshine is still set to hit the south east and there will be \u0027a high chance of 36C\u0027 (97F) in the region.Friday saw the hottest August day in 17 years, with temperatures hitting 97.5F (36.4C) at Heathrow and Kew Gardens in West London.Mr Snell said: \u0027We started this run of 30C days on Thursday, and Monday will be the fifth day where we will have those temperatures down in the south eastern quarter of the UK.\u0027Scotland and Northern Ireland may have a lesser risk of seeing thunderstorms on Thursday as temperatures start to fall away."},{"url":null,"title":"Council run contact tracing systems set 94 areas England squash virus","story":"Share this article Local public health officials had been crying out for months to be given the power to do their own contact tracing. Gerry Taylor, Luton borough council\u0027s director of public health, said last month she was \u0027very concerned\u0027 at the low rate in her town and blamed the centralised system for being too far removed from communities. Luton has since become one of the first areas to have its own local, dedicated tracing team.Blackburn with Darwen Council also launched its own track and trace scheme to combat a rise in infections in the area.Its public health chief, Professor Dominic Harrison, said the national system was \u0027simply not tracing enough cases and contacts fast enough\u0027.Reacting to today\u0027s news, James Jamieson, chairman of the cross-party Local Government Association, said: \u0027This announcement is good news for everyone. \u0027A strong national and local partnership is critical for test and trace to work as effectively as possible and it is right that local resources are kept under constant review to ensure everyone involved is able to help stop the virus spreading further.\u0027Using councils’ unrivalled local knowledge and vast experience of contact tracing within local public health teams is vital in the Government’s national efforts.\u0027 It comes after a study by University College London and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine last week found reopening schools will cause a devastating second wave if the test and trace system drastically improves.Scientists said reopening schools in the UK would inevitably result in another crisis that peaks in December.But it could be avoided — with pubs remaining open and no draconian lockdowns needed — if testing is dramatically ramped up and the contact tracing system becomes better.Three quarters of people with Covid-19 would need to be tested and self-isolate to prevent a second wave caused by schools reopening. Experts found that, to prevent a second wave when schools reopen, the NHS contact tracing system must reach 68 per cent of cases and their contacts.But the current NHS system is \u0027not good enough\u0027. It reaches half of contacts and only a fraction of symptomatic cases are tested, according to the researchers. Three quarters of people with Covid-19 would need to be tested and self-isolate to prevent a second wave caused by schools reopening. Labour today wrote to Heath Secretary Matt Hancock demanding urgent reform of the system ahead of schools going back next month.The party wrote: \u0027The stakes are too high to tolerate failure in either the operation or the design of this crucial public service.\u0027We cannot afford for the test and trace system to continue as it is without rapid reform. It is not too late to improve the system and put in place new, locally-led contact tracing measures.\u0027Meanwhile, Boris Johnson told teachers today they have a \u0027moral duty\u0027 to help schools reopen next month as he faced a standoff with unions.The PM warned it is \u0027not right\u0027 that pupils should spend more time out of the classroom, reiterating his determination for a full return when term begins.While he was careful to praise the work done by teachers and unions to make schools \u0027safe\u0027 in time for the move, he added: \u0027It is our moral duty as a country to make sure that happens.\u0027The intervention - on a visit to a school in Upminster - came as unions were accused of a bid to sabotage the government\u0027s plans with a 200-item list of safety demands.The National Education Union has provided its half a million members with a \u0027checklist\u0027 of Covid-secure measures, saying they should \u0027escalate\u0027 complaints if they are not being followed. There have also been calls for pupils to be taught on a week on, week off rota.But Professor Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and a member of Sage, said studies had suggested children were \u0027very minor players in the transmission overall\u0027 of the virus.And he insisted teachers were not at significantly higher risk than any other workers.Ministers have also played down calls for teachers and pupils to be routinely tested whether or not they have symptoms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/100085941f6850f256b3292185f94328abb9969f/0_333_3984_2390/master/3984.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9e2581daa603e66f6e95ef73e5e15689","title":"the big picture on the road with los angeles alternative schoolie movement","story":"Photographer Dotan Saguy captures an American family’s existence in a former school busMore than 16,000 people in Los Angeles live in cars, vans and buses. Some are part of the “schoolie” movement, families who have bought an old school bus and converted it into a mobile home.Photographer Dotan Saguy met Ismael and Greice Reis and their three children on the first day they arrived in the city in 2019 in their yellow school bus. Ismael and Greice were Mormons, originally from Brazil. The kids were aged two, five and 10. Saguy spent most of the year photographing the family as they tried to survive in LA in their bus. His book Nowhere to Go But Everywhere documents their progress.They had been travelling by then for six months after Ismael had given up his job as a waiter in Delaware. They had set out with a tank full of gas and $400. Casual work had proved hard to find. Their worst stories always began “Our bus broke down”. Once, in Pennsylvania, in the absence of alternatives, Ismael was forced to sit outside a Walmart with a cardboard sign reading: “Hungry, travelling with family, auto problems, please help.” He raised $200 in an hour.Though the family set out with the idea of being missionaries, they had come to doubt their faith. A different kind of philosophy had taken over, one they learned from watching The Lion King: “hakuna matata”, no worries, live for the moment. “I’m totally devoted to it,” Ismael said. “I’m not thinking about how I’m going to pay my bills next month or whether I’m running out of milk. It’s almost like you’re Tarzan swinging on a vine: in order to continue moving, you need to let go and trust the next vine will be there to carry you forward.

Given the deluge of personal minutiae – from Harry’s emoji habit to Meghan’s favourite hair highlight shades – as well as their litigiousness when it comes to undesired invasions of privacy (they are currently engaged in legal battles with the Mail on Sunday and an American paparazzo), this seems about as credible as Diana’s similar protestations of innocence, all of which Morton scotched about 10 seconds after she died. But whereas Diana chose a tabloid hack as her Boswell, who knew a good story when he saw it, Harry and Meghan opted for two royal journalists. This means the reader is subjected to the Sylvie Krin style of writing that is de rigeur in the genre (I could just about stomach Harry and his “famed ginger locks”, but details of his and Meghan’s glamping trip to Botswana, on which “their days were spent getting closer to nature and their evenings, closer to each other” made me briefly furious that the book hadn’t come with a health warning). Less forgivable than the predictable fluff is how the authors fluff the tale. Because Harry and Meghan definitely have a story to tell, but it is not the story in this book.By now, everyone – and certainly everyone who will buy this book – knows the outlines of this saga: Harry, the scampish prince, meets Meghan, the beautiful American actor, who wows him with her glamorous civilian ways (“In fact, Harry,” Durand and Scobie exclusively reveal, “lived within a bubble of sorts”). They marry and live happily ever after – if by “living happily ever after” we mean the British tabloids were wretched to Meghan, her father Thomas behaved even worse, Harry fell out with his brother and then he and Meghan opted out of the whole shebang and moved to Los Angeles. (The book opens with a Ralph Waldo Emerson quote beloved of people who post slogans on Instagram: “Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail.” Whether shacking up in director Tyler Perry’s $18m mansion in Beverly Hills is quite the pathless existence Emerson had in mind is a question for another day.)Morton proffered up Diana’s eating disorder and Charles’s affair with Camilla the most Scobie and Durand get are that Buckingham Palace was bad at protecting Meghan from the press, and William and Kate weren’t very warm to the new couple. That Meghan was treated abominably by an institutionally racist and sexist British press is a fact, and the book, with satisfying brevity, alludes to one particular tabloid columnist whose obsession with Meghan ranges from hysterical to certifiable. He is deftly dismissed as a social-climber with a grudge “after not receiving an invite to the wedding.”The Sussexes were hung out to dry by the palace and the press the question the book fails to answer is why, when they were such a boon to the brand. Last year there was a widely circulated rumour that they were being used to distract from some ugliness involving William. Finding Freedom has the space to respond to every other media claim, but on this it stays schtum.Their silence may tell its own story. Despite all the fuming, the book is very cautious when it comes to the senior members of the royal family, and it’s interesting that it’s Kate who is the focus of the criticism rather than William. It may well be that, despite claiming he has finally found freedom, Harry is keeping a door open to his gilded cage. His mother could have told him that pulling punches doesn’t make for a satisfying book, but perhaps he also learned from her that burning bridges doesn’t make for an easy life.• Finding Freedom: Harry and Meghan and the Making of a Modern Royal Family is published by HQ (£20).

Waves of shop closures in 2019 have been followed by a string of collapses during and since lockdown, with the result of thousands of job losses.Mark Robinson, chair of the High Streets Task Force, said high numbers of office workers were important for retailers. “The most successful places for retail have the most people working there as well – so having lots of people coming into work for councils, offices, and other employers is good for high streets,” he said. “We need to encourage more people to work in our town centres.”In several large towns and cities, students make up more than a quarter of those residents, which means if they do not return to university in the autumn, high streets could see lower footfall.Matthew Williams, a director at PwC who works with the taskforce, said the report provided “some clues that Covid is a catalyst for change that was already happening”.Last week PwC published a study of how four areas had coped since lockdown loosened, which showed that while Windsor and Cleethorpes had seen footfall bounce back, recovery was slower in Manchester and Ashford in Kent.“Not all the changes will be the same. What we’ve started to see is a ergence of what is happening in different towns and on different high streets,” Williams

stamp duty holiday behind surge in home buyer interest","story":"Demand for all UK property is up, but price range reflects chancellor’s £500,000 limitThe number of buyers looking for homes has surged in the month since the chancellor announced a stamp duty holiday, with demand for properties costing between £500,000 and £750,000 showing the biggest uptick, according to figures from the UK’s largest estate agency chain.The stamp duty holiday, which was announced by Rishi Sunak as part of a package of measures to support jobs, means anyone spending more than £500,000 on a property is set to save £15,000 if they buy before 31 March next year.The move only applied to sales in England and Northern Ireland, but was followed by changes in Wales and Scotland which increased the tax-free threshold in those parts of the UK to £250,000.The housing market had already started to move after lockdown, but immediately after the chancellor made his statement, estate agents reported that phones were “ringing off the hook”, while property websites reported a rush of page views.Hamptons International’s analysis of data from more than 700 branches owned by its parent company Countrywide suggests that much of the initial flurry of interest has translated into serious property searches.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons International, said the stamp duty holiday had boosted the market, but the impact of lockdown should also be considered as it could be driving demand for homes outside cities.“The number of people looking to buy a home has risen across every region in Great Britain since the announcement, with southern areas recording the biggest increase,” she said. “It’s in these regions, where house prices tend to be higher, that buyers stand to gain the most from the holiday.”She added: “With space topping buyers wish lists, demand for homes in the suburbs and country locations has increased the most, and it’s these homes that are most likely to sell above their asking price.“Over the last decade house prices in cities have risen more than twice as much as those in the country, so this trend may mean the gap between city and country house prices will begin to close.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0c010694016109ad43f75020a85aad817ffda634/286_196_4642_2786/master/4642.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da78cf7cf45fa231ca60b931f20c7842","title":"belarus alexander lukashenko presidential elections","story":"The implausible results of Sunday’s presidential elections have triggered a pushback like never beforeFrom the residential area of Minsk where I’m writing, I can hear the incessant honking of car horns. The sound marks the expression of popular protest in the Belarusian capital against Alexander Lukashenko, and his desire to stay in power and add one more presidential term to his already 26-year rule.Tens of thousands gathered on the streets of Minsk, united by a simple slogan: “Leave!” In response, the siloviki – the special state security forces – violently dispersed the crowds, resulting in around 3,000 people being detained and hundreds injured. What is particularly remarkable is that protests took place all over the country. This is not the uprising of some narrow or unrepresentative liberal group.The internet has also been blocked for the second day in a row even with workarounds, like VPNs, it barely works. (This happened before in 2010 on election night and sporadically during the 2020 electoral campaign.) As of Monday afternoon, the protesters, many of whom rely on information from the encrypted Telegram app, were still intending to take to the streets again. Moments of connectivity brought Telegram reports that additional military trucks and equipment are being brought to the city.Lukashenko’s plan to stay in power is crumbling. In a recent address to the nation, he proclaimed that he “won’t give the country away”. With multiple violations of democratic standards and human rights committed during his reign – such as the unconstitutional referendum that allowed Lukashenko to run for president for an unlimited number of terms, the disappearance of opponents in the 1990s, the imprisonment of those who dared to question his authority – he and his government understand that if he leaves now, the prosecution of past deeds might follow. People would be free to pore over the past 26 years. The regime is in survival mode: they are determined to suppress discontent, even at the cost of spilling blood on the streets.Although Lukashenko has a strong hold on the repressive apparatus of the state – as the spectacle of siloviki bundling unarmed protesters into the backs of vans in broad daylight signals – and maintains leverage over the employees in the state sector who work on the electoral commissions, there are signs of cracks inside the system.There were reports indicating that police showed up last night at some of the polling stations, forcing the commissions to report the “correct” results. In addition, although many of the siloviki present on the streets yesterday did attack protesters, some refused to take part. Such developments are unprecedented.Another source of inspiration for the protesters and those people who oppose the regime from inside the system (electoral commissions and the police), is the growing consolidation of the civil society. Belarusians – those inside the country and the Belarusian diaspora all over the world – have already reached into their pockets to crowdfund money to assist those who have been repressed and detained. We are at a turning point. Lukashenko has little option other than to cling to power, which makes the possibility of more state violence against his own people likely. At the same time, this level of popular protest against the intolerability of life under Lukashenko has never happened before. Even if he manages to suppress the protests in the coming days, Belarusian society has awoken to a freedom struggle that will not go away any time soon.• Katsiaryna Shmatsina is a research fellow at the Belarusian Institute for Strategic Studies"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/34a5939846c7a9876224a559cc58f9245b857589/0_90_3500_2099/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=202978380c364b9c52fd1f4ffdfd0f1a","title":"exam results inequality private state students","story":"With almost no scope for overturning the estimated A-level and GCSE grades, parents and students are expected to just take themIn July, I thought the major risk of this extraordinary exam results season would be the unconscious bias of teachers when they made their predictions of student grades. The effects might be quite subtle, and universities would have to be correspondingly nuanced in their response. I have to say, it never occurred to me that teachers would be broadly disregarded, and instead, any existing disparity between the private and state sectors, between affluent and deprived areas, would be baked in by design.There is a political complacency to all this, an assumption that parents and students will simply weather it. And so here we are: a fortnight ago in Scotland, students from richer areas saw their predicted grades, if they were A to C, reduced by seven percentage point in the poorer areas, 15. This, apparently, was to preserve “credibility” – if there had always been better grades in these richer areas, what would the world make of a year in which the poorer kids did somewhat less badly? What would it mean for the students of 2019 and 2021, to be sandwiched either side of this freak year in which deprivation didn’t show (so much)?Almost no student in Scotland was untouched by this system – among 138,000 entrants, 125,000 grades were changed. But the truly life-changing impact – A and B predictions reduced to Cs and Ds – was of course reserved for the highest achieving students in the poorest schools.The decision in England, where results come out on Thursday, is more rigid still: alongside their predictions, teachers were asked to put their students in order, with none jointly ranked. Then, in what Ofqual called its “direct centre-level approach”, the predictions were largely disregarded instead, schools have been allocated a fixed number of As, Bs etc based on their performances in previous years. Students’ results will rely jointly on where they were placed relative to their peers, and how students did in the years before them.This system would be statistically absurd in the more obscure subjects, with five students or less, and in those, teachers’ predictions are still decisive. But this is the plan in subjects with more than 15 entrants – English, maths, history. There is almost no scope for appeal at an inidual level: you can challenge the result if you can prove that this process wasn’t followed, but you can’t challenge the process itself.A student at an independent or selective school can expect to receive their most optimistic result, those institutions being accustomed to exam success (not only because of their intake, but because they quietly shuffle out underachieving students over the course of their school career). A student in a historically low-performing school (and very recent history, at that) can expect to see their results downgraded. Everyone knows that in this unprecedented era of the exam-guesstimate, no results will be perfect. But to choose a system in which those that already have shall be given As, while those that have not, Cs, is shameful.In all the handwringing, there is an acceptance of one inevitable choice – either Ofqual extrapolated from precedent, and kept grades level, or they took teachers’ predictions, and accepted perhaps a significant amount of grade inflation. I would have been far happier with the latter: grade inflation, like any inflation, erodes inequality by shaving away pre-existing advantage in a relatively painless way.Yet that isn’t the only measure they could have considered: for the purposes of the ceaseless measurement that has become the hallmark of state education, secondary schools have a “value added” score, to mark how good their actual teaching is, as distinct from the advantages of their intake. It relies on a comparison between SAT scores at the end of primary school, and key stages 3 and 4, ending in GCSE. Schools in deprived areas tend to have good value-added scores – if they had an intake that was below average at key stage 2, they’d have to, to keep Ofsted off their backs.Independent schools, meanwhile, don’t measure value added at all, because independent primaries don’t always sit SATs in year six. It would have been perfectly possible to add that as a reference point to these calculations, and consider not only how many As to Cs a school got over the past three years, but also how much value they typically added in order to get there. You might still be left with some grade inflation, but then you could always adjust downwards from the sector that couldn’t provide full data, which would be private schools, or the schools that didn’t add much value, selective state schools.It is inevitable that results which were only guesses would disadvantage some hard-working pupils. But all these decisions have been flaccidly political – they didn’t even set out to penalise the disadvantaged, they just didn’t think in any serious way about how not to.After all that’s happened – the chaotic closure of schools, the assumption that everybody could work from home while simultaneously homeschooling, the sudden instruction to go back to the office with no mention of educational provision, the reopening for years 1 and 6 on a sporadic, confusing, discretionary basis, the announcement of a full return in September with no indication that teachers’ unions were on board, the seemingly tabloid-led announcement of priorities, a prime minister adjudicating between pubs and schools hypothetically, and on a whim – perhaps this was predictable."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c3e9dbb55d3422b63a3b5c2fb5a6b6868e51c786/0_13_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n\u0026s=51eea1b843427fe0c719c18bda966bd8","title":"david hare experience covid subject new play bridge theatre","story":"Monologue starring Ralph Fiennes to be part of Bridge theatre’s reopening scheduleDavid Hare’s experience of being sick with coronavirus and his fury at the government’s handling of the crisis is to be the subject of a play starring Ralph Fiennes as the playwright.The Bridge theatre in London announced it would reopen in September with socially distanced audiences, assuming the government gives the sector the go-ahead.It will begin with performances of a monologue written by Hare, Beat the Devil, which is a response to his experience of contracting coronavirus early in the pandemic.The theatre said Hare would recall “the delirium of his illness, which mix with fear, dream, honest medicine and dishonest politics to create a monologue of furious urgency and power.”Hare contracted coronavirus at about the same time the UK government introduced lockdown measures.Speaking to the BBC in April, he described his experience of the virus, which evolved rapidly and unexpectedly. “One day it would be fever, next day it would be arctic cold, then it would be vomiting, then coughing, then conjunctivitis, then breathing problems,” he said. “Day 10 was five times worse than day five.”Hare is one of Britain’s most celebrated stage writers and has written plays that are witheringly critical of the performance of governments on subjects including rail privatisation and the Iraq war.He has been particularly damning of the coronavirus response, calling it worse than the handling of the Suez crisis or Iraq. “To watch a weasel-worded parade of ministers shirking responsibility for their failures and confecting non-apologies to the dead and dying has seen British public life sink as low as I can remember in my entire lifetime,” he said.Hare continued that “in return for lockdown, isolation, commercial disaster and social distancing” the British public deserved honesty. “They must own up to their mistakes, stop dodging and waffling and start to trust us with the truth.”The playwright also criticised people who said “courage” and “love of life” got Boris Johnson through coronavirus.“Those of us who’ve had the virus know you don’t under any circumstances ignore it,” he said. “What helped me survive were pure luck and the assiduous expert care of my first-class GP. Those two things only, not my fabled resources of character.”The new Hare play will star Fiennes and be directed by the theatre’s co-founder and artistic director, Nicholas Hytner.Also in the opening programme will be a stage version of the Alan Bennett Talking Heads monologues, which Hytner produced for the BBC earlier this year.In total, eight will be reprised in a series of double bills starring the same actors: Imelda Staunton, Kristin Scott Thomas, Rochenda Sandall, Maxine Peake, Lucian Msamati, Lesley Manville, Tamsin Greig and Monica Dolan.Bennett has waived his royalties to help the theatre stage the shows.Running alongside those performances will be three other monologue shows: An Evening with an Immigrant by Inua Ellams Quarter Life Crisis by Yolanda Mercy and Nine Lives by Zodwa Nyoni.The theatre said the plan was to reopen the 900-seat theatre to audiences of 250. As a recently built theatre with a large, open bar area, the Bridge is better placed to reopen than most West End venues with small bars and narrow corridors.It is dependent on the government allowing socially distanced indoor performances, which was permitted until the government paused its introduction on 31 July. It said the delay would be until at least 15 August.The performing arts has been one of the sectors hardest-hit by the pandemic with theatres and concert halls fighting for their existence.Most regional theatres depend on the income they generate with pantomimes to help them get through the year. On Monday. four London venues – Hackney Empire, Lyric Hammersmith, Queen’s Theatre Hornchurch and Theatre Royal Stratford East – became the latest to announce postponements of their 2020 pantos.A show will go on, however, in St Helens where the Theatre Royal announced it was abandoning its production of Cinderella with Linda Robson, and replacing it with a fully socially distanced production of Beauty and the Beast."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b6f4afe873579eee00c1dc54fb66212963a7a104/0_328_4946_2969/master/4946.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=f79641096e162b15474486ffc8a8e370","title":"undergraduate students what plans do you have for freshers week","story":"If you are set to begin an undergraduate course in the UK this autumn, we would like to hear from youWith nightclubs closed and social distancing measures in place at hospitality venues – including pubs – across the UK, freshers’ week is likely to be a toned down affair for first-year university students in September.Many universities have set their sights on virtual events such as remote freshers fairs and Zoom comedy nights as a way to welcome young people to campus life, while parties in halls are likely to be banned.

Here’s what some of you saidThe Big Butterfly Count this year took place between 17 July and 9 August. People in Britain were asked to spend 15 minutes in a park, garden, field or wood, counting the butterflies they see.From peacocks to jersey tigers, here are some of the photos readers sent in of the butterflies and moths they spotted during the count.“When I saw this butterfly in front of a pretty background I just had to take a picture of it. It let me come really close so I could observe it in detail,” said 11-year-old Astrid Stone of this photograph she took in her back garden in Tunbridge Wells.“I love butterflies because of their amazing wings and fragile shape, the wonderful patterns and pretty colours. I enjoy looking for butterflies and identifying them which is why I did the butterfly count,” she said. “When I am older I hope to become a butterfly specialist.”This is the second time that 34-year-old Rusana Krasteva, who works for a travel agency, has taken part in the count. She said that the pandemic adds extra poignancy to this year’s event.“Due to the lockdown and pandemic restrictions we all started noticing the little things that surround us which we normally miss in our daily life,” she said. “Especially people like me stuck in the big busy city of London, rushing to the office five or six days a week, compared to me currently working from home and, on days like today, even from my patio garden.”Hopkins also took part in the count last year, both times in her garden in Camberwell, London. “This year I’ve seen a greater variety of different species: peacocks, speckled woods, small tortoiseshells and painted ladies. But I’m yet to see the famous Camberwell beauty.”Alison Offer in Charlbury, Oxfordshire has said she sometime finds herself “walking through a cloud of butterflies”. “They must have always been there, but it’s taken till lockdown for me to notice them,” she said.She knew about the count last year but wasn’t able to take part due to her daily commute. “This year though the world has shrunk,” said Charlbury. “Instead of sitting in a car for an hour, I’ve spent that time wandering our local green lanes and footpaths. I’ve become much more aware of butterflies now.“I have not seen the usual number of tortoiseshells and red admirals in our garden, but the lanes and flower meadows of west Oxfordshire are alive with butterflies – marbled whites, meadow browns, gatekeeper butterflies and others.”Nine-year-old Ralf spotted the mountain ringlet when with his dad Steve Banks in Rampsgill Head above Haweswater, in the Lake District.“Ralf chased it around so he could track where it perched I was then able to get a picture of it on my phone,” Banks said. “They are only found between 500m and 800m in the Lakes and a few locations in the Highlands. They are scarce and live on matt grass, and are usually only spotted on sunny days. It’s only the second one we’ve seen.”Banks said his interest in butterflies had been piqued during lockdown while on walks with Ralf in their home of Threlkeld, near Keswick.“I’ve never been involved in the butterfly count before but became interested in butterflies, moths, trees and wild flowers in more detail this year when using the lockdown to go out on nature walks with Ralf,” he said. “He’s become adept at identifying butterflies and has spotted 15 different species so far.”In Edinburgh, five-year-old Freya spotted this tortoiseshell butterfly, which was captured by her dad Stuart, 39, on one of the family’s daily walks during lockdown.“I love butterflies because they are so pretty and colourful,” said Freya. “Sometimes if you stand still they’ll land on your nose.”“My counts have taken place exclusively in my garden and mostly around a buddleia bush and some marjoram,” said John Showers, 72, who captured this photograph of a peacock butterfly in his garden in Northants. He said there had been up to nine peacock butterflies at any one time.This is the second year that Showers has participated in the event, and said he had seen fewer butterflies during this year’s count. “It’s not been as productive as last year, largely, I think, because of more variable weather this year,” he said. “Here we have had a lot of cloudy and breezy days which tend to depress the count.”“At present I cannot walk very far because of a foot injury so being able to do the count in my garden has given me my daily wildlife fix,” he added.“We spotted this beautiful red admiral walking past our neighbour’s front garden. I expect it was trying to dry its wings in peace,” said Katie Lingwood, 40, an architect who lives in St Albans. “My son stuck his finger out and it climbed right on.”“We did the butterfly count last year and only saw cabbage whites and orange tipped butterflies, and only a few at that,” she said. “This year has been amazing. We’ve seen loads of peacocks for the first time ever, blue butterflies and lots of unidentified orange and brown ones. Plus, some cool moths including finding a lime hawk moth caterpillar which is huge!”“These photos were taken in Earswick, just outside York, on 17 July at around 9.30 am,” said Amy Glasman, a 22-year-old student. “There is a buddleia plant just outside my window and there are usually multiple butterflies on it at any given time.“On this occasion, I watched as the sun hit the plant, and the butterflies, who I assume had been sleeping on it as they were completely still, woke up and began pollinating. I could see about six butterflies on the plant at once.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cc9239850cfc79db59ab321ff033a566cc7b0a6c/0_358_7120_4271/master/7120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd9151c1d12851d14070a1dfc5bbf4a2","title":"the amazon is the vagina of the world why women are key to saving brazils forests aoe","story":"Indigenous leader Célia Xakriabá and Vagina Monologues author V discuss Brazil’s bioersity crisis and why this is the century of the indigenous womanCélia Xakriabá is the voice of a new generation of female indigenous leaders who are leading the fight against the destruction of Brazil’s forests both in the Amazon and the lesser known Cerrado, a savannah that covers a fifth of the country. V, formerly Eve Ensler, is the award-winning author of the Vagina Monologues, an activist and founder of V-Day, a global movement to end violence against all women and girls and the Earth. The two recently held a conversation in which V asked Xakriabá about what is happening to Brazil’s bioersity and indigenous peoples, and why women are the key to change.V: Many people, especially in the west, don’t really understand what’s happening to the Cerrado in Brazil. Can you tell us what’s happening to the forests?C: It’s very tough at this moment. Every minute one person dies of Covid-19, but also every minute one tree is cut. And whenever a tree is cut, a part of us is cut, a part of us also dies, because the territory dies and with no territory there is no air, no good air for everyone in the world. People can’t breathe. So all this Covid contamination, it gets to the territory through the miners, the gold miners, the loggers and the rangers. And now that we are getting to August, we get even more worried about the fires, all the fires that burned the Amazon last year. It’s going to come back. “Our findings provide evidence that land clearing has degraded weather in the Brazilian Cerrado, undermining one of the main reasons for land clearing: rain-fed crop production,” the report said.Last year, in an article published in Perspectives in Ecology and Conservation, scientists warned that “climate changes are likely to cause local extinctions of several mammalian species throughout the Cerrado biome”.Dom Phillips in Rio de JaneiroAnd what happens to all the animals, and to the birds and to every living thing in the forest? What happens to them?When the forest is burned, the birds and the animals, they are either burned or they go away. And this doesn’t affect only the animals, but it also affects us. We rely on them to eat. So with no animals, we have to rely on food from the outside, and this ends up making our children and our women sick, here with the Xakriabá people. I can hear the song of the birds now, but it’s also a song of misery, of sadness, because most of them, they are alone. They have lost their partners. The birds, they usually sing as a couple. And many of them are now singing alone. And we, the indigenous are becoming more alone, because they’re taking people from us.When I first met you, we laughed because we were talking about vaginas and you told me that the Amazon was the vagina of the world. So can you talk a little bit about that?The Amazon’s like the vagina of the world because it’s where people come from. It’s like the entry door of the world. When this opening is sick, the future generations, they will be sick also. People lost this connection to the Earth because they don’t see Earth and land as a relative. For me, the Earth is like a grandmother, because it’s Earth who gave birth to all of the mothers of the world. Earth is like the first independent woman that created humanity and Earth needed rivers and water to create humanity. But now people just see Earth as a thing. They can design big cities, but they can’t see this connection to Earth. They go to the supermarket, to the grocery store, and they don’t know where that food comes from.It’s so powerful to see how many indigenous women are leading the struggle to defend the forests and the land. Why do you think this is important?I’ve been saying that this 21st century, it’s the century of the indigenous woman, because you can’t cure with the same evil that first caused the sickness. You have to overcome this colonising power that is mainly male. I like to say about the matrix of destruction that it’s not matrix, it’s the patrix because it’s based on patriarchy, not matriarchy. And the women, they are the ones who are in this century regaining power over the land, because they know how to cure the Earth. Women have this knowledge and that’s why we are on the frontline right now. I am fighting to not only strengthen the role of women in the territory and in the fight, but also in politics, with indigenous women running for positions in parliament, in the Brazilian Congress. Who can take better care of humanity, if not women?Can you tell me what is the lived experience of the struggle for life and the struggle of the indigenous peoples in this phase of the onslaught of the extractive industries, and now with Covid exacerbating the situation? What is happening?During this pandemic we are making this effort to remain in our territories, in our houses, in our homes, but also at the same time, we have to challenge, to fight, because very far away in Brazil, in the Congress, they are negotiating our territories, our homes and our houses. During the pandemic, hundreds of indigenous people have died. But we have to think about how many people would die if we don’t fight. You have to think about the pandemic that is killing us, about the racism that is killing us, about the macro politics, about the colonisation, the absence of the state. It’s hard to tell which weapon is more dangerous, because we are getting killed by many different weapons.It appears very clear that President Jair Bolsonaro has weaponised Covid against indigenous peoples. Can you talk a little bit about this?Like in the US, Brazil is going through a kind of dark night of the soul with Bolsonaro in power.Bolsonaro likes to say that indigenous peoples are becoming more human, but the indigenous peoples don’t like the kind of humanity that doesn’t respect the Earth, doesn’t respect the animals, because you can only know how to be a human if you know how to be a plant, how to be a seed, how to be food. And so actually this project, it’s an anti-humanitarian project of the government. It represents a sick lung, a sick organ of the body of the Earth.And why do you think at this moment that we have so many leaders in the world like Trump or Duterte or Modi or Putin or Bolsonaro?All of this is because we are living in a moment of disputes, disputes of values. They are not part of this project of regaining and retaking the values of life. They are like boils on your skin, and they emerge with all the fury, these boils, like a cancer to these values of life. They emerge with this fury because they appear to have the desire to extinguish all ersity – the ersity of life, the ersity of culture, the ersity of seeds, the ersity of territory.What is the mood and the feeling in Brazil right now?Some people who thought we were invisible, they didn’t look, didn’t pay attention to the indigenous populations, now they’re starting to pay attention to us. And the indigenous people, they have within themselves the sense of solidarity and of connection that other peoples don’t have. And that’s something that can help heal the Earth and heal our world because humanity, without love, it’s a dead humanity.And how do you stay grounded in the midst of all these changes happening in the Cerrado and then the planet at large?The fight is what feeds me. So every time I think about taking a step away from the fight, I can’t. And as an indigenous person, you fight to survive. You don’t really have another choice. I think about the fight as the children that I haven’t generated yet, the children that I and the indigenous peoples will give birth to in the future. I remember that some time ago in another genocidal process that was going on, the leaders and the indigenous peoples weren’t allowed to paint themselves. So the women would keep these painting pots in their houses. It was a way of not forgetting the paintings and the patterns. And now when I think about that, I think about my body as a pot. I like to paint myself because it’s a way of getting all this memory eternalised, and not forgetting, because more than fighting, painting myself is a way of continuing what my ancestors were doing. Some feel pretty when they put on their best dress. I feel pretty when I paint myself. And it’s not only that. When I paint myself, I feed my spirit and I keep my mind strong. And my headdress gives power to my thoughts and to my fight. So, when I paint myself, when I put my headdress on, I’m not only doing that to show others, I’m doing that to keep myself, my mind and my spirit strong and fed, to keep singing.What’s your vision of the future?My hope for the future is being alive. And by that I don’t mean just my body being alive. But our voice has to be alive. Our memory, our chants, our singing, and our womb, because you can’t be alive in your body if the womb of the Earth is sick, because when the Earth is sick, we can’t get food. And what’s the point of keeping your body alive if all around you is dead?And lastly: please describe your vision of what the “re-enchantment” means.Re-enchantment is within us. People are very worried about this Covid emergency, about being able to touch other people and to feel an effect, a love of affection for other people. But what really is this re-enchantment? It’s the love that we feel for the rivers, for the forest, for food. We have to think that the real borders of the world, it’s not the borders between Brazil and the United States, or between the Amazon and the Cerrado. The real borders of the world are the borders between racism and bioersity. We can’t drop this fight. We have to keep fighting for the bioersity, for this cure of the Earth, and for our territories, because one who has territory has a place to return, and one who has a place to return has refuge, has warmth. And that’s why we need to keep fighting.Find more age of extinction coverage here, and follow bioersity reporters Phoebe Weston and Patrick Greenfield on Twitter for all the latest news and features"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd2a07feb67a48f6cbaa89707462b14f659dc0c2/0_137_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4f518b3f035e8d7555e5fca058812472","title":"we love fashion fixes for the week ahead in pictures","story":"Mother Denim launch new Aura collection, plus beach towels made from recycled plastic bottles, and slippers built to last"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9e9a692904a8ac1cd3d50861f302bf0d30da977e/0_100_2961_1776/master/2961.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c3a3432e56cef580e3958192bf7e0f1","title":"antonio banderas reveals he has coronavirus on 60th birthday","story":"The actor has said he is celebrating in quarantine and otherwise relatively unaffected, other than being ‘a little bit more tired than usual’The actor Antonio Banderas has confirmed on Twitter that he is suffering from coronavirus.

Connery’s tenure lasted a total of seven movies.Craig, as well as being the incumbent Bond, is also the longest serving: now clocking 14 years’ service, partly because of the lengthy gaps between his five films.No Time to Die, his final outing as Bond and the 25th film in the series, is still currently due for release in November, following its date change from April, prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.However, optimism about the feasibility of such a release is fading as many cinemas remain closed, audiences appear sceptical about safety measures and studios are increasingly putting releases straight to digital.• This article was amended on 10 August 2020 to remove an external video that contained offensive language."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3964d8ebecc50ab692a687ef36165b3d6acd74ff/0_901_5792_3475/master/5792.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=52eb227aac6a98eb9def61866b049875","title":"thomasina miers recipe cherry frangipane galette","story":"A fuss-free tart that punches well above its weight in terms of effort and end resultThere has been a bumper harvest of cherries this year, and I can’t get enough of them. This quick galette, which uses readymade all-butter puff pastry, requires very little work, but looks sensational when it emerges from the oven: golden, crisp and juicy, with those deep scarlet stains from the cherry juices. A brilliant midweek pudding fix that does a delectable fruit justice.Caramelised nuts, sweet fruit, crisp pastry and a drop of booze: this is everything I want in a pudding.1 x 320g shop-bought, all-butter rolled puff pastry sheet160g butter120g golden caster sugar3 medium eggs140g ground almonds50g plain flourZest of 1 orange300g fresh or frozen cherries, stoned30g demerara sugar50g hazelnuts or whole almonds, roughly choppedKirsch, grappa or Cointreau (optional)Heat the oven to 180C (160C fan)350Fgas 4. Lay the pastry sheet out on a board and trim so that the edges are straight, then transfer to a lined baking tray.Using an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar until creamy, light and fluffy. Gradually add two of the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition, then use a large spoon gently to fold in the almonds, flour and orange zest.Spread out the frangipane in the centre of the pastry sheet, leaving a 4cm border, then pile the cherries on top. Fold the sides of the pastry over the cherries, crimping them a little, to create a dam that will prevent the juices escaping.Whisk the remaining egg with a splash of water, then brush it all over the pastry. Sprinkle the demerara sugar and nuts all over the pastry and fruit, then bake for 50 minutes, until the pastry is golden and the fruit is soft. Remove from the oven and, if you like, sprinkle the tart with a few teaspoons of kirsch or other booze, to lift the cherry flavour delicately.Serve warm or at room temperature with ice-cream or Greek yoghurt.If you have any cherries left over, I love them for breakfast with Greek yoghurt, toasted almonds and honey. Or preserve them in liqueur to add glamour to autumn cocktails."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13fbc6fcb32e161dfb6cb6d06ce7e16e47d45d65/0_0_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f3794e3b5dbd39510d86c5c630ab1ec8","title":"champions league quarter finals tie by tie analysis and verdicts","story":"Bayern Munich should be too strong for Barcelona while PSG have played only two games in the past five monthsOn the one side, the fairy story of this season’s Champions League, the sole remaining Italian club in the competition with their annual revenues of €188.6m. On the other, the habitual French champions with their annual revenues of €635.9m. Atalanta are delighted even to be in the Champions League, never mind to have got this far, while Paris Saint-Germain are weighed down by the burden of never having got beyond the semi-final, and never having got beyond the quarters under their Qatari ownership.Stylistically they are very different as well. Under Gian Piero Gasperini, Atalanta play breathless attacking football, pressing hard and looking to create overloads across the pitch. Under Thomas Tuchel, although PSG have become more cohesive than they were previously, they are still a side that plays through its two huge celebrities, Neymar and Kylian Mbappé. Atalanta are very clearly more than the sum of their parts for PSG, it seems a constant struggle to prove they are not less, a gaggle of stars in search of a constellation.PSG are perhaps the most absurd of all the absurdities of the superclub era. Until six years ago, there had never been a domestic treble in France. In the past six years there have been four, yet all PSG’s success feels empty because it’s been achieved against much weaker, less well-resourced opponents and has never translated into real success in Europe. In the Champions League the pattern has been for them to collapse in the face of the first proper challenge, largely because they’re so unused to being tested.PSG clearly have a better squad than Atalanta, but much depends on how they handle Atalanta’s press. It’s enough to unsettle anybody, but PSG may be especially susceptible given no side in France would ever play so aggressively against them. A lack of matches after the abandonment of the French league – only two cup finals in the past five months – may also count against PSG.The prognosis might have been very different had Leipzig met Atlético in March, when the quarter-finals were supposed to be played. Back then Atlético looked out of sorts, struggling with yet another season of attempted transition to a supposedly more progressive approach, while RB Leipzig still had Timo Werner. Five months later Atlético are buoyed by finishing their domestic season in fine form, winning seven and drawing four of their final 11 games to claim third in the league and qualification for the Champions League next season, something that was by no means assured when lockdown began.And having eliminated Liverpool, the defending champions, in the last 16, and progressed further than Real Madrid, their bêtes noires in this tournament, for the first time since 1996-97, there’s no reason for them not to believe this could be their year – providing, that is, the two positive Covid tests don’t presage a wider problem. The one-legged format may play into their hands as well, given there is probably no coach better at game management than Diego Simeone.Leipzig have been hugely impressive this season, both domestically – where they ended up being undone by too many draws – and in Europe. Their demolition of Tottenham in the last 16 suggested them as a realistic outsider to win the tournament itself. But that was with Werner. That he has been allowed to move to Chelsea before the end of the season is a disgrace, yet another example of modern football’s prioritisation of money. There is still enough firepower in this Leipzig side to trouble Atlético, particularly with Patrik Schick back in form, but Emil Forsberg, who presumably will take Werner’s place on the left of the front three, does not offer the same threat.The only former champions who remain meet, but they could hardly do so in more contrasting situations. Bayern are favourites for the Champions League and with good reason. Their 4-1 dismissal of Chelsea on Saturday was their 26th win in their past 27 games. Under Hansi Flick they have rediscovered the swagger that had gone missing under Niko Kovac. They press better than anybody in Europe, they have tremendous pace in attacking areas and in Robert Lewandowski they have the best centre-forward in the world. Two goals and two assists in the second-leg win against Chelsea took his tally to 13 goals and four assists in the Champions League this season. With their rejuvenation well under way and other giants stuttering or stagnating, and Liverpool gone, the only negative for Bayern is being on, by far, the tougher side of the draw.Barcelona are one of those stagnating giants. Even in beating Napoli 3-1 on Saturday they seemed oddly tentative, insecure at the back and heavily reliant on Lionel Messi going forwards. Their midfield has been vulnerable to direct runners for years, in part because of how stretched they become as a side with the lack of pressing from the forward line. Antoine Griezmann was signed presumably partly to improve that, but he hasn’t settled on the left and is yet to gel with Luis Suárez and Messi.Barça and Bayern haven’t met since the semi-final in 2015 when Pep Guardiola’s Bayern took a surprisingly aggressive approach at the Camp Nou and ended up being beaten 3-0, eventually losing the tie 5-3 on aggregate. On form, though, this seems likely to be more similar to the previous meeting two years earlier, also in the semi-final, when Bayern demolished Barça 7-0 over the two legs.Lyon finished seventh in Ligue 1, 28 points behind PSG, who had a game in hand. And that was after only two thirds of the season had been played. For them to get past Juventus on away goals was a minor miracle, and evidence of just how shambolic the Italian champions have been this season, but it’s extremely difficult to see how it could pull off another miracle against City – even if they did shock them at the Etihad Stadium in the group stage last season.City have a glass jaw. They have deficiencies at the heart of their defence. They are vulnerable to the counter-attack and it may be that Memphis Depay can hurt them with his direct running – the former United forward is happily recovered from the cruciate injury that would have kept him out of a quarter-final in March – but the issue is rather at the other end. After five months without football, Lyon have played just two competitive games and in both of them they have essentially sat deep and looked to cling on – in losing on penalties against PSG in the Coupe de la Ligue final after a 0-0 draw and in losing 2-1 at Juve to win on away goals.Their approach will presumably be similar against City, but City are a rather more cohesive and fluid attacking side than either even if they are perhaps not quite so ruthless as they might be. Lyon conceded less than a goal a game in the league and haven’t let in more than two in Champions League defeats against Benfica, Zenit and Juve this season, but it’s still hard to believe they will be able to hold out. Rudi Garcia’s only previous two meetings with Guardiola, when Roma met Bayern in 2014-15 ended in 2-0 and 7-1 defeats."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c1a1bec42b449995259b52388a95adbb9b11d469/98_237_2543_1525/master/2543.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=c796353f3cb5f05d3d5390c909ac15d6","title":"manchester united v fc copenhagen europa league quarter final live","story":"“Is it really such a surprise that Fred is selected this evening?” says David Wall. “Even when they were inconsistent in the first half of the season he was unarguably one of the few successes of the season (alongside Rashford and Martial). He seemed to have developed a decent relationship with Fernandes before the hiatus that gave Pogba time to regain fitness.“Much as I was impressed by their post-lockdown form I thought it a shame that he was the one missing out in the new midfield three. He was pretty good evidence for the view that sometime players arriving to a new league just need a bit of time and, crucially, support from their manager to adjust and show the form that justified buying them in the first place.”Don’t get me wrong, I like him a lot and agree with pretty much everything you say I’m not just sure about him alongside Pogba. I’d much prefer Matic and Fred or Matic and Pogba, depending on the opposition. It’s also a surprise simply because Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has picked the same XI where possible, without Fred, for all the important games since late June.It’s a really warm night in Cologne, over 30 degrees, so there should be drinks breaks during both halves.If the match level after 90+4 minutes, it will go extra-time and potential penalties. The shorter format definitely increases Copenhagen’s chance of causing a shock.“Would have picked McTominay over Fred - his forward thrusts cause the opposition problems,” says Francis Mead. “And Bailly always gives me the willies - he’s an accident waiting to happen.”I assume Lindelof is only fit enough for the bench. The Fred decision is interesting I didn’t see that coming.It’s all part of the game.Eric Bailly continues alongside Harry Maguire, with Victor Lindelof on the bench, and Fred is preferred to Nemanja Matic. That’s a bit of a surprise. If I was going to play Fred it would have be instead of Pogba rather Matic.FC Copenhagen’s XI includes the former United right-back Guillermo Varela, one of the 327 youth players given their Old Trafford debut by Louis van Gaal.Hello. We’re all desperate to get back to normal life, and I don’t know about you but I’m Jonesing for a pedicure. There are, though, are a few aspects of Covid life that are superior to the old normal. Exhibit A: the two-week festival of European football that starts in Germany tonight. It’s the best of all worlds. We get the splendour of European football with the thrill of a novelty format – and without the affront to tradition that would usually accompany such a TV-friendly mega-event.The two mini-tournaments to decide the 2019-20 Champions League and Europa League are a bespoke response to a unique situation. There will be European football – knockout, cut-throat, business-end European football – on TV for 12 the next 14 nights (or days, depending on where you reside). It’s an orgy of jeopardy and everyone’s invited, just as long as they have the right TV package.There are two games tonight: a humdinger between Internazionale and Bayer Leverkusen and an assumed walkover for Manchester United against FC Copenhagen, who are playing in their first European quarter-final. We’re covering the United game, though we’ll also have goalflashes from the other match in where the hell’s it being played, no you can’t just say ‘in Germany’, FFS this is amateur hou- Dusseldorf.While United are favourites, their generally rich European history does feature plenty of unexpected defeats. The list of conquerors, whether over two legs or in a group game, includes Videoton, Galatasaray, Rotor Volgograd, Cluj - and FC Copenhagen when the teams last met 14 years ago. Complacency cost United then and, with a respectful nod to Rasmus Falk and Jonas Wind, is probably the biggest danger tonight.If United were playing Celtic or Istanbul Basaksehir, the champions of Scotland and Turkey, I suspect we’d be taking the threat more seriously. And they would have been playing one of those teams, had Copenhagen not beaten them both.Still, the likeliest scenario is a United win, and if they go through they will play either Wolves or Sevilla in the semi-final a week tonight. We might all have football fatigue by then. On this occasion, I doubt it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/afc3b012deac6643af9b110607d9484b1c225abb/0_22_2362_1417/master/2362.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=2fb0c8795b98433aee92cfe0ab5e23fd","title":"house sale london location regents park bargain 185m john nash","story":"Developer seeks to cash out of investment in John Nash-designed terrace with views of Regent’s ParkDevelopers have stuck an asking price of £185m on a house overlooking Regent’s Park in central London in what would be the UK’s second most-expensive home purchase.The property firm Zenprop is targeting foreign billionaires as potential buyers of 1-18 York Terrace East as it seeks to cash out of a 2016 investment.The Grade I-listed building was completed in 1826 under designs by John Nash, the Regency architect whose other works include Buckingham Palace, Regent Street and the Royal Pavilion in Brighton.If it were bought by an inidual it would represent the second most expensive house ever sold in the UK, despite the weakness in the luxury housing market caused by the pandemic. The Chinese property tycoon Cheung Chung-kiu agreed in January to buy a 45-room mansion overlooking Hyde Park in London for more than £200m.The York Terrace East property, with 117,000 square feet of floorspace, previously served as government offices and then student accommodation, after bomb damage during the second world war.Stephen Lindsay, an agent at Savills who is working on the property, said: “Nothing on this scale in such a prime London location has ever come up for sale.”Derrick Beare, chief executive of Zenprop, said the building was bought four years ago for less than the current £185m listing price, despite previous reports that the company paid £200m. “We would have made a very healthy profit, but because of Brexit and the pandemic, prices are not what they were,” Beare said.Beare said the property was “priced attractively for what it is” and described it as “one of the most amazing buildings I’ve ever seen”. He thought London would continue to be seen as safe for buyers. “People love to buy real estate here. I don’t think that is going to change.”Planning officials rejected a previous application for the building to be turned into townhouses because they would be too large, planning documents show.One super-rich inidual had considered buying the property to install one large dwelling in the terrace’s central block, with other houses either side, Beare said. However, the potential buyer put plans on hold because of Brexit and the pandemic."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d1e79bff74f12a886477faec7e9907a975712cd3/106_0_2483_1490/master/2483.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=b0d8108353c513289e757e9a34615510","title":"how we made mungo jerry in the summertime","story":"‘I still had my old job when it went to No 1. There were women chasing me across the factory floor’I still had a day job at a laboratory when the melody for In the Summertime entered my head. The lyric took 10 minutes to write. When I was young, my family always went to Hayling Island, in Hampshire, for holidays great affairs with about 20 of us. So, for part of the song, I was recalling lovely childhood memories. “In the summertime, when the weather is high” meant high pressure, when it’s not raining and you have that sense of euphoria where you feel “you can stretch right up and touch the sky”. Singing “have a drink, have a drive” meant just a coke, a coffee or a milkshake in the days before drink became a generic term for alcohol.Rhythmically, the song was a mix of skiffle, Caribbean and the Latin American I’ve loved ever since hearing Edmundo Ros on the radio with my mum. But it sounded bare when we went into Pye’s Studio One to record it in 1970, so we added a lot of percussive effects. The jug band sound came from Paul King blowing into a glass bottle while playing banjo. I stamped with my feet on a piece of wood, a bit like John Lee Hooker. I went: “Ch-ch-ch-UH  Ch-ch-ch-UH,” and I’m told it was the first beat box sound on a hit record.The single took off immediately, straight in at No 13. We did Disco 2, BBC2’s forerunner of The Old Grey Whistle Test, recorded at Shepherd’s Bush. Directly after the rehearsal upstairs, we had to rush downstairs for the filming, due to be aired that night. Thirteen of us piled into the lift, which got stuck halfway down, and we were panicking we wouldn’t get out in time.Then it went to No 1. I was still at the lab and people upstairs who had never spoken to me before wanted to be friends. I’d go down to the factory floor and all the women were chasing me. It was a complete madhouse. When I look back at performance clips of the single, I see I’ve got this big grin and I’m wearing clothes that make no sense at all, with these massive sideburns, while the other guys in the band have a proper hippy look. I think I was trying to align everything to nature and spontaneity. It’s always been about the groove and the vibe for me, not technical mastery or seeing how many notes you can play, which leaves me cold.When Pye Records started their underground label, Dawn, one of the first things I did was sign Ray Dorset. Previously, I’d been a gig booker for a couple of agencies and Ray had always impressed me. Whatever lineup he had behind him, he always generated terrifically rhythmic, syncopated music.Mungo Jerry was a four-piece, drummerless band, with a stand-up bass (Mike Cole) and a piano (Colin Earl). They’d signed to make an album because, in those days, that’s what underground bands did. They didn’t want a big single because, heaven forbid, that was commercial. But they needed to support an album by building a following and I knew a successful single could achieve that.Ray played me song after song, earmarking what would be good in the album context. But when he did In the Summertime, initially in straight time, I knew instantly it was a hit single.But two minutes into the session, the band stopped playing. I asked why and Ray said: “That’s all we’ve got.” Making the record longer meant bigger performance royalties for each radio play, so, because Pye’s sound-effects library was dire, I got the engineer Howard Barrow to rev up his Triumph TR4 in the street. I stood out there with a mic under the exhaust pipe, practically giving myself carbon monoxide poisoning. But we edited the car sound on to the tape and copied the first part of the song, with a slightly different mix, on to the back. The single is really the same song played twice.It sold 112,00 copies by lunchtime in one day. But what’s often lost in the story is what a phenomenal live band Mungo Jerry were. They made the front page of Melody Maker with the headline “Mungomania” not based on In the Summertime, but for a performance the weekend before when they blew the Grateful Dead, Free and Black Sabbath off stage at Newcastle-Under-Lyme’s Hollywood festival. It was surreal, but despite worries they’d be the biggest one-hit wonders of all time, they were back on top a few months later with Baby Jump.In the Summertime sold 30m copies not even the Beatles did that. But, to me, a hit is always redolent of a place in time. That was my greatest satisfaction: that, in future decades, when people heard that track, they’d remember the summer of 1970.• Mungo Jerry’s new single, The Lockdown Song, and new album, Touch the Sky, are available at mungojerry."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a9a8deb3fcf592cd80fec1435c48bdc0e7ed2cb0/0_0_2555_1534/master/2555.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=32fe8f380d1792dd3c4f791c197d9b45","title":"hadley freeman on the future of the royals","story":" columnist Hadley Freeman discusses the fallout from the publication of Finding Freedom, a biography of Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and the latest allegations surrounding Prince Andrew columnist Hadley Freeman tells Rachel Humphreys why 2020 is not shaping up to be a great year for the royals.

They are travelling across the Channel on a magic carpet that can take only two people at a time. So, in order for everyone to get across there will need to be 9 trips in total from their starting point in England: 5 across carrying two people, and 4 returning carrying one person. (Magic carpets cannot fly empty, which is why one person needs to travel back. All the friends are able to fly alone on the carpet if need be.)The faster the carpet flies, the bumpier the ride. Babs can fly at a speed that gets her to France in 1 minute. Charles feels queasy at that speed: his maximum speed gets him to France in 5 minutes. The others can get to France without suffering debilitating travel sickness no faster than 6 mins (Hattie), 7 mins (Joan), 8 mins (Kenneth) and 12 mins (Sid).1. What is the least amount of flying time, in minutes, required to get everyone from England to France without anyone suffering from queasiness? (When two people are on the carpet together, the crossing will take as long as it takes the slowest of the two.)Perhaps the most obvious strategy is for Babs, who can travel fastest, to take everyone over one by one, returning by herself, since she will save everyone time on the return journey.If she does this, she takes 5 min with Charles, and 6, 7, 8 and 12 mins with the others. Her total time in minutes is thus 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 12 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  42. This is indeed the best strategy with the given times in the question.2. Let’s say that the friends’ tolerance for travel-sickness means that their fastest journeys take the following times: Babs (1 minute), Charles (3 mins), Hattie (7 mins), Joan (9 mins), Kenneth (11 mins) and Sid (13 mins).If you tried the above strategy of Babs taking everyone over one by one, the total time would now be:This is not the best strategy any more. You know this because I told you that all the friends can get to France in less than the answer to question 1, which is 42 minutes. So we need to look for a better strategy.The insight here is that the slowcoaches must go over together. If Sid will take 13 minutes, much better for Kenneth to go with him, which avoids the need for another traverse to take 11 minutes. So let’s put Sid and Kenneth on the same ride.However, if Sid and Kenneth go on the first traverse, one of them will have to return to pick up someone else, which rather defeats the object. So let the fastest two go over first, leaving someone there to return with the carpet once Sid and Kenneth get there. In other words:Step 1. Babs and Charles go over. Charles stays in France and Babs returns: 3 + 1  4 minsStep 2: Kenneth and Sid go over, and Charles returns: 13 + 3  16 mins.Step 3: Babs and Charles go over again, and Babs returns: 4 mins.Step 4: Hattie and Joan go over, and Charles returns: 9 + 3  12 minsStep 5: Babs and Charles go over: 3 mins.If you used the ‘slowcoaches together’ strategy for Q1, the total time would have been 46 minutes. So that strategy is not always the best one.I hope you enjoyed today’s puzzle. I’ll be back in two weeks.I set a puzzle here every two weeks on a Monday. I’m always on the look-out for great puzzles.

It had lain idle and fallen into disrepair over a number of years. It is the only track of its kind in the north of England and attracted a Covid-19-limited capacity of 100 competitors and 500 spectators for its first event, entitled Dragtastic, on the weekend of 8 August 2020.The fundraising effort and venue revamp was organised under the auspices of Straightliners, the West Yorkshire-based motorsport event organiser and club which tapped into its thousands of followers on social media. The revamp involved a complete resurface of the drag strip.The prestigious track was set-up in the late 1970s as York Raceway by the Murty family, who organised drag racing events for decades. It isa well-loved drag strip that has played a part in so many racers and enthusiasts lives. It became the north of England’s premier drag racing venue and generations of families have come here to test their nerve and machines. Unfortunately, Melbourne Raceway closed down in 2017, a heartbreaking development for the motorsport community.The relaunch of Melbourne Raceway is the next chapter in motorsport history in the north of England. The community came together and saved this iconic venue, once again reborn to live another day.Competing side by side in a two-lane raceway, the racers take off from a standing start after dramatic tyre burnouts and the first past the finish line wins. All runs are electronically timed under the auspices of the UK Timing Association (UKTA), with competitors receiving a personal performance print-out showing their times and speeds.Event organiser and founder of Straightliners, Trevor Duckworth, thanked everyone for their fundraising effortsand help in order to getting the eighth-of-a-mile track ready for the event. “It’s new tarmac, drivers,” he said at the start. “Don’t expect super fast times today. We need to lay down some rubber and get it going,” he said referring to the practice of heating up the tyres on the start pad. This makes the vehicle tyres grip and perform better but over time it makes the track grippier and therefore faster. As the first event got under way and rubber was laid, Duckworth said: “I had a dream and it’s now very much a reality. Melbourne Raceway lives and it’s time to create new memories and inspire the next generation of racer and teams.”Mark Flavell’s Funny Car 7.8 litre recorded the fastest time of the day powering down thetrack in 5.41 seconds.One of the big draws at the event was Force of Nature, a steam-powered rocket motorcycle designed, built (with the help of others) and ridden by Graham Sykes from north Yorkshire and powered solely by steam. Built for drag racing, record breaking, exhibitions and events, it uses the latent energy of super-heated pressurised water released through de Laval nozzles, where it turns to steam and creates the thrust to propel the bike.Another big name attendee was Kevin Nicks, who holds the world record for fastest shed. Nicks was racing on his latest creation Barrow of Speed, which he built on a zero budget during the coronavirus lockdown.Duckworth said: “I had a dream. It’s now very much a reality. We have had some very unexpected hurdles but we prevailed and I can honestly say this is something remarkable. Melbourne Raceway lives. It’s almost time to create new memories and to inspire the next generation of racers and teams, who knows what the future holds? But I can tell you this: we surpassed expectations in many ways, and you have all done me proud. Long live Melbourne Raceway.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec6e61fb868d83b6cfcf31240d690cfd43ab2e8c/0_154_3669_2201/master/3669.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63352d7d152505f30bb03f753e718296","title":"england v pakistan five talking points from the first test cricket","story":"Ben Stokes was sorely missed the last time he was absent but he has not been his superhuman self in the past two Tests With difficulty. The last time he was absent for more than the odd Test was in the 2017-18 Ashes, when he was helping Bristol police with their inquiries. England lost 4-0, and it was hard to say what they missed most – Stokes’s batting, his bowling, or his blazing presence. This summer, though, they have already had to do without him to an extent. In the third Test against West Indies, he couldn’t bowl in the first Test against Pakistan, he barely batted, making nought and nine. And he has been dropping catches. If he was superhuman in the first two Covid Tests, he has been a mere mortal in the last two. Since his debut, England’s record is much the same whether Stokes is on board (won 30, lost 29, drawn eight) or not (won eight, lost seven, drawn three). His usual understudy is Sam Curran, the man with the golden home record (played eight, won eight). But this time it has to be a batsman, as a fifth bowler had already been brought in to bowl Stokes’s overs. Cometh the hour, cometh Zak Crawley. Curran may sneak in too, depending on …In English cricket, there’s one surefire way to make everybody love you: stick around for ages. Alastair Cook, who played 161 Tests and then retired after a ropey last few years, was rewarded with an instant knighthood. Ian Botham, who followed a long and thrilling career as a cricketer with a long and plodding one as a commentator, is heading, rather bizarrely, for the House of Lords. The latest venerable veteran is Jimmy Anderson who, unlike Cook or Botham, has got better while getting older – until now. This summer he has looked good, run in hard, touched 87mph, racked up maidens, yet somehow mislaid his mojo. He has taken six wickets in 92 overs while a fellow oldie (Stuart Broad) has 22 in 92.4 and a fellow swinger (Chris Woakes) has 15 in 91. If England are still rotating, Anderson is due a rest if not, he may well be, very tactfully, dropped. It’s significant the selectors have sent for Ollie Robinson, the Brighton McGrath. He surely has more chance than a fading maestro of making his mark on the 2021-22 Ashes, and needs blooding soon.It was said of Steve Waugh after he beat his twin, Mark, to a Baggy Green that he wasn’t even the best player in his family. At Taunton, Dom Bess isn’t seen as the best spinner in Somerset – he’s behind Jack Leach. All summer England have preferred Bess, who’s easily the better fielder and batsman, unless you’re looking for an epic one not out. Leach is clearly the more incisive bowler, taking a Test wicket every 60 balls as against 80 for Bess, who was unlucky with Jos Buttler’s handiwork last week but doesn’t often trouble top players. As a left-armer Leach is also more of a threat to Pakistan’s batsmen, who are nearly all right-handed. He may be rusty, after falling ill before lockdown and being ignored since, but these weird times have shown rust is less of a handicap than we thought.With his fearless 75, Buttler had his finest hour in a white shirt – but only because he had just had a nightmare. He stressed he had been trying to atone for his wicketkeeping, which had been “not good enough”. His honesty was impressive. And now there’s talk of letting Buttler play as a batsman, as he did for a year from May 2018. Bringing Ben Foakes back as keeper would sharpen the fielding. But Buttler has another role behind the stumps: being Joe Root’s left-hand man. Root, more of a good guy than a born boss, heads a triumvirate. Standing at first slip, he relies on his neighbours: Stokes as the alpha male who makes things happen, Buttler as the thinker who stays cool when the battle heats up. Deprived of one consigliere, Root is unlikely to dislodge the other.Every time a Covid Test is played, another piece of received wisdom goes up in smoke. We now see that it’s fine to hold three Tests on the trot at the same ground, something that had never happened in England in 140 years, as long as you have a groundsman like Matt Merchant, who laid on three results, three absorbing contests and opportunities for everyone. We now see that a crowd, though desirable, is not indispensable. Pakistan brought their own noise. England made their own match-winning momentum. The great community of cricket lovers carried on regardless, watching on Sky, listening to TMS, following the live blogs, fitting the drama into real life, tapping on clips on their phones, relishing the elegance of Babar Azam, the exuberance of Yasir Shah, the audacity of Ollie Pope, the composure of Buttler, the wonder of Woakes, the unbeatable undulations of long-form sport."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/978f4c079cba050b5eabc2f0c072556a0d8cb758/100_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=0eac9e6e6f7e9f064b4b69deb15f5f1b","title":"italians do it better an expert guide to hosting an amalfi inspired dinner party","story":"Giulia Rhodes speaks to some in-the-know Italians about how stunning seafood and verdant produce can add a touch of the Amalfi coast to your next dinner partyFrom authors and actors to designers and directors, the glamorous set has long flocked to Italy’s Amalfi coast. And it’s not hard to see why.A film-set perfect 25-mile ribbon of mountainous coastline, its colourful villages, fragrant lemon groves and deep blue sea form a Unesco world heritage site.And as with all Italian regions, the local food and drink is inextricably tied to the culture which means that even if you can’t actually strut your stuff in Positano, you can cook up a bit of Italian sunshine in your kitchen.Alessandro Savelli is CEO and founder of UK-based Pasta Evangelists, which makes premium fresh pasta and sauces for home cooking – with next day delivery across the UK – in addition to its coveted concession in Harrods, now back open for business following the easing of lockdown restrictions.He learned to make pasta with his grandmother. Step one, he says, is to understand the culture. “I am Italian. I love food. I love pasta. I love cooking. Meals in Italy are when the family comes together to talk and enjoy delicious food. It is the highlight of our day. Food is not just seen as a necessity.”He celebrates the regional roots of Italian cuisine, sharing culture and stories to support local speciality pasta dishes. The food of the southern Italian Amalfi coast is different to that of his native Genoa, in the north, but it is close to his heart.“We go every year. My wife is from Naples and we married in Capri. I love it. The people are friendly, funny and loud, and the cuisine has everything – from amazing fish and seafood, fruits and vegetables to wonderful pizza and pasta. I discovered dishes that only really exist in that area.”His personal favourite is spaghetti alla nerano, with fried courgette and provolone cheese. While scialatielli – somewhere between linguine and tagliatelle in shape – with Amalfi lemon, ‘nduja sausage and mascarpone, features on the Pasta Evangelists’ Amalfi week menu.“Pasta dishes are about simplicity, freshness and few ingredients. We can bring that to your home,” he says. Although he admits he can’t deliver the full experience. “In Italy, we do tend to take the sunshine for granted.”Carla Bollati, a retired doctor from Turin, was introduced to the area around Amalfi by her late partner Gennaro, a Neapolitan. “I have a deep sentimental attachment,” she says. “And the tastes are a lovely way to travel to happy memories.”She was struck by the area’s scenery from her first visit. “It is a crowded landscape that cannot be changed. But there is also such special light and colour, the perfume of lemons, so many wonderful flavours. All the senses are covered.”The people and cuisine of the south are, she says, another huge draw. “They cook with what the area has to offer. Try a mozzarella there and you will understand what it is supposed to be.”Culinary roots and rules are revered, she adds. “If I cooked Neapolitan pasta e fagioli – with beans – for Gennaro, it had to be with broken odds and ends of pasta. Shells just wouldn’t be right. We Italians are so tied to the history of our food and the habit of coming together to eat it.”Italian food expert and cook, Paola Maggiulli, who runs the Tiny Italian supper clubs and cookery courses, agrees. But she insists it is a very inclusive tradition. To create an authentic Italian dinner, she says, the starting point is confidence.“Anyone can make Italian food. It is about flavour, not technique. With a few quality ingredients you can make incredible dishes.”Having spent much of her childhood in her father’s south London Italian deli, she recommends taking time to shop for good ingredients and learn the stories behind them.“In normal times, what is special about Italian food is the connection and time with other people. That might be planning the menu with friends or helping your grandmother prepare Sunday lunch for the extended family. Community and family are everything. Sharing the experience of eating with people you care about just makes you feel better.”So what would Maggiulli serve for a feelgood dinner inspired by the Amalfi coast?“I would want those incredible lemons,” she says, suggesting simple spaghetti with lemon, parmesan, olive oil and basil as a first course.“Amalfi seafood is beautiful, too. So perhaps a main of braised octopus, mussels cooked in white wine, or a frittura mista platter of fried squid and prawns,” she says. A chocolate and almond cake – a torta caprese after the island of Capri – would end the meal nicely.When you host your party, build the convivial atmosphere by serving the food on large dishes in the middle of the table, for guests to help themselves, and make sure the conversation, as well as the drinks, are flowing.For the latter, Daniele Umoette, former bar manager and drinks brand ambassador from Carpi in the northern region of Emilia-Romagna, suggests a gin spritz aperitif to kickstart the evening.“Mix blood orange flavoured Malfy Gin Con Arancia with Fever Tree Sicilian Lemon Tonic and a splash of prosecco over lots of ice in a nice glass, and garnish with some fruit such as blackberries, pink grapefruit slice and some aromatic herbs such as sage,” he says.Admittedly, your after-dinner stroll will probably be a little less glamorous than the nightly passeggiata in Positano. Maybe next year.

In the early days it formed the basis of many a #quarantini – made from whatever we might have left in the cupboard. Since then, the hashtag has clocked up more than 87,000 posts and the term has passed into the popular lexicon. Now, take it a notch higher for the ultimate cocktail moment.

This year, with staycations booming, boutique bell tents are all the rage, and whether you’re a Hyde Park regular, or head to the Isle of Wight every summer, you don’t have to miss out. Pitch your tent in the garden – or indoors if it’s raining – swing open the patio doors, pour yourself a Malfy Gin and tonic, and cue up your festival playlist. Designer wellies optional.UpcyclingNesting has taken on new meaning as we’re spending more time than ever at home, meaning that we are looking to make our personal spaces as cosy and reassuring as possible. With major home improvement projects put on hold, we’re looking at subtler ways to spruce up our living spaces, often going hand-in-hand with the crafts we’ve taken up to help while away our extended free time. Repurposing old units and reupholstering much-loved chairs are at the top of many DIY lists – and when it comes to themes and patterns, rainbows and bright, uplifting shades are the order of the day.Micro garden partiesWith our close friends and family having been out of bounds for so long, we’re getting to know the neighbours. WhatsApp groups for inidual streets and blocks of flats are springing up across the country as we look closer to home for friendship, support and entertainment.Scaled-down garden parties comprising small groups of neighbours dressing up and bringing over their own food and drinks – nibbled and sipped at a respectful distance – make for eclectic gatherings and unexpected new friendships being forged.Staying ‘in-in’Now we can no longer go “out-out” – and with loungewear fatigue firmly setting in – summer is about dressing up for virtual socialising. Many of us are seeing more of our friends than ever as we plan regular catch-ups via online video calling, from family quizzes to propping up a virtual bar with friends, while Royal Ascot 2020 saw thousands of us donning fascinators in front of the TV in aid of frontline charities.

Explore your local high street to see what gems you can unearth.Home cooking with a little helpOnce we realised how much mess keeping a sourdough starter alive entails, the appeal of devoting ourselves to becoming expert home chefs faded fairly fast. With more food businesses pivoting to offer meal kits designed to be finished off at home for that personal touch, there’s no better time to start enjoying gourmet food delivered to your door (without worrying about it getting cold). For a taste of Italy, Pasta Evangelists offer artisan pasta and sauces via next-day delivery across the UK, which can be whipped up at home in minutes. With dishes inspired by culinary traditions found across Italy, from Venice to Sicily, you can be taken on a foodie journey with all the taste and minimum effort.Growing lupinsSince lockdown began, gardening has shot up in popularity, with garden centres opening some time before other non-essential businesses. From window sills to flower beds, this summer is about attempting to turn green spaces into a riot of colour to rival the rainbows pinned in people’s windows, and the West Country Lupin has been particularly popular. Packed with uplifting colour, lupins are easy to grow and soothing to look at, making them the ideal flower to plant this summer.Virtual destination toursGrounded globetrotters are fulfilling their wanderlust by taking virtual tours of some of the world’s most stunning spots.

At Magor Marsh you can walk along boardwalks near where monks once worked to reclaim the land from the sea, through reed beds with Cetti’s warblers singing wildly, water voles dashing off, the sound of distant cuckoos floating on the air and plenty of waterfowl.

Hordes of bright goldfinches, chaffinches, green finches and siskins flurried around the feeders while a treecreeper crept up a nearby oak. In autumn there are thousands of pink-footed geese here and in winter, whooper swans. Ospreys are present in summer. There’s also a bumblebee sanctuary.

Anyone can walk for free around the extensive heathland, with its sites of special scientific interest there are a great number of interesting bird, reptile and invertebrate species flitting around the gorse, heather, gravel and grassland.

Luckily for us a bittern salvaged the day, flapping ponderously overhead before disappearing into a reedbed. Later, we saw a couple of great egrets.

At least five people trapped, some children. A Collapse Response and Second Alarm has been called,” the union said on Twitter.The union tweeted photos of rescue workers climbing over a pile of debris.The cause of the natural gas explosion remains unknown.As well as destroying three homes, the blast ripped open the wall of another, spreading debris throughout the neighborhood as rescuers picked through a pile of rubble, searching for victims, the Baltimore Sun reported.Neighbors responding to the blast dug through rubble and called out for victims, one man told WBAL television.“It was just chaos,” Dean Jones told the NBC affiliate, saying he ran barefoot to the scene where he found destroyed homes and broken windows, and smelled gas.“We were just worried about just trying to get people out. Once they said a kid was in there, I lost it.

Dr Mike Ryan, the head of the World Health Organization’s emergencies programme, alo said the virus had shown no seasonal pattern and governments in western Europe needed to react fast to new flare-ups to prevent it bouncing back.The Paris order applies to everyone aged 11 and over and covers places where physical distancing is difficult, including open-air markets, shopping streets and areas with large numbers of cafés and bars such as Rue Oberkampf and parts of the Marais.The city’s busiest boulevards and the pedestrianised banks of the Seine and the Canal St Martin, which are popular evening and weekend gathering places, are also included, as is Montmartre with its warren of narrow streets. More open areas such as the zone around the Eiffel Tower and Champs Élysées are not included.“The targets are basically places with a lot of people where it’s hard to keep more than a metre apart, and areas where people go to to relax, where distancing measures are being forgotten,” said Nicolas Nordman, a city hall safety official.He said people not wearing masks would be warned for the first few days, but that police would soon start handing out fines of €135 (£120). The zones where masks are obligatory will be evaluated regularly and could be expanded, he added.Several other French cities, including Lille, Nice and Biarritz, have adopted similar measures in recent days as the spread of Covid-19 has accelerated in several parts of France. France reported 2,288 infections in 24 hours on Friday and another 785 on Monday, bringing its weekly total of new cases to 10,800.Several European countries are experiencing a sharp increase in infections after easing strict lockdowns. In most, numbers remains significantly lower than during March and April, but Greece recorded 203 infections tests on Sunday, its highest figure since the start of the pandemic.Gkikas Magiorkinis, an assistant professor of hygiene and epidemiology at Athens University and one of the country’s top infectious disease experts, said Greece had reached a critical juncture in its ability to contain the further spread of the virus.“We can say that Greece has formally entered a second wave of the epidemic. This is the point that we could win or lose the battle,” he said, adding that cases could surge to 350 a day if the “dramatic increase” continued unabated.“Unless there is a change in the trend that we are seeing we are likely to propose more measures along the lines we have seen in Poros,” he said, referring to the island where a surge in cases late last week prompted authorities to announce an unprecedented crackdown including the closures of clubs, bars and restaurants from 11pm.The Greek health minister, Vassilis Kikilias, said transmission of the virus was “growing dangerously and hinted that further containment measures were likely to be announced.The country’s main concern was “the degree to which this epidemic can stretch any health system”, he said. “No health system, anywhere in the world, can cope effectively with a full epidemic resurgence.”While tourism was partly to blame, Magiorkinis attributed the recent Greek resurgence mostly to lax observance of hygiene protocols by Greeks, particularly younger generations who have flooded bars and beaches in recent weeks.The median age of an infected person within the last 30 days has fallen to 38, the Corriere della Sera paper reported, with a sharp increase in cases among those under 18. “Not being worried would be reckless,” the health minister, Roberto Speranza, told the paper. “The average age among those infected has dramatically fallen below 40.”There are currently 15 clusters of infections across Italy, including 14 friars in the Umbrian town of Assisi who recently arrived from overseas. The biggest outbreak, involving 257 people, has been among residents and staff at a migrant reception centre in Treviso, Veneto.Fresh outbreaks in north-east Spain continue to cause concern. Catalonia reported 863 new infections and five deaths in the past 24 hours and neighbouring Aragón recorded 633.New outbreaks have also been reported in Marbella and elsewhere on the Costa del Sol, and the Atlético de Madrid football team, who are due to travel to Lisbon for their Uefa Champions League quarter-final against RB Leipzig, also reported two cases.Despite the recent increase in infections in Spain, the WHO’s director of public health and environment, Maria Neira, said a new national lockdown would only be justified by a “very alarming” epidemiological scenario which she said “simply doesn’t exist”.Education authorities across Germany, meanwhile, where pupils in the states of Berlin, Brandenburg and Schleswig-Holstein returned to class on Monday, are ided over whether students should be required to wear masks during lessons.In four states, pupils and staff are required to wear masks only in corridors, common rooms, stairwells and canteens, while others – including Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where secondary schools go back on Wednesday – have made masks compulsory everywhere on school grounds, including classrooms.Teachers’ unions have criticised the rules. “Starting schools with full classrooms can only be something other than a risky experiment if we are prepared to replace safety distances with other effective hygiene measures at schools,” said Heinz-Peter Meidinger, the head of the German Association of Teachers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a8d1e3b52910f0d1dbe8d609c7bef9684b10755b/0_0_5359_3216/master/5359.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a1958a9a21a897f5fcc71feb0d54302","title":"germanys sdp picks olaf scholz as candidate to succeed angela merkel","story":"Social Democrats name pragmatic ex-mayor Olaf Scholz as candidate for chancellorGermany’s Social Democrats have fired the starting gun in the race to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor by announcing the pragmatist finance minister, Olaf Scholz, as their candidate for the job.Yet next year’s federal elections will be the first since the second world war in which an incumbent chancellor will not be in the running for the top seat, making the centre-left party hopeful that all could be to play for if it offers up the right candidate.Scholz, a former mayor of Germany’s second-largest city, Hamburg, surprisingly lost last year’s contest to lead his party but has now secured the support of the SPD’s more leftwing leadership duo, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, to lead the party into next autumn’s election.A taciturn number-cruncher previously nicknamed Scholzomat for his monotone delivery, the 62-year-old has enjoyed high approval ratings since taking over the finance ministry in 2018, and his popularity has risen further during the Covid-19 pandemic.The former leader of Juso, the SPD’s youth wing, is a more isive figure among his own party faithful, many of whom accuse him of lacking the courage to go after banks implicated in the “cum-ex” tax fraud scheme and having failed to detect and prevent the Wirecard accounting scandal.Supporters say Scholz has played a vital role in shaping the EU’s €750bn (£675bn) Covid-19 recovery plan, which involved a historic break with Germany’s commitment to balanced budgets. They say wooden delivery in interviews and hesitant decision-making have never significantly harmed Merkel’s appeal in her 15 years in the chancellory.Hailing Scholz as “decisive and experienced”, and “brave even in crisis”, a press release announcing his candidacy left little doubt that the SPD would present its contender as guaranteeing a better chance of continuity with the stable Merkel era than any politician from her own party.Because of the pandemic, the CDU has postponed until December the party congress that will decide the party’s future leadership, and therefore the likely candidate leading the party into next year’s elections."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/06ad32b7d7bb3a33087df313f06ba49bd8d09f64/0_48_1920_1152/master/1920.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca672321c3146a7ac98e97235ca5dc5d","title":"government paid vote leave ai firm to analyse uk citizens tweets","story":"Faculty, linked to senior Tories, hired to collect tweets as part of coronavirus-related contractPrivacy campaigners have expressed alarm after the government revealed it had hired an artificial intelligence firm to collect and analyse the tweets of UK citizens as part of a coronavirus-related contract.Faculty, which was hired by Dominic Cummings to work for the Vote Leave campaign and counts two current and former Conservative ministers among its shareholders, was paid £400,000 by the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government for the work, according to a copy of the contract published online.In June the  reported Faculty had been awarded the contract, but that key passages in the published version of the document describing the work that the company would carry out had been redacted.In response to questions about the contract in the House of Lords, the government published an unredacted version of the contract, which describes the company’s work as “topic analysis of social media to understand public perception and emerging issues of concern to HMG arising from the Covid-19 crisis”.A further paragraph describes how machine learning will be applied to social media data.Silkie Carlo, the director of the civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch, which discovered the updated contract, expressed alarm at the details. “This is effectively AI-powered mass political surveillance, and it’s been done in a very secretive way, apparently to inform policy,” she said.“It seems from the contract this social media monitoring has been going on for three months, and machine learning has been used for that time. We don’t know what the impact is.”A Faculty spokesperson declined to comment on the criticism, but said that the project analysed public posts from Twitter containing words relating to the pandemic, such as “covid” or “coronavirus”, as part of an endeavour to help the government detect emerging issues relating to the pandemic in local communities.They said personally identifiable information, such as Twitter usernames or profiles, was stripped out from the data at the point of collection, meaning it would be impossible to use the information to profile any inidual or group of people.Carlo expressed scepticism that social media posts would provide the government with an accurate insight into public attitudes. “Twitter is not representative of public opinion as a whole,” she said. “I think there are a lot of questions to be asked about the premise.”An MHCLG spokesperson said: “We are satisfied that the service provided by Faculty was of a high standard, and delivered on value for money.” They added that the contract expired in July.The MHCLG social media work is one of several government contracts awarded to Faculty relating to coronavirus. In March an existing contract to support the NHS with AI initiatives was expanded so that the firm could help create a “coronavirus datastore” for the government, visualising NHS data to help inform ministerial decision-making.The company has several links to figures in the Vote Leave campaign and the Conservative party. Two of its investors, Theodore Agnew and John Nash, are current or former Conservative ministers.In 2016 the firm was recruited by Cummings to provide data science and machine learning technology for the Vote Leave campaign. The work was carried out by Ben Warner, the brother of Faculty’s CEO, Marc Warner.Ben subsequently worked on the Conservative party’s 2019 general election campaign, and was later recruited as a data science adviser to Downing Street.Last month the  reported Cummings had paid more than £250,000 to Faculty via his private consultancy firm, Dynamic Maps. Both parties have declined to explain what the payments were for. Faculty has previously said it would no longer accept political work.The Scott Trust, the ultimate owner of the , is the sole investor in GMG Ventures, which is a minority shareholder in Faculty."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ec3170720aa3102344a57bcf601fccd1f06bd23a/0_185_6240_3744/master/6240.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9f42d2c235d2530d05a07693dde73e91","title":"joy relief lagos churches reopen worship coronavirus lockdown nigeria","story":"In devoutly religious Nigeria, the closure of places of worship to stop the spread of coronavirus has been keenly feltThe sound of church organs pulses through drowsy streets, puncturing the Sunday quiet for the first time in five months. Worshippers stream into the near century-old courtyard of Lagos’s Catholic Holy Cross Cathedral and find a somewhat unfamiliar place.Sink units with motion-sensitive soap dispensers line the entrance through the gates. Security guards point temperature sensors at foreheads. At the church steps, contact details are taken by staff in exchange for a pass to enter. Inside the building, stickers mark the two designated seats on each pew, while ushers patrol the aisles, gesturing reproachfully for masks lowered under chins to be promptly raised.The cathedral in Nigeria’s most populous city is open to half of its usual capacity of 2,500 worshippers, under strict government guidelines, for the first time since March when lockdown measures to stop the spread of coronavirus banned religious gatherings.“In this period we can’t do things the way we want to,” says the archbishop of the Catholic church in Lagos, Alfred Martins, as he addresses the faithful from his pulpit draped in gold fabric. “We must do them the way we have to.”Glimmering gele head-ties wrapped like giant rose petals dot the cathedral hall. Many dressed in Sunday best wave at fellow parishioners, stealing embraces over pews and gently dancing through hymns. At every stage of the mass, physical distancing is enforced by vigilant ushers. After the service, no meetings or groups are allowed. Worshippers are guided out through exits, which lead away from the open courtyard and directly into the street. For many the service provokes an odd mixture of relief and loss.Thompson Babatunde, 35, was born into Holy Cross, situated in Lagos Island – and home to lots of established, tightly knit working-class communities. “There’s really nothing like being present physically,” he says. “But today I noticed it when we didn’t offer each other the ‘sign of peace’. There is no hugging, no holding, these things are important connections. For me, something was missing.”The impact of the closure and subsequent new regulations for places of worship has been deeply felt at Holy Cross and across Nigeria, a devoutly religious nation. On Friday mosques reopened across the country, where the vast majority of the population is evenly split between followers of Christianity and Islam.In 2014, widespread fear that the deadly Ebola outbreak could spread in Lagos led to swift changes to religious practices, yet not to this extent, Babatunde says. “With this virus, unlike Ebola, it’s even in the air. It’s very easy to spread so it has caused more disruption.”After morning mass, Father Raymond Emedo greets departing parishioners. The scale of loneliness in Lagos, particularly for older people, makes places that foster community vital. “Most of them have kids who have left Nigeria or live further away in Lagos,” he says. “An elderly woman will walk all the way to church just to tell me she’s having a headache and I will think, ‘You should have rested’. The next week she’ll come back and say ‘Thank you, after I got home I ate and I slept and felt better’. Really it was the connection that was important.”Among both traditional institutions and the powerful pentecostal megachurches that dominate Christian life in Nigeria, the ban has universally been a burden, but has also ided reactions.From some, it has meant a greater willingness to adapt and offer aid. For others, a hostility towards lockdown measures has led to dangerous conspiracy theories.Bishop David Oyedepo, the founder of Living Faith Tabernacle which draws 50,000 people, has been among the most ardent critics of the lockdown. “There is something wrong for people to be allowed to be in the market for six hours and can’t be in church for two hours,” he says, pointing out that shopping areas and hospitals were allowed to open. Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, the founder of Christ Embassy, which seats 30,000 at its main branch in Lagos, has also been heavily critical. “The lockdown is not science,” he said in a sermon. In June, the UK broadcasting regulator, Ofcom, sanctioned his LoveWorld TV channel for furthering the conspiracy that 5G networks were the cause of the pandemic.More generally, the vast, ostentatious wealth of megachurches and their multimillionaire pastors has fuelled criticism during the lockdown that the financial hit of the closure was a more pressing consideration than offering support to those in need.Other large churches such as the Citadel church and Elevation church have been more vocal in offering support to the government and affected people.The pandemic was a challenge for the church in Nigeria to reassess its obligations to society, Martins says. More than 400 of the Catholic church’s health centres have been offered to the government to support its outbreak response. “We’ve had to reflect on what pastoral care looks like during a pandemic,” he adds. Visitation to vulnerable or sick people had become complicated by the pandemic.“We’ve quickly transitioned to online, and began airing live services on Catholic TV. It is an unusual phenomenon, giving mass to an empty church, but with our virtual services we’ve also become more accessible to others. We’re using social media to keep in contact and connect with people.“I’m old school but even the old school knows when new school ways can be valuable,” he says, laughing."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/072f789e567fa37a147a1cf6d6f6b1504677e289/0_300_4000_2400/master/4000.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca921e8b29819b3e49521016c4e217a4","title":"puerto rico primary election","story":"Hundreds of voters turned away from shuttered centers that received ballots several hours late or never received them at allPuerto Ricans demanded answers on Monday after botched primaries forced officials to reschedule voting at centers lacking ballots, an unprecedented decision being called a blow to the US territory’s democracy.The island’s elections commission remained silent as anger and embarrassment spread across Puerto Rico one day after hundreds of voters were turned away from shuttered centers that for unknown reasons received ballots several hours late or never received them at all.“That scar will never leave Puerto Rico,” said political analyst Domingo Emanuelli. “It was a hold-up of the country’s democracy.”On Monday, Carlos Méndez, president of the island’s house of representatives, demanded that the commission release the results of the nearly 60 out of 110 precincts where voting was able to take place on Sunday.Governor Wanda Vázquez and other officials from Puerto Rico’s two main parties also have demanded the resignation of Juan Ernesto Dávila, president of the election commission. He declined comment via a spokeswoman but told NotiUno radio station that he would resign once the primaries are over, saying it would be irresponsible to step down before that.Meanwhile, questions about why Puerto Rico held a primary if ballots were not available and how it was possible that no one knew about the problem until it was too late remained unanswered.The electoral commission officials for the pro-statehood New Progressive party and the main opposition Popular Democratic party did not return calls or messages for comment.The primary is one of the most closely watched races in the island’s history since it pits two candidates who served as replacement governors following last year’s political turmoil. Vázquez faces Pedro Pierluisi, who represented Puerto Rico in Congress from 2009 to 2017.Pierluisi briefly served as governor after Governor Ricardo Rosselló resigned in August 2019 following widespread street protests over a profanity-laced chat that was leaked and government corruption. But Puerto Rico’s supreme court ruled that Vázquez, then the justice secretary, was constitutionally next in line because there was no secretary of state.Meanwhile, the Popular Democratic party, which supports Puerto Rico’s current political status as a US territory, is holding a primary for the first time in its 82-year history. Three people are vying to become governor – the San Juan mayor, Carmen Yulín Cruz, known for her public spats with Donald Trump following the devastation of Hurricane Maria the Puerto Rico senator Eduardo Bhatia and Carlos Delgado, mayor of the north-west coastal town of Isabela.While another primary is scheduled for 16 August, some expect lawsuits and legal loopholes to potentially upset those plans.At least one voter filed a lawsuit against the commission and the electoral officials of the two main parties late on Sunday via the American Civil Liberties Union. Pierluisi also filed a lawsuit against the commission and the two officials as he rejected its decision to hold another primary next Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/904114a91bfebc0b04b9aa0d93ebbc5c49b70953/0_22_1280_768/master/1280.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=91eecf7cb0459f7d260210fe266b6dcd","title":"share your reaction on the belarus election result","story":"If you live, work in Belarus or are an expat, we would like to hear your thoughts on the election resultProtests have broken out in Belarus after Alexander Lukashenko, who has ruled for 26 years, claimed he had won a landslide victory in an election marred by accusations of vote-rigging.In clashes that took place on Sunday, riot police used rubber bullets, flash grenades, teargas and a water cannon to quash protests.Whether you live, work in Belarus or are an expat, we would like to hear your reaction to the election result.

For those of you who were concerned about the best way to manage the risk of coronavirus while having sex, a UK-based sexual health charity has published a list of guidelines, which include wearing face coverings, avoiding kissing and picking positions where participants are not face to face during intercourse. However, after several months of the lockdown and its partial easing, THT said it was no longer realistic to ask people to completely refrain from sex. In the guidance, the charity advised the best sexual partner during the pandemic is yourself or someone you live with. Masturbation, using sex toys or participating in phone or online sex are recommended as the safest options, as these can be done at a distance from others. If having sex with someone outside of your household, THT advised having one regular partner or limiting the number of sexual partners as well as taking other precautions. Sexual partners are advised to wash their hands for 20 seconds before and after sex to help reduce the risk. Due to the ways Covid-19 is spread, the charity further recommends not kissing and wearing a face covering during intercourse. The charity also advises picking positions where participants are not face to face. Finally, having borne those precautions (and others on the THT website) in mind, THT’s medical director Dr Michael Brady adds: Once you’ve made the decision to have sex, try to relax and enjoy itHealth authorities in France have reported 785 new confirmed coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, compared to 2,288 on Friday, but gave no indication of the number of infections over the weekend, Reuters reports.  In its latest update, the health ministry said that it had registered 10,800 new cases over the past week, but did not provide an updated number for the total cumulative number of coronavirus infections, which on Friday stood at 197,921.  The ministry said that over the past week, 10,800 new cases had been registered but it was not immediately clear what period this referred to and whether infections over the weekend were included in this total.Denmark’s health minister says the virus is “on its way back,” and has announced local measures to contain it, according to the Associated Press.“We are intervening with local measures that are fitted to local needs,” Magnus Heunicke told a news conference on Monday. “We are doing that to avoid a total lockdown of the country.”Increases in the number of cases were reported in Aarhus — Denmark’s second-largest city — and in six other places geographically spread across the country of nearly 6 million.Since Sunday, Denmark has recorded 76 new cases, bringing its total so far since the outbreak began to 14,815 cases and 620 deaths. More than half of the new cases are in Aarhus.The decision comes after Aarhus made it mandatory as of Monday to use face masks on public transportation.Restaurants and bars in some of Greece’s top tourist destinations will be subject to a night curfew, after coronavirus infections in the country reached a new high. The announcement comes after one of Greece’s top infectious disease experts told the  that the country was “formally” in the grip of a second wave of coronavirus, and the government said visitors arriving from Sweden, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic will need proof they have tested negative for coronavirus to gain entryAreas in which eateries and bars will be closed from midnight to 07:00 am include the popular islands of Mykonos, Santorini, Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos, Aristotelia Peloni, a government spokeswoman, said in a televised address, according to the French news agency AFP. Some of these destinations are known for late-night clubbing. The cities of Thessaloniki, Larissa, Volos and Katerini were also affected, as was the Halkidiki peninsula which is popular with Balkan visitors. The restrictions will be in place from Tuesday to 23 August, she said. Greece’s public health watchdog on Sunday announced 203 new infections, the highest since the start of the pandemic. A total of 213 people have died from the virus. Another 126 infections were announced on Monday,The European Union’s health agency has called on member states that are seeing an increase in cases of coronavirus to reinstate control measures, as it warned of a “true resurgence” in several countries. In a “rapid risk assessment” published on Monday, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) warned of a “risk of further escalation of Covid-19” across the continent. The agency said:While many countries are now testing mild and asymptomatic cases, which has resulted in increased case reports, there is a true resurgence in cases in several countries as a result of physical distancing measures being relaxed.The Stockholm-based agency said that the Covid-19 pandemic continued to “pose a major public health threat”, in spite of a recent decline in cases. Since the relaxation of movement restrictions and other measures, the spread of the virus had resumed, it said. “Further increases in the incidence of Covid-19, and associated hospitalisations and deaths, can be mitigated if sufficient control measures are reinstalled or reinforced in a timely manner,” the agency said. Countries that are now observing an increase in cases, after having lifted their control measures following a temporary improvement in the epidemiological situation, should consider re-instating selected measures through a phased, step-wise and sustainable approach. For those countries seeing an increase “the risk of further escalation of COVID-19 is high.” If those countries fail to implement or reinforce restrictions, the risk was “very high,” it warned.The agency conceded that as the pandemic wears on “it is natural for people to become fatigued and reduce compliance with public health measures.”Risk communication efforts should be tailored to changes in the local situation and continuous messaging is needed to remind the population that the SARS-CoV-2 virus will remain in circulation within the community and that they should take everyday measures to reduce potential exposure, such as practising cough and respiratory etiquette, physical distancing and hand hygiene, wearing face masks, reducing the number of contacts and staying home when ill. The rate of new coronavirus infections in Ireland over the past 14 days is now higher than that of the UK, figures released by the European Centre for Disease Control show. After a spike in cases over the past week, Ireland’s infection rate is 16.9 cases per 100,000 people, compared to 16.5 in the UK, which remains the European country worst-affected so far by the pandemic. According to RTE, Ireland’s national public broadcasting corporation, the Irish government used figures from the ECDC to decide which countries went on its green list for travel. Royal Caribbean Group has reported a net loss of $1.6bn (£1.2bn) for the second quarter of the year, after the coronavirus pandemic caused the cruise operator to cancel all sailings during that period, writes Joanna Partridge for the  business desk.The group, which operates brands including Royal Caribbean and Celebrity Cruises, made a $473m net profit during the same period in 2019.The company, which suspended all of its voyages globally on 13 March, said the Covid-19 pandemic was posing an “unprecedented challenge” to the cruise industry.Royal Caribbean is burning through between $250m and $290m cash a month, while its ships are not sailing, because of ongoing costs including operating and administrative expenses, and commitments to build new vessels.A 15-year-old boy in England has admitted punching a student from Singapore and saying: “I don’t want your coronavirus in my country.”The “vicious and completely unprovoked” attack by the teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, on Oxford Street in February left Jonathan Mok, 23, with a bloodied and bruised face which required surgery, said the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Mok was coming back home after a dinner in central London when he was “clearly targeted in this hate crime because of his ethnic appearance”, Daniel Kavanagh, a senior crown prosecutor, said, according to the PA news agency. The boy admitted wounding or inflicting grievous bodily harm at Highbury Corner Magistrates’ Court on Monday, the CPS said. He will be sentenced at the same court on 7 September. This was a vicious and completely unprovoked attack on a young man who was simply making his way home with a friend after dinner in central London. Hate crime has a corrosive effect on our society and nobody should be subjected to such vile behaviour. The prosecution case included CCTV footage of the incident, leaving the defendant little choice but to plead guilty and own up to his actions. I hope this conviction provides the victim with some comfort and shows that the CPS will take action to prosecute those who commit hate crimes.” The CPS said it will be applying for a “hate crime uplift” at the sentencing, which can see defendants handed a lengthier sentence. Earlier we reported that travellers from Lithuania were banned from entering Belgium. A reader has written in to say this is incorrect. While Lithuania does appear on the Belgian government’s “red list”, this is because Lithuania bans travellers entering the country from Belgium, rather than vice versa. The UK recorded 816 confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Monday, according to the Department of Health and Social Care.On Sunday there were 1,062 new positive tests for the coronavirus.Visitors to Greece arriving from Sweden, Belgium, Spain, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic will need proof they have tested negative for coronavirus to gain entry, the government said on Monday.Tightening controls after a recent spike in Covid-19 infections, the government said the requirement will go into effect from August 17. The required test cannot be older than 72 hours prior to entry.On Sunday Greece reported its highest daily tally of coronavirus infections, 203 cases, since the start of the outbreak.The brought the total number of infections in the country to 5,623 since its first infection surfaced in late February.The government said the same requirement will apply to all visitors entering Greece via its land borders, including Greek citizens returning home.The government also moved to suspend public gatherings, including shows and concerts, where audiences are not seated.Sinopharm, a Chinese state-owned pharmaceutical company, has begun phase 3 clinical trials of a Covid-19 vaccine in Bahrain. The company launched similar trials in the United Arab Emirates last month.The human trial, which launched in the UAE capital Abu Dhabi in mid-July, is a partnership between Sinopharm*s China National Biotec Group (CNBG) and Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing company Group 42 (G42).G42 Healthcare CEO Ashish Koshy said expanding the trial to the small island state of Bahrain will increase the numbers of participants on a par with trials under way in nations with much larger populations.The study, which uses an inactivated vaccine, will include around 6,000 citizens and resident volunteers in Bahrain over 12 months, the health ministry said.No Covid-19 vaccine has yet been approved for commercial use.The trial in the UAE, which was expanded from Abu Dhabi to include another centre in Sharjah emirate, on Thursday reached a milestone of 5,000 vaccinations, a joint statement from the trial organisers said.Bahrain, with a population of 1.5 million, has recorded more than 44,000 cases of the new coronavirus and 162 deaths.India has registered a record 1,007 fatalities in the past 24 hours as new coronavirus infections surged by 62,064 cases, the Associated Press reports.The health ministry said the total fatalities reached 44,386 on Monday. The number of confirmed cases reported so far are 2,215,074. At least 634,935 patients were still undergoing treatment.India has recorded more than 60,000 cases of the virus daily in the last four days and more infections than any other country in the world for six consecutive days. It has averaged around 50,000 new cases a day since mid-June.Concern is growing that a resurgence of coronavirus in Europe will lead to a “second wave” of uncoordinated border restrictions that will undermine the open borders on which the European Union is founded. In a letter to national governments, seen by the Associated Press, the European commission warns that “while we must ensure that the EU is ready for possible resurgences of Covid-19 cases ... we should at the same time avoid a second wave of uncoordinated actions at the internal borders of the EU.”“The re-establishment of ineffective restrictions and internal border controls must be avoided. Rather, the response should be to have targeted, proportionate and coordinated measures, informed by scientific evidence,” said the letter, sent to the 27 EU member countries and Britain.The letter comes after some countries have imposed new restrictions, or demanded that travellers quarantine, in an echo of the panic border closures which blocked the movement of supplies and medical equipment after Europe’s first outbreak emerged in Italy in February.Experts fear that countries are becoming so used to lowering the gates at their frontiers as they see fit that the future of Europe’s ID-check free Schengen area is in peril.Belgium — where EU headquarters are based — does not allow travel to some regions in Spain, notably Catalonia in the north, and also has bans on people coming from parts of France, Britain, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania and Switzerland.Scandinavian nations are notably quick to react to any rise in infection rates. Denmark’s foreign ministry now has Spain, Bulgaria, Luxembourg, Romania and Andorra on its so-called red list. Norway, which is not an EU member but is part of the Schengen area, has not hesitated either.The Migration Policy Institute said “Scenes of backed-up borders and checkpoints would have been unthinkable just five years ago. Yet today, the unilateral reintroduction of border checks and border closures has become an accepted part of member states’ toolkits to respond to cross-border emergencies.”The danger, the institute said, is that “the instinct to return to national borders at times of crisis may only grow stronger, particularly as second or third waves of the virus necessitate the reintroduction of some level of travel restrictions.”The actor Antonio Banderas has confirmed on Twitter that he is suffering from coronavirus. In a message posted on 10 August, his 60th birthday, the actor said he was forced to celebrate in quarantine but reassured followers that his health was largely unaffected.Educational authorities across Germany are ided over whether students should be required to wear masks during lessons, as schools reopen in large swathes of the country today, writes Philip Oltermann, the ’s Brussels bureau chief.Pupils in the states of Berlin, Brandenburg, Berlin and Schleswig-Holstein got back into classrooms on Monday, following from Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and the city state of Hamburg.In four states, pupils and staff are required to wear masks in corridors, common rooms, stairwells and canteens, but not in classrooms. The education ministry of Schleswig-Holstein merely recommends the use of face masks in the first two weeks after the summer holidays, but also advises students from year seven (aged 13-14) to wear masks in their classrooms.Teachers’ unions have criticised the rules: “Starting schools with full classrooms can only be something other than a risky experiment if we are prepared to replace safety distances with other effective hygiene measures at schools,” said Heinz-Peter Meidlinger, the head of the German Association of Teachers. His association has praised measures taken in North-Rhine Westphalia. When Germany’s most populous state opens secondary schools on Wednesday, students of all ages will be required to wear masks anywhere on school grounds, including classrooms."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd8b06d91abd5582ad255236fae3fb0a2cf49631/0_92_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fd6b1655682388e9977c1fee27f8e047","title":"uk coronavirus live news covid 19 latest updates schools","story":"PM says government will keep looking at data in all countries Britons are travelling toThat’s all from me, Caroline Davies, for today. Once again, thank you for your time. Live coverage continues on our global live blog:Here’s a summary of some of today’s major UK coronavirus news:NHS test and trace is cutting 6,000 contact tracer jobs and allocating roles to regional teams to work with councils, following criticism by local authorities that the centrally-run system was failing to tackle local outbreaks.The government announced on Monday that local and national teams would work together to make sure they reach as many people as possible who have been in contact with someone who has coronavirus. The change means that the number of national contact tracers will be reduced from 18,000 to 12,000 on 24 August.Currently, a national system is used to contact those who are at risk of having contracted the virus but the move means tracers will focus on specific areas and if they cannot make contact with a resident within a set period of time, local public health officials can use the data provided by NHS test and trace to follow up.Read the full report by Sarah Marsh and Josh Halliday here:Scientists have called for routine Covid testing of teachers and pupils alongside a robust test-and-trace system, amid a debate over how to safely reopen schools in England, Nicola Davis reports. On Sunday, the children’s commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said teachers and pupils should have weekly tests, but Nick Gibb, the schools minister, ruled out the idea, saying instead that those who are symptomatic should be tested.Now researchers behind a report from Delve, a multidisciplinary group convened by the Royal Society, have said routine testing will be necessary when the majority of children return to school.Dr Ines Hassan, a researcher in the global health governance programme at the University of Edinburgh and a lead author of the report, said the group were recommending the widespread and regular screening of all staff in schools, including those who are asymptomatic.Those planning on heading to Greece for a summer vacation will be greeted with a night curfew from Monday for restaurants and bars in some of its top tourist destinations after coronavirus infections hit a new high.A government spokeswoman also announced new entry restrictions for Balkan arrivals and passengers flying in from several EU countries.Health Minister Vassilis Kikilias said the infection curve was “rising dangerously.”Areas in which eateries and bars will be closed from midnight to 07:00 am include the popular islands of Mykonos, Santorini, Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Zakynthos and Kos, spokeswoman Aristotelia Peloni said in a televised address.Some of these destinations are known for late-night clubbing.The cities of Thessaloniki, Larissa, Volos and Katerini were also affected, as was the Halkidiki peninsula which is popular with Balkan visitors.The restrictions will be in place from Tuesday to August 23. In addition, all passengers on flights from Belgium, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Spain and Sweden arriving from August 17 must provide a negative COVID-19 result obtained up to 72 hours before entry, as must all land border arrivals.And only 750 people will be allowed in daily from Albania as of August 16, The UK has recorded a further eight coronavirus deaths, according to today’s update on the government’s coronavirus data dashboard. The official headline total for deaths is now 46,574.This is a Public Health England figure for the UK as a whole.The PHE figure is suspect because it includes people in England who tested positive for coronavirus and died - even if they died of something else.But the main problem with the headline total is that it is an underestimate because it does not include people who died from coronavirus without testing positive. Edit: the dashboard is now saying 21 deaths bringing the total to 46,526.The TUC will hold its annual congress at its London conference centre over two days next month, it has been announced.A small invited group will be present in Congress House on September 14 and 15, while union members across Britain will join the event online.TUC20 will focus on the impact of coronavirus and what action is needed to protect jobs and livelihoods in the weeks and months ahead.The TUC general secretary, Frances O’Grady, and the Labour leader, Sir Keir Starmer, will deliver their keynote speeches in person.Other items on the agenda include demands for a pay rise for key workers, and debates on safe working, public services, the challenges facing parents and shielded workers and the impact of Covid-19 on BME workers. O’Grady said: Working people must not pay the price of the pandemic, and the government must act now to stop mass unemployment. Congress is our chance to come together and debate our priorities for the year ahead. We will hear from the leader of the opposition, from union general secretaries and from frontline and key workers.This year’s Congress has to be different, to keep us all safe. We are delighted to be able to welcome trade unionists and working people from across the UK to join Congress online.Away from coronavirus, there been reaction to the  exclusive that Downing Street is planning a controversial intervention to reverse the record decline in rape prosecutions by imposing targets on police and prosecutors.In a highly unusual move, the prime minister’s crime and justice taskforce is planning to set targets for police to refer more high-quality rape cases to the Crown Prosecution Service and for the CPS to prosecute and bring more rape cases to trial, the  reported this morning. The shadow attorney general, Lord Falconer has now put out a statement, explaining why political interference would compromise the CPS.The number of rape prosecutions has fallen dramatically over the last few years because the CPS unduly raised the bar for bringing cases to court. The CPS, not Downing Street, must decide in inidual cases who is prosecuted. Rape prosecutions in England and Wales are at their lowest ever, but they can increase without compromising CPS independence. More needs to be done to ensure that victims have faith that the criminal justice system will be there to support them throughout.Boris Johnson’s spokesman denied that a target would be imposed, my colleague Peter Walker reports. “No,” he said. “Quotas or numerical targets would undermine prosecutorial impartiality where cases are inidual by nature, and require a specific set of considerations in each instance.“We are determined to protect victims of and to give them the confidence that everything will be done to bring offenders to justice.“A review of the criminal justice response to rape and to sexual offences was commissioned in March last year by the National Criminal Justice Board. That review is due to report in the autumn, and I wouldn’t want to pre-empt its findings or recommendations.”Asked whether this timetable was too slow, the spokesman said: “I don’t think that is the case. We are determined to do everything that we can to ensure that these appalling crimes are tackled effectively and victims are supported, but it’s obviously very important that we do this in a way that is sensitive and gets this right.”One senior local health official, who did not want to speak on the record, said he interpreted the move as “the government saying we can’t do this only from London”.The work of two local authority chief executives who were seconded to the national test and trace system – Carolyn Wilkins of Oldham council, and previously Tom Riordan of Leeds council – is said to have “definitively swung the balance” towards local leaders in recent weeks.Directors of public health were expressing increasing frustration with the centrally-run national system before the shift in approach. One said:If you look on a map, it’s really clear: there’s probably one case a week in Surrey. It’s not quite like that in Blackburn with Darwen, for instance.We’ve shifted from a single, universal pandemic across the whole country to a series of localised flare-ups. That’s why the nimbleness and ability to get on top of things at a local level really does matter.People who have been in contact with confirmed coronavirus cases may get a knock on their door if tracers are unable to reach them over the phone under plans to strengthen regional test and trace powers in England announced by health officials.In pilot schemes, this has meant that local authorities have been able to visit people at homes where national contact tracers have been unable to reach them. It comes after criticism that the national system was not tapping into local knowledge.Now, NHS Test and Trace will provide local authorities across England with a dedicated team of contact tracers for local areas.The government announced plans to strengthen regional contact tracing so more people can be reached. Dido Harding, the executive chair of NHS Test and Trace, said:NHS Test and Trace is one of the largest contact tracing and testing systems anywhere in the world, and was built rapidly, drawing on the UK’s existing health protection networks, to stop the spread of coronavirus.At the height of the pandemic, we ensured the system had extra capacity in place to cope with potential peaks in the virus.We have always been clear that NHS Test and Trace must be local by default and that we do not operate alone – we work with and through partners across the country.As we learn more about the spread of the disease, we are able to move to our planned next step and become even more effective in tackling the virus.After successful trials in a small number of local areas, I am very pleased to announce that we are now offering this integrated localised approach to all local authorities to ensure we can reach more people in their communities and stop the spread of Covid-19.At the launch of the “Time Out to Help Out” campaign to ensure workers still get paid when they are asked to self-isolate, Greater Manchester’s mayor, Andy Burnham, has said schools – particularly those in poorer areas – would be “exposed to the risk of real harm” if government doesn’t step in.If this issue is not fixed, we will not be reopening schools in the safest way that we possibly can. We would be leaving a situation in place where people aren’t being supported to do their duty and self-isolate and consequently we will be allowing more of the virus to circulate in communities than should be.The reality is that it will be schools in some of the poorer communities that will be most at risk because of the higher number of people living in those communities in low-paid, precarious work.Frances O’Grady, the TUC general secretary, said schools were partly staffed by many low-paid workers in insecure often-outsourced contracts who, unless the government offers them support, will face “making that choice between doing the right thing by your community and your family taking a big hit financially”. That isn’t good for our public health. I hope the government will see sense and see this as a critical part of that schools reopening plan.And Liverpool’s mayor, Steve Rotheram, said a fortnight without pay “really could push many people into destitution, into arrears with rent, especially if they don’t qualify for the meagre pittance that is SSP or if they’re paid weekly”.A newly described disease that occurs in children and is linked to Covid-19 has caused significant changes in white blood cells, experts say.The discovery may allow doctors to better assess their young patients’ condition and predict their resistance to current treatments, a new study suggests.Paediatric inflammatory multi-system syndrome temporally associated with Sars-CoV-2 infection (Pims-TS) is a new disease which shares some features with Kawasaki disease, as well as toxic shock syndrome.Scientists looked at blood samples from children admitted with the diseases to Birmingham children’s hospital during the UK’s lockdown. They found large changes in the monocytes, a type of white blood cell, in patients with Pims-TS and Kawasaki disease, according to a pre-print which has not yet been peer-reviewed.The co-lead author Dr Graham Taylor, from the Institute of Immunology and Immunotherapy at the University of Birmingham, said:Our study is the first to reveal that Kawasaki’s disease and Pims-TS are both characterised by profound changes in the numbers of monocytes and their genetic make-up.Our results require confirmation in a larger patient cohort, but the changes we have observed are likely to be highly relevant, potentially allowing us to predict the disease resistance of children with Pims-TS and Kawasaki’s disease, as well as identifying alternative therapies for both diseases.A further six people who tested positive have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed reported deaths in hospitals to 29,419, NHS England has said.The patients were aged between 65 and 93 and all had known underlying health conditions. No deaths were reported with no positive Covid-19 test result.The region with the highest number of deaths was the south-east with four. There were also two deaths in the north-east and Yorkshire but all other regions of England recorded no deaths for the same time period, including the north-west, where local lockdown measures are in place around Greater Manchester, according to the official figures."},{"url":null,"title":"climate","story":"\u0026lsquoExtensive Irish commitment to data centres\u0026rsquo could cause cost to consumer, study findsBuyers may want to go green, but for those travelling long distances the range is smallReform needed to safeguard \u0026euro6bn income while promoting electric vehicles, economist warns"},{"url":null,"title":"heritage","story":"Michael Viney: The wayside ashes of the west stand as defiantly healthy emblems of their kindInidual ants are certainly not smart, but their group wisdom may exceed our ownMichael Viney: Irish numbers have more than doubled since the counts of Operation Seafarer in 1970Michael Viney: A predator denning in parks, gardens and wasteland gets mixed responsesA beefed-up, independent National Parks and Wildlife Service would be just the ticketMichael Viney: Wild grasses have loved the mood swings of our climate this yearAnother Life: As one of many of the world\u0026rsquos declining seabirds, puffins are now receiving much more necessary and serious attentionAnother Life: A new book on the founders of the Tyler Prize shows their political influenceAvian science journal Ibis reports \u0026lsquogreat conservation concern\u0026rsquo about the speciesAnother Life: Dairy farmer Bruce Thompson examines impact of worming drug on beetlesMichael Viney: Crumbling hilltop trig pillars\u0026rsquo played key role in the mapping of IrelandAntipodean flatworms pose risk to indigenous variety which could have severe knock-on effectsAnother Life: Some floaters circle territories and sneak the odd \u0026lsquoextra-pair copulation\u0026rsquoMichael Viney: Plant intelligence rests in the ways by which they solve their problemsA Life on Our Planet is a terrifying catalogue of our self-sabotaging transgressionsGreys carry squirrel-pox virus which is fatal to Ireland\u0026rsquos native redsAnother Life: The disappearance of this bird from cities has prompted much researchRobinson has followed Mair\u0026eacutead, his wife and collaborator, into the list of Covid-19 fatalitiesWill Covid-19 begin a resurgence of the 1970s withdrawal from growth-driven capitalism?Greater industry involvement required if bovine TB to be eliminated by 2030 targetMichael Viney: Camera traps are now used as a regular part of hare monitoring"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4326634.1597069670!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"ireland wildly unlikely to meet 7 carbon reduction goal mccarthy","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tEconomist Colm McCarthy: On the programme for government, he said it had a number of contradictions, notably the “mad idea” building of very expensive high-speed railways while at the same time decarbonising road transport over 15 years. Photograph: Brenda Fitzsimons  THE IRISH TIMES The notion that Ireland will achieve a 7 per cent reduction in Irish carbon emissions every year up to 2030 is “wildly unlikely”, according to the economist Colm McCarthy.As the country pursues various policies to try to control emissions, however, “various technologies will be developed at episodic pace” that will assist decarbonisation of the economy, he predicted.In the analysis, he also evaluates current emissions patterns future targets and whether they will be achieved in the period up to 2030 – and carbon tax impacts.He stressed, however, there were no technology constraints and the electric car market will become competitive as soon as EVs are being made “by the million, at a €20,000 price point”.His report was commissioned by the Irish Car Carbon Reduction Alliance, made up by a majority of Irish motor dealers, who accept the need for zero-emission vehicles but are seeking a different approach to a government ban on petrol and diesel cars by 2030, that allows for purchase of carbon-efficient fossil-fuelled cars up to 2040, as agreed by the EU.On the programme for government, Mr McCarthy said it had a number of contradictions, notably the “mad idea” building of very expensive high-speed railways while at the same time decarbonising road transport over 15 years.In analysing the 2019 Climate Action Plan (CAP) in the broader context in which policy on the taxation of transport must be enshrined, he said it was clear the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which covers how heavy industry and power generators account for their emissions, was “a disaster, especially for Ireland”. Industry and energy lobby groups gained permits which allow emissions without penalty. Instead, Europe should have gone the carbon tax route “and increased it every year for the next 50 years”. He said economists like himself have been whingeing about this for years. In the meantime, a litre of jet kerosene was 60 cents at Dublin Airport and untaxed, a litre of diesel was €1.30 at a nearby filling station – while marine diesel was untaxed.Irish emissions are mainly outside the ETS, which relates to emissions from power generation and heavy industry, to a greater degree than in other EU countries, McCarthy notes. This imposes a differential adjustment obligation, since non-ETS targets must be attained entirely through national policy measures. Ireland’s targets are affected greatly by the measurement system, which counts emissions from agriculture on a production basis. “Most other emissions, for example fuel combustion in the road vehicle fleet, are counted on a consumption basis. This measurement issue is important since Ireland is a substantial net exporter of agricultural products,” he notes. From 2021 Ireland’s emissions from the non-ETS sector, a higher portion of the total than elsewhere in the EU, are required to decline substantially to 2030. This is especially problematic because an expanding agriculture is responsible for so much emissions, he finds. “Agriculture involves a potentially perverse attribution of responsibility for emission reduction and conflicts with both efficiency and fairness.”Any policy to restrict herd numbers in countries such as Ireland where output has risen significantly amounts to a reversal of milk quota abolition, he suggests “leading to a re-allocation back to the less efficient producers, for example a decline in Ireland encouraging increased output in Spain. ” Consumer taxes on products would reinforce the trend towards an efficient geographical distribution of European production, an objective of EU Common Agricultural Policy reforms, he notes.A steady increase on non-ETS emissions is projected, and would necessitate the purchase of costly carbon credits. ETS sector emissions are also expected to rise, he adds, despite ambitious plans for renewable energy in power generation.While Ireland will miss emission targets up to 2020, McCarthy concludes: “Since the 2020 excess will be reduced by the Covid downturn, the amount of allowances to be purchased by Ireland to cover past overshoots will be less than had been feared...though neither the quantity nor the price of allowances already purchased to cover the gap is publicly available.” Strong growth in the requirement for electricity network investment is driven largely by a 70 per cent target for the share of renewables in the generation mix and planned growth in facilitating data centres, McCarthy concludes.The capacity of the data centres “already here exceeds substantially any demand arising in Ireland, so the country has chosen to become an exporter of data management and hence of electricity, the main input”. It is not explained in the CAP why such a large proportion of Europe’s demand for data management has chosen Ireland, he says. “In the ordinary course of events it would be expected that northern European countries would enjoy a large share of data centre provision, since temperature control is more readily facilitated. “But the decisions to locate in Ireland on such an extraordinary scale (29 per cent of power demand is expected by Eirgrid to come from data centres within a few years) may also have their motivation in the failure to require full costs, including infrastructure costs, from the data centre companies.” Because of the large commitment to data centres, any curbs on the construction of wind farms and solar generation facilities could diminish the availability of low-carbon power to the non-ETS sector, and lead to non-compliance penalties for Ireland, and ultimately cost consumers. The current carbon charge in Ireland is €26 per tonne carbon. Climate campaigners have argued recent increases in the carbon charge have been too timid and there have been calls for a charge of €100 (and more) – since adopted in the programme for government. If petrol and diesel faced carbon charges at the €100 per tonne level adding about 15 cent to the retail price per litre, annual revenue would increase by up to €800 million. “If €100 per tonne is the ‘correct’ price for carbon, there is under-recovery of up to €800 million per annum,” he observes.Road use chargesMcCarthy comes down in favour of a combination of electronic road charges and congestion charges in urban area to replace fossil fuel taxes that are set to decline. These should not involve deployment of physical barriers as in London, (which leads to inefficient queuing) but avail of the fact that modern cars are “connected” and have GPS.“By accident, a whole lot of things have come together”, which are forcing the Government to consider proper congestion charges, he told The .The 11 tolls currently in existence are the closest approximation to a use-related charge in the Irish motor taxation system but generate only 5 per cent of revenues, “and not well designed”.Three are in Dublin and the remaining eight scattered randomly around the motorway network, “reflecting the involvement of private finance in the construction of many of the links rather than the more coherent scheme in France”. “The biggest money-spinner, the M50 in Dublin, is tolled at just a single point even though it is effectively the main street of the city. There has been political resistance to any revision to the M50 tolling scheme and it was clearly designed to recover construction cost rather than to manage congestion. The M50 was first designed as an outer bypass and has been overtaken by the urban sprawl to the west of Dublin,” he says.The only tolled facility which has time-of-day charging is the Dublin Port Tunnel, where private cars pay €3, on a tidal-flow basis inbound or outbound, in the off-peak and €10 at weekday peaks. Trucks and buses go free on the East Link but must pay at all 10 of the other tolling points. McCarthy’s analysis highlights the arbitrary “system” of tolling: “There are very few tolling points. Large parts of the country have none and all tolls can be avoided through the selection of un-tolled alternatives, depriving by-passed towns of relief from congestion by heavy trucks in several cases.”Anomalies include: “...buses go free on the Dublin Port Tunnel but not on the M50. The tunnels in Dublin and Limerick are tolled but the Lee Tunnel in Cork is free”.Brenda Fitzsimons takes a look at the recent flooding from an Irish Air Corps helicopter"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Eight results were returned negative.However, some preschool children in another pod at the creche are still waiting for results.The creche’s chief executive, Marie Daly, confirmed on Monday morning that the three siblings had tested positive.“I have closed another room at the facility, and the parents of children in all other rooms which remain open have been informed of developments,” she said.“We have followed all guidelines and advice given to us from all the relevant bodies.“Eleven children have been tested so far, and three siblings have proved positive for Covid-19. None of them are showing any symptoms of the virus.“The results of seven staff have been returned as negative, and there are about seven children to be tested in the coming days.”Response measuresChildren at the facility have been split into pods of up to eight, with two staff members in each as part of Covid-19 response measures.Two rooms were closed immediately after one member of staff tested positive last week. Another staff member in another room who was tested as a precaution was also positive. Neither of the staff who tested positive had been in contact with each other either in or outside of work.The second room had been closed due to a staff member who had been “floating” between two pods in the two rooms.The third room was closed on Monday morning due to the latest developments.The results were described by Ms Daly as “extremely devastating” after an investment of €10,000 in protective personal equipment and other Covid-19 measures at the facility.“We have done everything we can to try and stop this virus coming into this building, and the worrying thing is that all the children who contracted the virus are asymptomatic.“Everyone is worried but the parents and preschool inspectors have been extremely supportive to us.“We really are all in this together.

Local firm Carroll’s Cuisine has confirmed nine positive tests for the disease and said 210 other employees had been tested on Sunday.  Photograph: Collins. Carroll’s Cuisine has suspended operations at its meat plant in Co Offaly until further HSE test results on its workers are returned. The decision on Monday afternoon now means all four plants where outbreaks have occurred are temporarily closed. Earlier indications that Carroll’s Cuisine had planned to remain open prompted calls from Minister of State Seán Fleming for the State to take action if the company “doesn’t do the right thing”.The company had said on Sunday that it would remain open but was being “constantly vigilant.” In a statement at 3pm on Monday, it said it had decided to suspend operations to support measures by the public health services to prevent the spread of Coronavirus in the community. “We have been working closely and co-operatively with the HSE and, while positive case levels among our staff are low, we believe that the best approach is to take this break in operations over the days ahead until we can evaluate the results of comprehensive tests which were undertaken for our staff on a precautionary basis yesterday in co-operation with the HSE,” the company’s chief executive Kieran Carolan said. Independent testing carried out at the facility last week revealed nine cases of the virus from 330 workers, an infection rate of 2.4 per cent. Those workers are now in isolation and are still being paid. “We note that a number of Government and health service sources have said factories should close wherever there are any cases of Covid,” Mr Carolan said. “However, it’s essential that while closures may be envisaged, the industry will need to continue in operation to supply food and facilities will need to reopen once any particular situation is contained and brought under control. Clear guidance is required on the measures, procedures and roadmap envisaged by the Government in this regard.”The company has also said it supports the proposal for a 14 day recurring testing programme for the meat sector. Asked about Mr Fleming’s comments on Monday, Tánaiste Leo Varadkar said the closure of meat plants or otherwise would be a decision for local public health authorities. “I don’t really think it’s helpful for inidual politicians to be falling over each other to tell people to close their businesses, or tell people what to do or what not to do,” he said. “The decisions have to be led by those people who are experts in the field.”Siptu and the meat industry are to contact the health service about putting in place improvements to the Covid-19 testing system for staff in the meat processing sector.Following talks with the trade union on Monday, Meat Industry Ireland is to bring a proposed charter for the sector, which was put forward by Siptu and includes new arrangements on pay, conditions and sick leave, to its members. Further talks are expected to take place in the next two or three weeks.Siptu organiser Greg Ennis said there had been “robust and frank discussions” with representatives of the processing sector on Monday.It is understood that the union and the industry agreed to directly contact the HSE to discuss improvements to the Covid-19 testing system including the provision of quicker tests and faster access to results to ensure the continuity of production and the safety of workers.‘Culture of blame’Mr Varadkar said it was important not to engender a “culture of blame” regarding outbreaks of the disease. “We don’t want people to be afraid to report their symptoms or to say that they may be infected. We don’t want businesses to be afraid, if they’ve a cluster we want to know about it so we can act,” he said. “It’s important we know the facts and understand the facts before we start finger pointing, and I do know that the meat industry has done a huge amount in the past couple of months, had no cases for a prolonged period and now there’s been an outbreak in a number of plants.” Three other factories in the midlands have closed following the discovery of clusters of Covid-19 among staff. The spread of the virus in the region has led to local movement restrictions being introduced in counties Kildare, Offaly and Laois. Kildare Chilling in Kildare town, which has registered 150 cases, and O’Brien Fine Foods in Timahoe, with 86 cases, have suspended production, while Irish Dog Foods in Naas, where 53 cases have been reported, has delayed plans to reopen. Some 210 employees at the Carroll’s meat plant in Tullamore were tested on Sunday for coronavirus as part of two testing programmes carried out at the factory in the last week. An earlier statement from the company said its “own specific situation has not escalated further” but that they were “doubling and redoubling our efforts to stop any spread of the virus and staying constantly vigilant” and keeping the situation under review on “an hourly and day by day basis”. The plant is also undergoing a deep-clean, it said.Recurring testingThe company welcomed proposals for 14 day recurring testing within the meat sector and said it would fully participate in any such initiative. An outbreak team is currently working to assess measures needed at the Carroll plant.Mr Varadkar, the Minister for Business, was speaking at a shoe shop on Dublin’s Grafton Street to mark the launch of a “restart grant plus” that will see grants of up to €25,000 offered to businesses to help with costs associated with reopening and adapting their premises.He said applications were now open, with a target time for decisions by local authorities administering the scheme of two weeks. Mr Varadkar said he would meet with chambers of commerce in the affected counties this afternoon, “and I’m happy to hear from them about perhaps additional things we can do that are specific to these three counties and that would set a precedent of course for future local lockdowns that might happen in other places as well.”He said that the existing schemes for business support, however, were “already calibrated to help those businesses that need it the most”.

Similar to the regulations requiring people to wear face masks on public transport, those in breach of the rules can be fined up to €2,500 or face six months imprisonment. The move to make face coverings mandatory in shops and other retail outlets was announced three weeks ago, with regulations enforcing the measures coming into effect from today. The regulations apply to shops, supermarkets, shopping centres, retail outlets, hairdressers, nail bars, museums, libraries, and cinemas. The requirement does not extend to restaurants, bars, cafes, or post offices, credit unions and banks. Premises providing healthcare services such as opticians or dentists are also exempt. Children under 13 years of age are exempt from the regulations, as are people who cannot wear face coverings due to a physical or mental illness. All retail staff will be required to wear face coverings at work, unless they are separated from customers by a partition, or can maintain a 2m distance at all times. In the initial months of the coronavirus pandemic public health officials played down the usefulness of face masks, however they introduced the mandatory measures as the country began to reopen from lockdown. Officials had feared the use of masks would lead to a slippage in compliance with other measures, such as frequent hand washing and social distancing, which are more effective in preventing the spread of Covid-19. Disposable face coverings should not be worn more than once, and reusable cloth masks should be washed after use at 60 degrees.Minister for Justice Helen McEntee has said if an inidual remains inside a shop or other outlet without a mask, the owner or staff would engage with them in the first instance. Only as a “last resort” would gardaí be called to deal with the matter, she said. Ms McEntee said gardaí had only been required to be called in a small number of cases where people refused to wear face coverings on public transport. The regulations around face coverings in shops come into force as the number of coronavirus cases has increased over the last week, in part due to several large outbreaks in food processing plants.

File photograph: iStockThe weekly cost of accommodating a person in a publicly-run nursing home under the “Fair Deal scheme is over 60 per cent higher than in a private facility, a new report by the Comptroller and Auditor General has found.The special report published on Monday also revealed that residents in private nursing homes were more likely to incur charges for additional services than those in the public system.The Comptroller’s report also recommends changes to the HSE’s approach in a number of cases to dealing with the contribution of residents to the cost of their care under the scheme.The Comptroller’s report says by 2018 the “Fair Deal” scheme was supporting more than 23,000 people with the cost of their nursing home care. The HSE paid out €969 million with an additional €343 million provided to nursing homes in 2018 in the form of residents’ contributions. There are about 550 nursing homes covered by the scheme with about 80 per cent in the private and voluntary sector.“In 2018, the average charge rate for public nursing homes was €1,564 a week. The agreed average maximum price chargeable for private or voluntary homes was €968 a week. The difference was 62 per cent. However, because the methods used to determine the weekly rates are different for each sector, a meaningful comparison of the charge rates is difficult.”The Comptroller’s report says the HSE has maintained the higher average weekly charge rate for public homes is attributed to a range of factors such as* better pay and conditions for staff in public nursing homes, including theimplementation of national pay awards* higher staff-to-resident ratios in public nursing homes* a higher proportion of maximum dependency residents* higher costs associated with older buildings used as nursing homes, which typically were not purpose-built for long-term residential care* some public nursing homes located in rural or isolated areas may not beHowever, the report says the HSE has not undertaken formal analysis of these cost drivers.Nursing Homes Ireland said on Monday that the report highlights ”a scheme that requires urgent reform and is inherently unfair for private and voluntary nursing homes”.The Comptroller’s report says that both public and private nursing homes provide a range of goods and services not covered by the scheme such as access to social programmes or transportation to appointments.The Comptroller’s team carried out a review of 12 contracts with residents, six in the public system and six in the privatevoluntary system.The report says, for example, in five of the six privatevoluntary sector contracts reviewed there were references to a change in fees if a resident’s dependency level changes.The sample study also found additional charges in the privatevoluntary sector for the provision of additional incontinence wear.“The HSE provides a supply of incontinence wear free of charge to eligible people both in the community and in residential settings (public and private). A clinical decision as to a person’s necessity for products, and a determination of the number of pads required per day is made, on a case-by-case basis, by a HSE continence advisor or public health nurse. It is HSE policy not to levy charges in cases when a resident of a public nursing home requires additional incontinence wear. In private nursing homes, the cost of required additional incontinence wear is typically passed on to the resident.”The report says that a person applying under the scheme is required to providedetails of their income and assets to the HSE together with supporting documentary evidence. However it says the HSE does not specify the nature of thedocumentary evidence required for many types of income and assets, or how recent that evidence should be.A sample study carried out found that the majority of applicants were receiving Department of Social Protection income supports .“For 41 of these cases, Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection (DEASP)system (Infosys) containing information on welfare payments made to iniduals, marital status and previous employment status, was available in the local HSE office. The examination found evidence that DEASP’s system had been checked by HSE staff in just under half of these cases.“A rate change in the State pension will impact the amount an inidual pays towards their cost of care. The examination found that following a rate change, each inidual’s contribution must be manually re-calculated by the HSE. Between 2015 and 2018, there have been three such pension rate changes. The examination team analysed information from the HSE’s IT system, as at February 2018, to determine whether pension rates had been adjusted accordingly and in a timely way. It was found that there were over 2,200 instances where rates of pension had not been adjusted and the contribution to care had therefore not been re-calculated. This represented about 10 per cent of the cases in payment at the time.”Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4324506.1596782289!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gove announces 650m brexit support package for the north","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMichael Gove visited Northern Ireland on Friday with Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis.

A new £650 million Brexit support and peace and reconciliation package for Northern Ireland was announced by British Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove who was visiting the North on Friday.The funding comprises £300 million of support for the European Union’s Peace Plus programme and £355 million to assist traders in the North deal with the complications of Brexit. Of the £355 million the package involves £200 million towards a new free-to-use Trader Support Service that will assist with import, safety and security declarations on behalf of traders.The other £155 million, according to Mr Gove’s office, will fund the development of new technology to ensure the new processes can be fully digital and streamlined.Mr Gove’s department said the “new service will be available to businesses bringing in goods from Great Britain or the rest of the world, providing guidance as well as dealing with their requirements for moving goods into Northern Ireland”. The £300 million confirmed by Mr Gove for the Peace Plus programme will help “to support peace, prosperity and reconciliation projects on the island of Ireland”.Mr Gove who, accompanied by Northern Secretary Brandon Lewis, was visiting Northern Ireland on Friday, said the £650 million investment underlined the British government’s “absolute commitment to the people and businesses of Northern Ireland as we move towards the end of the transition period”.“Our new free-to-use Trader Support Service will provide vital support and guidance to traders, while our £300 million investment in reconciliation projects will help to preserve the huge gains from the peace process and the Belfast Agreement,” he said. “As we continue to engage with businesses, and our discussions with the EU proceed, we will update these resources to ensure that traders are ready for the end of the transition period,” added Mr Gove.Mr Lewis said the Trader Support Service “will ensure that businesses of all sizes can have import processes dealt with on their behalf, at no cost”."},{"url":null,"title":"asia","story":"Maria Ressa\u0026rsquos news organisation Rappler is a buffer against dictatorship in PhilippinesLai has been a prominent democracy activist and an ardent critic of BeijingAuthorities warn against complacency as other countries battle a resurgenceCrack in hull of Japanese-owned ship is spilling oil into country\u0026rsquos famed blue lagoonsAttitudes still shaped by legacy code of conduct that dictates women must be submissive and patientAircraft with 190 passengers and crew on board overshoots runway in heavy rain in CalicutAbe avoids reference to nuclear treaty during scaled-back ceremony due to coronavirus\u0026lsquoWhat frightened me the most was how we got used to the piles of dead bodies\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash survivorIndia\u0026rsquos supreme court handed site to Hindus last year in culmination of complex disputeChina says attempts by Washington to engage more closely with Taipei \u0026lsquodoomed to fail\u0026rsquoCountry\u0026rsquos move closer to China set to be confirmed after unusually subdued pollThree men stuck on tiny Pikelot Island after boat ran out of fuel spotted by military aircraftAustralian state to deploy military, impose hefty fines to enforce Covid-19 isolationNorth Korea subject to UN sanctions since 2006 over nuclear and ballistic missile programsAt least 29 killed in terror group\u0026rsquos assault on prison in eastern city of JalalabadPolice officers and government officials suspended following deaths in Punjab stateInfections surge in Latin America while China reports highest total since MarchPro-democracy opposition, which was seeking a majority, says move politically motivatedCountry records first Covid death after finding virus lurking in tourist city of DanangInternational lawmakers condemn move as \u0026lsquounacceptable obstructions of democratic process\u0026rsquoStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"middle","story":"Prime minister Hassan Diab says blast that killed at least 163 was result of endemic corruptionResignation of government could enable international donors to sideline corrupt administrationPolice fire tear gas near parliament as donors pledge \u0026lsquomajor resources\u0026rsquo after explosionPort officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarersTwenty-five years after the Balkan conflict\u0026rsquos worst atrocity the Bosnian town remains idedDemonstrations stretch far beyond prime minister\u0026rsquos official residence in Jerusalem\u0026lsquoWe have no trust in our government . . .

Photograph: Wael HamzaEPALebanon’s prime minister announced his government’s resignation on Monday, saying the huge explosion that devastated the capital and stirred public outrage was the result of endemic corruption.Last Tuesday’s explosion at a port warehouse in Beirut of more than 2,000 tonnes of ammonium nitrate killed at least 163 people, injured more than 6,000 and destroyed swathes of the city, compounding months of political and economic meltdown.In a televised address, prime minister Hassan Diab said he backed calls by ordinary Lebanese for those responsible for “this crime” to be put on trial.Mr Diab made the announcement after the cabinet, formed in January with the backing of the powerful Iranian-backed Hizbullah group and its allies, met on Monday, with many ministers wanting to resign, according to ministerial and political sources.Mr Diab said on Saturday he would request early parliamentary elections.Demonstrations broke out again in central Beirut, with some protesters hurling rocks at security forces guarding an entrance leading to the parliament building, who responded with tear gas.“The entire regime needs to change. It will make no difference if there is a new government,” Joe Haddad, an engineer, told Reuters. “We need quick elections.”For many ordinary Lebanese, the explosion was the last straw in a protracted crisis over the collapse of the economy, corruption, waste and dysfunctional governance, and they have taken to the streets demanding root-and-branch change.The information and environment ministers quit on Sunday as well as several members of parliament, and the justice minister followed them out the door on Monday.Lebanon’s president had previously said explosive material was stored unsafely for years at the port. He later said the investigation would consider whether the cause was external interference as well as negligence or an accident.The Lebanese army said on Monday that another five bodies were pulled from the rubble, raising the death toll to 163. Search and rescue operations continued.The cabinet decided to refer the investigation of the blast to the judicial council, the highest legal authority whose rulings cannot be appealed, a ministerial source and state news agency NNA said. The council usually handles top security cases.Anti-government protests in the past two days have been the biggest since October, when angry demonstrations spread over an economic crisis rooted in pervasive graft, mismanagement and high-level unaccountability.An international donor conference on Sunday raised pledges worth nearly €253 million ($298m) for immediate humanitarian relief, but foreign countries are demanding transparency over how the aid is used.Some in Lebanon doubt change is possible in a country where sectarian politicians have dominated since the 1975-90 conflict.“It won’t work, it’s just the same people. It’s a mafia,” said Antoinette Baaklini, an employee of an electricity company that was demolished in the blast. – ReutersStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4325908.1596986511!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"murky world of international shipping behind explosion in beirut","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tThe vessel Rhosus. According to Lebanese  reports, officials are investigating whether the  recent major blast in Beirut was caused by  ammonium-nitrate that allegedly originated from the  vessel.  Photograph: EPATony VrailasHidden behind the tragedy of Tuesday’s deadly explosion in Beirut is the more pervasive travesty of the abandonment of ships, seafarers and cargo, and unless the global public reckons with this deeper problem a next disaster is all but inevitable.While Lebanese investigators say that nearby fireworks likely ignited the 2,750 tons of explosive ammonium-nitrate, the true causes of this explosion stem from slower-moving and less dramatic factors: anaemic enforcement by shady flag registries that are supposed to hold shipowners accountable, tightened immigration controls that routinely trap stranded crews on decrepit ships, lax rules and a maritime bureaucracy designed more to protect anonymity and secrecy of ship owners than to enable oversight and transparency of the industry.These are the factors that make it so easy for vessel owners and operators to walk away from their responsibilities usually with impunity, and sometimes with life-or-death consequences for the crew that gets left behind.The broader story begins on the barely-seaworthy, Russian-owned ship flagged to Moldova called the Rhosus that in 2013 was transporting tons of the volatile and odourless crystalline substance when Lebanese port authorities deemed the vessel unsafe to continue its journey.Refusing to answer urgent calls from the crew or port authorities, the ship’s owner, a Russian man named Igor Grechushkin, was soon confronted with heavy fines, including roughly $100,000 in back wages and port fees. In response Grechushkin did what many shipowners do. He cut his losses, declared bankruptcy, and quietly disappeared, abandoning his workers, the dilapidated ship and its deadly cargo.That Grechushkin could disavow his duties so easily is a consequence of the labyrinthine elements of maritime law and administration, and the distinctly transient and trans-national nature of the industry. Lebanese authorities were hard pressed to arrest Grechushkin or seize his property since he lived not in Lebanon but in Cyprus, and his shipping company, Teto Shipping Ltd, was registered on the Marshall Islands.No moneyMeanwhile, the men left onboard the Rhosus found themselves in a bind that is surprisingly common for seafarers around the world. Lacking clean water, fuel, or food, not to mention phone service, legal help or the ability to speak the local language, these men had no money to get home nor even the immigration papers allowing them to disembark.While warning anyone who would listen about the dangers of the Rhosus’s cargo, several of the stranded crew waited a full year before they were able to go home with help from the International Transport Workers’ Federation (ITF), which is the largest global seafarers union.On any given day hundreds of ships and thousands of seafarers are in the same situation. Port officials like those in Beirut have little power to repatriate abandoned crews or ships when they are left behind. Usually cargo gets sent to its rightful owner because it travels with insurance, but the men who work on board are rarely as lucky.A database created by the ITF and international labour section of the UN indicates that nearly 5,000 seafarers were abandoned on their vessels in nearly 400 separate incidents between 2004 and 2018. Over the past six years while reporting on crimes at sea, I’ve stumbled across hundreds of these dire predicaments.Take for instance the 16 men stuck on the Zoya 1, a supertanker that in April 2018 had been trapped off the coast of the UAE for more than a year and were owed more than four months’ salary. Languishing on board a ship overrun with vermin, the men slowly fell apart, physically and mentally. Unable to disembark, several of the men who were unable to swim tried to take their own lives by jumping overboard. In a photo taken at the time, crew members held signs that said, “We are helpless. We did not commit any crime.” The crew was repatriated in June 2018.Covid-19 has made matters worse, stranding roughly 400,000 mariners at sea and in ports. “The ITF has been receiving emails from hundreds of seafarers daily, expressing their concern about contracts being extended under duress,” said Stephen Cotton, general secretary of the ITF.In the port of Beirut, for example, not far from the warehouse that exploded, an oil tanker called the Captain Nagdaliyev was abandoned with 13 seafarers on board. Stuck for nearly a year, these men have been without wages, water or food, and they barely escaped with their lives when the warehouse blew apart sections of their ship.Even when crews make it home, their cargo presents risks. Case in point: the full oil tanker called the FSO Safer, which was abandoned in one of the world’s busiest shipping routes last year along the coast of Yemen. Hit by a rocket-propelled grenade, this floating bomb could cause massive environmental damage, impede marine traffic and kill hundreds, according to marine safety experts.Similarly, environmentalists and union officials have warned of a possible disaster tied to an abandoned ship 21km off the coast of the Philippines in Manila Bay. A crew of 15 have been stuck on the Spanish tanker MV Celanova since February 2nd. Loaded with liquid petroleum gas, the tanker lacks enough fuel to keep the cargo refrigerated and port officials warn there is imminent risk of fire.Strict rulesInternationally there are strict rules mandating that ammonium-nitrate should not be stored near fuels or sources of heat. In the US regulations over ammonium-nitrate were tightened significantly after the Oklahoma City bombing of a federal building in which 168 people died.There is no shortage of blame to share for what happened in Beirut. Local corruption and ineptitude within the Lebanese government likely played a role. Customs authorities repeatedly tried to get permission from local judges to allow them to seize so they could export the ammonium-nitrate or to hand it over to the Lebanese army rather than store it dangerously in the port warehouse. Their urgent letters went unanswered for years.Port officials globally have a tough time preventing the abandonment of ships or seafarers partly because of the opaque way that the shipping industry polices itself. For centuries the world’s merchant fleets flew the flag of the country of their home port. That country was responsible for ensuring the proper treatment of the crew and safety of the vessel. This began to change in the early 20th century with the emergence of “open registries”, also called “flags of convenience”.The company collecting fees for the right to fly a certain flag is also responsible for policing its customers, ensuring they abide by safety, labour, and environmental rules, and conducting investigations when things go wrong. But in practice flags of convenience create a perverse incentive for ship operators to shop around for the most lax registries with the lowest prices and fewest regulations.The Rhosus, for instance, was flagged to Moldova, which at least since 2013 has been on a black list that is run by Paris MoU, an international naval organisation that monitors and regulates maritime traffic in European waters. The organisation labelled Moldovan-flagged ships as “medium to high risk” due to the number of times their ships have been inspected or detained in the past three years.Crimes of neglectThe media is also complicit. Dramatic disasters such as the deadly Beirut explosion reflect acute problems and typically grab press attention. Slow-motion tragedies and bureaucratic crimes of neglect such as those that preceded the Beirut explosion rarely get covered, even though the ruinous impact is often as severe.When abandoned seafarers do make it home they usually face crushing debt due to the unpaid wages and the money they borrowed to get this job at sea. Their maritime licences expired, they are often also blacklisted by the local employment agencies that control access to jobs.In 2017, partly motivated by bad press and union pressure, the shipping industry came together in an unprecedented fashion and tried to confront the tendency to abandon seafarers. The industry imposed a new rule requiring shipowners to carry insurance to cover the costs of sailors marooned in port. Unfortunately most of the smaller and older vessels that are most likely to strand mariners are not, under this new rule, the ones required to carry such insurance.Ian Urbina, a former investigative reporter for the New York Times, is the director of the Outlaw Ocean Project, a non-profit journalism organisation based in Washington DC that focuses on reporting about environmental and human rights crimes at seaStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"lockdown supporters cannot bear thought sweden has got right","story":"Sweden has fulfilled the same role during the Covid-19 crisis as Argentina fulfils in every World Cup. It’s the team which everyone – apart from the natives themselves, naturally – wants to get beaten. This has been especially true in the liberal US press, which has taken time off from berating Donald Trump to publish lengthy pieces on the supposed failure of the Swedish approach. “The Swedish government didn’t enforce social distancing,” began the Washington Monthly, for example, in May when Sweden briefly had the world’s highest death rate from the disease. “It’s now paying the price – in lives and GDP.”Even neighbouring Nordic countries – normally peas in a pod – have taken against Sweden. When Denmark and Norway re-opened their borders to the world they initially left out Sweden. Sweden’s chief epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell, who has acquired a rock star image among some of his countrymen, is seen as a maverick by many abroad.It’s not hard to see why politicians, officials and many others around the world need Sweden to fail and to fail spectacularly. If the Scandinavian country is not seen to suffer for its failure to lock down its population and close down much of its economy then citizens in other countries are going to start asking awkward questions.For a while it looked as if Sweden might well fail spectacularly. While other, locked-down countries saw their rates of new infection plummet and gradually unlocked, infections in Sweden remained stubbornly high. Economic projections suggested that Sweden was going to suffer a deep recession anyway. All those needless deaths, it seemed, and Swedes were still going to lose their jobs.Then came July, and a reminder that lockdown is no long-term solution to a pandemic. Infection rates began to creep up in countries which had locked down – first Spain, then Germany, France, Belgium. Some have been going to into selective second lockdowns. All they had really done by incarcerating their populations for weeks is sweep the virus under the carpet for another day. Sweden, by contrast, has as yet seen no second wave.Meanwhile, the Swedish economy has surprised on the upside. Last week, its economy was revealed to have shrunk by 8.6 per cent in the second quarter – cataclysmic by normal standards, of course, yet in the circumstances it counts as a triumph. GDP across the Eurozone shrank by 12 per cent, with Spain’s economy plunging by 18 per cent quarter on quarter. Britain’s GDP figures won’t be out until next Wednesday, but we will be doing very well if we don’t out-shrink Spain. At one point the Office of Budgetary Responsibility was penciling in a 35 per cent plunge for the UK in the second quarter.      There was no way that Sweden, with many of its neighbours’ economies closed, was going to escape without a sharp contraction. Volvo, for example, suffered a 38 per cent fall in sales as showrooms across Europe were closed. Nevertheless, there is an intriguing possibility that Sweden could be just about the only developed country to manage to get through the Covid-19 crisis without technically suffering a recession – defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth.Alone in Europe, it managed to grow its economy by 0.4 percent in the first quarter. One after another, Swedish companies have produced results which have exceeded expectations. There have been few bankruptcies. What’s more, having kept factories and other workplaces open throughout the crisis, the Swedes have an advantage in the recovery. They don’t have a workforce which has lost the habit of working, which enjoyed weeks off in the spring sunshine and is now reluctant to return.But was it worth all those deaths? The case against Sweden rests on comparisons with its neighbours, Denmark and Norway. On that basis, Sweden looks to have come off badly – its 571 deaths per million residents seems reckless compared with that of Denmark (106) or Norway (47). But then are Denmark and Norway the right comparators?Sweden has much more significant urban areas compared with Norway, and it has a high number people who take skiing holidays in the Alps – which seems to have been the seat, or one of the main seats, of Covid-19 in Europe. Significantly, Sweden has a lower death rate than many European countries which did go into full lockdown, such as Italy (582), Spain (610), the UK (683) and Belgium (850).But even if Sweden has suffered a relatively high number of deaths to date, that is not the end of the story. As John Giesecke, Sweden’s former chief epidemiologist and adviser to the World Health Organisation (WHO), argued in April we won’t really be able to judge how different countries have performed until the crisis has reached some kind of conclusion, either through a vaccine or the natural decline of the virus. His belief is that, eventually, comparable countries will have similar death rates, but the misery – both health and economic – will be spread out far longer in some than others.Were an effective vaccine to become available this autumn, then the suppression strategy proposed in Professor Neil Ferguson’s paper of March 16 and followed by most developed countries, will seem wise. But just how long are governments prepared to suppress their economies? The longer a vaccine takes to arrive – and there is no guarantee that a vaccine will ever be approved, even if early trials have been promising – then the more that the Swedish approach will seem appealing.The disappointing news from Sweden’s point of view is that antibody tests suggest that the country is still far from achieving herd immunity. The country’s Public Health Agency revealed in June that even in Stockholm, the worst-affected place in the country, only 10 percent of the population had antibodies – way short of the 60 to 80 percent which our own chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, suggested would be needed for herd immunity.Not all scientists are agreed on this, however. Last week, modelling in a yet-to-be published paper by an international group of scientists led by Gabriella Gomes of Strathclyde University claimed that the 60 percent is only applicable where herd immunity is gained through a vaccine programme given randomly to a population. If a virus is allowed to spread naturally, on the other hand, it will affect the more susceptible people first (people who either have fewer natural defences or who have more contacts).Once this group has been infected, the virus finds it much harder to spread and herd immunity will be reached at a much lower level – when between 10 and 20 percent of the population have been infected. If that is right, Sweden might be far closer to herd immunity than previously believed.      In the meantime, Sweden finds itself with unfamiliar friends and unfamiliar enemies. Thanks to its generous welfare policies it is more often a country praised on the left and condemned by economic liberals. Now it is now the other way around. Ultimately Sweden might just end up pleasing both groups – if, thanks to a less-damaged economy, it emerges as the only country able to avoid deep welfare cuts.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"metal detectorist unearths bronze age sword horse harness scottish","story":"A metal detectorist has discovered a hoard of Bronze Age artefacts in the Scottish Borders which experts have described as nationally significant.Mariusz Stepien, 44, was searching a field near Peebles with friends on June 21 when he found a bronze object buried half a metre underground.The group camped in the field and built a shelter to protect the find from the elements while archaeologists spent 22 days investigating.Among the items found were a complete horse harness - preserved by the soil - and a sword which have been dated as being from 1000 to 900 BC.Mr Stepien said: I thought I\u0027ve never seen anything like this before and felt from the very beginning that this might be something spectacular and I\u0027ve just discovered a big part of Scottish history.I was over the moon, actually shaking with happiness.We wanted to be a part of the excavation from the beginning to the end.I will never forget those 22 days spent in the field. Every day there were new objects coming out which changed the context of the find, every day we learned something new.I\u0027m so pleased that the earth revealed to me something that was hidden for more than 3000 years. I still can\u0027t believe it happened.As he was getting strong signals from the earth around the initial object, Mr Stepien contacted the Treasure Trove Unit to report his find.They also found decorated straps, buckles, rings, ornaments and chariot wheel axle caps.Evidence of a decorative rattle pendant from the harness was also discovered - the first one to be found in Scotland and only the third in the UK.The hoard has been moved from the site in a large block of soil and taken to the National Museums Collection Centre in Edinburgh.Emily Freeman, head of the Treasure Trove Unit overseeing the recovery and assessment of the find, said: This is a nationally significant find - so few Bronze Age hoards have been excavated in Scotland.It was an amazing opportunity for us to not only recover bronze artefacts, but organic material as well.There is still a lot of work to be done to assess the artefacts and understand why they were deposited.We could not have achieved this without the responsible actions of the finder or the support of the landowners.The finder was quick to action when they realised that they had found an in-situ hoard, which resulted in the Treasure Trove Unit and National Museums Scotland being on site within days of discovery.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"rise uk covid 19 cases better testing fuelling increase","story":"Fears of a fresh Covid-19 surge mounted this week as the UK saw its largest rise in new cases since the end of June - but data suggests the rise is being driven by more infections in younger people and increased testing. A total of 1,062 people tested positive for Covid in the 24 hours before 9am on Sunday - nearly a fortnight after Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned of the possibility of a \u0027second wave\u0027 of infections.But the rise appearing in the UK\u0027s daily case numbers may in part be due to more testing - as infection rates climb among younger people while community testing is ramped up . According to the latest surveillance data from Public Health England, the infection rate is rising among all age groups under 65, and falling in every age group above 65 - those most at risk.Among the 15 to 44 age bracket, the infection rate has risen by 35 per cent over the last five weeks.It now almost matches the rate of infection among the over 85s, who have been the most disproportionately affected and at risk group throughout the pandemic.It suggests the recent rise in cases is being driven by cases in younger people who may not have previously been picked up by the testing regime.In the week to August 2, the rate of infection among 15 to 44 year olds in England was 11.9 per 100,00 people - up 35 per cent from the week ending July 5 at 8.8 per 100,000.It has climbed back to roughly the same rate seen in mid-June, while the infection rate among the over 85s has dropped dramatically before levelling off.At the height of the pandemic, in the week to May 3, the infection rate was at 302 per 100,000 people among the over 85s, and 44.1 in the 15 to 44 age bracket.When accounting for tests, the proportion of new cases being detected under Pillar 1 of the testing regime - for those in clinical need and public health workers - have been falling for weeks.The average number of new cases per 1,000 tests in Pillar 1 has dropped from 12.6 in early June to 1.4 by August 6.In the same period the number of tests conducted under Pillar 1 has risen from 248,338 in the week to June 7 to 357,242 in the week to August 6 - indicating a significant drop in cases.Within Pillar 2 - tests conducted by commercial partners in drive-in centres and community testing - there has been a recent uptick in the rate of cases picked up.In the last two weeks the number of cases picked up per 1,000 tests in Pillar 2 has risen from 8.2 to 9.4.Over the last fortnight the number of weekly Pillar 2 tests has risen from 545,662 to 615,648, suggesting a corresponding rise in cases in the community.But the overall trend in Pillar 2 cases has been relatively static since early July, when accounting for tests conducted.Significantly more tests are now taking place across the UK, with over one million (1,091,904) conducted in the last week alone.That represents 14 per cent more than the average weekly number in July and over eight times more than the equivalent figure for April.The rise in new cases is not evenly spread across the country, and in many areas there has not been a corresponding rise in the positivity rate of tests conducted among those in clinical need.While the infection rate in London has doubled since mid June, from 3 cases per 100,000 people to 6, it has been accompanied by a 50 per cent reduction in positive Pillar 1 tests, while the proportion of Pillar 2 tests coming back positive has risen from 0.8 per cent to 1.2 per cent.In the North West, which has seen the infection rate climb from 9.6 to 17.4 in the space of a month, the positivity rate has risen from 0.8 to 1 per cent in Pillar 1, and 2.1 to 2.5 per cent in Pillar 2.Meanwhile, those who are hospitalised with Covid now have much better chances of survival.Deaths in intensive care units are at their lowest level since the pandemic began, according to data from the Intensive Care National Audit \u0026amp Research Centre, with just two deaths in the final week of July.Though there is a significant lag between spikes in new cases translating into increased deaths, data shows that the ratio of those dying from Covid-19 in ICUs compared to those being discharged has fallen, which could indicate hospitals are grappling with the most severe cases more effectively. During April approximately two patients were dying for every three discharged, while now one patient is dying for every three discharged.However, the data for more recent weeks represents just a fraction of the numbers of patients ICU\u0027s during the pandemic\u0027s peak - in the first week of April, 1,037 patients died from Covid-19 in critical care while 1,354 were discharged.By contrast, in the first week of July, 19 died while 31 were discharged.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"take covid 19 vaccine would","story":"So, will you be getting the coronavirus vaccine? If you’re feeling leery at the prospect of pumping a brand new concoction into your veins, you’re not alone.Research by King’s College and Ipsos Mori published last week found only 53 per cent of respondents said they would “definitely” get a jab, with 16 per cent saying they definitely would not. Those aren’t hugely positive numbers considering that at the outset of the pandemic the prospect of a vaccine seemed like a magic bullet, a way to move on from the nightmare of 2020 and pick up our lives roughly where we left off before a bat strayed into a market in Wuhan. Experts say we need at least seven in 10 people to be vaccinated to provide “herd immunity,” the benevolent status in which enough of a population has developed antibodies to a disease to significantly impede its transmission.The numbers are comparable to the United States, where a Gallup poll found only 65 per cent was determined to get a vaccine when one becomes available, while 35 per cent would decline. In France, considered among the most suspicious nations when it comes to vaccinations, a recent YouGov poll found that one in three would refuse a coronavirus vaccine.That’s concerning given that if there is a jab for Covid-19, it may well be that, like the flu shot, it will need to be given annually. So even if there is a huge drive to encourage sceptical populations to accept a vaccine, it is a process which may need to be repeated year after year, at a time when, if anything, hostility towards health experts is rising. Those most opposed to taking a vaccine tend to be wary of authority. Polls suggest they are reluctant mask users, likely to obtain information from friends and family via WhatsApp or Facebook rather than the mainstream media. Scientists understandably deplore this reticence to a theoretical vaccine, given the long hours they are putting in to truncate the usually protracted process of getting one into general use.Sometimes, as with attitudes to the anti-vax movement more generally, frustration at this antipathy towards science and logic can tip into derision.  After the Gallup poll was published in the US, a popular Tweet circulated which basically suggested that the one in three refusal rate showed that one in three Americans was stupid. But is it stupid, or ill-informed, or ignorant to be wary of becoming guinea pigs for a vaccine which will have been rushed to the market in record time? For all scientists are heroes in this battle with Covid-19, up there with the doctors and nurses and paramedics fighting to protect us from the worst of this truly awful disease, we can not automatically erase from our memories the times in the not so distant past when they got it catastrophically wrong.Most of us still shudder when we hear the word “Thalidomide”, the supposed wonder drug for morning sickness that left babies cruelly deformed. It was, perhaps, the start of the end for the “doctor knows best” culture, a trend exacerbated by a series of medical scandals which continue to the present day: the serial killer Harold Shipman the retention of children’s organs at Alder Hey contaminated blood vaginal mesh the apparently elevated level of baby deaths now coming to light in Shropshire.No wonder so many were ready to believe the disgraced doctor Andrew Wakefield with his pernicious claims – since entirely disproved – that the MMR jab could lead to autism.   Personally, despite all the risks, I am inclined to take the vaccine. The way I see it, the mass trials currently underway among tens of thousands of truly selfless volunteers mean the short-term side effects will be very well known by the time it is offered to me in, let’s hope, nine months to a year’s time.The long term consequences will necessarily remain unknown how can we tell if a vaccine is likely to lead to increased cancer or some other unpleasant condition in 10, 20 or 30 years until we reach that point? But it seems to me that we haven’t got the time to wait to find out, with the virus still out there, stealing our future and curtailing our present.On balance, I will be getting a vaccine. I very much hope you do too – but I don’t think you’re stupid if you don’t.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"tropical nights rise britain sees 16 evenings 20 degrees","story":"Tropical nights were once so uncommon in Britain that just eight were recorded in the 30 years between 1961 and 1995.Now, thanks to the heatwave, we have seen 16 such uncomfortably hot evenings this summer, with more forecast for this week.These hot nights, when the mercury does not drop below 20 degrees, were once so uncommon in Britain that they were not logged, but now a large proportion of our summer nights are spent tossing and turning, and this year looks likely to set a record.Climate change means that tropical nights are likely to continue to increase year on year, and become a regular part of our summers, meteorologists have warned. Data shows that the average number of tropical nights per year only became statistically significant after 1995. Now, there has been an unbroken run of at least 10 tropical nights per summer from 2011 to 2020.The highest minimum nightly temperature this year so far was 22.3 C at Langdon Bay, near Dover, on 8th August. On this date the temperature at nine sites in the UK didn’t drop below 20.0 C, which is the highest number of sites since 26 July 2019 when 20 stations didn’t drop below 20.0 C.Other tropical night hotspots in August include Luton, Bognor Regis, Hastings, the Isle of Wight, London, and Southampton.Grahame Madge, a Met Office spokesperson, told The : “Minimum daily temperatures of 20.0 C or above are still extremely rare events in the UK, but with a changing climate we can expect to see more incidents. Mostly it is weather stations in the south east of England which record these high temperatures, and there have only been three in Scotland since 1961 and none in Northern Ireland over the same period. However, as well as in increasing frequency of events we can also expect to see more occurrences outsides of the south east of England.“There is a huge interest from the public about daytime high temperatures. While this is important, tropical night temperatures can be extremely challenging for those with underlying health conditions as it means that when overnight temperatures remain high, it is very difficult to get any respite and rest before the next day’s heat begins to build.”The heat is set to end this week with torrential rainfall and thunderstorms, and the Environment Agency has warned of possible flooding. The worst affected areas are expected to be between Birmingham and Cumbria, with rainfall beginning in those areas at 4pm yesterday, although almost the whole of the UK is covered by a Met Office weather warning between now and Thursday evening.Met Office forecaster Craig Snell said: For England and Wales over the next four days, there is a risk of some very severe weather in places but it is not going to be everywhere.Away from the thunderstorms, it is still going to be very hot.It is not going to be wall-to-wall sunshine, but it is not going to be a washout each day.It follows an intense period of very hot weather which saw temperatures reach 34C at Herstmonceux in East Sussex on Sunday, the fourth consecutive day the thermometers passed 30C in the south of England - although there is every chance hot weather will remain, with temperatures of up to 36C possible across the south coast at the beginning part of the week.Caroline Douglass, flood duty manager with the Environment Agency, said heavy thunderstorms this week could lead to surface water and river flooding in some communities from Monday afternoon into Tuesday morning.She said: Isolated flooding is also possible more widely across England today through until Thursday due to further heavy thunderstorms.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2020/07/28/17/antonio-banderas-birthday.jpg","title":"antonio banderas coronavirus test positive covid 19 zorro","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.Spanish actor tweeted that he was spending his 60th birthday in quarantineActor Antonio Banderas has tested positive for coronavirus.The Spanish actor, who is best known for roles in The Mask of Zorro and Once Upon a Time in Mexico, tweeted that he was spending his 60th birthday today (10 August) in quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19.“Greetings to all,” Banderas wrote. “I want to make a public statement that today, 10 August, I’m forced to celebrate my 60th birthday in quarantine after having tested positive for the Covid-19 illness, caused by coronavirus.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“I would like to add that I am feeling relatively well, just a little more tired than usual, and I am confident I will recover as soon as possible following the doctor’s instructions, which I hope will allow me to overcome the infection that I and so many people around the world are suffering from.”Antonio Banderas interview: ‘Tarantino should be free to make his art’The actor explained that he would be using his time in isolation “to read, write, rest and to continue to make plans to give meaningfulness to my recently started 60th year, to which I have arrived filled with desire and enthusiasm.“A strong hug to everyone,” he signed off the post.Celebrities including Tom Hanks and Idris Elba have previously tested positive for and recovered from the virus.The best in film, music, TV \u0026amp radio straight to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

All money raised from the auction will go to The Independent’s appeal partner, The Felix Project, London’s largest food surplus distribution charity. Our campaign has so far raised £7.5m towards our £10m goal which includes a pledge to open London’s largest community kitchen to tackle food poverty.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHighlights from the Sotheby’s Help the Hungry auction include a drawing from Tracey Emin, a series of three etchings by Anish Kapoor, Mark Wallinger’s “Ghost”, and Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s “We Have Only Got Each Other” placard.British-Nigerian artist Yinka Shonibare also joins the catalogue with his “Unstructured Icons - Aristocrat I” alongside a pair of polished steel reliefs by Michael Craig-Martin and a floral plate by Chinese artist Ai Weiwei.   How to support our campaignSotheby’s senior director Oliver Barker said: “We are grateful to the artists who have generously contributed their works and we’re looking forward to channelling part of the excitement of our major sales in London this month into a cause which will provide food and comfort to the capital’s most vulnerable.”  Evgeny Lebedev, proprietor of The Independent, said: “We are delighted to be raising money with Sotheby’s and some of the world’s leading contemporary artists to help build London’s biggest community kitchen that will continue to feed those in need for years to come.”The Felix Project distributes nutritious food that would otherwise go to waste to 350 frontline charities, schools and holiday programmes in London.Founder Justin Byam Shaw said: “Although our food is surplus and donated to us and we have over 1,500 volunteers, our costs are still spiralling. “The coming unemployment crisis means we are in this for the long term. This new community kitchen will provide a high-quality meal for homeless Londoners, cooked by great chefs using surplus food.” Turner Prize-winning artist Mark Wallinger said: “I am delighted to contribute to help raise funds for The Felix Project, a fantastic charity that does such vital work in providing food for vulnerable people throughout London, work that is ever more necessary in our current crisis.”Sotheby’s Help The Hungry Auction will go live on 20 July and will run until 30 July.Help the hungry\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Swindon is now the fourth worst affected area in the UK when measured as a proportion of population, having seen a 200 per cent increase in new cases over the last seven days.It has nearly as many new cases per person as Leicester, which was the first place to see tougher local restrictions put in place after the nationwide lockdown lifted.The UK as a whole remains a long way off its peak levels from April and May, when daily new cases frequently reached above 5,000.Yet local spikes could see the recent upwards trend continue if not brought under control, as has been the case in other countries like France and Spain.Having endured a big surge in cases during the early stages of the pandemic, London has since seen its number of daily cases drop at an even greater rate than the rest of the country.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

At a time when Londoners from all walks of life are struggling due to the impact of coronavirus, the importance of love and care from others has been magnified tenfold.The phrase comes from a work made by the artist Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith – one of several fantastic lots in an auction kicking off today at sothebys to support The Independent’s Help the Hungry appeal.Over the past four months we have raised more than £7.5m for food redistribution charity The Felix Project – a cause for which we have pledged to raise £10m as well as to open central London’s largest community kitchen.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe auction is an opportunity to get your hands on works by some amazing artists – more likely to be seen on the walls of a museum than your living room. They can also be viewed at Sotheby’s, 34-35 New Bond Street.Ceramic has been a recurring motif for Ai Weiwei (a 1995 series of photographs showed him dropping a Han dynasty urn) and he has often used porcelain, for centuries a secret formula known only to Chinese makers. Flowers, too, are significant – when his passport was taken Ai put a bunch of fresh flowers in a bike basket outside his studio every day until he was able to travel freely. This small plate holds a great deal of meaning.Yinka Shonibare deconstructions of icons of western power couldn’t be more current. This elegant woodcut print, using vivid Batik textiles, transposes animal masks from Mali onto the faces of English aristocratic figures enriched off the back of colonisation and slavery. The patterns of textiles overlay the repeating patterns of power and show how history’s long fingers reach into our present.Unfailingly optimistic, Bob \u0026amp Roberta Smith’s work is always a call to care. He’s known for his colourful and impassioned but peaceful slogans (“Make Art Not War” seems like a good standard to live by) and his advocacy of art as a tool for education and understanding. We Have Only Got Each Other quotes his late mother, the artist Deirdre Borlase, spoken in response to the isions revealed during the Brexit campaign — but its universal meaning is clear.I’m a sucker for a good drawing – I’ve always felt that even at 500-odd years distance, it’s the form that brings you closest to an artist the sweep of a human hand that has just left the page. After many years of deeply mining her own emotions and experiences in her work, Emin is an artist at the height of her powers. Her raw, almost agonisingly expressive draughtsmanship gets me every time and this little sketch nails the feeling of having a really good cry.These three etchings – a supremely generous donation from Anish Kapoor, more usually known for the interactive theatricality of his large-scale sculptures – exude a quiet drama. Their simplicity belies their seductiveness velvety and intense, they draw you in, never quite revealing their secrets.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Wallinger was inspired by X-rays of Old Masters, which he thinks of as akin to spirit photography: “The revelation of the invisible, supernatural life of a painting.”A reminder of the pre-lockdown era, when we were able to wander the Hayward Gallery and bathe in the sea of pulsating colour that was Riley’s superb exhibition. This screenprint is from a series that vibrates right off the paper (Tate owns an edition of Elongated Triangles 5, so you’ll be in good company if you get your hands on this one).The essence of things is what Michael Craig-Martin seeks in his work, and colour is part of seducing the viewer to really look at the objects that make up our world. These sculptural reliefs in polished steel come from a series that pays homage to designers and architects whose vision has shaped what we think of as “modern”. You can’t sit on them, but look at them.

I have every right to be here.”Trudeau says Canada handled coronavirus pandemic better than USVandalism of cars with US license plates has occurred so frequently over the last few months that John Horgan, premier of British Columbia, has suggested drivers with those plates replace them with Canadian ones.Mr Horgan asked Canadian residents to “be calm. Be nice” but added: “With respect to those who have offshore plates and are feeling harassed, I would suggest perhaps public transit.“I would suggest that they get their plates changed.

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAs well as setting up enclosed play areas, the school has set up plastic screens around the students\u0027 desks and has marked out socially-distanced boxes on the floor for pupils to stand in.

Sam Khok school, which is located around 30 miles north of the Thai capital, asked its almost 5,000 students to self-isolate at home for 15 days returning for the new term, according to its headteacher. “Once students arrive at school, teachers hand face masks to them because it’s mandatory to wear them,” said Chuchart Thiengtham.The head teacher also added face shield were used by pupils for some activities.  The pictures from Wat Khlong Toey School in Bangkok came on the same day that the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that schools had to be safe before they could reopen. Director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said: We all want to see schools safely reopened but we also need to ensure that students, staff and faculty are safe. The foundation for this is adequate control of transmission at the community. My message is crystal clear: suppress, suppress, suppress the virus, he added.

Each year this involves around 200 hours of work promoting local events, encouraging tourism, and welcoming dignitaries to Christchurch.Over the years he has become a fixture of Christchurch, even acquiring his own page and rating on TripAdvisor, and often appears at civic events in the town.He told CNN he saw his role as being a provocateur, satirising the establishment. “Every day the world gets more serious, so fun is the most powerful thing in the world right now,” he said.Most of his time in Christchurch’s city squares is spent speaking on philosophy and engaging the public in his ideas on everything from climate change to the supposed inequities of New Zealand’s census.His journey into wizardry began when he was working at a university in Australia in the 1970s, when he began to try and inject more fun and absurdity into his classes. He found a mostly chilly reception from the university authorities and eventually his then-wife, who left him over his increasingly full-time commitment to being a wizard.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Before he was taken onto the council payroll, he was recognised by the country’s Art Gallery Director’s Association as a living work of art in the 1980s.The city of Auckland’s art gallery has even formally added him to their collection, citing the medium of his art as “artist’s corporeal presence” and its value as “priceless”. In 2009 to mark his place in Christchurch’s civic life he was awarded the Queen’s Service Medal.Although he has not legally changed his name, Mr Channell has secured both a British passport and a New Zealand driver’s licence, both made out in the name of The Wizard.His website even features a photograph of a letter he says he received from the Prime Minister of New Zealand in 1990 asking him to become “the Wizard of New Zealand, Antarctica and relevant offshore areas”, adding “no doubt there will be implications in the area of spells, blessings, curses, and other supernatural matters that are beyond the competence of mere Prime Ministers”.Mr Channell, who is now aged 87, is beginning to wind down his duties as the city’s wizard but for the last six years has taken on an apprentice, Ari Freeman, who hopes to inherit the mantle one day.Mr Freeman, a 39-year-old musician who leads a psychedelic funk band, is not sure if the council will employ him under the same terms as Mr Channell when he finally hangs up his wizard’s hat and staff.“I want the wizard phenomenon to continue, and I will totally fulfil that role,” he told CNN. “”It takes someone to do something unusual to poke their head in to create a zeitgeist change. And those people are magicians.”Lord of the Rings\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

In Minsk, which saw the worst violence, water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets were deployed against protesters. In two instances, a police van drove into crowds. At least four people ended up in intensive care, with one man reportedly in critical condition. In other cities across the country, officers reportedly laid down arms and crossed to the side of protesters. Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe unity opposition candidate Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, who claimed victory in the face of the scarcely credible 9.9 per cent assigned to her by the official preliminary results, called on police and army officers to stop the violence. “I want to ask them to remember that they are part of the nation too,” she said. Hours before voting ended, Belarus had all but declared a state of emergency. Footage of soldiers and military equipment entering the capital was widely shared by locals.By 6pm local time (3pm GMT), most of the capital’s central squares and government buildings had been cordoned off. Transport systems were shut down. Roads in and out of the capital were also closed. The regime’s obvious nervousness extended to widespread efforts to control the internet. Major disruptions to mobile networks were reported from the morning, with connections practically grinding to a halt at around 10pm local time. Proxy servers, used widely in these parts to get around censorship, became unreliable.Belarus’s upcoming election spells out two very different futuresUnidentified forces want ‘massacre’ in Belarus, says LukashenkoBelarus charges opposition politicians with assisting Russian plotJournalists and other independent observers appeared to be a target. At around 2pm local time, three reporters from the Russian liberal outlet TV Dozhd were handcuffed, held to the ground, and arrested. Just before midnight, AP photographer Mstyslav Chernov was admitted to hospital with suspected concussion after being beaten by riot police while in their custody. Sunday’s events came at the end of an unexpectedly panicked campaign for Belarus’s longtime leader – one that saw opposition candidates jailed, protesters snatched from the streets, the president claim a scarcely believable Russian-backed plot, and where the opposition candidate was forced into hiding on the eve of voting.Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, 37, was never supposed to mount a serious challenge, only entering the race after President Lukashenko jailed her husband, and presidential hopeful, Sergei Tikhanovsky. Famously dismissive of women in politics, Mr Lukashenko seemed to believe the housewife and former translator didn’t have a chance.

Few expected Ms Tikhanovskaya to reach an agreement with the campaign teams of other banned opposition candidates – but she managed to do so in just 15 minutes. Few believed she could lead a clear campaign – but she did so with simple promises to deliver fresh elections, walk back authoritarian changes to the constitution, and free political prisoners.Flanked by Veronika Tsepkalo, the wife of Valery Tsepkalo, another barred candidate, and Maria Kolesnikova, campaign manager for jailed Viktor Barbariko, Ms Tikhanovskaya’s opposition campaign took on unmistakably feminist, modern slant. It also brought over 200,000 people to the streets in support – an astonishing achievement in Belarus, a police state of just 9 million people, and where dissent often leads to jail.Underestimating Ms Tikhanovskaya was not the only mistake the usually clever and adroit Mr Lukashenko made in the run-up to the elections. His electoral rating was hit hard by a perceived cavalier approach to the Covid-19 epidemic: he claimed the virus was avoidable with vodka, trips to the sauna and work in the potato fields. His management of the country’s increasingly desperate economic position – and its rapidly unwinding model of Soviet planning with Russian subsidies – also provoked much anger. The extraordinary campaign to unseat Belarusian ‘dictator’ LukashenkoGiven the fact independent polling is illegal in Belarus, it was never entirely clear quite how vulnerable “Europe’s last dictator” actually became to Ms Tikhanovskaya’s challenge. But results from a handful of more reliable Minsk polling stations appeared to support the opposition claim that Ms Tikhanovskaya had, in fact, won — and convincingly.Unprecedented numbers of voters appeared to answer Ms Tikhanovskaya’s call to turn out late on Sunday — and the logic this would make falsifications more difficult. But Lidia Yermoshina, a key Lukashenko ally and chief vote counter as the head of Belarus\u0027s election committee, described the huge queues as “provocations” by the opposition. In an earlier interview on state TV, she described the opposition as a “totalitarian sect”.Independent exit polls conducted outside polling stations in foreign embassies also painted a starkly contrasting picture to the official figures. According to these surveys, Mr Lukashenko received just 6.25 per cent, compared to Ms Tikhanovskaya with 79.69 per cent. Ahead of the end of voting, Mr Lukashenko dismissed his rivals as being “unworthy of repression”. But he also seemed to make ominous warnings for those intending to protest. “All our structures and special services are ready and waiting,” he said. “There is no reason for our country to be plunged into chaos or civil war. I guarantee you that.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

I believe my own eyes rather than the data of the Central Election Commission.”Protester in ‘intensive care’ after clashes over Belarus electionPolice and protesters clash on streets as Lukashenko declared winnerForeign observers have not judged an election to be free and fair in Belarus since 1995. In the run-up to the Sunday’s vote, authorities jailed Mr Lukashenko’s political rivals and opened criminal investigations into others who voiced opposition.Ms Tsikhanouskaya said her team was “gathering proof of falsification”.“We have official protocols from many poll stations, where the number of votes in my favour are many more times than for another candidate,” she told the Associated Press.Ms Tikhanouskaya entered the race following the imprisonment of her husband, who had intended to run. She emerged from obscurity to draw some of the biggest crowds since the fall of the Soviet Union at her campaign rallies.Police violently broke up protests which sprang up on Sunday after the election results were announced. In Minsk, which saw the worst of the violence, police deployed water cannon, stun grenades and rounds of rubber bullets against demonstrators and drove a van into crowds. Dozens were injured and there were reports of one person being killed.Amnesty International said its researchers on the ground had documented arbitrary arrests and excessive use of force against peaceful protestors.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

But some wanted to spoil that holiday”.The president claimed without evidence that opposition to his iron-fisted rule was being directed from Poland and the Czech Republic.“They are trying to orchestrate mayhem. But I have already warned: there will be no revolution,” he said.The brutal police crackdown drew condemnation from Belarus’s European neighbours and will likely complicate Mr Lukashenko’s efforts to mend ties with the west amid tensions with his main ally, Russia.The European Union lamented that “the election night was marred with disproportionate and unacceptable state violence against peaceful protesters” and called for the immediate release of arrested demonstrators.The EU and United States slapped sanctions on Belarus in the early 2000s, but lifted most of them in recent years after Mr Lukashenko’s government freed political prisoners and allowed some opposition protests.A spokesperson for Boris Johnson, the prime minister, on Monday condemned the violent suppression of protests in Belarus as “completely unacceptable”.They added: “We have previously made clear on many occasions our significant concerns about Belarus’s anti-democratic actions, including the detention of opposition candidates, peaceful protesters and journalists. We’re raising our concerns, again, with the government of Belarus following these protests.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

To support us, please consider a\u0026nbspcontribution.Concerns are rising across Europe that the coronavirus-induced slump in oil prices could knock demand for recycled plastics but data is still patchy on how the pandemic has affected the amount of trash piling up, the European Union’s environment chief said.As lockdowns around the world caused a drop in demand for fossil fuels, oil prices have plummeted this year, making virgin plastics even cheaper than recycled versions of the material.That could spell trouble for EU plans to improve recycling rates. The EU generates around 26 million tonnes of plastic waste each year. Only 30 per cent of that is recycled.Sharing the full story, not just the headlines“We are concerned about potential disruption of the markets for recycled plastics caused by the low prices of crude oil, and also about littering of disposable masks and gloves,” EU environment commissioner Virginijus Sinkevicius told Reuters in a written interview.“At this stage, we do not yet have sufficient aggregated data to make reliable conclusions on the impact of the coronavirus crisis on plastic waste generation, separate collection, sorting, recycling or littering.”Household plastic waste increased in lockdown, survey showsGMB presenter explains why he didn’t help migrants crossing ChannelOcean plastic pollution is set to double within 30 years, study findsCould this zero-waste shopping service be the solution we need?Plastic recycling plants across Europe have been forced to curb operations during the pandemic, and some say demand has plummeted, as clients have shelved green goals due to the economic downturn.So far, however, companies still appear on track to meet a voluntary goal set by the EU to use 10 million tonnes of recycled plastics in new products by 2025, Mr Sinkevicius said.He said the commission has received “relatively few” requests to grant exemptions or extensions to EU environmental rules due to the Covid-19 crisis, but some countries had faced difficulties meeting recycling targets even before the pandemic.The EU will ban some single-use plastics next year and EU leaders agreed last month to introduce a bloc-wide tax on non-recyclable plastic packaging waste, to help raise funds for Europe’s recovery from the economic chaos wrought by the virus.Mr Sinkevicius said the EU’s 750 billion euro (£676bn) coronavirus recovery fund could help support the recycling sector.“If no rapid remedy comes from the EU and the authorities of the member states, reaching of the EU recycling targets is in danger,” Plastic Europe managing director Antonino Furfari told Reuters.“The low oil prices are set to remain with us for more than only a couple of months, hence further affecting the recycling business. Decoupling the price of fossil plastics from recycled one is therefore a must.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Protesters also broke into the housing and transport ministry offices.“We gave these leaders so many chances to help us and they always failed,” Walid Jamal, an unemployed demonstrator, said.The numbers of those out on the street was considerably less than Saturday’s demonstration, which saw thousands attend. Anger against the government mounted after reports suggested that officials knew about the 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate for several years, but failed to take action. But even before the blast, Lebanon had been rocked by mass rallies against the government decried as corrupt and culpable for the worst financial crisis to hit the country in decades.

The emergency aid will focus on medicine and hospitals, schools, food and housing.The French president, Emmanuel Macron, who hosted the conference, said in his opening remarks that the UN in Lebanon should coordinate the international response to the disaster which devastated Beirut.“Our task today is to act swiftly and efficiently, to coordinate our aid on the ground so that this aid goes as quickly as possible to the Lebanese people,” Mr Macron said on the video call. “Our role is to be by their sides. Lebanon’s future is at stake,” he added. The French president also said international assistance would include supporting an impartial and independent inquiry into the blast on 4 August.During the conference, which included international leaders and government officials, Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister also called for a “transparent and independent investigation” into the explosion.Donald Trump told participants the US was ready to continue providing aid to help the Lebanese, according to the White House. The blast destroyed swathes of the city, leaving more than a quarter of a million people homeless. The economic effects of the incident are expected to be significant, with some economists forecasting that Lebanon’s GDP could fall by as much as 25 per cent as a result. The UK’s international development secretary, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, has pledged another £20m to “stand by the Lebanese people” on Sunday, on top of the £5m the UK has already promised. Lebanon president admits knowing about explosive stockpile weeks agoThe German foreign minister, Heiko Maas, announced on Sunday that his country would give an extra €10m (£9m) to Lebanon.As part of his statement, Mr Maas said Lebanon had faced “overwhelming challenges” before the explosion, adding that there will be a lot to do “even after the worst of the rubble is removed”. France has offered 18 tonnes of medical aid and 663 tonnes of food, while the US Agency for International Development said it will give $15m (£12m) directly to those who need it most in Beirut, rather than to the Lebanese government.Additional reporting from agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesThe explosion is believed to have been caused by a fire that ignited a massive pile of ammonium nitrate stored in the port since 2013.Mr Diab, who was a university professor at the American University of Beirut before he took the job, directed his anger at the country’s political parties and politicians who preceded him, accusing them of hiding the dangerous stockpile for seven years.How Beirut firefighters were left to tackle port blasts blindI declare today the resignation of this government. May God protect Lebanon, he said repeating the last phrase three times. They (the political class) should have been ashamed of themselves because their corruption is what has led to this disaster that had been hidden for seven years, he added.Local media later reported that he arrived at the presidential palace to formally submit his resignation to President Michel Aoun.Under Lebanese law, Mr Aoun will call for mandatory consultations with parliament to name a new prime minister, in the interim the current government will be resigned to caretaker status until a new one is formed. World leaders pledge €250m to help Lebanon after Beirut explosionMy dear Beirut, I am far away but I am feeling your painFireworks stored alongside stockpile in ‘dangerous’ Beirut port hangerHow Beirut firefighters were left to tackle port blasts blindLebanese’s beleaguered government had faced mounting pressure from angry citizens to step down after it emerged the explosion was caused by a fire igniting a 2,7000-tonne poorly-stored stockpile of explosive ammonium nitrate that the authorities knew about.The fury has only mounted as the government has been accused of doing little to help the 300,000 people who were made homeless or whose businesses and livelihoods were destroyed.Although there were mounting calls for resignation Mr Diab seemed unwilling to leave office and only two days ago made a televised speech in which he offered to stay on for two months to allow for various factions to agree on a roadmap for reforms. But the pressure from within his own Cabinet proved to be too much, over the last 24-hours three ministers had already resigned. Beirut’s streets have been rocked by protests over the last two days, as demonstrators and members of the security forces have clashed outside parliament as well as several ministries citizens tried to occupy.The explosion, centred at Beirut port, is believed to be one of the single largest non-nuclear blasts in modern history.\u0026nbspAdditional reporting from agencies\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The specialist in major crimes and child abuse, Mark Williams-Thomas, explained how he believed that Brit cops would have been more aware of how to deal with the critical incident which may have lead police to prime suspect Christain B. He told the Express: #It’s crucial to get house-to-house done really quickly, particularly in an area like that –you’re doing house-to-house in central London you’re dealing with people who are living there, whereas in Praia da Luz you’re dealing with a transient community who are largely holidayers. #Therefore  hours can make a signicant dference in terms of somebody being there or not being there.#The British police, we’ve had considerable experience dealing with critical time-sensitive cases, in particular, child abductions.#We’ve learnt from major mistakes we’ve made in cases in the past.#On May , , Madeleine McCann, three, vanished from her bedroom in the apartment her family were staying in at the Praia da Luz resort in Portugal while her parents, Kate and Gerry, ate with friends at a nearby restaurant.The apartment was broken into while Madeleine and her twin baby siblings were asleep, and local police concluded it was a kidnapping. The family voiced concern at what they called was a slow initial police response and a failure to secure the crime scene.In the following days, the McCanns turned to the media to help locate their daughter, and the case attracted global attention with soccer stars David Beckham and Cristiano Ronaldo joining the appeals for information.The media focus on the case led to reported sightings of Madeleine across the globe. However, the early investigation by Portuguese police produced no major leads.The following July, the Portuguese police dropped their investigation because of a lack of evidence.The British police began their own investigation # Operation Grange # saying they had identied  potential suspects.They released an e-fit image of a number of men, including one of an unidentied suspect they particularly wanted to trace. Soon after, Portuguese prosecutors ordered the case to be reopened by local police.The new inquiry led Portuguese police to interview four suspects, but they were later cleared of any involvement, and a search by British detectives of wasteland near Praia da Luz also failed to provide a breakthrough.In June , British and German police said they had identied a new suspect in the case, a -year-old German man. Prime suspect Christian B lived in the Algarve between  and  and burgled hotels and holiday flats as well as trading drugs.Nine years ago, the Met police said that it had agreed to bring its expertise to the Madeleine McCann case, after a request from the Home Secretary.Known as Operation Grange, the team is led by the Specialist Crime Command unit and involved, in the first instance, an ‘investigative review’.This was a check of all of the investigations that had been previously conducted into the circumstances of the toddler’s disappearance.Then in June this year #  years after she was abducted # DCI Mark Cranwell, who is heading Operation Grange, said they received more than  calls and emails following an appeal for information on German TV.Investigators were inundated with hundreds of tip-offs after paedophile Christian B was identied as the prime suspect in the childs disappearance.They also revealed:On June  , the Braunschweig public prosecutors office announced that it was “investigating a -year-old German national on suspicion of murder”.The office explained its probe was “in connection with the disappearance of the then -year-old British girl Madeleine McCann on May ,  from an apartment complex in Praia da Luz in Portugal.“The accused is a sex offender with multiple criminal records, who has also been convicted of child sexual abuse.“The accused lived regularly in the Algarve between  and , including for several years in a house between Lagos and Praia da Luz. “According to the information available here, he did several odd jobs in the Lagos area during this time, including in the restaurant business.”The Braunschweig public prosecutors office said it was “involved in the investigation because the accused was last domiciled in the local district before his stay abroad”.The investigation in Germany is being carried out “on behalf of the Braunschweig public prosecutors office by the Federal Criminal Police Officein close cooperation with the [UK[‘s] politan Police and the Polícia Judiciária in Portugal.”Snfer dogs used to search a Germany allotment connected to the prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case were said to have #barked a lot# when a hidden cellar was uncovered by cops.The dogs are trained to bark should they come across traces of human remains or potential evidence as cops searched the ­allotment in Seelze, Hanover, once used by paedo Christian B.According to the , a person present at the scene said: #The snfer dogs were barking quite a lot in the morning#, as cops removed a cement block from the entrance to the cellar.Christian B, , left the site in  or , with no visible sign of the cellar left.But it was finally uncovered last month by  police and forensic officers, who spent days using dogs, diggers and underground radar equipment.Officials have not as yet revealed what they were looking for.German politician Ulrich Watermann said: #I hope that the case will be solved so that [Madeleines] parents can close a terrible chapter.“But despite this, the pain will remain.”Madeleine McCann was aged three when she disappeared in May,  while on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz on Portugal’s Algarve.Watermann claimed that prime suspect Christian B is to remain in jail, as he understands his appeal against a rape conviction has already failed.A seven-year jail term for the rape of a -year-old woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal is due to kick in at the end of him serving time for drugs trafficking, in January next year.In a hearing at the European Court of Justice, his lawyers had argued that it was a breach of international law to put him on trial for the rape.Watermann said he believed the court has already thrown out his bid, with the official ruling set to be announced later this week, reports the Mirror.The ECJ case in Luxembourg hinges on a legal point relating to Christian Bs extradition to Germany from Portugal and later Italy.Prime suspect Christian B will never face trial for Madeleine McCann’s disappearance, his lawyer claims.His lawyer Friedrich Fulscher said: “Where is the evidence #Why has the prosecution not revealed it #There won’t be a trial for my client for Madeleine McCann. I am certain.”He saidthe case ever did get to trial, drter Christian B would face the court “serenely and calmly . . . he has nothing to hide”.Prosecutors said in June that they had mobile phone data which put Christian B near the Ocean Club apartments in Praia da Luz on Portugal’s Algarve from where Madeleine, three, was taken in May, .Christian B is currently appealing at the European Court of Justice against his conviction for raping a American woman aged  in Praia da Luz in .A top forensic expert said that Madeleine McCann’s disappearance WILL one day be solved.Professor Angela Gallop, a world-renowned scientist whose work has helped to solve numerous cold cases, said the mystery would finally be solved because “contact always leaves a trace”.Her passion and attention to detail has seen her work on and solve murders including Stephen Lawrence, Rachel Nickell and the Coastal Path murders in Pembrokeshire in the s.Speaking to the Sun Online, Prof Gallop explained: “There have been so many cases where it has looked so hopeless at the start, but where we have been able to dig out something which has led to a resolution.”She added: “I’ve always been interested in this case – after all this time it would be extremely tough.“But one thing I’ve found with some of these really dficult crimes is that you never say never about anything.“I’m an optimist by nature and an optimist now because of my teams’ success in helping to solve so many of these complex cold cases.# that every contact leaves a trace I now know to be absolutely true. #The dficulty is usually in finding the traces in the first place.#For the full story, see HERE.German sex offender Christian B, who is currently serving time in prison for drug offences, is being investigated following Madeleine McCann’s disappearance during her family holiday in Praia da Luz, Portugal, in .He is a prolic burglar, who has previous convictions for sex crimes against young girls.The prime suspect was already known to British and Portuguese police in relation to Madeleines disappearance in Praia da Luz.Christian B has  child sex convictions and is known to have videoed victims.Yet recent information came from a witness who stepped forward following an appeal by the Met Police on the tenth anniversary of Madeleine’s abduction in .He is in jail in Kiel on drugs charges and is appealing a conviction for the rape of a -year-old.A man, known only as Tomas, said he was horried to realise the man who gave him a lt in a camper  years ago was the main suspect in the disappearance of Madeleine McCann.He told the Mail Online: #It makes me sick to think that the little girl could have been taken away in the same van a month later.”In newly unearthed footage the paedophile, , can be seen laughing as he is filmed by three German travellers he had offered to drive from Portugal to Spain.In the video obtained by the Mail Online, Christian B can be seen wearing a white sweatshirt and black necklace, joking around while looking at a map in the back of the distinctive rusting campervan.The video, dating back to March  , was taken just five weeks before Madeleine went missing from the holiday apartment, sparking one of the biggest missing persons cases in recent history.Tomas added: #He seemed like any other ordinary young man. He was cheerful and joked a lot and happy to give us a ride in his VW van.#He didnt mind us filming him and taking his pictures. He was happy to pose and must have known we could never suspect what a terrible man he really was.#A court last week sided against the suspect in Madeleine McCanns disappearance in his bid to overturn a rape conviction.At the European Court of Justicein Luxembourg, Advocate General Michael Bobek gave a preliminary ruling on a legal point relating to Christian B’s extradition to Germany from Portugal and later Italy.He:Bobek said that Christian B was prosecuted in Germany successively in three criminal cases for ious offences: for dealing with narcotics for sexual abuse of a child committed in Portugal and for a serious rape also committed in Portugal .The case hinges on a legal point relating to his extradition to Germany.When the hearing at the ECJ in Luxembourg opened last month the German prosecutor’s lawyer, Felix Halabi, had argued that Christian B’s argument was “nonsensical”. He said: “The suspect made the most of European open borders and now he wants us to interpret the law so as to get it turned on its head in order to give him an advantage in court.”A final decision by ECJ judges will be known at a later date.Kate McCann made a “horror” discovery while combing through police files on her daughter’s abduction in Portugal.The heartbroken mum revealed in her book how the family’s routine with friends they were holidaying with could have been easily monitored by anyone watching them.A friend of the family had made a block booking at a tapas restaurant close to their apartment so they could check on their young children intermittently.She wrote: “It wasn’t until a year later, when I was combing through the Portuguese police files that I discovered that the note requesting our block booking was written in a staff message book, which sat on a desk at the pool reception for most of the day.“This book was by definition accessible to all staff and, albeit unintentionally, probably to guests and visitors, too.“To my horror, I saw that, no doubt in all innocence and simply to explain why she was bending the rules a bit, the receptionist had added the reason for our request.“[It was because] we wanted to eat close to our apartment as we were leaving our young children alone there and checking on them intermittently.”Last Thursdays ruling on Christian Bs bid to overturn a rape conviction was only preliminary.It was an #opinion# given by Advocate General Michael Bobek at the European Court of Justicein Luxembourg.That means its not binding, and Christian Bs appeal has thus not yet been officially concluded.He is appealing against a conviction for the  rape of a -year-old American woman in Portugal, for which he was sentenced to seven years in jail.The case delves into a legal point relating to his extradition from Portugal # and later, Italy # to Germany, where he is currently in prison serving time for drug trafficking.Bobek said the consent of only the Italian authorities was needed for the Germans to carry out their proceedings legally.It comes ahead of a final decision by ECJ judges at a later date.A delighted German prosecutor Julia Meyer told the PA news agency: #The advocate general shares our opinion.#We are pleased and wait for the decision of the court the next few weeks.# reports that ECJ judges usually back the Advocate Generals opinions.The elderly American widow raped by Madeleine McCann prime suspect Christian B told an FBI agent the horric attack “changed my whole le and led to me moving back to the United States.”Official documents tell how she failed to notice balaclava-clad fiend slipping into her home because she was gripped by TV news about Hurricane Katrina.She told the agent: “I went to the study. I was grabbed by a very strong and tall man by the neck in the dark and pulled up the five stone stairs into the bedroom.“I was briefly able to recognise a masked figure.“Dark eyes looked out of slits and he had held a long, curved kne, which looked like a sabre.”Christian B, , is appealing a conviction for raping the -year-old woman.Madeleine McCann investigators in Germany want to re-test a saliva sample from the Portugal flat where she vanished to seeit matches main suspect Christian B, it’s been reported.In June, The Sun reported how a scrap of blue material in the vaults of a Portuguese forensic lab could provide the vital link between Christian B and Madeleine McCann.Detectives hope advances in DNA testing may yet provide a full profile for comparison with the -year-old convicted paedophile and rapist.The material comes from the bedspread draped over the bed Madeleine was sleeping on when she was abducted from her family’s holiday apartment.Tests uncovered a microscopic a DNA profile initially identied as semen, but later confirmed to be saliva.And according to Sky News, German authorities are now keen to re-examine a sample from the Praia da Luz holiday apartment where Madeleine vanished from in .Sky News claimed Portuguese tests on the sample apparently found no DNA match to Christian B.Authorities in Germany believe their scientists should do their own tests.But Portuguese police may not send the sample due to legal restrictions in sending samples abroad for testing and recent criticism of them from Germany, Sky reported.Asked about the report about the saliva sample, Braunschweig state prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters, who is leading the Madeleine investigation, said in June: #That information is not mine.#I dont know where it comes from. I cant confirm anything.#Prime suspect Christian B is to remain in jail as his appeal against a rape conviction has failed, a German politician has said.The paedophile is currently appealing to the European Court of Justice after being convicted of raping a -year-old American woman.But Ulrich Watermann says the court has already made a decision that the conviction is lawful, ultimately keeping Christian B behind bars, the Mirror reports.Waterman is a Social Democratic Party of Germany politician in Lower Saxony and prosecutors there are leading the case against Christian B.A court in Braunschweig, Lower Saxony, is also handling the rape appeal.Christian B is currently on jail for drugs offences but is soon eligible for parole meaning thathis rape conviction had been overturned he could have walked free.DNA from a rape case allegedly linked to Madeleine McCann suspect Christian B was destroyed on the orders of Portuguese prosecutors.Irish rape victim Hazel Behan waived her right last anonymity in June to say she believes a masked man who targeted her in her Algarve apartment could have been the German sex offender.She went public about her horric  attack after discovering Christian B was convicted late last year of the September  rape of an elderly American woman in Praia da Luz, Portugal.Met Police told her they were taking her case very seriously and were contacting Portuguese counterparts after taking her statement.But, it later emerged that biological material collected from the crime scene was destroyed.The extraordinary decision was laid bare in court papers relating to Ms Behan’s rape in Praia da Rocha # which is a -minute drive east of Praia da Luz.The former holiday rep suffered a terrying five-hour ordeal during which she was abducted, gagged, threatened with a machete and raped.But, potentially key evidence was thrown away after the case was mothballed in March .Cops shelved the investigation as the attack happened during Euro , when there were more people in the area, and they decided it was a #one-off#.Case files in Ms Behans case describe her rapist as an English speaker who could be “German, Belgian or Dutch.”They add: “As they are in a bad condition it is improbable thatthis re-investigation was reopened the material could be subjected to counterproof analysis.”For the full story, see HERE.The lawyer for Christian B has said he doesnt recognise the person portrayed in the media and that his client is a calm and friendly person.Friedrich Fulscher, currently representing the -year-old, said: “I dont recognise the person the media describes.“I am able to describe him as a very calm and friendly person when I talk to him in prison.”Christian B is currently serving time in a German jail following a conviction for a  rape that took place in Praia da Luz, the resort from which Madeleine McCann disappeared in .A Brit woman whose parents hosted Christian B as a lodger has said his eyes #chilled her to the bone#. Angie Dawes, then , said the -year-old stayed with her family after suddenly arriving in their remote Portuguese village. “I met him at my parents’ house. Even though he was polite, on every occasion he was weird,# she said.“He was memorable to look at. The blond hair with striking blue eyes.“But he would just stare at me in a sleazy way for a minute or two without saying a word and not release his gaze.“It was bizarre and made me feel very uncomfortable. His eyes chilled me to the bone.”Phone records that prosecutors say place Christian B near the apartment from which Madeleine McCann vanished dont incriminate him in the case, his lawyer has said. Prosecutors have said that a pre-paid mobile phone owned by Christian B #pinged# a phone mast close to the McCanns apartment around the time Madeleine disappeared. Investigators continue to search for evidence that Christian B was on the -minute call and of who he was talking to. Representing the -year-old, lawyer Friedrich Fulsche said: #You cant say because of the fact that this cell phone was logged to this tower that he was standing near to the apartment of Madeleine McCanns disappearance. #He could have been  kilometres away.#Christian B wont ever co-operate with Madeleine McCann investigators, his lawyer has said.Speaking to the Sydney Morning Herald, Friedrich Fulsche said it was not for his client to defend himself, but for prosecutors to establish his guilt.“Before our client starts to co-operate with the prosecutors office, you could order holy water as a long drink in hell,” he said.“That is not unusual. It is very normal not to talk to the police when you are suspected of committing a crime.“The prosecutors office has to prove that a suspect has committed a crime, and not the suspect prove that he hasnt.”Prosecutors in Germany have welcomed a ruling by Europes highest court that has dashed Christian Bs hope of an early release from jail. The -year-old is currently serving a jail term in Germany for the rape of a woman in Portugal in .He stood trial for the crime after being extradited from Italy, and is currently appealing his conviction on the grounds that he was initially extradited to face unrelated drug trafficking charges. The European Court of Justice this week told him the appeal is unlikely to succeed because he left Portugal voluntarily.Speaking to the PA, German prosecutor Julia Meyer said: #The advocate general shares our opinion.#We are pleased and wait for the decision of the court the next few weeks.#German police knew about an allotment previously used by Christian B for two years before searching it, the suspects lawyer has claimed. Investigators last week conducted an excavation of a plot in Hanover and a basement structure beneath.Representing Christian B, Friedrich Fulsche said: “I am very surprised they have started a search there now and not much earlier.“I was very surprised because the police had known for over two years that the garden was used by my client.”He speculated that the timing of the search had been an attempt to sway opinion against Christian B ahead of a then-upcoming ruling by the European Court of Justice concerning his extradition to Germany.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

After new UK government guidelines came into play, advising Brits against travel to Spain after originally giving holidaymakers the greenlight, many of the worlds super-rich are looking for alternative lockdown options as the risk of a second wave becomes more imminent. This means that the worlds most wealthy would be able to enter their country of choice once citizenship is obtained and would most likely only need to follow quarantine rules on arrival. These so-called citizen-by-investment programs, or CIPs, are currently a growing industry, as are residence-by-investment arrangements, also known as golden visas.But the buying citizenship comes with a hefty price tag as well as certain requirements that wealthy clients must meet, ying from country to country. For example, you can acquire the right to live, work and study in New Zealand for roughly £.million or approximately £.million depending on the visa package you apply for. The country has been praised for its swt handling of the virus with just  deaths and only , cases after introducing strict border controls and placing residents in full lockdown, only leaving home for food and medical appointments. Just over £million and a property purchase would get you a married couple citizenship in Malta.

Trayor Lesnock, the founder of Platinum Luxury Auctions, which is conducting the online sale of Mai Island, in Fiji, told the Times that the pandemic had led people to reassess their lives and pursue the things they had fantasised about but always held off from doing.Pumpkin Island, an eco-retreat in Australia’s Great Barrier Reef Marine Park that was put on the market with a price tag of nearly £million, was described by its current owners as a “safe haven” from the pandemic.Laureth Rumble, whose family owns Pumpkin Island said: We’ve weathered the [coronavirus] storm well and people are looking for places where they will have space and where they don’t feel like they’re on top of someone  . . . I definitely think that’s an attraction.New inquiries jumped  percent in the first four months of this year, compared with the same period in , according to the company. Paddy Blewer, Director of Henley and Partners UK, told the Sun Online: All clients,they contacted us today would have to wait four or five months, up to six months, to gain citizenship. This is not a jump the queue type services but because of the extreme challenge of COVID our clients are looking for optionality. We have seen a signicant jump in interest, our client engagement has risen by % between January and April. We see a lot of entrepreneurs and millionaires making six-figure investments.They are very wealthy people acquiring citizenships but the visa rules still apply. Many are looking for options in Europe but we have seen a signicant rise in places such as Thailand, New Zeland and Australian residency and right to live. Also places such as Portugal, Greece, Malta and the Schengen zone.Since the beginning of the pandemic, our clients are beginning to think more about their assets and balancing their portfolio.If all their assets are in one place they think do I want to change my le, its not just about a second wave. They may not be thinking about the next big pandemic in years to come, what is on the horizon. COVID has had a similar effect on our clients as the  financial crisis, similar effects on their portfolio, but this has a physical effect and matters more.Countries will allow those with citizenship to fly out but due to the pandemic, those quarantine rules will certainly still apply.No one has specically asked for COVID specied properties but with the money that is often being spent, properties will be setup with everything requires such a private location.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He’s looking forward to getting going. “I believe he will be particularly good at this.”Not-for-profit Medical Detection Dogs is working with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Durham University on the trial, which could lead to  arrivals in the UK being screened at airports every hourit gets positive results. The charity and the London School worked together two years ago to train dogs to recognise the smell of malaria from socks which had been worn by the patients in Gambia. The results showed the hounds were able to diagnose  per cent of malaria samples accurately.Medical Detection Dogs is also working on two NHS-approved clinical trials – looking at how dogs can snf out prostate cancer with Milton Keynes University Hospital and another looking at colorectal cancer with Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust.Claire is confident her canine team has what it takes to smell Covid- in humans based on research on other cold and flu viruses.Scientists would first work on isolating the scent before using a decontaminated sample for dogs to learn to recognise. Claire says: “We haven’t found any disease that hasn’t got its own unique odour. “Dogs are very, very good at smelling dferent bacterias so it’s extremely likely that there would also be a smell coronavirus. “If the odour is reasonable we would get these dogs ready in six weeks. Normally it would take eight to ten weeks.“That would be intensive because the whole point about Covid is that we need dogs trained as soon as possible. “The team is ready, the dogs are ready and everyone wants to make a dference.” The charity feels the dogs will be best placed to prevent a resurgence of the virus as lockdown restrictions are lted.The dogs’ sensitive snouts mean they will be able to stop super-spreaders who don’t experience symptoms from infecting the public once again.“That’s why we need to get cracking quickly – we need to get these dogs trained and ready, Claire says.“We are in discussions with the Government and obviously healthcare advisors. “Because to start with there won’t be many dogs, we’ll be deploying them where they will be making the most dference.“Public places, probably ports of entry, screening people coming off flights for example to seethey are bringing the virus back into the country.”If the trial proves a success, Claire and her team would hope to share their knowledge with agencies who train detection dogs all over the country.The super snfer dogs cant be deployed until the trial has been completed, and thats entirely dependent on when enough samples have been received. “We’ve already started recruiting so we’ve already got some samples, says Prof James Logan, lead researcher on the study and Head of the Department of Disease Control at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.But because the Covid- numbers have come down in the UK, we’re finding it dficult to get enough samples to do all the training.”The scientists are asking anyone who has either tested positive in the last  hours or who has symptoms and is going to get a test done to get in touch. “We really are desperate for these samples, Prof Logan adds. We need them as quickly as possible, which is why we’re doing this callout to the public.“If this is successful and we can get lots of people to donate within the next couple of weeks, we’ll be on track to do that.*To volunteer for the study, visit: https:www.lshtm.ac.uk research centres-projects-groups using-dogs-to-detect-covid-#volunteer-for-the-studyOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But also because he was only  years old and had been married to his beautul we Lissie for just a month.It was heartbreaking to see the photos of the pair overflowing with love and happiness at their wedding — while knowing his le had been needlessly ended.Our hearts went out to Lissie, who no doubt is still trying to make sense of the tragedy. So too his mother and father. For any parent, such a loss is unthinkable. Nobody should have to bury their child.It is against the natural order of things, especially when your beloved son or daughter has been murdered.That kind of pain will never go away. It becomes the defining moment of a parent’s le.Who would blame someone in that position for opting out of le ­altogether and sinking into inertia and depression  To me, that even seems the most likely response.Instead, his mum Debbie Adlam has hit the campaign trail, arguing for longer sentences for anyone who kills a policeman.PC Harper’s killers were convicted of manslaughter but cleared of ­murder.Henry Long, , who drove the getaway car, was jailed for  years. His accomplices Albert ­Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , were each given  years.Unduly lenient sentences, to my mind — and probably yours too.On Wednesday, Lissie began a campaign to bring in “Andrew’s Law”, in memory of her late husband. She wants anyone who kills a police officer, firefighter, nurse, doctor or paramedic to be jailed for le — meaning a minimum of  years.Mrs Adlam, who has been robbed of growing old happily with her beloved son in her le, has joined the campaign.“We got to the end of our trial and we didn’t feel like justice had been done,” she said. “We felt like we had been punched.“We didn’t walk away feeling that we had done Andrew proud.”That is the nub of the matter. She wants to do right by her late son. And I imagine she will not rest until she feels she has done that.It is only when tragedy strikes that many people realise how strong and determined they can be.Nothing can bring back PC Harper. ButAndrew’s Law comes to pass, acting as a deterrent to other criminals, at least one positive will have come from an otherwise senseless death.The need for justice is a stronger force than most of us can comprehend. I think of Stephen Lawrence’s mother Doreen, whose le changed overnight when her son was ­murdered in a racist attack in .She campaigned tirelessly for reforms to the police service and founded the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust.She forged positive change from the tragic murder of her son, ­showing the strength of her feeling and the scale of her loss.I think also of Michael and Sara Payne who also campaigned with great determination after the murder of their eight-year-old daughter Sarah.As a result, parents and ­carers can now formally ask the police for information about a person who has contact with a childthey fear that person poses a threat.Then there is the Jodie Chesney Foundation, set up by Peter Chesney to tackle kne crime after his daughter was murdered last year.When faced with unimaginable loss, some people respond by taking action to change things.They are gripped with the strength to move mountains — and get the law changed.We salute their courage and their determination to find light amid the terrible darkness of their loss.How sad it is seeing footage of Keeley Bunker dancing with her trusted friend Wesley Streete, who walked her home that evening . . . then went on to murder her.Keeley was a beautul young woman, just  when she died and with her whole le ahead of her.But her “friend” chose to end that le.It is tragic seeing any le wasted – and for what  Streete’s own gratication.Let us hope he is haunted by his actions and choices for the rest of his le.Wonderful news this week as the parents of poor Charlie Gard – who died of a rare genetic condition three years ago – gave birth to a healthy baby boy.As Connie Yates said: “The world feels a whole lot more beautul this morning”.I am so happy for them after the tragedy of losing Charlie, and what a beautul baby.Congratulations.WARNINGS this week that menopausal women could be unfairly denied entry to pubs and restaurantstheir hot flushes are confused in temperature checks for Covid symptoms.Take note: No one in their right mind should keep a menopausal woman from her chilled white wine . . .It feels a bit like a sword of Damocles is hanging over the nation at the moment, with yet more job cuts announced this week – at LGH Hotels, Pizza Express and Wetherspoons.Thousands more workers are living in fear of redundancy. It is a scary prospect. But don’t panic.The best defence is preparation. Find ways to be positive. That means not taking it personally.The ROLE is redundant, not you. So don’t view redundancy as a reflection of your ability or your worth.Know your rights and get the best settlement you can. A proper redundancy process comes with a consultation period, which will give you time to weigh up your options.My advice is to engage in that process. Ask for written clarication of any offer andyou are unhappy in any way, there are plenty of employment lawyers you can talk to. Or free help is available from Acas.Sort out your finances. Work out how much money you need for day-to-day living and,you can, keep some back for emergencies. Cut out spending on non-essentials and work out how to manage everything from mortgage payments to credit card debt.You might have to tighten your belt for a bit but that’s not the end of the word. For many people, redundancy is a chance to consider what they might do dferently.That is easier said than done but try to see it as an opportunity – to go freelance, start a business, become a consultant, get another job or re-enter education – rather than an ending.I love a romantic gesture as much as anyone.But the -year-old man who spelled out “Marry Me” using  tea lights made me wonderhe might have found another way.The candles set fire to the living room and seriously damaged the flat he shared with his girlfriend.But she still said yes!And at least she knows what she is getting herself into.It is always hard seeing photos of people enjoying a holiday in the sun when you are working.And this year, more than ever, I’ve been consumed with envy of the lucky souls who somehow got away despite all the travel restrictions.Having seen multiple beachtastic photos of Coleen and Wayne Rooney, who jetted off to the Caribbean what seems like weeks ago, is it wrong of me to admit I’ll be quite pleased when the holiday season is over We need a word for the irritated envy of others’ amazing holidays.GOT a story  RING The Sun on    or WHATSAPP on  or EMAIL exclusive@the-sunOur journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Labour councillors and MPs shake their heads about the dangers of opening while never reflecting on the risk of keeping schools closed.Even Labour’s new leader Sir Keir Starmer is worried about safety . . .  and his own children attended school during lockdown.The risks to children from Covid- are next to non-existent. Teachers are more likely to be hit by a bus than contract coronavirus from kids.Butthe risks of the schools opening in September are minimal, the cost of schools staying shut is beyond measure.Already, a generation of kids have seen their education become another victim of coronavirus.Some , of them could not sit their GCSEs in spring. And , could not sit their A levels.The years below them, due to sit those le-changing exams next spring, have lost six months of their education they will never recover.A report by the National Foundation for Educational Research said  per cent of state-school children had between none and one online lesson a day during the long months of lockdown.The most disadvantaged children have suffered the most.The schools are due to open in just  days and the vast majority of parents — almost  per cent — want them to start as planned.But even as Gavin Williamson was making his bold promise to throw open the school gates, Business ­Secretary Alok Sharma was mewing that school closures would be ­considered on a “case by case” basis, while Schools minister Nick Gibb bleats he can’t “decree” that every pupil will be back at their desk in September. These timid Tories must start showing some spine.With the schools closed, parents cannotto work. Already unemployment is soaring. Already there are hard times ahead.If parents and their children stay at home during the autumn months, this country will be on its knees for years.The A-level results will be announced this Thursday and the class of  will finally discover the damage that Covid- has done to their dreams.For the first time ever, A-level grades will be estimated, and there are countless families across the country holding their breath, me included.But for the millions of children meant to be in school, the future is even more uncertain.If their schools do not open in September it will be a craven act of surrender to extremist teaching unions.And a national tragedy that ­effectively chucks an entire generation on the scrapheap.IT is  years since Cameron Diaz made her movie debut opposite Jim Carrey in The Mask and six years since her last film.Cameron says retiring from the movies has brought her the peace she has always craved.And, of course, having an estimated £million in the bank usually has a calming effect.The thieving simpletons responsible for his death will all be free before they turn .The police get endless stick these days. But PC Andrew Harper was the best of us.Andrew had been married to his childhood sweetheart Lissie for just four weeks when he was dragged to his death after becoming entangled in a tow rope dangling from the back of a car being used to steal a quad bike.Driver Henry Long, , got  years. Albert Bowers and Jessie Cole, both , got  years. Not once have they shown even a flicker of remorse. But the law allows a third of a term off sentences for murder and manslaughter.Now Andrew’s widow Lissie has launched a campaign for “Andrew’s Law”, which will mean a full le term for killing  workers.“I wish to ensure any widows of the future will not have to experience the same miscarriage of justice,” says Lissie, . “I pledge to my late husband to never stop until I have made the dference this country needs.”I know that every reader of this paper will wish Lissie well.The sentences handed down to Long, Bowers and Cole might be what we would expect for manslaughter convictions.But God knows it does not feel very much like justice.“NO one here gets out alive,” sang The Doors’ Jim Morrison.Jim could have been thinking of Public Health England, the quango of clowns charged with protecting the nation’s health and wellbeing.PHE has developed a unique way of counting our corona- virus dead. If you catch Covid-, PHE claims you as a virus victim evenyou recover and die many months later of something .Who does their maths, Diane Abbott PHE’s madcap counting system means all , cases of coronavirus in England will eventually be added to the UK’s Covid- death toll – because we all have to go some time.PHE receives £million of your money a year to produce this garbage.The explosion has left more than  dead, , hurt and , homeless.Israa Seblani, , is the bride who was posing for wedding photos at the very moment the Lebanese capital was devastated by the huge blast.A doctor herself, Israa helped the wounded before seeking safety.

Love that “maybe”, monsieur!Priti Patel threatens to send in the Royal Navy but that shouldn’t be necessary. It is contrary to international law that these desperate souls are not claiming asylum in the first safe country they reach.But as they continue to arrive here on a daily basis, you have to say they look happy to have reached this country from the war-torn wastelands of, er, France.Perhaps the UK is not quite the racist hellhole it is frequently cracked up to be.THE Government is mocked for launching its wildly popular Eat Out To Help Out scheme while, at the same time, Boris is posing in gyms and waging his private war on obesity.

Court documents claim they also gave themselves the same nicknames used by Harris and Klebold - and sent each other pictures of the two killers.It is alleged they planned to carry out the bloodbath when schools ed next month as most classes have been closed since March.Detectives reportedly viewed Schultz and Robins Facebook profiles and obtained search warrants to view their private conversations.Police are said to have discovered multiple messages planning out massacres at Rochester High School and Caston High School in Rochester, Indiana. Robin allegedly said he wanted everyone there dead, according to a probable cause affidavit. He allegedly wrote he would kill a security guard before roaming the halls killing people before heading into classrooms.Robin allegedly even estimated how long it would take a SWAT team to arrive at each Rochester and Caston schools. Police claim Robin revealed he had an itch to shoot up a school, claiming he had once sat outside Rochester Middle School for  minutes with an AR when he was in eighth grade.He wrote that he planned to kill  or more people, with  magazines packed in a duffel bag, and then himself before reportedly deciding it was too risky.Meanwhile, it is alleged Schultz wrote to one unnamed friend that “we are gonna do it i wanna shoot up a school with him”.He added: “I want him to stay out of trouble till we can shoot up the place.Police allegedly found a June  conversation revealed more details about the plan - including a potential suicide pact.Robin is reported to have said im killing myself after I kill a bunch of people and but im killing myself after I kill a bunch of people.Allegedly, Schultz said: I does exist donny just like no matter what im doin the same for u bc u guys are my family we had bad childhoods and we will always stick together u guys fr mean everything to me.In another conversation on Facebook, Robin is alleged to have said he had a gun locked in my dads safe and later discussed shooting up an airport, festivals or Black churches.Police also alleged Schultz had multiple conversations on Facebook about either trying to buy illegal narcotics or others asking for his help selling illegal narcotics.Robin also alleged had a friend buy him a hat for the band KMFDM , whose lyrics were posted by Harris before the Columbine massacre. The friend said: Cant believe Im buying you a school shooter hat butit makes you happy.Robin is said to have replied its not a school shooter hat, its a band hat.Fulton County Prosecutor Michael Marrs said: So I mean, anytime anyone’s obsessed with Columbine, yes, it’s a fine line between free speech and when you cross the line, but I think in this case, clearly what they had done was going to interfere with the occupancy of a school.He added: Anything like this, were going to take extremely seriously because I think history has shown us that sadly, these kind of things do get carried out. And were not going to take it lightly.Marrs added more information about the case would be released in the coming weeks.Charges of  conspiracy to commit murder and intimidation were filed against the pair on July .Schultz is being held at the Fulton County Jail and Robin, still a minor, is being held in a juvenile detention center but will be transferred when he turns  later this month.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And it would be bonkersthose ing from hotspots were allowed to roam Britain freely.ButBoris and his ministers are asking holidaymakers to quarantine after getting back from places deemed safe when they set off, the Government must cough up and pay them compensation for missing work.If they refuse, they’ll burn through political capital and decimate the tourist industry while they’re at it.It really is as simple as that.NEWS that the number of people in hospital with Covid- has fallen  per cent since the peak of the pandemic is music to our ears.Of course there’s always a risk that cases spike come winter.But with signs Britain is finally getting the disease under control, let’s get back to work, shops and restaurants to salvage our damaged economy.The sun, at last, is shining.

Warnings had been issued years before as the killer cargo was seized from a ship owned by a Russian businessman who had gone bankrupt.Several ministers had already stepped down amid murmurings that the government was on the brink of collapse.The cabinet, formed in January with the backing of the powerful Iranian-backed Hezbollah group and its allies, met today after a slew of resignations.Justice minister Marie-Claude Najms, information minister Manal Abdel-Samad,finance minister Ghazi Wazni, defence minister and deputy PM Zeina Akar, and environment minister Damianos Kattar all resigned in quick succession.Kattar blasted the system as flaccid and sterile, while Abdel-Samad said the government had let the people down.Meanwhile, Lebanese MPs Paula Yacoubian and Samy Gemayel resigned, with the latter confirming two other colleagues from his Kataeb party had also quit.Yacoubian had called for the entire Lebanese government to resign - and said it was her duty to step down over the failures that led to the explosionThe apparant collapse of the government came as prosecutor Ghassan El Khoury began to question the heads of government agencies over the explsion.Lebanese people had been calling for the entire regime to go following the disaster which came after the months of anti-government protests.Joe Haddad, an engineer, told Reuters: The entire regime needs to change. It will make no dferencethere is a new government. We need quick elections.Food shortages and unrest are mounting in the city as the disaster compounded anger stemming from a severe economic crisis and the coronavirus pandemic.Eli Abi Hanna, whose home was destroyed, said: It was easier to make money during the civil war. The politicians and the economic disaster have ruined everything.And meanwhile, Prime Minister Diab said on Saturday he would request early parliamentary elections.It wont work, its just the same people. Its a mafia, said Antoinette Baaklini, whose workplace was demolished in the explosion.University student Marilyne Kassis added: It will always be the same. It is just a political game, nothing will change.The killer cargo of , tons of ammonium nitrate was confiscated in  from the Moldovan-flagged ship Rhosus while en route from Batumi in the ex-Soviet republic of Georgia to MozambiqueThe ammonium nitrate was sold by Georgian fertiliser maker Rustavi Azot LLC, and was to be delivered to a Mozambique explosives maker, Fabrica de Explosivos.It was however impounded by Lebanese authorities, and sat on the dockside in Warehouse  for six years until it blew up last Tuesday.Reportedly the blast was sparked when a reckless welder caused a fire at nearby Warehouse  - which then spread to the explosive Warehouse .Hang up the nooses trended across Lebanese social media as grief turned to fury in the days following the explosion.Sources close to the investigation blamed the incident on inaction and negligence, saying nothing was done by committees and judges involved in removing the explosives.Public Works Minister Michel Najjar told Al Jazeera he had only found out about the presence of the explosive material stashed at the port  days before the explosion.No minister knows whats in the hangars or containers, and its not my job to know, he said.Badri Daher, Director General of Lebanese Customs, told broadcaster LBCI that customs had sent six documents to the judiciary warning that the material posed a danger.He said: We requested that it be re-exported but that did not happen. We leave it to the experts and those concerned to determine why.Another source close to a port employee said a team that inspected the ammonium nitrate six months ago warned thatit was not moved it would blow up all of Beirut.Two documents revealed that Lebanese Customs had asked the judiciary in  and  to ask the concerned maritime agency to re-export or approve the sale of the ammonium nitrate.One of the documents cited similar requests in  and  - suggesting repeated warnings about the danger were overlooked by the authorities.It is a white crystalline solid and is highly soluble in water - with the chemical formula NH₄NO₃.The chemical is applied in granule form into the soil and quickly dissolves under moisture, allowing nitrogen to be released.Another use of ammonium nitrate is in the food industry where it is used as a nutrient in producing antibiotics and yeast.In most countries, it is used to make explosives for mining, quarrying and civil construction because of its low cost and ready availability.It has been the cause of numerous industrial explosions over the last three decades, including the explosion at a chemical plant in Toulouse, France, in  that killed  people.Ammonium nitrate was also used to create the explosives used in the  Mumbai train bombings.By itself, ammonium nitrate is not regarded as dangerous but under certain conditions, it can become deadly.The chemical is classied as an “energetic material” meaning that it produces heat as it decomposes.If there is a signicant amount of ammonium nitrate it can generate enough heat to catch fire and continue to burn eventually causing an explosion. Prime Minister Diab had vowed those responsible will pay the price - but the focus of the probe and public anger has turned on the regime.International aid is being mobilised across the world to help support the victims and search for the dead among the rubble.The US, UK, France, Gulf states and even rivals Israel have offered money and assistance - but Canada has refused to give cash directly to the Lebanese government due to fears of corruption.Royal Navy vessel HMS Enterprise has arrived to carry out survey work in the port to establish the extent of the damage.British engineering experts have found the blast was unquestionably one of the largest non-nuclear explosions ever to take place.The team from the University of Sheffield has calculated the strength of the blast based on the videos and photographs of the catastrophe.They believe the explosion was the equivalent of , to , tonnes of TNT.Protests mount as , people gathered at Martyrs Square and some demonstrators stormed government ministries and the Association of Lebanese Banks over the weekend.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

His charred body parts would be passed around for everyone to taste.His blood, which they saved, would be smeared over their bodies. Once the head was fully cooked, they would scalp it, remove his brain and eat it.If theyd killed Michael that was how it wouldve been done, the author said.The Dani tribe sometimes transformed decapitated skulls into pillows or used them as bowls to eat the flesh of rival tribe members.Headhunting stopped in the s. Within the tribe, men reportedly had sex with men, they shared wives, and practised polygamy. They sometimes drank each others urine and covered themselves in human blood during bonding rituals.In their eyes, killing the American was revenge for the deaths of tribesman at the hands of the white Dutch. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Now is the time and we know that you can do it.According to the authors of Finding Freedom Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand, Meghan has played a pivotal role in helping her husband become more attuned to racism.Speaking to the National Public Radio in the United States, Mr Scobie said: Harrys journey to wokeness has been very public. Weve seen him learning and educating himself along the way.But this experience of witnessing Meghan face racist remarks and commentary would have been the first time hed seen someone in his le or someone he was particularly close to affected by it in a certain way.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The First Minister admitted that ministers didnapost get this right after , pupils had their predicted results downgraded following the cancellation of exams during the coronavirus pandemic. Pupils will not all be expected to appeal against their results, Ms Sturgeon said, in an attempt to curb the growing row over the issue, which disproportionately affected the poorest pupils. The Scottish Qualications Agencyrejected nearly , recommended grades from teachers using computer models after pupils were unable to sit exams due to coronavirus. Pass rates for pupils in the most deprived areas were reduced by .% in comparison with .% for pupils from the wealthiest backgrounds. Ms Sturgeon told a daily briefing: Despite our best intentions, I do acknowledge we did not get this right and Iaposm sorry for that. She said Education Secretary John Swinney will set out a plan to fix the fiasco in the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday. Opposition parties have called on Mr Swinney to resign over the issue - and he faces a vote of no confidence at Holyrood next week. Ms Sturgeon originally defended the process but made a u-turn on Monday in the face of growing outrage. She said: We will be taking steps to ensure that every young person gets a grade that recognises the work they have done.  Our concern - which was to make sure that the grades young people got were as valid as those they would have got in any other year - perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system and not enough about the inidual pupil. That has meant that too many have lost out on grades that they think they should have had and also that that has happened as a result of not of anything theyaposve done but because of a statistical model or an algorithm, and in addition that burden has not fallen equally across our society. She added: Despite our best intentions, I do acknowledge we did not get this right and Iaposm sorry for that.

The NHS and other healthcare employers will receive £, per placement per year for both new and existing apprenticeships - benefiting those for whom a full-time university course is not practical or preferred.

Director for England Mike Adams said: This increase in places is a welcome step and we hope it will make a career in nursing more accessible for those fortunate enough to secure a place.

The Prime Minister said it was bad and stupid and dangerous and criminal for desperate people to travel to the UK in small boats. Campaigners accused Mr Johnson of using inflammatory soundbites as tensions escalated over the influx of asylum seekers arriving in the UK. More than , people are believed to have come to Britain so far this year, making the treacherous journey across the worldaposs busiest shipping lane. The Government has been accused of being increasingly chaotic in its handling of the situation - with anger over Home Secretary Priti Patelaposs request to bring in the Navy to deal with the number of small boats. But Mr Johnson ramped up his rhetoric on the issue, saying the Government would look at the law to make it easier to send migrants home again. Speaking on a visit to a school in Essex on Monday, he said: Be in no doubt whataposs going on is the activity of cruel and criminal gangs who are risking the lives of these people taking them across the Channel, a pretty dangerous stretch of water in potentially unseaworthy vessels. We want to stop that, working with the French, make sure that they understand that this isnapost a good idea, this is a very bad and stupid and dangerous and criminal thing to do. But then thereaposs a second thing weaposve got to do and that is to look at the legal framework that we have that means that when people do get here, it is very, very dficult to then send them away again even though blatantly theyaposve come here illegally.No said Brexit would make it easier to create new rules for dealing with migrants, claiming the UK was bound by inflexible and rigid EU regulations, which decide which country is responsible for considering asylum claims. Refugee campaigners condemned the Governmentaposs rhetoric on asylum seekers and called on the Prime Minister to avoid scapegoating desperate people. Lisa Doyle, director of advocacy for the Refugee Council, said: Itaposs incredibly disappointing to hear the Prime Minister using such inaccurate and inflammatory language to describe men, women and children who are desperate enough to make perilous journeys across the busiest shipping channel in the world. Seeking asylum is not a crime, and it is legitimate that people have to cross borders to do so. She urged ministers to avoid scapegoating people in desperate circumstances and instead to provide better legal routes to claiming asylum.

Hereaposs some top tips from the experts to keep babies and children cool and safe during the hot weather. Don’t cover the buggy Parents often put a blanket or cover over their babyaposs pram in the hope it will keep their child out of the sun, but a paediatrician has warned it could actually heat up the buggy like a thermos. News outlet Svenska Dagbladet tested the theory and found a buggy without a cover reached C, but when a cover was applied temperatures rocketed to C. Check their bedding The NHS advises keeping nightwear and bedclothes to a minimum for young children. Remove heavy bedding and do not cover your child when itaposs hot. It states: If your baby kicks or pushes off the covers during the night, consider putting them in just a nappy with a single well-secured sheet that will not work loose and cover their face or get entangled during the night.  Put ice in your babyaposs room Freezing bottles of water and placing them in your childaposs room at night can help to cool the air as they melt overnight.Placing them in front of a fan will also help lower the temperature of the air circulating the room, as reported by The Sun.Never leave them in the car Temperatures can soar in cars in an instant so never leave them alone in a vehicle for any amount of time, no matter how quick you plan to be. Also try to limit long drives and use plenty of breaks to cool off. Use flannels to cool them down Soak a flannel in cool water and dab it on your childaposs head and hands to help reduce their temperature. You can also give them a slightly cooler bath before bed to refresh them, but make sure itaposs quick to ensure they donapost get too cold.  Think about their clothes If their bedroom or your home traps heat and itaposs over C indoors, a nappy and a thin vest is probably all you need. When they go out in the sun, make sure their skin is covered when possible, but that the fabric is breathable and light.

Speaking on Good Morning America ahead of the bookaposs release tomorrow, he said: These are two women who really have little in common. Being a newcomer, and knowing Kate was once a newcomer, I think there were times where she knew that Meghan felt that she could have, or needed a bit more support from Kate, but didnapost get it in some of those important moments. Asked about the story of Meghan making Kate cry at a bridesmaid dress fitting, he said it couldnapost be further from the truth. Extracts of the book published last week support this point, but say there were a few awkward moments between the two women. The authors write that while there were no rows as such, there were some awkward moments between the royal wives. It is claimed Meghan had hoped Kate would reach out to her, but didnapost lose sleep over it when she did not. The book says: Meghan would agree with the assessment that the duchesses were not the best of friends. Their relationship hadnapost progressed much since she was Harryaposs girlfriend. But they were not at war with each other, either. There were awkward moments, such as the day the women happened to cross paths at Kensington Palace , and although both were heading out to go shopping - in the same street - Kate went in her own Range Rover. Speaking more generally about Meghan and Harryaposs time in the royal family, Scobie said: History will remember them as a couple who were perhaps failed by the institution of the monarchy.

The remains of Hungarian national Henriett Szucs and mother-of-three Mihrican Mustafa were discovered by police in a flat in Canning Town, east London, on April , . Zahid Younis, , who was the occupant of the one-bedroom, ground-floor flat where the two women were found, is on trial for two counts of murder. The two women had been missing for a long time before the grim discovery. Ms Szucs had last been seen in August  and Ms Mustafa in May . On the first day of his trial at Southwark Crown Court, the jury was told the alleged victims had been subject to very signicant violence.  Prosecutor Duncan Penny QC said that Younis had bought the freezer a short time after the death of Ms Szucs for the sole purpose of concealing her body. Mr Penny said police had gone to the property looking for Younis when one found a lockable freezer in a cupboard which had flies around it and items stacked on top. The bodies were discovered after the officers forced the lid of the freezer with a crowbar. Prior to their death each of them had been the victim of signicant injury, each of them appeared to have been subject to very signicant violence, Mr Penny said. The women, both in their s at the time of their disappearances, had suffered numerous rib fractures, while Ms Szucs had sustained dreadful head injuries and Ms Mustafaaposs sternum and larynx had been fractured, Mr Penny said. Ms Szucsapos blood was found on the carpet of the flat and Ms Mustafaaposs fingerprint on the oven, Mr Penny said.  The court heard that between their deaths and the discovery of the bodies, there were periods when the electricity supply to the flat had been cut off - causing the bodies to start to decompose. By April , Younis had allegedly become so paranoid about the smell in the flat and the possibility the freezer would be discovered that he had abandoned the address. When he was detained, Younis told police: Itaposs my house, itaposs my problem, no-one  is involved. He later gave a no comment interview. The court heard the two women were known to have associated with Younis in the weeks leading up to their disappearances, and belongings of each of them were found in the flat. Both were vulnerable women living somewhat chaotic lives, including periods of homelessness and class A drug addiction, Mr Penny added. Ms Szucs had met the defendant while both were patients at the Royal London Hospital.

As part of efforts to stem the spread of the virus, tracing teams working on the Aberdeen cluster have now identied  close contacts of people who have had a positive Covid- test. Everyone contacted is required to self-isolate in their home for a minimum of  days – longerthey are still unwell at this point. Anyone who lives in the same household is also required to self-isolate for at least  days. Susan Webb, director of public health for NHS Grampian, said test and trace teams had worked throughout the weekend to interview the people identied as detected cases and establish who their close contacts are. Meanwhile, eight Aberdeen players who broke local lockdown rules to visit a city bar have made a public apology. Jonny Hayes, Michael Devlin, Scott McKenna, Matty Kennedy, Sam Cosgrove, Dylan McGeouch, Craig Bryson and Bruce Anderson issued a statement saying they made a “huge error of judgment”. Two of the players tested positive for Covid-, while the remaining six began self-isolating, following their outing last Saturday after the team’s - home defeat to Rangers. Their actions caused the Dons’ premiership match against St Johnstone, which was due to be played on Saturday, to be rearranged for August . The situation also prompted First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to say she was “furious” at their “blatant” rule-breaking. In a statement issued via social media on Saturday, the players said they had made a “genuine error” and were unaware their group of eight exceeded the limit for mixing households.  They said: “As players we appreciate our club has gone above and beyond to put protocols in place to protect us and it was never our intention to put those in jeopardy, or to put our teammates or football staff at risk. “As a player group, we once again apologise unreservedly to the fans, the manager, the board and all the staff at the club.” Meanwhile, work is continuing to monitor the Aberdeen cluster and trace any close contacts of those who have tested positive. Dr Webb has urged people to take “personal responsibility” for their behaviour by following guidelines to keep others safe. “Thorough and regular hand washing with water and soap, observing physical distancing, using face coverings where these are required and avoiding crowded places are all vital,” she said.  “People in Aberdeen should observe the enhanced restrictions covering the city. “Finally, anyone who develops the recognised symptoms of Covid- – however mild they might be – should self-isolate immediately and arrange a test.” There have now been more new cases in the rampian region in the first nine days of August than in June and July combined. There were fears the resurgence of the virus in the north-east may also have led to its reintroduction in Shetland, which has recorded its first positive case in more than three months.  "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with all the days royal headlinesThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" %, rgba, rgba, url\"Get our daily royal round-up direct to your inboxWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Elena Povelyaikina, a keen boxer, was jailed for  years in the Omsk region of Russia over the deaths. She attacked a “drunk” man, , who refused to leave the family home in the village of Mikhailovka, the court was told. “At first the girl brutally beat the man, and then she took a handle from a shovel and committed violent acts of a sexual nature against him,” according to a statement from the Russian Investigative Committee.  When he died, she “carried the body over the fence and threw it on the street.” The victim was pictured but not named. Police initially failed to find a suspect. Two months later she was drinking with locals and a man named Evgeny Grebenkov, , made “unflattering” comments about her gun-toting father Pyotr Povelyaikin. Her dad, , is a “wealthy” farmer who raised her and brother Valery, , as a single parent.  “She jumped on him and inflicted many blows with her hands and feet, causing bodily injuries from which the man died the next day,” said the committee. After killing the second victim, she confessed to both murders. A local told Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper:Although small in stature, she’s strong. She was into boxing.” A witness to the second murder said: When she was beating Ivan, my sister and I begged her not to touch him.  “But we were afraid to intervene, because she is very strong. “He lay in the house for another day. “We did not call an ambulance, we thought he would recover by himself. “But the next morning he stopped breathing. State investigator Ivan Lyubyi said: The defendant first confessed to both killings, then refused to testy.  “She put forward several versions - that the first man died after he was hit by a car on the road, and the second from kidney failure, which he allegedly had. “But forensic analysis refuted these versions.” She was convicted of “intentional infliction of grievous bodily harm, resulting in death” and “violence of a sexual nature”.

Emma Johns, , from Goole, East Yorks, was diagnosed with uterus didelphys nearly a decade ago and feared she would never conceive naturally. The condition is caused when the womb fails to fuse properly during gestation and forms two chambers. She and her HGV driver fiancé Marc Kirkby, , started trying for a baby at the start of , to give them time to consider alternatives like IVFthey failed But much to her amazement she fell pregnant just a month after they stopped using contraception. Giving birth to lb oz baby Olive at Hull Royal Infirmary on November  last year, property consultant Emma said: “I really do see her as a miracle. I never thought I’d have a baby after the diagnosis. “It sounds cheesy, but every time I made a wish, blowing out my candles or seeing a shooting star, I’d always ask for the same thing – to have a baby naturally. “Now here she is and she’s completely perfect.” Emma was  when she thought she had a recurring bug until she realised that her problems always coincided with her period “It was about a year before I realised the sickness would come on around the same time as my period,” she explained. “I’d come down with the sweats and shakes. If it fell on a school day, I’d have to go home.” In  her doctor agreed that Emma’s symptoms could be linked to her cycle and prescribed the Pill, hoping this would reduce their impact. Given an internal examination at the same time to rule out any other causes, Emma was left shell shocked when the doctor announced she had found not one cervix – the cylinder connecting the womb to the vagina – but two. Emma said: “I’d never had an internal examination before, so that in itself was daunting.” She continued: “Then the GP said, ‘I think I can see two cervixes.’ I don’t even think I knew what a cervix was at the time, let alone what it meant to have two. “She told me she couldn’t be sure, but it could be a lot harder for me to fall pregnant, to carry a baby full-term and it might increase my chances of miscarrying. She continued: “Ever since I was a little girl I’d wanted to have babies, so it was hard to hear.”  Referred to Goole and District Hospital a week later, an ultrasound confirmed that Emma had two cervices and two wombs. “It was such a confusing time and all these words I didn’t understand were being thrown around,” said Emma. “A big question I had was why I didn’t have two periods, but the doctors explained that each month the dferent oies alternate, releasing an egg. “As a result, I was told it would be a lot harder to fall pregnant.” She continued: “If one month the egg was released into the right womb, the sperm would need to go and find it there and the reverse,it was released into the left. “Doctors told me my chances of conceiving were halved.” Still only  then, starting a family felt a million miles away and Emma was more intent on having adventures – so saved up for  months and headed to Melbourne in Australia in , to work as an au pair for a year. Signing up to dating app Plenty of Fish after ing home, eventually, in , she was matched with Marc. Three months into their relationship, after broaching the subject of having children, Emma told Marc she had uterus didelphys. “I didn’t want to spring it on him right away,” she said. “Instead,  we were talking about whether we wanted children and I explained it could be dficult for me.” She continued: “He laughed and said we’d just have to try harder.” Moving in together in September , initially they were going to leave it for at least a year to start trying for a baby – thinking that would leave plenty of time to become parents before they turned . But, realising the odds could be against her, the couple then decided to start earlier, so they had more time in case they had to look into other options, like IVF. Coming off the Pill in January ,  just a month later, when she missed a period, Emma’s pregnancy test turned positive. She said: “My period was late, so I bought a pregnancy test on the way home work. “I told Marc I was running a hot bath, as I didn’t want to disappoint himit was negative.”  She continued: “Then I came downstairs holding the stick saying, ‘I’ve got a surprise for youapos.” At Hull Royal Infirmary for the -week scan in April, doctors confirmed the baby was growing in her right womb, saying that, because of the her uterus didelphys, Emma would need regular check-ups. “The consultant felt my stomach and told me it would most likely look a bit wonky, because the baby was growing on the right hand side,” she recalled. She continued: “He was quite positive, but told me to keep my sights on reaching  weeks – when a baby is viable.” Alarmingly, on the day she turned  weeks, she noticed she was bleeding. Driven to Hull Royal Infirmary by Marc, she said: “I was so happy to have made it up to that point, then it all came crashing down.” She continued: “I was weeping and panicking. The doctors got me an ultrasound right away and the midwe found the baby’s heartbeat. It was such a relief.” While she was there, Emma became the talk of the ward, with a consultant and registrar askingthey could conduct an internal examination as they had never seen a case of uterus didelphys in person before. She continued: “I heard the consultant say, ‘You’ll never guess what I’ve just seen.apos” She added: “Then, before I knew it, I was being askedI could be examined by another doctor. “Obviously, it’s not the most comfortable experience, but I was happy to oblige in case it helped any women in the future.” Continuing to have regular check-ups, doctors planned to induce Emma on November  – a week before her due date – to avoid any potential complications. But, two days beforehand, she woke up in the early hours of the morning having contractions.

Posing as a street vendor, charity worker or priest, Luis Garavito tortured, mutilated and sexually abused his victims before slashing their throats, even decapitating some while they were alive, and leaving many in sickening positions with their severed genitals. Locked away after being sentenced to a record , years behind bars in Colombia, the psychopath readily described his vile crimes in gory detail to Dr Mark Benecke, the only forensic scientist he has ever agreed to speak to. Dr Benecke quizzed the monster at a prison in July  and again three years later to get into his head and find out what drove him to kill again and again. It became clear how the drter was able to lure poor and vulnerable children, including orphaned and homeless boys, to their deaths in towns across the South American country. To the average person who didnapost know his background, he could come across as friendly and sincere. But to the German expert, who once analysed the skulls of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun, Garavito was typical psychopath putting on a show. Dr Benecke, from Cologne, told : He is one of the most friendly and soft spoken persons I have ever met. [He was] very manipulative towards me in a friendly way. He is a typical serial killer who acts out his fantasies. He is a typical paedophile - soft, mild-mannered and friendly to kids and others. Garavito told me that he even pitied a kid he killed because the kid had told him of [being abused], and Garavito could relate to that due to him being sexually abused as a child all the time. Despite apparently feeling sorry for the boy, Garavito went ahead and tortured him to death. It was one of countless horric stories to emerge when the child sex predator confessed to raping and murdering more than  kids between  and , when he was in his s and s. Police suspect he has killed close to  people in his letime. Most of his victims were aged between six and . Garavito, now , gave gruesome descriptions of his crimes and drew maps to lead police to the places where he buried or dumped corpses. Colombian newspapers called him The Beast and dubbed him the worldaposs worst serial killer. He was also called Tribilin, the name for the Disney character Goofy. His sentence totalled more than , years, but there are fears he could be freed as early as leukaemia doesnapost kill him first. Many of the murders played out the same way. Garavito would stalk town centres and lure his victims with offers of paid work, cash, sweets or illicit drugs as he posed as everything from a beggar to a priest. He carried out the murders in hidden away spots, including hillsides and wooden areas on the outskirts of towns, and used the same location over and over before skipping town.  In some cases, the unsuspecting child would see the decomposing bodies of earlier victims as Garavito led them to the location. But by then, it was too late to escape. The highly organised, ruthless and prolic killer would tie up his victims and begin torturing them while downing bottles of cheap booze. When he was finished sexually abusing them he would usually slash their throats with a kne he carried around with him and leave their bodies in the open. He decapitated and dismembered some of the children. Many were found with their severed genitals placed in their mouths. Garavito was able to get away with his crimes by moving from town to town, changing his appearance and using fake names or stolen identities.  His offending was helped by the fact that the authorities did not catch on sooner that a serial killer was at work. The police did not take some cases seriously because of the victimsapos disadvantaged backgrounds, there were organisational problems, forces didnapost have funding for DNA testing and regular fingerprinting did not take place. There were several missed opportunities to bring his killing spree to an end. One was in June  when a missing boy was found decapitated and slaughtered in the town of Boyaca. The victimaposs mum found out her son had been in a shop with a stranger who was buying sweets for children. When Garavito was questioned by police, he admitted buying sweets for the children, but insisted he then left alone. Four days after he was let go, he killed a -year-old boy in nearby Pereira.  The authorities didnapost begin to connect the dots until the mass grave was found in Pereira, a coffee-growing city in the foothills of the Andes, in November . Skulls and bones belonging to  boys were unearthed, although they were initially thought to have been killed by a satanic cult. A nationwide task force was set up to investigating the deaths and explore other cases for similarities. As the murders continued, there was a major breakthrough in February  after three boys, aged between  and , were found dead on a hill outside the town of Genova. They were friends who worked in the streets selling chewing gum and fruit to support their poor families. At the bloody scene, detectives found a kne and a piece of paper with an address written on it. It turned out to be the home of Garavitoaposs girlfriend. A bag containing pictures of Garavitoaposs victims, which had been kept as trophies, and notes that described dates and details of the killings were found during searches of the girlfriendaposs flat and a friendaposs home. But the police were unable to track down Garavito and he claimed more victims. In November , the skulls and bones of  children were found in Pereira and a week later a mass grave containing the remains of  more victims. He was finally captured in April  after a rough sleeper stopped him from attempting to rape a -year-old boy in Villavicencio, but the police didnapost know they had their man at the time because he wasnapost carrying ID and gave them a dferent name. Later, when he was confronted with overwhelming evidence proving he was the serial killer Luis Garavito, he confessed and asked God and mankind for forgiveness. He admitted killing  children across  provinces and drew maps to direct police to their remains. But over time he told police he had murdered more than  children.  In December , Garavito was sentenced to more than , years in prison, but under Colombian law the most he can serve is  years. The country does not have the death penalty. He could be released next year - after serving  years - because he confessed and helped police find the victimsapos bodies. According to Colombian media, the killer has been diagnosed with terminal leukaemia. He is kept in solitary confinement   due to fears he would be murdered by fellow inmates. Garavito only accepts food and drink from a few guards that he trusts because he fears being poisoned, and he rarely agrees to leave his cell. It is said he spends his time making earrings and necklaces, and is relaxed and chatty with guards. What drove him to kill  In addition to Garavito, Dr Benecke questioned the killeraposs sister, investigators and social workers to find out how he became such a monster. Garavito was physically and sexually abused and neglected when he was a child, having been raped twice by dferent men. The Colombianaposs alcoholic father forced his seven children to work instead of attending school, forbid Luis from having a girlfriend and threw him out of the house several times after they rowed. There were genetic factors and he might have been exposed to harmful substances when he was in his motheraposs womb, affecting his brain, the expert said. Garavito left the family home in his mid teens but struggled to hold down a job and became an alcoholic. In his s he sought help for depression and told of having suicidal thoughts.

The Wat Khlong Toey School in Bangkok, Thailand, reopened its doors to its  students at the beginning of July after the relaxation of Covid- lockdown measures. But the nursery now looks a very dferent picture. Social distanced screens are in classrooms and lunch areas to protect the kids who wear face masks. The kindergarten has also installed sinks, soap dispensers and hand sanitiser outside of each classroom. There is also a temperature scanner at the entrance for when the young pupils arrive. In one photo, the kids can be seen standing in squares as they sing a song about washing their hands. With the strict measures in place, the nursery school has been open for a month and has had zero cases of Covid-. When the nursery was forced to close its doors in mid March due to Thailandaposs emergency decree and lockdown, the administration and teachers prepared measures to ensure a safe reopening. Although Thailand is now allowing schools throughout the country to further relax safety measures, the Wat Khlong Toey school has chosen to continue strict social distancing to ensure the safety of their students and teachers.Thailand has had , cases of coronavirus and  deaths, according to worldometer. The photos have emerged as all pupils in England prepare toto school in September. Boris Johnson has stood by his pledge to fully reopen Englandaposs schools within weeks despite anger from teachersapos unions and fears of a second wave. The Prime Minister has faced calls from the Association of School and College Leadersfor a Plan B in case there are local outbreaks of coronavirus.

They said I was too small after youth team level.“Usually it’s a case of, ‘He’s too small,’ being an easy excuse but I was about ft  when I was !“I was gone then, thinking my career was done before it had even started but luckily enough I got picked up by Dundee.“It went quite quick from there. I played a few U-s games, established myself and had a good season.“When they were short of players for the reserves I’d come up and join them sitting on the bench.“Luckily enough I managed to come on for a couple of games, done well and just managed to build my way up.“Next minute there was a few injuries in the first team and boys not wanting to play and I was making my full debut at Brechin away.“I was like here we go, Brechin away for my debut. I remember walking into the changing-room thinking to myself, ‘I’m buzzing,’ but looking back now I question why!“It was fantastic, though, and my career has took off since then.”One man who McDonald feels should take particular credit for his success is ex-Dee gaffer Alex Rae.Former Rangers midfielder Rae replaced Alan Kernaghan in the Dens dugout in  as player-manager and McDonald initially feared for his midfield position.He added: “I knew straight away I was done but he’s the manager at the end of the day so I was still young and ready to accept it.“He came in and he was at it. He put himself straight into a reserve game and, to be fair to him, he was absolutely brilliant.“He was a player and absolutely battered us. He was the biggest signing for Dundee when I was there.“It was such a high-profile player and manager to have besides all the Italians.“When he came in it was a bit of a wake-up call because he raised the standard as such.“He was quite hard on people but it was what the club needed at the time.“He was hard on me because he could see I had potential to go on to another levelI wanted to.“He was the same with Robbo , DickerandSwankie – the lot of them.“He helped me, to be fair, because he was a centre midfielder he helped me massively.“He was smashing people in training on a daily basis. Normally managers want you to take care in training a little bit but he was wanting you to go in hard.“If you were pulling out of a tackle, he was hammering you so it got feisty at times but he loved that everyone was playing hard for their places.“He brought that mentality to the club.”McDonald began to establish himself in Rae’s side, rejecting interest from Celtic and Everton, before moving to Burnley for £,.He was a standout in Scotland’s second tier but not at any point did he find it easy.McDonald said: “After a couple of goals you do gain a bit of confidence and then there’s the media hype and that.“It did start to feel easier as time went on. The more I played, the more I got into it and felt more comfortable.“I’d never at the time say it was easy when you’re going to places like Airdrie away and they’re absolutely battering you.”Of the transfer interest, he added: “I’d see so many people and heard so many stories of people going to Celtic and being a number.“They had a -man squad, some incredible players right the way through their set-up, such strength and depth throughout the whole club.“I had a chat with my agent and family and said I don’t think I fancy going there at all.“I knew there was a couple of clubs interested down south still. That was the swaying point and I thought I needed to give it a blast and go there.“I had the choice of Burnley and Everton and went to Burnley. I don’t know how that one worked out to be honest.“It was Owen Coyle who sold it in the end. He was incredible.”PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – United back in the big time and Danny Mullen in at Dundee\" title\"#PODCAST: Twa Teams, One Street – United back in the big time and Danny Mullen in at Dundee# # Evening \" src\"https:www.eveningtelegraph fp podcast-twa-teams-one-street-united-back-in-the-big-time-and-danny-mullen-in-at-dundee embed # secretntitiw\" data-secret\"ntitiw\" width\"\" \"\" frameborder\"\" marginwidth\"\" margin\"\" scrolling\"no\"For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

I still wanted to go back home for a few weeks to a month but unfortunately I cannot do that this summer.“It is what it is but I love staying in Dundee and staying in Scotland and enjoying all the things we have to do here because it is such a beautul place.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles.Newsletter Get top stories straight to your inbox every day.SUBSCRIBE HERE!Latest blaize_config   n t t tCancelation Offer % - Web + ePaperGet unlimited access to the Eveningwebsite and Premium Content and all the benefits of the print paper in a digital replica of the Evening  n t t t t n t t t ua. per month  u recurring subscription n n t t t n t t t tEdition: n t t t tWeb + ePaper n t t t n t t t n t t t tDuration: n t t t t Month n t t t n t tSubscribe TodayEnjoy the digital edition of the Eveningnewspaper on your smartphone, tablet and computer.Unlimited access to all articles on the Eveningwebsite.

It’s great to be part of a legacy like that.”Never-before-seen outtakes from the archives will be shown, and the documentary will revisit the passionate  fan campaign which saw hundreds of people descend on Glasgow’s George Square to demand a reversal of ITV’s decision to axe the soap.As a result, the soap remained on screens for another  years before TV icon Mrs Mack finally hung up her hat and the show was retired in .Bobby Hain, managing director of broadcast at STV, said: “Scotland Loves High Road will not only remind us all of the drama, wit and stunning scenery that made this show a hit the world over, but also recognise the key role it played in nurturing young talent and boosting the tourism industry throughout Scotland.”Gwyneth Guthrie, who played Mrs Mack from  to , said: “I thoroughly enjoyed my years on High Road.#I worked with an array of talented actors and had wonderful storylines. The programme showed Scotland in a great light – there’s no doubt the natural Scottish scenery sold itself.“I wouldn’t have said Mrs Mack was a loveable character but she was unique.

Once again, the separatists# numbers simply don#t add up.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands wardSir,Exactly two years ago I was diagnosed with stage three, oestrogen positive breast cancer.I’d just come back from a week#s holiday in Spain with Isabel and Margaret. Days before I went on holiday I’d had a biopsy following referral from my GP. Although there wasn’t a cloud in the sky, my holiday was definitely clouded by impending results#I had chosen to wait until after my holiday to get them.The journey that Monday to go to Gartnavel is one I’ll never forget. My partner Frank didn’t shut up the whole way there, obviously he was nervous. I couldn’t be bothered with the small talk and just wanted him to shut up. Obviously I was nervous and he was just trying to keep my mind off it, but I was too busy silently praying. The number  is something I see all the time so I spent the whole journey looking for the number on someone’s licence plate #I saw it everything would be ok. I didn#t see it. That might sound a bit daft, but fear does crazy things to you.Walking into the consultant#s room and finding a nurse waiting there confirmed my worst fears. #It’s a wee cancer,# said Mr Wilson. The words echoing in my head, I couldn’t hear anything after that. I remember taking a deep breath and looking at Frank. I will never, ever forget the look on his face.My only question that day was #am I going to lose my breasts # The answer was no, and thankfully Frank was there to take in what was being said my head was spinning. The question I really wanted to ask was #am I going to die # I was too scared to ask that question.I didn’t cry until I walked out the hospital, then I bawled. Frank was amazing, and he didn’t talk like a budgie on the way home.The journey home was horrendous. I was terried about telling my mum. How do you tell your mum that her only child has cancer  I hadn’t told her anything about finding a lump. I couldn’t cope with worrying about her worrying about me # butit happens again I#d do it dferently and she’ll be the first to know. By the time I got home I had no more tears left.The relief telling mum was a huge weight off my shoulders. What ensued after my initial diagnosis was two weeks of crying every day. Telling the girls at work was so emotional, and in fact I was exhausted with it all.Once surgery and treatment plans were in place I was in a better place. Time to get the head down and get on with it, and that#s what I did. I was full of positivity and determination, and I think my sense of humour helped enormously.The treatment was bad, but it was necessary. The ongoing treatment is bad but it#s necessary. I’m alive and that’s what matters. My le has changed forever, nothing will be the same. My le has been ided into Before Cancer and After Cancer  I now have a new #normal#.I don’t know what the future holds, who does, but I intend to live my le happily, positively and most definitely to the fullest!I will never forget the support, both physically and emotionally that I received from my nearest and dearest, and of course from the whole community. The strength you have given me continues, and for that I am truly grateful.Please, pleaseyou find an abnormality or you just feel something isn’t quite right, act upon it and seek attention.I know it’s a dficult time with this horrid virus but it’s important to remember that early detection saves lives.Stay safe and take care.Yvie Young, Lochgilphead"},{"url":null,"title":"your pictures june 26 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAvril Lockhart from Cairnbaan sent us this week#s photograph.Taken at Bellanoch, the photo shows the bike that Avril, as a key worker, has been lent by Alec Ohnstad of the Ardrishaig Bothy.

However, there are still numerous restrictions in place, including no operation of locks and bridges, limited services and limited staff available on the ground. This remains the position.#We are, however, pleased to let you know that Scottish Canals is planning to re-open canals to navigation in line with the announcement that Scotland’s tourism sector is preparing to reopen during phase three of the Scottish Government route map on July . Subject to the confirmation of phase three from that date, the canals will open to navigation as follows:While boats will be able to transit the canals, the operating hours and days still have to be confirmed#When the canals were closed to navigation at the beginning of lockdown, mooring customers received three months# navigation licence free of charge to June .Scottish Canals added: #We have decided to extend the concession to cover July, with mooring customers getting a credit note issued to their account next month in addition to April, May and June.#A deferment of boat safety certicates has also been further extended until September.With health and safety in mind, Scottish Canals will adopt strict social distancing, segregation and hygiene measures to minimise the risk of transmitting Covid- for the foreseeable future, including cough screens at transaction points, queue management and clear signage to remind people of the importance of physical distancing and good hand and cough hygiene."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor july 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,Communities on the A are blighted by the noise of bikers, many with illegal exhausts.Inveraray is the gathering point for motorcyclists and on a recent Saturday during lockdown around  were gathered, not two metre social distancing, and failing to adhere to the maximum eight in a group guidance.This has become the norm throughout the summer, and it seems lockdown guidance does not apply to bikers as they have been a constant feature on the roads, even in phase one.The unofficial Argyll TT goes past our homes most weekends over the spring and summer months.I have a bike licence and understand the feeling of freedom, but three-figure speeds past residential entrances, many of them hidden, is completely unacceptable.As a resident you begin to dread the weekend and sunny days. The noise is constant and intrusive for  –  hours in a day, the decibel level in excess of  dB where sounds above  dB are harmful to hearing.This is a serious issue for residents who cannot open their doors and windows, cannot use their gardens, pets are terried, it is often impossible to have a conversation, or a phone call. The noise from hundreds of bikes is explosive and destructive.The speeds are terrying, they travel in intimidating packs, the noise is threatening and the bikers have no respect for the communities they are speeding through. They pass multiple residential entrances with limited sight lines with no care for risk. The offensive noise seems to come from two actions modying motorbike exhausts and extreme acceleration in legal bikes.If a car made a similar noise, spewed out the same polluting omissions, or did the same ridiculous speeds they would be pulled over by the police, but bikers appear above the law.As technology reduces the noise pollution of cars, planes and other forms of transport, it seems motorbikes are exempt. Bikers claim #loud pipes save lives# but is safety really the motivation for deliberately creating excessive noise Noise counts as a statutory nuisance it either unreasaonably and substantially interferes with the user or enjoyment of a home or other premises or is likely to injure health.The problem on A is known to all the statutory agencies, but nothing is done.If this is a national problem, what action needs to be taken Concerned Loch Fyne-side resident Sir,I am not qualied to judge economic competence, but considering the party he represents, I think that Councillor Redman might find it advisable to be wary of the phrase #colossal mismanagement# .For my part, I would consider a degree of incompetence to be preferable to the great damage caused over the last decade to  per cent of the UK’s people, as well as to its institutions and its reputation by the cruel, self-serving, xenophobic, elitist, dishonestregime currently in Westminster.Name supplied, LochgilpheadSir,Our charity#s support for blind and partially sighted people affected by the coronavirus lockdown has received a £, boost from the Scottish Government#s Wellbeing Fund.With this extra funding we will be able to support an additional  people and respond to the increased demand for more in-depth, one-to-one emotional support.The practical and psychological effects of losing your sight can have a signicant impact on people’s well-being, and this current situation has exacerbated the anxiety and isolation felt by many.Access to essential services such as food and medicines is more dficult as is social distancing, vital information on staying safe isn#t always in accessible formats, and many of our older members aren#t always confident about using new technology to stay in touch with others.Everyone accessing RNIB#s confidential counselling service will receive eight weekly sessions with an accredited counsellor, delivered via telephone and online, with each session normally lasting an hour.The funding will enable us to reduce the waiting list for emergency mental health sessions and also let existing clients access additional sessions.The RNIB helpline is available on   .James Adams, RNIB Scotland directorSir,Every pub across Scotland should be allowed to stock and sell beer from local independent brewers, to help them recover post-lockdown.CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale has launched the #Cheers for Choice# campaign.The campaign wants these arrangements to be relaxed, and MSPs are also being urged to support the Tied Pubs Bill being put forward in the Scottish Parliament by Labour MSP Neil Bibby. The legislation would give tied pub tenants protections in law, including a right to be able to sell guest beers in their pubs.Allowing small and independent brewers to sell into all pubs will also improve consumer choice and allow pub-goers to support local brewing businesses.It also makes business sense, with  per cent of pub-goers saying they would be less likely to go back to a pubit doesn’t have a range of brews from small and independent producers.Sarah Crawford, CAMRA Director for Scotland, Kirkcaldy"},{"url":null,"title":"could a two way conversation transform scotlands health","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSome of us have learned in lockdown the importance of other people, and have been longing for these first personal contacts.There have been surprises in discovering just what is important in le, and the comfort of knowing you are not alone in your likes, as your favourite brand of chocolate is again sold out.We have also been made aware that the way we behave makes a dference to the future. It has taken a national emergency to get the government to acknowledge that it needs our compliance and, for that, must give us the information we need.Suddenly the choices we make are seen as vitally important, and we have a part to play in achieving success for ourselves and our community. Can this be a foundation for a future partnership that could transform the health of Scotland and the pressure on our services As a physiotherapist I became aware that there was little that one could do to impose solutions there had to be a relationship that involved two way listening, mutual trust and support to do what was necessary. In this pandemic Nicola Sturgeon has said that we have behaved in a way that saved lives and protected the NHS.When this is over we could be at the beginning of another le-altering journey.It will demand a huge sht in expectations. There is an amazing bias in society towards the idea of decrepitude and dependency in old age, when in fact encouraging dependency increases a slide into that very state. During past months many of these attitudes have been exposed and caused outrage but they are long standing and deep seated.If you have been trying to escape into fiction you might have no better idea of what is possible. Alison Flood interviewed crime writers about their work, and this is what she found.Ian Rankin is now writing about a John Rebus who has health issues, James Lee Burke has his detective Robicheaux meditating on mortality in his early s and Mark Billingham has slowed his Tom Thorne down a bit because he is in his s. Michael Connelly does not believe that it is credible to have his Harry Bosch with a badge and gun and still working for the LAPD, this in a country where the President is  and one of the presidential hopefuls .Worst of all, Sara Paretsky created a feisty, strong woman for her books, only to succumb to popular misconceptions and stop her age at  because she didn#t #want Vi to be helpless#.These fictional creations battle the evils they see in their society.

Perhaps for the first time in their lives they have heard the bark of deer or spotted something in nature that is totally new to them. And many will have seen footage of the animals and creatures that tentatively stepped into urban settings whilst humankind remained under lockdown.But that is changing as we ease back into a new normality.Economics and peoples’ livelihoods are, of course, firmly entwined with modern day living, human survival and wellbeing it is extremely important that we find a route to recovery and many are suffering deeply. But what we do not want to do is fall back into the same old traps that were so detrimental to the wildle, nature and ecosystems of our planet. Finding a way forward and a new balance is not just crucial for other species but for that of our own children and future generations too.Many will have been shocked at the sudden increase in fly tipping during lockdown plus the thoughtless parking and abandonment of picnic rubbish, disposable barbecues and indiscriminate toileting as lockdown eased. All have grave consequences for wildle and nature.The result is the burning, choking, strangling, trapping or poisoning of animals, birds, plants and aquatic le.Taking care of our surroundings and appreciating nature is a real joy.

It is now one of the most beautul drives in the place, and as a drive it would be destroyed.#The line from Glasgow to Oban took  years to build and finally opened in , proving extremely popular with holidaymakers for many years. The proposed branch line from Dalmally to Inveraray was never built, despite plans to #hide# the railway from the duke’s view. A plan from  shows a proposed tunnel to carry the line through the duke’s policies near to the castle.

Without action and proper investment from central government vital public services will be at risk.This news of huge strain on local authority budgets comes as the SNP is delaying in opening up Scotland’s hospitality and tourism industry. Instead of following other parts of the UK and opening the sector on July , the separatists are forcing businesses to wait until July .This delay will cost businesses millions at a time when thousands of jobs are already on the line.The SNP is risking people#s livelihoods. It needs to accept responsibility for that and take action now.Councillor Alastair Redman,Sir,People occasionally ignore the elephant in the room to support their point of view, but in his latest letter, Councillor Alastair Redman has ignored an entire herd in his living room.In his latest rant he states that the SNP is failing councils as the cost of coronavirus could hit more than £ million, but surely these costs would be the same no matter who was in power He also suggests that #essential local services have been underfunded for years# yet fails to mention the years of needless austerity cuts, actioned by his party and their collaborators, to bail out the greedy and risky practices of the banks, which reduced funding to a devastatingly low level in general. It is worth noting that the Scottish Government has put a greater percentage of their curtailed income into NHS Scotland than any part part of the UK. This has helped NHS Scotland to outperform all of the others, in the UK, for the past five years. This is paying idends now.He s to his familiar attempt to insult by referring to citizens who want to take responsibility for making and managing decisions and working to make their country prosper within the priorities set by its citizens as #separatists#. I’m glad to be described as a separatist because the alternative is to be an apologist for an unrepresentative government in Westminster and to abdicate decision making to that same out-of-touch group.It is Councillor Redman’s final point, however, that demonstrates his blinkered sycophancy. His suggestion that the Scottish Government should follow the example of other parts of the UK. Could he really be saying that we should follow the chaotic shambles and incompetence that has emanated from his chums at Westminster  Does he seriously think that any sensible person, irrespective of their own political affiliation and from any of the devolved nations, would swap what their government#s have done for the Westminster model Sadly, nowhere in his missive does Councillor Redman take time to mention the health and safety of our citizens.It is this, together with scientic advice and without political point scoring, that is driving the Scottish Government#s response to this tragic pandemic.Kevin MacKaveney, TarbertSir,Following reports of littering around Argyll and Bute, including the Isle of Islay, the issue was discussed at a recent meeting of Islay Community Council where community councillors heard that items like rubber gloves have been found dumped in ditches.It is always very disappointing to hear about littering and fly-tipping but doubly so in an area like Islay where residents take such an understandable pride in their environment.We also need to bear in mind that items like disposable gloves can pose a threat to livestock. As well as being profoundly antisocial, this kind of behaviour can be positively harmful.Those acting irresponsibly should remember that there can be serious consequences to their thoughtlessness.Donald Cameron, Highlands and Islands MSPSir,We all have a role to play in the recovery of the country’s tourism industry after its reopening on July .Scots could help by taking a trip, visiting an attraction or experience, shopping locally, dining out and booking a staycation.Scottish tourism is facing its biggest challenge in a generation and will need financial support for some time to come to help it recover. The Scottish public has a crucial part to play in helping this happen.It#s easy to not think of yourself as a tourist in your own country but many of the experiences that we often enjoy with loved ones, such as holidays, shopping or eating out, all contribute to our visitor economy.July  marked a new era for the industry as we start to welcome back visitors and take our first steps on the road to a safe and responsible recovery. However, reopening won’t be the same for all businesses, many are still adapting to this #new normal#, so it#s important that we recognise that as we move forward to try and restore our industry.We look forward to helping Scots rediscover their own country in a way that is safe for everyone # visitors, residents and those working within the industry.

Walking and cycling infrastructure needs to be improved, trees can be planted, and renewable energy can be expanded and made more efficient.Transport and food are the most obvious areas for behavioural change in Argyll. We need to be promoting the benefits of electric cars and making them preferable to petrol or diesel cars.We can easily bring food production and consumption closer together by shopping and eating more locally and more naturally. Farming in Argyll is generally quite low impact, but does not have the capacity to feed everyone in the area, meaning that we have to buy in meat which is less sustainably farmed to make up the dference. If everyone ate only the meat that is produced locally, we could dramatically reduce the emissions caused from the transport of imported meat, as well as supporting our local market and ensuring that it remains natural and sustainable. Reducing food waste is also an easy behavioural change.Acting on climate change is all about thinking of others. Across the globe, the people who see the most adverse effects of climate change so far are those who are already marginalised and vulnerable.Kindness and common decency indicate that we must act with the needs of these people in mind, with the knowledge thatwe do not act, ‘these people’ will soon become us and our children.One thing that I think would make a huge dference would bewe all took #our whole selves# to work with us.Whatworld leaders were constantly thinking: #what would my children say about my role in this decision # This kind of moral thinking would make a huge dference in the future of industry and politics, and the more we educate the next generation, the more influence they will have on their parents.Everyone can make changes such as cutting down on their meat and dairy consumption, shopping locally, re-using plastic containers, recycling, composting, reducing food waste, buying fewer new things, using a renewable energy supplier, and cutting down or cutting out air travel.At the Paris Agreement in ,  nations decided to take measures to limit the global temperature increase to . degrees above pre-industrial levels. Our current behaviour will not allow for this.A rise of  degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels will mean that large areas of land around the equator will be uninhabitable, resulting in huge numbers of refugees fleeing for their survival. Sea level rise caused by the rapid melting of the ice caps will mean that small island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu will be submerged. The combination of the loss of arable land and ocean acidication due to temperature increase will mean global food shortages, such that we have never seen before.The rich will still be able to buy food, but those who are already marginalised and vulnerable will find it increasingly dficult to access basic amenities like food and clean water, further stretching the inequality gap.It’s not too late to make changes, but it soon will be.We all need to have climate change in the forefront of our minds when making any kind of decision, be it personal or business. It is an omnipresent issue and every decision, however big or small, will have an effect."},{"url":null,"title":"science matters are aircraft vapour trails harmful","story":"Dorothy H CrawfordUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsAlthough much reduced by the Coronavirus pandemic, everyone has seen the vapour trails produced by high-flying aircraft as they streak across the sky. But what are they  and are they harmful Officially called contrails , these ephemeral, cloud-like structures are primarily made of ice crystals. They form at altitudes over , metres from water vapour in the aircraft’s engine exhaust as it freezes almost instantaneously at temperatures below minus  degrees celsius. There are, however, plenty of other volatiles and solid components in engine exhaust, including soot particles that often act as a nucleus around which the ice crystals form.Official figures show that air traffic contributes around five per cent of greenhouse gases. Yet these estimates only account for CO emissions. They do not include the effect of contrails, which can persist for hours and even expand into cirrus clouds several miles wide. These clouds, which are most abundant over North America and Europe, trap heat within Earth’s atmosphere, so do they improve our climate or contribute to global warming Air traffic has been steadily increasing year-on-year, so, assuming the coronavirus effect is a temporary one, estimates suggest that the distance flown by passengers will double every  years, and that air traffic will quadruple by . Therefore, it is imperative to determine how the increase in clouds created by contrails might affect us.In a recent study*, scientists used a climate model to analyse the future impact of contrails on climate change, taking into account their predicted increase balanced against any likely changes in engine soot emissions.The results show a three-fold increase in contrail cirrus coverage by , despite a  per cent reduction in soot emissions due to improved fuel and engine efficiency. These predictions cover all major air traffic routes and are mostly due to increased air traffic volume, although a sht to flying at higher altitudes also contributes. The area with the greatest increase will be Eastern Asia, where the largest rise in air traffic is expected.This previously unaccounted for, non-CO, climate impact of air traffic is now reckoned to have a more damaging effect on climate change than all the CO emitted from aircraft engines.*Atmos.

Here is some advice on how to take advantage of the great outdoors and get the whole family fit this summer.The summer months offer us all the perfect opportunity to make changes to improve our mental and physical health. Getting active is good for your body and mind, and there are lots of easy ways to get active. Taking a brisk walk every day will help shed the pounds, but there is nothing better than heading out into the great outdoors to take in some of the wonderful countryside and coastal sites close to home. There are fabulous woodlands, beaches and picnic spots everywhere. And you don’t have to just go walking.

Taking a holiday in the United Kingdom offers people the chance to uncover some stunning scenery, wonderful attractions and superb accommodation without having to jump on a plane. Here, we take a look at the type of places you can stay, the rules you need to follow and how to enjoy a great staycation.Scotland’s colourful countryside, breathtaking beaches and glorious gardens are ready to welcome visitors this summer.Many locations are reopening, but have restricted visitor numbers and pre-booked time slots, so we recommend looking at the official websites for attractions and organisations before you travel, so that you’re in the know before you go.The national tourist organisations of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland have launched a UK-wide industry standard and ‘We’re Good to Go’ mark. The mark means businesses can demonstrate that they are adhering to the respective government and public health guidance, ensuring they can welcome visitors back with confidence.Do remember that our four nations have dferent guidelines, advice and timescales for reopening tourism. Please respect government guidance on social distancing and also any regional lockdown measures that are provided by the respective nation.Summer is here and Britain is beginning to reopen, providing everyone with the opportunity to start dreaming about a holiday. And this year a staycation could give you some much needed rest and recuperation, while also helping get the holiday industry back up and running. Hotels, campsites, bed and breakfast accommodation and other places to stay are now openingthey can follow the guidelines relevant to their locality to ensure that their guests will be safe to stay and spend days wandering our award-winning coastlines, exploring our green spaces and getting inspired in our cities. Each accommodation provider is unique and those that have reopened have had to adapt depending on the nature of their business, including the size and type of accommodation.But these changes mean it is safe for visitors to come and enjoy a change of scenery. But even when we are away from home, we still need to follow the guidelines.Speaking earlier this month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: “As lockdown eases, we should focus on supporting the livelihoods of business owners and their employees up and down the country – all of whom are opening their doors for the first time in more than three months.“They are our local restaurants, hairdressers, libraries, museums, cinemas, and yes, pubs. They are also hotels, BBs, indeed much of our tourism industry.“All these businesses and their workers have put in a heroic effort to prepare their venues for this reopening, to work out a way to trade in a way that keeps their customers safe.“But the success of these businesses, the livelihoods of those who rely on them, and ultimately the economic health of the whole country is dependent on every single one of us acting responsibly. We must not let them down.”Mr Johnson emphasised that evenwe are now allowed to spend nights away from our own homes, we must still follow social distancing rules. When out and about, we need to remember to look after ourselves, one another and the environment around us. To make sure we’re all doing our bit to travel responsibly, just follow a few simple steps.When planning your trip, check that important facilities like toilets and car parks are open before you travel.  If you have an attraction in mind, check online to seeyou need to pre-book.Some places may be extremely popular, so get off the beaten track and discover a hidden gem.Stay socially distanced apart from anyone outside your household while walking, running, cycling, sitting and sunbathing.  Wear your face covering at all times when on public transport.  Make sure you have a bank card many outlets are currently only accepting cashless payments. Take hand sanitiser with you. Leave the car behind where possible and visit nearby attractions by walking, cycling or public transport.Heidi and Stuart Cordner have reopened their self-catering property on the shores of Loch Lomond and their family-run passenger cruise business, Cruise Loch Lomond.The -person rental property is set in self-contained grounds on the shore of the lake, and the Cordners hope guests will contribute to the local economy while being respectful.They have implemented virus prevention measures in both the property and on the boats, including increased cleaning and social distancing procedures.They have also invested in additional cleaning equipment and training for cleaning staff.Passengers are asked to wear face coverings and book in advance, and capacity has been reduced to allow for social distancing.“We live in a small community but we’re fortunate that there’s a lot of space and our main business is an outdoor activity,” said Mr Cordner.Cool Camping is a curated website of small, independently-run camping and glamping sites across Wales and beyond.  Marketing manager James Warner Smith said: “Having campfires, spreading yourself out, being able to chat with the owner of the business who’ll be able to recommend a local pub – they’re all big parts of the appeal of camping.“You’re much more likely to be pitching your tent among shrubs and long grass with a lot of space between you and your neighbours.” The company has been working closely with campsites in Wales to ensure safety guidelines are met. At the moment, only self-contained accommodation can open, so the website only allows those types of sites to be booked.  They’ve introduced a new feature on the website where each business can indicate what new safety measures they’ve put in place.  Among the most popular places among potential visitors is Pembrokeshire, with secluded spots outside of national parks all proving popular.·         Wales is open for camping from  July.Northumberland’s oldest castle hotel, Langley Castle near Hexham, has reopened to visitors, with all the appropriate “defences” in place. The castle, which has survived attacks by Border Reivers and a fire that left it as a ruin for centuries, has again been buzzing with guests who have been impressed by the sanitary and social distancing measures that Langley has already put in place. The management team makes many arrangements upfront, such as menu choices and payments, as part of the social distancing procedures that are required. Other changes affect check-in and check-out times, to enable the housekeeping team to carry out deep cleans. Executive general manager Margaret Livingstone-Evans said: “We have stayed upbeat and optimistic and have managed to generate enquiries throughout lockdown, by being creative about the ways in which we can make things happen, in a safe way.” More details at langleycastleFor more information on staying safe, please go to visitscotland"},{"url":null,"title":"creative writing how to begin","story":"Kenneth StevenUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe last few months have been a dficult and unsettling time. But it has also been a time of positive change and reflection, prompting people to be more creative. Writing, be it poetry, song writing or short stories, for example, has given many a way of making sense of this time, of sharing their feelings and looking after their mental health.For those who have found it dficult to know where to begin, Seil author Kenneth Steven offers this advice to help you start your creative writing journey.For me, there are two essential ingredients when it comes to setting out as a creative writer: time and space. By creative writing I mean poetry, short stories, novels and children’s writing: everything involving the use of the imagination.When someone claims they don’t have time to write, I don’t believe them as it’s a question of making time.PD James started writing when nursing a dying husband: he needed care all through the day. There was a part of the night when finally he went to sleep and she had the chance to put pen to paper, so that was what she did. If we are serious about wanting to write, we will make time.For many years I lived in Dunkeld, close to the entrance to the cathedral. When friends heard my address they would roll their eyes and say: ‘What a place to be. And you’re lucky enough to be a writer.’Except it wasn’t that easy. The truth is the modern world invaded even that idyllic corner of Scotland.First, there were thousands of pilgrim feet and voices. I was driven mad by not being able to find sufficient quiet. My former we watched a great deal of television. It was a tiny flat and the distant murmur of low voices maddened me because I couldn’t concentrate.It was she who suggested # probably to stop the grumbling # that I should have a cabin built in my mother’s garden in Aberfeldy, a place where I could hide away to write. After considering the idea for a few days, I realised she was right.When finally I sat down to start working in that simple shed among the trees, the words poured from the pen. I will never forget those first days. Poem after poem appeared as though by magic on the page. For me # and after many years of leading creative writing sessions, I would suggest for the vast majority of others too # finding real quiet makes all the dference.But it doesn’t have to be a hideaway in a garden it can be a living room or a bedroom or an attic – just at a time when others in the household are asleep or absent.There are few rules for creative writers, but one I have discovered is that we are all larks or owls. We’re either attracted to early morning or late evening.I have yet to meet anyone who has said they’re drawn to the mid-afternoon # what I term # hammock time, though that’s when I wrote in the Aberfeldy cabin. I’ve come to believe strongly you will use the time you are given. If that’s what you have, you will adapt to that rhythm.But I quickly came to realise in my cabin that I couldn’t simply turn on good writing like a tap. We go into our creative space weighed down by the modern world. We live lives beset by emails, phone calls and text messages. We are all expected to respond quickly.I think creative writers are generally poor when it comes to practice writing. The creative lives of visual artists, actors, singers and musicians are dominated by practice. Why should it be dferent for those from the writing community What do I mean by practice writing  Describing the view out of the window going back into memory to capture a moment as evocatively as possible imagining a dialogue between two characters. There’s no end to the possibilities. What practice writing provides is creative grounding. It brings us from being all over the place in our minds to give us creative focus.What this practice allows us to do is to start, then to pour ourselves into what I like to call deep writing. It creates a kind of doorway so the real writing can begin.Kenneth Steven is best-known as a poet. Sixteen of his collections have been published and he writes and presents poetry-related programmes for BBC Radio. He is also a Scottish novelist and children’s author. He’s written two handbooks on writing and led workshops and worked as writer in residence at home and abroad. www.kennethsteven"},{"url":null,"title":"if walls could talk","story":"Susan WindramUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsStrachur Smiddy opened its doors again on Saturday, August , after an uncertain few months due to Covid-.The museum will only be open on Saturdays and Sundays, until Sunday September , but for now families can again enjoy stepping back in time in the th-century blacksmith’s smiddy, which has been carefully repaired and restored to its original state and now acts as a working museum with with forge, bellows and anvil, cobbled floor, tools of the trade and beamed ceiling.Browse through the Smiddy’s collection of fascinating artefacts and tools.

Work has continued since then to raise money to complete the project.With the cost of the original scheme estimated at £ million, the charity decided to scale back its ambitions and make it a phased project that could be added to as funding allowed.The first priority was to remove buildings containing asbestos on the newly-purchased site, at an estimated cost of £,.More than half of this sum was granted by the A#Chruach wind farm fund, provided by Ventient Energy, but the balance was still to be found and with the building warrant to remove the buildings running out in October time was getting short.That was when A and C Building Contractors Ltd, Kenneth James Construction Ltd and M Kerr Roofing stepped in to save the day.Andy Morrison and Craig Owen, of A and C Building Contractors Ltd, approached MAYDS centre manager Fiona Kalache to find out what was happening with the buildings and how the project was progressing. They decided to contact the other firms and they all agreed to help the charity by completeing the first phase of the project for the amount of money currently available.Andy and Craig explained: #MAYDS really helped us out when we were putting together our business plan and setting up so we wanted to say #thank you# and repay the favour. We are happy to be helping a local charity, especially when it is going to create something good for the community and youngsters in the area.#Kenny MacLeod added: #It is great to see something happening for young people and for Lochgilphead. Often it seems like lots of things are happening around Lochgilphead but never in the town itself, so this is an important development that will be really beneficial.#Fiona Kalache offered her thanks to the construction companies: #This is a huge relief as we have been struggling for some time to get funding for the full costs. The main thing was to get the buildings down before our building warrant ran out, giving us a clear site to start construction of the skate park.#These builders have gone out of their way to support us by doing work in kind and reducing costs so that we can now move forward with our planned development. We are so grateful to them for stepping in to support the young people of Mid Argyll and finally allowing their vision to progress. Thanks also have to go to A#Chruach wind farm. It has funded a signicant part of the costs quoted and have continued to support us throughout.#This will make a big dference to the lives of young people in the area. Many of them currently travel through to Dumbarton to access the type of facilities we hope to offer. We plan to use the back end of the site for basketball hoops and other play equipment and hope to attract children from all over Argyll, creating a fun, safe space for young people.#Once the site is cleared, security fencing and lighting will be installed. Then work will start on putting the steel skate park jumps and ramps in place. MAYDS would welcome any help to raise money to meet the cost of this work.MAYDS works with young people up to the age of  across Mid Argyll and Islay, offering training, support, youth clubs, drop-ins, cyber cafe, trips and much more. People receiving help include young carers, young parents, young people with disabilities and young people looking to engage in fun activities or access training courses.The skate park project has received support from Lochgilphead Community Council and from Mid Argyll members of Argyll and Bute Council.Betty Rhodick, Lochgilphead Community Council member on the A#Chruach wind farm fund , commented: #I am delighted to see things progressing. Everything comes to those who wait and this will be a great thing for the area.#"},{"url":null,"title":"borders-athlete-sammi-kinghorn-appears-bbcs-one-show","story":"SAMMI Kinghorn appeared in a BBC

I think it was Michael Gove who said, Your example gives us hope. And she instantly responded and said, We dont want your hope, we want clear, cost-effective but very radical policy responses to the climate change.

Civic pride is important and hopefully this group can supplement the routine street cleaning and waste disposal work done by East Lothian Councilrsquos hard working waste workers. Itrsquos important there is a coordinated approach between the group and the council, and I would be happy to help facilitate thisit is required.Finally, Councillor John Williamson said: ldquoThe Musselburgh Renegade Street Sweepers is the latest in a number of initiatives in Musselburgh which demonstrate the growing pride in our town and a determination to make it a better place for everyone.

Amanda had been diagnosed in November  and given  weeks to live.David and Trevor are raising money for Pancreatic Cancer UK after Trevor was diagnosed with an aggressive form of the condition in November last year,  months after Amanda.His diagnosis is terminal and he has received  chemotherapy sessions.Trevor was also given  weeks to live but chose to go through treatment to extend his le.He is receiving more treatment in September.This is not the first time that the pair have embarked on a tour like this and it was this previous trip that inspired them to go again.In Christmas , David received a present to go on a motorbike ride and the following February he left with Trevor to go on a -day tour around Europe.However, they were on their trip during the Beast from the East snowstorm of early , which saw them ride through snow in mainland Europe.David, who owns a couple of coffee shops in London, said: ldquoWe went through the Swiss Alps, France and Italy and people were following us through France and beeping their horns at us, so we said thatwe ever do this again that we must do it for charity.The pair then set up their own website, called the Hairless Bikers www.hairlessbikers, inspired by lsquoHairy Bikersrsquo David Myers and Si King with their own twist, as both David and Trevor are bald.The pair were planning their next trip until Amandarsquos terminal diagnosis, with David saying the news came ldquoall of a sudden.After Amandarsquos death, David spent time dealing and coming to terms with his loss and then Trevor received his diagnosis.And when the coronavirus pandemic started earlier this year, it added to an already dficult year.The pair were waiting for Trevor to finish his chemotherapy before starting the tour, with Trevor phoning David last month and askinghe wanted to go.David told the Courier before he set off: ldquoWersquove always said we will do it but now itrsquos all go.ldquoTrevor phoned me last weekend and said: lsquoLetrsquos just do it.rsquo If we donrsquot do it now then itrsquos never going to happen.ldquoWe thought about all of the news going on at the moment andanything happens or we need to come back we are just in Europe so can easily catch a plane home.Ahead of the trip, David said he was ldquovery excited, adding he was just going to focus on riding and see what happened.He added: ldquoWe wonrsquot stop laughing, wersquoll be like little kids.An initial target of pound was raised, with more than pound, raised in a few days.David saidan average of pound a day could be raised ldquothat will be brilliant.Donate at www.facebook donate  "},{"url":null,"title":"column-tory-disarray-not-reassuring","story":"It cannot be reassuring for the Scottish Tories that their leader has only been in the position since February and has now left the party in disarray.It is clear the party do not hold Scottish Parliament seats in a high regard, given that it is looking likely that the next leader will be Douglas Ross, who is not even currently an MSP.Scottish Parliament seats require a member who is willing to commit time and effort to their constituency, they are not simply a stepping stone for jumping into a leadership bid.If you compare the Toriesrsquo leadership with that of Nicola Sturgeon over the last few months, with her clear and consistent messaging throughout the Covid- crisis, it is easy to see why polls for the SNP and independence are through the roof.I know that many are looking forward to enjoying the Eat Out to Help Out scheme, which will offer discounts of up to  per cent at restaurants and cafeacutes throughout August.I welcome this help for local businesses, and I am sure that this will benefit them in their restarts following lockdown.I would like to stress, however, that guidelines should always be followed within these establishments.That means that you should be socially distancing from those who are not from your household or extended household, and you should maintain good hygiene by regularly washing your hands for  seconds, as well as not touching your face.To keep yourself safe, it is important to use businesses that are taking these measures seriously and putting safety precautions in place to protect their customers.This week I will be hosting the first meeting of the Esk River Improvement Group.I look forward to working with them to make progress towards cleaning up the Esk."},{"url":null,"title":"tims-tales-mist-midges-memories","story":"Oh and I forgot to mention the midges, which add a particularly Highland flavour to any camping trip up north.Such was our experience last weekend after we managed to find a campsite that was open. We managed just one overnight stay in Glen Nevis.It has always been a favourite glen of mine.Its beauty challenges the majestic Glencoe, but its landscape is gentler and less rugged, and the upper reaches of the glen take you back in time, to the majesty of the ancient Caledonian forest.In the days when I was a tour guide, I always thought that mist and rain were an essential part of a trip to the Highlands.People would refer to hot and sunny weather as good weather, but Irsquod always say that in the Highlands mist and rain can be good weather too.On such days, the weather would add the veil of mystery and unpredictability that makes the landscape so intriguing.Hardly ever was the approach to Glencoe the same because of the weather it changes the landscape in ways the imagination could never predict.Swirling mists which dress the peaks, layers of low lying cloud which suddenly break to allow sparkling rays of sunshine itrsquos spine-tinglingly magical.On days of so called good weather, when the skies were a cloudless blue, I always felt there was something missing in the experience.I know all this might sound like patter from VisitScotland attempting to persuade rain drenched tourists that they are lucky to have experienced the true mystery of our country but for me it has always been true.Of course, days of endless pelting rain are no fun and can spoil a holiday, but for me, some mist and rain, in moderation, makes a Highland holiday all the more memorable.Such was our experience last weekend, with two days that seemed to be in dferent seasons.When we arrived we were lucky to be able to put up the tent just in time, before the rain got heavy.Itrsquos always an awkward moment for me putting up our tent in full view of other campers, as we struggle to remember which pole goes where and try not to look like we need assistance.It couldrsquove been easy to be despondent at the weather. Dark brooding clouds shrouded the sides of Ben Nevis, bringing rain that threatened to dampen everything but I refused to let it dampen our spirits.I recited the famous quote: ldquoIn Scotland there is no such thing as bad weather just bad clothing.We had a hearty camp stove meal and then set off for our walk in the Nevis Gorge.Itrsquos a well kent walk now, but when I was first taken many years ago before the internet it was a relatively unknown secret. I still remember the sense of awe as I heard the roar of the river below, and the sight of the distant waterfall An Steall as we emerged from the gorge.Our trick was to go on our walk when it was raining, and after teatime so we had the place almost to ourselves, well apart from the midges.Our midge repellent was gold dust, and Irsquove always found the trick in avoiding midges is to keep moving, which we did, except for once, and we momentarily paid the price.It was a walk in the childhood footsteps of my younger self, where my young children were re-pacing along the route also taken by their older siblings years ago.It was about saying ldquohere is a place important to me, part of who I am itrsquos yours now,you want it to be.Yet not saying it with words, but by making memories that I hope will last as long as mine have.The rain and mist was all part of it, and yes even the midges. As often happens, the weather began to clear as we headed back.The sun broke through and the clouds developed a sparkling yellow tint. The mountains appeared, like giants awoken and rising to their true height.Sunshine briefly warmed our faces and it seemed a gt from the gods for our endurance.The kids danced and sang the song ldquoI can see clearly now the rain has gone as they saw a rainbow.I knew the rain hadnrsquot really gone so we didnrsquot dally.We made it back to the car, tired with sore legs, but before the next dark cloud arrived.That evening we recounted our experiences in the tent, and I told stories about the Jacobites and the old Highland way of le, and the connection to the Battle of Prestonpans on our own doorstep.The kids listened, partly because we were camping and they had no screens, so no choice but Irsquod like to believe partly also because we were in a land where stories and legends are steeped in the soil and they now felt a small part of them.It lashed with rain all night. But its rage had ended by morning and the new day welcomed us with sunshine.New adventures beckoned, with other memories to impart, on what was to become our sunny day.Loch Oich, rich in family memory and where the ashes of both my parents were scattered.Then Loch Ness, a fitting end to a pilgrimage, especially for my monster daft wee boy, and his sisters who love the mystery of the story.Such was our short ldquostaycation this summer.Wersquod followed what I have always called The Road of Legends which is the title of my yet to be published novel, an abridged version of which will be serialised on this page very soon."},{"url":null,"title":"column-tourist-home-help-love-area","story":"I WAS on holiday a couple of weeks ago and on one of the days I went to the local amenity

morning cycle.As I came out from Musselburgh Lagoons towards the mouth of the Esk, I saw the magnicent sight of all the seabirds, the swans and the geese gathered at that point where river meets sea.It occurred to me then that my best holiday this year could be to live in my own place as though I were a tourist.In my own hometown, I can still be awed by unexpected beauty, delighted by the simple things that sometimes familiarity overlooks.I can take time to appreciate things that normally the hurry and the care of le make miss.Maybe being a tourist at home will help me love Musselburgh

Journalism, as Jon Lee Anderson says in his foreword, was his first and most enduring love. Reading this selection of  pieces, you canrsquot help but think that many nascent writers would benefit from an apprenticeship in a trade too often derided and underrated.When in  Maacuterquez won the Nobel Literature Prize he used part of the money he received to buy a magazine, Cambio, and relaunched it with a new set of editors and contributors, of whom he was one. Cambio didnrsquot survive but while it did its owner had a ball.What is clear from The Scandal of the Century is its authorrsquos relish for a form that requires its practitioners to be multi-talented and endlessly adaptable. The best journalists ndash and on this evidence Maacuterquez fully merits his place at the table ndash are insatiably curious and find everything fascinating, from the earth-shattering to the seemingly banal. He was a huge fan of Hemingway, who also wrote for newspapers before turning to fiction. Once upon a time in Paris, Maacuterquez spotted his hero on Bouled Saint-Michel. What should he do  Don his literary beret and express his ldquounconditional admiration or try to interview him as any self-respecting hack would  What he did was cup his hands and, ldquolike Tarzan in the jungle, bellow from one side of the street to the other, ldquoMaeeeeestro! Hemingway responded: ldquoAdioacuteoacuteoacuteoacutes, amigo.Though born in Colombia, Maacuterquez spent a good part of his le as a roving reporter in Austria, France and Italy. In From Paris, With Love, he recalls arriving in  and seeing people kissing everywhere in contrast to Bogotaacute ldquowhere it was even dficult to kiss in bedrooms. It was the time of the Algerian War, when it was the norm for anyone who ldquodidnrsquot have a Christian face to be slung into jail. The police thought he was Algerian even though he looked like ldquoa door-to-door salesman. It was, he writes ruefully, the only revolution for which he was ever imprisoned.While his career as a novelist burgeoned and critical and commercial success beckoned, Maacuterquez never forsook journalism and was forthright in denouncing General Pinochet in Chile and in his support of Fidel Castro. He was deeply critical of the US blockade of Cuba and consequently mocked as an idiot savant by hawkish Republicans. In The Cubans Face the Blockade, he reports on the effect the embargo had on the population. Even clothes were rationed. At first nine items were rationed which was upped to  within a year. Toys were next. But there was an upside: that Christmas was the first in the history of Cuba when every child received a toy.The eponymous piece recounts the story of how the mysterious death in  of a young Italian woman sparked a scandal that reached deep into Italian society and showed a more sordid side to La Dolce Vita. It runs to some  pages and Maacuterquez spins it like a thriller, artfully reminding less attentive readers to pay attention to salient facts.Several of the pieces relate to writing. All are required reading. In Misadventures of a Writer of Books, he refers to his occupation as ldquosuicidal. Most readers, he suggests, have no idea of the effort and anguish that goes into producing a book and the meagre reward their creators receive. He estimates that a good writer needs at least two years and , cigarettes to produce a book of  pages. So why write  ldquoYoursquore a writer in the very same way you might be Jewish or black."},{"url":null,"title":"blackness-isnt-monolith","story":"TELEVISION has the power to spark nationwide discussion about poignant ndash and often, uncomfortable ndash topics. And thats what the writers of Unsaid Stories hope to achieve, when the series of shorts lands on STV later this month.The four -minute dramas ndash which will air over consecutive nightsndash explore and confront racism and prejudice, and have been filmed with safety measures put in place because of the Covid- pandemic.Theyre inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, which has been ignited most recently in  by the footage of George Floyd dying at the hands of Minneapolis police.\"I just hope that people watching it maybe feel like theyre seen, that their voices are heard, and it speaks to them in a dferent way,\" notes Nicole Lecky, who has written the short titled Lavender, and is also known for her play Superhoe, which is being adapted for TV by the BBC.\"Most forms of racism arent really obviously physical or blatant ndash Im talking about the insidious racism or comments you may get ndash and we dont really talk about that side of racism.\"People think that its something that doesnt apply to them, and thats why I think its really important.\"Here, three of the talented writers ndash Lecky, plus Anna Ssemuyaba and Jerome Bucchan-Nelson ndash tell us more about the process of putting these brilliant films together.THE STORIESSsemuyaba, who used to work in TV development, is the woman behind I Dont Want To Talk About This, starring Peaky Blinders Joe Cole, and Adelayo Adedayo, who has appeared in The Capture.They play Tom and Thea, a former couple who bump into each other at a party and end up assessing the impact racism had on their relationship as a middle-class black woman and a working-class white bloke.Nicholas Pinnock, star of ITVs Marcella, and Yasmin Monet Prince, known for Amazon Prime series Hanna, take the lead roles in Generational, written by Bucchan-Nelson. It looks at how dad Oliver responds when he catches his teenage daughter Justina sneaking out of the house to attend a Black Lives Matter march.Meanwhile, Lavender focuses on an uncomfortable conversation new mother Jordanhas with her white mother Lyndseyafter giving birth to a baby with a black man.Lastly, Look At Me ndash from playwright and director Lynette Linton ndash follows a couple called Michael and Kay, played by Paapa Essiedu, who has recently been seen in the amazing I May Destroy You, and Pippa Bennett-Warner, who youll recognise from Gangs of London .The drama shows the young professionals being stopped by the police while on the way to a date, and the impact that has.PERSONAL PROJECTS\"Blackness isnt a monolith, and its really important to have loads of dferent stories,\" says Lecky, when discussing the aim of her film.\"Having a mixed-race black woman during this climate, who has white family members and finds it dficult talking about race, and still feels all the hurt and the pain of whats going on, I think its a story thats really needed. And to be cast in it too means Im able to do what I actually want to say with this piece.\"Meanwhile, Ssemuyaba wanted to show ndash through her characters who first met as children, and are now in their late twenties early thirties ndash how the way we talk about race has changed.\"In the past, I dont see colour was seen as a very progressive thought, whereas I think now everyone understands that thats not the point.\"I am a black personyou dont see colour, that means you dont see the microaggressions and the macroaggressions and you also dont see the way the world treats me dferently from people of other races.\"As for Bucchan-Nelson, who has worked in TV for a long time, and has \"often been the only black person in the room\", he felt that \"there is a perception that all black people feel the same way about most things.\"And so even with the Black Lives Matter movement, I wanted to kick off my film with two black people disagreeing on the validity of the movement,\" he explains.\"Just to shock people into sitting up and understanding that there are conversations and dferences of opinions within this community, just like every other community.\"COMPLEX FEELINGSAll the writers confide putting their stories out there has been an emotional process ndash and a surprising one too.\"This is what I love about being a writer: sometimes you dont know that you have something to say until youre given the opportunity to say something,\" reflects Lecky.\"It kind of just came out of me, really.\"\"For me, the politics of my writing is usually the subtext I Trojan horse it into a bigger and glossier story,\" follows Ssemuyaba.\"And so to do something where its very much in the foreground, it is the text, was quite emotional, but also quite daunting, because youre laying yourself out there and dealing with quite sensitive and nuanced topics so I wanted to make sure I was getting it right.\"Bucchan-Nelson, who has worked on Sky One drama Bulletproof, opens up about how researching the Black Lives Matter movement for his script had an impact on him emotionally.\"Having to pull on the real-le trauma that has inspired this is not fun,\" he elaborates candidly.\"Its really taxing to constantly read about people in the world who undervalue my le.\"But I guess the reward is getting to write something that hopefully, in some small way, works towards correcting that.\"HOPEFUL FUTUREThere seems to be more and more conversations surrounding ersity in the TV industry, but have the writers noticed a sht yet \"Id say Ive noticed a frenzy rather than a sht!\" responds Ssemuyaba. \"You just want the same level of respect and treatment as white writers.\"Were still in the midst of whats going on and Ill be excited and intrigued to see whats happening.\"\"Yeah, Ive noted something, but I think its too soon to say whether its a change,\" muses Bucchan-Nelson, before adding: \"I am encouraged by the conversations.\"There are certain people Ive worked with for a very long time, where weve never spoken about race, it just hasnt come up, and weve just worked together and weve got along, and they have gone out of their way to call, to ask me questions about my experience of working with them and how can it be better...\"I can only see it as a good thing, really.

It would only take a few thousand parental votes to go astray in May to deprive Nicola Sturgeon of that absolute majority she needs for an independence referendum.This is a full scale crisis, possibly Nicola Sturgeons worst yet. Young people are up in arms. The teaching profession is in a state of perennial discontent. The very credibility of standardised assessment may be in doubt. She will have to get a grip or face an unmoderated ldquofail in May.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

Those efforts were driven almost solely with an eye to commercial s and led to a general perception that these woods were dark, forbidding deserts as far as wildle and flora were concerned.For some years now new forest plantings by Tilhill Forestry and other forestry companies have focused on creating woodlands that encourage bioersity as well as providing commercial s that consistently outperform global stock markets.ldquoToday, there is a well understood need for the planting of new forests to create a balance between commercial requirements and the need to create forests that enhance the natural environment, Murray comments.One of the benefits of companies turning to forestry as a way of offsetting their residual carbon footprint, is that it makes money available for schemes that perhaps would not be commercially viable without additional financial support.ldquoThere are some great government grants for tree planting, but we often find customers struggling with potential projects in marginal land that just fall short of being commercially viable. This is where the investment from carbon-offsetting schemes can lt the whole project, leading to the planting of many hectares of forests that otherwise would not happened, he comments.Tilhill and other established forestry companies act as brokers to connect companies with a requirement for carbon offsetting, with landlords who have schemes that could be viable, given additional sources of investment.As Murray notes, commercial forestry does not just lock up carbon for the forty years or so that the trees are maturing. When the wood is turned into building timber, the carbon in the timber continues to be locked away for many decades thereafter.ldquoThe whole forestry industry has learned the lessons from the mistakes of the past. I walk through commercial woodlands every day and they are alive with deer and a wide iety of birdle, as well as a range of wild flowers.Many commercial forestry projects these days also include a iety of deciduous tree plantings in order to create a balance. When it comes to locking up carbon, Murray points out that it doesnrsquot matter whether the driving idea behind the creation of the forest is commercial, or a desire to restore some of Scotlandrsquos indigenous woodland. Both take carbon out of the atmosphere. However, fast growing commercial woodlands comprised largely of Sitka Spruce will lock up more carbon faster than deciduous woodlands, which mature at a much slower rate.ldquoIt is dficult to overstate the importance of commercial forestry to Scotlandrsquos rural communities.ldquoIt brings much needed jobs to rural areas at all phases in the le of a forest, from the initial planting, through the letime maintenance of the forest and in the harvesting, he says.Murray adds that as well as the wider societal and environmental values that woodland brings, through the positive impact it has on carbon sequestration, reforestation also improves an arearsquos water quality and helps with both flood mitigation and bioersity.ldquoWe are seeing a real uptick in investors who are attracted both by the idea that investing in forests helps to preserve the environment for their children and grandchildren, and by the recognition that s from forestry tend not to be correlated with the ups and downs in the mainstream equities and bonds markets, he says.The combined appeal of a goodon their investment along with the idea that they are helping to combat climate change, is stoking investor interest in the sector. ldquoForestry particularly favours those seeking long term capital gains and increasingly it will favour lsquoheritage investorsrsquo, those for whom ecological and climate change mitigation concerns rate as high or higher than concerns over the scale of monetary s, he notes.One of the positive stories over the past year was that Scotland finally managed to achieve the Scottish Governmentrsquos planting targets. ldquoThe Scottish Government has set an annual planting target of , hectares of new forest. Last year we actually achieved in excess of , hectares of new plantings, Murray says.The governmentrsquos target is set to rise to , hectares a year by . However, Murray points out that to meet the Scottish Governmentrsquos plans to go carbon neutral by , we should already be planting , hectares a year across the UK. England, which is still doing very little new planting, needs to take a leaf out of Scotlandrsquos book and get busy planting, he says.Tilhill Forestry is currently running a project called ldquo#PlantTreesAplentyIn. This is a campaign launched by Tilhill to encourage farmers, landowners and companies to plant trees on their unproductive land.As Murray explains, as part of this campaign Tilhill can help landowners and farmers decide what trees to plant and where to plant them. Todayrsquos new woodlands offer opportunities for wildle, recreation and will play a part in mitigating climate change.Planting a well-planned woodland on land that is marginal for agricultural use can help to provide shelter for cattle and sheep, as well as providing the farmer with a decent pension on retirement.This article appeared in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day series, under the topic of Nature and how we boost our ecosystems.For more information on the#PlantTreesAplentyIn please visitwww.tilhillTo participate in The Heralds Earth Overshoot Day coverage on the nd August please contact Stephen McTaggart on  or by email atstephen.mctaggart@heraldandtimes"},{"url":null,"title":"letters-surely-now-bring-end-school-examination-certification-process","story":"Reactions to the debacle demonstrate the gulf between those who design and administer the system and those who \"experience\" it. Parents, students and teachers highlight the failure of the system to recognise the hard work of learners, their application and commitment to task, together with their personal and academic problem-solving abilities ndash all skills and qualities that modern employers tell us they value most. On the other hand, politicians and examination body spokespersons emphasise their statistical processes and historical comparisons.A quarter of candidates this year have been told: Sorry, but you are not as good as youthink you are. We the \"system\" know better ndash because we have a model wersquove used before. These are the same young people ndash and their parents ndash that,Scotland is to compete successfully in the st century world, we need to convince of the value of a lelong commitment to education and training. How exactly does this contribute to reducing the attainment gap and promoting a \"can do\" culture This debacle was not an accident, the consequence of an aberrant computer glitch or systems personnel mals. The process of assessment and grading worked this year exactly as intended and designed by the examination body and politicians. Every year candidate results are manipulated, by the same process, to fit the demands of the normal curve of distribution ndash a statistical process increasingly regarded as spurious, as a mechanism for producing valid assessments of anything but the simplest of human capabilities.For those prepared to look critically at the evidence there is an irrefutable case for the abolition of current models of assessment and certication in Scotland.Students were demonstrating in Saturday in George Square and Dalkeith to protest about their treatment. They have been failed by the system. They deserve our strongest possible support.Jim Rand, Blanefield.WHATEVER the rights and wrongs of the recent SQA marking furore and the consequences that may fall from it, I think that a degree of naivety and or benign ignorance may be present in the approach and beliefs of some of those seemingly disadvantaged by apparently poorer exam results than expected.Put simply, and using mathematics as an example of a subject discipline whose \"answers\" in a test must surely be as objectively \"correct\" as is possible, it is not the case that a persons test score of, say,  per cent on the day will be the mark grade that ends up as that persons final mark grade. For a iety of reasons, that \"raw\" score is then subject to an equal iety of \"adjustments\" based on all sorts of indicators.The Bell Curve, for example, the rationale of which argues that human intelligence is substantially influenced by both inherited and environmental factors and that, ipso facto, is therefore a better predictor of many outcomes, is a common type of distribution for a iable on which the highest point represents the most probable event in a series of data while all other possible occurrences are systematically distributed around the mean. This has the consequence of forcing groups of people to be categorised as poor, average, good. Also, for smaller groups, having to categorise a set number of iniduals in each category to \"fit\" a Bell curve will do a disservice to those iniduals.Of course, none of the above in any way, diminishes the sense of anger and frustration felt by those most affected. There are many people, too, who hold that such social engineering, for whatever reason, is simply not on. However, the point is that these types of assessments  re-adjustments, and many more, are taken into account when final grades are being awarded.Consequently, those who believe, like the head of Clton Hall school in Edinburgh, that the professional standards of teaching staff are being called into question are aiming at the wrong target. Its not the teacher marking thats in any way imperfect rather its the myriad statistical contortions gone through by those who have rarely seen the inside of a classroom or struggled face-to-face with the learning dficulties of many of our youngsters that are the issue.Finally, as an anecdotal pointer to the iniable cries of marking inconsistencies that arise every year, as a teacher and SQA marker of many years, manys the time when I and other colleagues have smiled wryly at the idea of appealing for some students grades to be downgraded, such is our surprise when they \"over-achieve\". But we dont. Nor have I ever come across a student who, having done better than expected, has appealed their grade.But then, as Mark Twain reportedly said: \"Ive never let my schooling get in the way of my education.\"Gerard McCulloch, Saltcoats."},{"url":null,"title":"opinion-mark-smith-leaked-snp-email-shows-nicola-sturgeon-well","story":"Mr Smithrsquos email was actually about a pretty dull subject on the whole: the make-up of the partyrsquos executive committee, but in talking about it, he tackled one of the issues that goes to the heart of Scottish nationalism: the primacy of independence. Nationalists usually argue that Scotland would be better off economically and socially because of independence, but it actually doesnrsquot matter because independence is their top priority. Their thinking is: the economy and equality are important, but not as important as independence.This is the way, to be honest, that a lot of nationalists think, but they usually keep quiet about it because they know left-leaning voters would not be impressed. Lots of voters actually put equality as their top priority rather than the constitution and some of them voted Yes in  because they thought independence would improve equality and some voted No because they worried it would make inequality worse ndash I talked to lots of voters who think along these lines when I was on the ground with the Yes campaign in . Theyrsquore the opposite of nationalists: equality comes first, not independence. For nationalists, itrsquos the other way round.It is this kind of context that makes Mr Smithrsquos email so interesting, and embarrassing. What he said was that changes were needed to the SNPrsquos national executive committee because so much of the partys oxygen was taken up, in his words, by peripheral issues like reform of the law on gender. The BAME, womenrsquos and disabled conveners and others should lose their places on the NEC, he said, and become part of a separate forum instead. ldquoEqualities are close to my heart, said Mr Smith, ldquobut not as close as independence.:Nicola Sturgeon admits party disputes pose risk to SNP successIt is that last phrase thatrsquos the killer and itrsquos a bit unpleasant to see it written down in such stark terms ndash unpleasant but not surprising. In , Nicola Sturgeon wrote a piece for The Sunday Herald in which she said the case for self-government transcended the issues of Brexit, of oil, of national wealth and balance sheets, and of passing political fads and trends. The comment may have been less nakedly honest than Mr Smithrsquos, but it amounts to the same thing: independence matters more than everything , even ndash and this is the extraordinary bit ndash national wealth.But letrsquos not over-egg the comparison between Ms Sturgeon and Mr Smith because therersquos a big dference between them and it demonstrates why the First Minister is doing so well during the pandemic. Scottish independence transcends every other issue for her ndash she said so in The Sunday Herald ndash but as First Minister she also knows that the public health problem has to be the priority. In times of crisis, she said at the start of all this, the issues that ide us seem less important.This approach by the First Minister has not gone down well with some supporters of independence ndash the ones that take the ldquoIndependence First principle literally, or want new pro-Yes parties, or are aching for theof Alex Salmond, like Aslan from Over-The-Sea. We also shouldnrsquot be too lenient on the First Minister ndash pupils and parents caught up in the SQA debacle, for example, might disagree that she has put independence to one side to concentrate on domestic matters.However, for another constituency of voters, Ms Sturgeonrsquos approach is playing very effectively and probably explains why her party, and its cause, is doing well in the polls. Scotlandrsquos first SNP government, from , knew it was more important to look responsible than pick fights with London and it was relaxed about passing motions which allowed Westminster to enact laws on which there was common ground and it played well with voters. The same is happening now: Ms Sturgeon knows itrsquos important to look responsible in a time of crisis and itrsquos playing well with voters.The fact that the First Minister has handled the crisis in this way reflects well on her the way in which shersquos getting it right is also demonstrated by the way in which Alyn Smith got it wrong in his email. Mr Smith said equality was close to his heart but not as close as independence whereas the First Minister has backed off on the pronouncements about independence because she knows it would sound wrong during the coronavirus crisis.All of this has led the First Minister to a pretty clear interpretation of whatrsquos been happening for her party, as well as a strategy for the future. ldquoRight now, she says, ldquothe majority of the people in the country we serve are worried about their health and theyre worried about their ability to pay their bills. Opinion polls would suggest they massively trust the SNP to lead them through that crisis. If they ever thought the SNP was turning away from that priority and focusing on its own agendas and engaging in in-fighting Im sure they would pass a verdict on that.\":Lord McConnell in stark SQA warning to Nicola Sturgeon and John SwinneyI think itrsquos hard to disagree with that analysis, but it creates two problems for Ms Sturgeon. First, there are many in her party who disagree with her and think the focus should always be on the agenda of independence first and the disquiet is likely to get louder the longer the First Minister ldquofocuses on what matters to people rather than independence.However, the second problem is potentially more serious. The dissenters in her party ndash troublesome as they are ndash will ultimately, always, support independence, whereas the voters impressed by the First Ministerrsquos handling of coronavirus may be more fickle. At the height of a crisis, theyrsquove liked the First Ministerrsquos tactics and style, but as coronavirus drops down the agenda and independence s to the top of it, they may not be quite so happy. The First Minister and leader of the campaign for independence has been guided by her head rather than her heart.

His left hand is now so weak he cannot squeeze a tube of toothpaste. \"The endgame of MND is being paralyzed, your mind left whole to review the progress of your condition whilst being prisoned in a body which you cannot ,\" said Davy.\"This is a dficult conclusion to face in le for anyone.

Thatrsquos on us.She also said she still had confidence in her education secretary John Swinney, who will now be in charge of fixing the mess.After the SQA botched exam results in , the then Labour education minister was moved to a new job.Ms Sturgeon said: ldquoIn a very dficult and unprecedented situation, we took decisions that we thought on balance were the right ones, and we took them with the very best of intentions.ldquoThese were broadly the same decisions that have been reached for England and Wales as well.ldquoBut our concern, which was to make sure the grades young people got were as valid as those they would have got in any other year, perhaps led us to think too much about the overall system, and not enough about the inidual pupil.ldquoThat has meant that too many students feel that they have lost out on grades that they should have had, and also that that has happened as a result, not of anything theyrsquove done, but because of a statistical model or an algorithm.ldquoAnd in a addition that burden has not fallen equally across our society.ldquoSo despite our best intentions, I do acknowledge that we did not get this right and Irsquom sorry for that.ldquoBut instead of doing what politicians sometimes doo and dig our heels in, we are determined to acknowledge that and put it right.Ms Sturgeon went on: ldquoThere are deeper questions we will need to resolve for the longer term, about the impact of exams on the attainment gap and the dference between exams and teacher judgement.ldquoBut the most immediate challenge is to resolve the grades awarded to pupils this year.ldquoWe will not expect every student who has been downgraded to appeal.ldquoThis situation is not the fault of students, so it should not be on students to fix it.\"Thatrsquos on us. And we will set out tomorrow exactly how we intend to do that.Last year, the national attainment rates at A to C for National , Higher and Advanced Higher were . per cent, .% and .% respectively.But when teachers estimated the grades for their pupils after exams were cancelled because of the lockdown, the rates jumped by .,  and . percentage points respectively.The SQA then looked at past yearrsquos data, including inidual school data, to reduce the pass rates to what it considered more realistic - .%, .% and .% respectively.As the overestimation was greatest in schools in deprived areas, the subsequent reductions were also greatest for those schools, leading to claims poor pupils were being treated unfairly and marked down because of their schoolrsquos track record, not their own efforts.In the question and answer session at the daily briefing, Ms Sturgeon said the governments priority was to \"recty\" the SQA situation, and backed Mr Swinney, despite him approving the SQA approach that has now falllen apart.\"I accept that we did not get this right, therefore the onus will be on the government to fix this.\"She added: \"I dont attach any blame to the SQA for this. This is ministers responsibility.\"She said she understood many pupils would think it \"deepy unfair\" that they were being graded by an algorithm.She said: \"Im not prepared this years cohort of pupils, particurlarly those from the most deprived communities, to think that their hard word does not countthe system is determined to be against them.\"Ms Sturgeon said had done \"a lot of soul-searching and a lot of listening to young people\".Teacher estimates which would have seen a Higher pass rate of % among young people from the most deprived backgrounds, compared to around % last year.Last week, Ms Sturgeon said that% increase in a single year was\"unprecedented and thereforenotcredible\"Asked about this following the announcement of a rethink, she said: \"I didnt say teacher assessments are not credible.\"I said an overall outcome that led to a -point increase in the pass rates -and when I used those numbers last week I was talking about the bottom % in terms of deprivation -that I didnt think that outcome would be seen as credible.\"She added: \"What Im saying now is I think, whatever the view of that is, in my mind now a bigger problem is leaving an impression with young people that it doesnt matter how hard you work at school, some algorithm is going to get in your way.\"Im not prepared to have that, and that is why we will set out the alternative approach...tomorrow.\"Shortly before Ms Sturgeon spoke, Labour published the text of its no confidence motion.It urged MSPs to record their lack of faith in Mr Swinney ldquoin light of his mismanagement of schools education and in particular of this yearrsquos awarding of grades to Scotlandrsquos school pupils and the unfairness of the system applied by the SQA.Scottish Labour education spokesperson Iain Gray said: ldquoJohn Swinney has presided over the greatest scandal in education in Scotland for decades and for five days refused to acknowledge any failure.

It is now Scottish Labourrsquos task to inform the Education Secretary that the people of Scotland have no confidence in him.The Scottish Tories have said they will support the motion, but the Greens, whose votes would be critical to it passing, have stopped short of that in their otherwise stinging criticism.Green MSPRoss Greersaid:ldquoIrsquom pleased that the First Minister has now acknowledged that her government got this wrong and apologised.\"The working class young people who were unfairly treated last week need an urgent solution to this unacceptable situation.\"The Education Secretarys statement to Parliament must announce the kind of systemic solution the Greens have demanded, otherwise our confidence in this governments ability to discharge its responsibilities in education will come into question.\"Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said Mr Swinney has  hours to put together a package of measures to fix the SQA exam results scandal.He said:ldquoWe will listen to John Swinneyrsquos proposals in Parliament andwe are not satisfied with what he puts forward, we will vote to remove him.ldquoThe Deputy First Minister cannot casually blame the pandemic for his failures. For months he was warned repeatedly to turn back before it was too late. There was another way and he rejected it.ldquoWe need a solution to this chaos, and we need to hear a compelling case for why John Swinney should be the one to carry this out.ldquoIf the Education Secretary had listened to teachers and experts and acted earlier, thousands of young people would not have been put through a system that denied pupils equal opportunities and reinforced inequalities.\""},{"url":null,"title":"nicola-sturgeon-not-rule-extending-aberdeen-lockdown","story":"The First Minister said more than half of Scotlands latest Covid- cases are in the NHS Grampian health board area.Speaking at the Scottish Governments regular coronavirus briefing, she said there have been  new cases of the virus across Scotland in the past  hours and provisional figures indicate  of these are in Grampian.However, Ms Sturgeon said she is not able to say how many of these cases are linked to the Aberdeen outbreak that led to a local lockdown being introduced.She said there have been  coronavirus cases in Aberdeen since the start of the local outbreak on July .Of these,  were linked to the Covid- cluster and  contacts have been identied.The First Minister praised the work of the contract tracing teams but warned she expects cases and contacts to rise further in the days ahead.She said an extension of the Aberdeen lockdown cannot be ruled out but restrictions will not be kept in place longer than is deemed necessary.She said: \"Having done it, we need to make sure we do it long enough to get the cluster and the outbreak under control and so I cant rule out and wont rule out the possibility that we may have to extend for a further seven days.\"Aberdeens lockdown will be reviewed on Wednesday.Ms Sturgeon added: \"More generally, the events of the past fortnight have been a reminder of how fragile Scotlands overall position is and that is the same in countries across the world.\"The fact is we all still need to be really careful right now and Aberdeen is very hard proof of that fact.\"While our lives have regained a bit of normality in recent weeks, nobodys le should be feeling absolutely normal at the moment.\"Covid is still present and we know it is still highly infectious so all of us have a big role to play in keeping it under control.\"The daily overall new cases figure across Scotland is down  from the  confirmed on Sunday and takes the total people in Scotland who have tested positive for the virus to ,.The First Minister said no deaths have been recorded of patients who tested positive for coronavirus in the previous  days.There have been no deaths under this measure for  consecutive days, with this total remaining at ,.Of the people who tested positive,  are in hospital - up six from the previous day.

The idea of a \"postcode lotteryrsquo is now firmly embedded.Reporters, researchers, politicians, and placards have all repeated ious versions of Ruth Davidsonrsquos claims in the Mail on Sunday that ldquothe most disadvantaged pupils were more than twice as likely to have their grades lowered than wealthier students. It has become such an article of faith for so many that it is incredible to realise that it all stems from a basic statistical misunderstanding of a single set of tables.The only data thus far available to compare estimates and moderated results by relative social deprivation, are  tables in the SQArsquos Equality Impact Assessment. These tables comparethe percentages that would have achieved a C-grade of betterthe estimates had been accepted with the equivalent percentages after moderation was applied.It is true that they show that the percentage achieving Grades A-C was reduced by a greater amount for pupils from areas of higher deprivation. The obvious interpretation is that such pupils must have been more likely to have had estimates downgraded. Simple conclusions from statistics are often misleading.The tables tell us nothing about estimated As or Bs being downgraded to Bs and Cs and so provide no basis to conclude whether any group has been more likely to be downgraded.Intuitively, the most likely phenomenon shown by this data is that the more deprived groups were likely to have included a larger number of estimated borderline passes. If all groups are then treated equally they end up with more such passes downgraded but not because of unequal treatment.For the statistically minded: imagine twp frequency distributions with dferent means and a pass mark to the left of those means. Now move them both left by the same amount. Yoursquoll get tables very similar to those published by the SQA.That of course is no consolation to the pupils who have narrowly missed a C grade, but what about the situation at other grades  Although the SQA has not published such statistics, it is likely that the situation is reversed at Grade A. Intuitively, because of the higher number of A estimates to begin with in less deprived areas. Or, for the maths geeks, repeat the thought experiment but with a higher cut-off point to the right of the mean. It seems very likely that the number of estimated As downgraded will have been higher for more affluent areas ndash this is just the reverse effect of what happens at Grade C.If, as is starting to seem likely, the grades awarded are revised to match the estimates, the most striking feature might be the large number of extra A grades for rich kids. Such are the unintended consequences of basing policy on a simplistic analysis of data.That nobody seems to have noticed this is perhaps the truest indictment of our education system.Andrew Morrison, Dunfermline.IN the past twenty years there has never been a release of school examination results that met with universal acceptance. It will never happen. It cannot happen. Politics demands it so.Previously, any cohort of students in any subject, which had two or three per cent increases yearly, would be criticised as showing subject matter being \"dumbed down\". Conversely,two or three per cent reductions are recorded yearly, then criticism is voiced that exams are being set too dficult. If subject results are static, then the complaint is that progress is not being made.The usual subjects ndash CfE badly designed poorly implemented, teachers pay too low and staff over-stressed, classroom assistants under resourced and the like ndash have all been eclipsed this year by the Covid  pandemic.The option of having no results awarded this year would never have flown.The assessing by teachers resulted in high over-estimates and the SQA algorithm model is the outcome.A wonderful coalition has now come together through Ian Gray, Donald Ross, Willie Rennie and Jamie Green united in favour of taking teachers assessments at face value and removing any SQA equalisation to past pass levels. .Just how does this now work With pass marks this year raised % on last year, come   in months time, are we to see every student in every exam receive a top grade  Why bother with examinations  Alternatively, next year sees a huge fall in pass marks to equalise this years leap The total number of places at Scottish universities and colleges will never equal the number of secondary schools passes. Therefore evenevery student received A graded passes there will still be an entry sting process and disappointment is now moved from the school pass stage to the tertiary selection stage.Every possible solution offered in this matter will fail some faction in society.Robert Wolfenden, Biggar.THE calls for John Swinney to resign are ludicrous. We have to recognise that teacher estimates are far from infallible. I once predicted a D for a pupil and in the exam he scored A ndash although my other predictions were broadly consistent.A moderation process was essential, since the average prediction was  per cent better than typical of former years exam results. To have allowed the predictions to stand unmoderated would have been unfair to pupils of previous years.If ire is to be directed anywhere it should be towards the school, or even the inidual teacher, whose predictions in previous years had been seen to be consistently over-optimistic. With due consideration at appeal, we would hope that cases of genuine underperformence will be recognised and rectied.James McKelvie, Carmunnock.NOW that the SQA has developed a robust algorithm to adjust results down, it can be used regularly in the future to adjust for deprivation by increasing grades. This would have the effect of allowing for inequality, encouraging effort, boosting self-confidence, and achieving the policy goal of reducing the attainment gap. Win, win and unarguable logic given the current detriment logic.Bob MacKinnon, Inverness.IS there room for an alternative view of the importance of examinations and education in these stressful times Writing as someone who left school with a couple of dodgy Highers, I can tell young people who have been disappointed in their results that this is not the end of the world or even the road, its only the beginning. Having sought employment in an occupation which genuinely excited me, I was interviewed by some \"suits\" in London. The interview ended in a bit of a barney between one of the interviewers and my rather bolshie self about politics . I left the interview room thinking \"Oh well, Ill just have to think of something .\"I was rather surprised therefore to be accepted on to a training course against some quite stf competition, and which led to a long and interesting career. It turned out that they were looking for bolshie young people who would stand up for themselves.However, that was only the beginning of my education. I eventually graduated with honours in History with Frenchfrom the Open University, at the age of . As most people of my age will tell you, education is a le-long experience, both for good and ill. I spend more time reading and learning now than I ever have before.My message to young folk at thiscrucial time in their lives is: believe in yourself stand up for yourself argue your point with anyone who will engage and just make friends with those who wont above all keep learning from every experience you encounter and dont worryyou fail from time to time.John Jamieson, Ayr.WHILE I agree that the disruption to young peoples education has a massive effect, I would say that a positive outlook has to be kept. I did not have the opportunity to go to university, but I have always read widely, and I educated myself.

The council is also looking at ways to fill gaps in childcare provision for children under two and after school care for older children.The move is in tandem with schools and marks a signicant milestone in the Government’s “route map” out of lockdown as Scotland continues to make good progress in suppressing COVID-.OIC executive director of education, leisure and housing James Wylie said the focus is very much “getting it right for every child” in ing to these services after a challenging period of many months.“The decision to close Early Learning and Childcaresettings has had an impact on the lives of children and families throughout Orkney,# Mr Wylie explained.#There was little time to prepare, or scope to explain, the changes to our youngest children. Their relationships and friendships were abruptly interrupted as well as their learning.“Our focus must be on supporting children when they are in settings, to form a secure and emotionally resilient attachment base which will stand them in good stead as they grow and develop.  Nurturing and attached relationships are essential to creating the conditions for children to flourish in early learning and childcare.“All children have a right to play, to learn and to access experiences that meet their physical, social, emotional and cultural needs, and they have a right to associate with their peers. The health and wellbeing of children and adults is vital and these important rights and considerations have all been factored into the development of a framework for reopening and delivering ELC services.“We now know that young children are less likely to be affected by or transmit the virus. This means we are able to reduce some of the restrictions on ELC delivery laid out in previous guidance. However, we cannot yetto normal ELC practice – we all need to ensure that we continue to manage services and mitigate risks.”Mr Wylie pointed out that every child will have dferent levels of required support. He explained that some children have additional support needs and it will be important as part of the risk assessments carried out to consider the inidual needs of a child. Where there is a need to work in close proximity with adults and children the appropriate safety measures should be put in place based on that risk assessment.There will be a short transitional period for introducing our youngest children back into their learning and childcare services this week and this will y within each setting. The aim is to have all children, where possible, back into their settings by August .In line with government advice, there will be no requirement for physical distancing between children in nurseries. In nurseries two metre distancing will not apply between adults and children as, this does not meet young children’s social and emotional needs. However, adults will need to stay two metres apart wherever possible.Similarly, no PPE is required when undertaking routine educational activities. However, staff will continue to follow existing guidance on PPEit is required. Enhanced hygiene measures will be undertaken where necessary.Anyone showing symptoms of COVID- should not attend the childcare setting.A list of FAQs has been compiled to assist all as settings reopen their doors — they can be found here www.orkney.gov.uk CV-EL-FAQcopy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The village of Dounby is only slightly older.The story begins with Hosen Market, which was held three times a year at Geoth, north-east of the present village. According to my grandmother, Johina Leith, nee Kirkness, who was born at nearby Newhouse in , and wrote some notes on Dounby, the market began at Hosen in Birsay but drted across the parish boundary to Magz o’Geoth’s ale-house.Grandma was told that, after Magz gave up her ale-house, JosephMackay, who had built the Smithfield Inn, was responsible for the market’s next move.“It would be good for business to have the market near the ale house, so Josie marshalled public opinion into taking up a public subscription to buy a stance nearby with proper title deeds. According to George Wylie, in his book, Showyard on the Heather, , the subscription to buy the land was raised in . But Josie and the market had arrived on that spot almost simultaneously, four years earlier.The West Mainland Agricultural Society was formed in . Two years later, they advertised a Cattle Tryst at Dounby, “for the dispersal of the Best Fat and Grazing Stock of the district.New roads and steamships meant that farmers could export and Dounby Farm, between the main Harray and Birsay road and the new junction road through Sandwick, was the obvious place to sell animals.  is also the year that Josie bought land at the junction from Magnus Smith, owner of Dounby Farm, and built his inn. He married Margaret Davie from Firth in  and by the following year, according to the Orcadian, inn and market were thriving.“The market stance at Dounby, it is believed, is the best in the mainland… It is central and easy of access from all quarters, being held at the intersection of two roads. There is a good and commodious inn on the ground, conducted in a superior manner by Mr and Mrs Mackay, where a iety of refreshments can be had and a rest enjoyed. Sometime in the s, Josie built the larger Smithfield, which held the inn, the Post Office and one or two other businesses over the years. Grandma thought that it was probably the Post Office who fixed the name of Dounby Farm onto the village. It was certainly settled by , when the Dounby Public School opened.The first Dounby Show was held on a field loaned by William Hourie, tenant of Dounby Farm and was a great success. There were over  entries and more than  spectators. I was amazed to find that my g-g-grandfather, Robert Leask of Coldomo, Stenness was one of the prize-winners. It must have been quite an operation to get the animals to the Show then. Grandma had fond memories of the days before cattle trucks.“At one time it was interesting to watch the animals come up from Dounby, past the corner and then turn for Harray, Birsay or Evie, each with their tickets on. At the dinner in the Smithfield Hotel on the evening of the first Show, it was suggested that there should be a Flower and Produce Show and it was held in the Dounby School just six weeks later. After that first year, the two shows were on the same day and the crowds flocked to Dounby.The stock show was held on Dounby Farm until the Society bought five acres of uncultivated land from James Flett of Curcabreck in  and built a wall around it.copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

DaoineNow there is much within the machinations that occupy the precious time of our Comhairle officers that could well be regarded as relatively ‘trivial’, although I will fully concede that even the most improbable deliberations might well form the centre of somebody’s entire universe.But when we, as a community, or section of that community, continue to press for answers and resolutions to a subject that has already been explained fully to us, then we should ask ourselves one important question: “Are we doing this for the greater good, or because we are trying to promote our own agenda ”. about some of the material that was included in the Scottish Government’s RSHPguidelines and how I felt that some of it was completely over the top for inclusion in any classroom.Several concerned parents had written to me, asking what on earth was going on.I enquired of both the Director and Chair of Education and Children’s Services as to the validity of these concerns.I was happy to note that the ‘plot’ wasn’t as sinister as had been portrayed by some ‘concerned’ groups both within the counciland on anti-social media.Some alleged that the Comhairle were somehow, through the back-door and under the cover of the Covid- crisis , trying to sneak through an agenda which went against the “moral values of this community”.An inflammatory accusation, one that was sure to ignite passions and ring yet another Pavlovian bell.Except that, far from being subject matter that was about to get rammed down our children’s throats, not just ‘promoted’ it was simply an extreme example of what was included for reference, should anyone wish to avail themselves of it.Yes, some of it was fairly graphic stuff and, as I’ve said before, I was hugely alarmed that it was even considered for anything to be found in our classrooms.But, as is the case with material which has been taught in our schools for at least a couple of centuries the devil is in the detail .Luckily we have seen teachers, historically, opt to use the message of love, forgiveness, compassion and mutual understanding from this particular tome ignoring the more sinister aspects where death, retribution, punishment and all kinds of nastiness are very much front and centre.Choosing your testaments wisely is what this is primarily about.We are lucky to have an educational framework where common sense prevails, otherwise there could be very many distractions in the subjects of Biology, Geology and quite possibly Physics.I attempted to be amusing about a topic which has very legitimate, obvious, and serious, implications for our most impressionableyoung people.I hoped I was taking a cue from people who think that a banana dipped into a jar of Nutella is a suitable metaphor for something.Possibly the obesity crisis I think a jar of Bovril might have been funnier.If people wish to identy as a Unicorn and have sex with the pavement, then that’s fine too, but not surely for inclusion in ‘guidance’ material.Yes, I have to admit that I also jumped onto the bandwagon, until I had the situation clearly explained to me and was told to trust the teacher’.They will be given the ultimate discretion and they know best what’s appropriate for their young audience.We do ‘much ado’ well here.When ‘Ironside’ and ‘Bob the Budget Builder’ steered the Comhairle and helped many local businesses through the worst of the effects of the ongoing pandemic, we turned inward and focused on upholstery.With Bernie, Angus and the Education Department, all under immense pressure to get a hugely problematic school year underway on time, we are more focused on what won’tbe getting taught, rather than what will, and how.Andour kids come home from school with a penchant for strange combinations of fruit and nut sandwiches, then it will have been discussed with the Head Teacher and Parent Council first.A lot of the contentious issues which occupy us here in the Western Islesare perceived to exist somewhere between a conservative, culturally protective, radically Christian, ‘right’, and a somewhat more progressive, more liberal, secular, bunch of left-wing snowflakes.Most of us are somewhere, far more certainly and squarely, in the middle trying to make sense of it all.If we cannot empower and trust our teachers to do what’s best for the most vulnerable amongst us, then we will have failed both.The man of the week, last week, certainly in the northern half of this county, was the irrepressible David Black.Three rounds crammed into  hours saw him claim the Thompson Bruce Trophy at Stornoway and take an early lead in Scarista’s  ‘Blue-Riband’ event.Rounds of +  around Lady Lever Park on Friday and Saturday saw him edge out Eddie Rogers,  +  by just a single shot over  holes.A further shot adrt saw Murdo ‘Griddy’ MacLeod,  +  in third slot.Iain ‘Juke Box’ MacKay won the handicap trophy with two excellent rounds of nett  for a  total.In between his Thompson Bruce exploits, Davie also posted the leading score in the, two-round, Harris G.C. Club Championship.His  was  shots ahead of nearest challengers, Billy Fraser and Cal Robertson, both on .Starting with six straight pars, he succumbed to bogies at the ‘amen’ of corners, the deadly-deceiving brace of par-s at   .Naturally he bounced straight back birdies at the new th, and the th brought him back to level.He swapped a birdie for a bogey at  and  to see him home safely.Only a sht in plate tectonics will see him throw away this lead.Midweek at Stornoway saw the Glennie Trophy claimed by Iain Moir on  Stableford Points. Starting his opening four holes, five-over par, couldn’t have been good for his confidence.He was just one-over for the next .In the Junior section, Calum Gbounced back from his recent humblings at the hands of brother, Geordie H in the Par Bogey competition.Six ahead of the course, he demolished the rest of the field by  clear shots.In the Scarista midweek competition, Billy Fraser kept up his, season-long, decent form, partnering Chris Sutton to a fine win in the Pairs Greensomes.Their  was two ahead of Russell Tennant and Alan Gunn’s, .Benbecula’s finest continue to battle it out for their season-long Order of Merit, Dami Steele ing a semblance of normality, bouncing back from a week out of the top spots to consolidate his lead at the top.His round wasn’t, however, good enough to claim the full points last Tuesday evening, Domhnall MacKay storming to a -pointer and the maximum Point haul.Apparently Donald has been keeping his powderdry and intends, after a decent sabbatical, to make a strong charge over the coming weeks."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/TOURISM-2-copy.jpg","title":"litir do luchd ionnsachaidh","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na Daoine.’.

The rest were reduced by a single grade and she has missed out on As in English, Biology and Modern Studies, as well as a C in Higher Chemistry.Eva said to have her grades knocked down so signicantly has made her “completely reconsider her career path”.Exams were cancelled this year because of Covid- and replaced with estimated grades based on past attainment, and the school’s previous exam record.The modelling system adapted by the Scottish Qualications Authority reduced the grades of around , results, with analysis suggesting youngsters from poorer backgrounds and historically poorer performing schools suffered disproportionately.In her letter, shared almost , times on Twitter, Eva said that “it was clear” that her grades had been signicantly adjusted “because I go to a school classed as underperforming”.Her letter calls for the system, which she describes as discriminatory, to be urgently investigated, adding: “The government has been pushing the ‘no wrong path slogan’ but why should pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds and deprived areas be forced into a pathway they didn’t want and worked tirelessly to avoid”.Eva had been predicted in her fourth year to achieve  As and two Cs at national five level, but in her exams she improved to come out with five As and a B.She added that her school’s recent performance had been affected by staff shortages.She had stayed behind after school for extra tuition, aiming to secure a university place and a career in the field of medicine.“Any further efforts by pupils to achieve higher grades in schools which have historically underperformed has been disregarded, she added.“SQA results this year have been more about fitting the statistical trends than the inidual pupil.”According to the Scottish Government#s own statistics, the estimated . per cent of most deprived pupils who would have expected an A-C band at Higher was lowered to . per cent by the SQA#s moderation system. By contrast, for the least deprived pupils, the predicted . per cent for A-C grades was lowered to . per cent.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that it would not be “credible” to have accepted the high pass rates as recommended by teachers.The First Minister and education secretary John Swinney both urged pupils to appealthey feel they have been treated unfairly.Both Highland Council and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar have said overall pass rates in the region were up on the previous year"},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Shieling-on-Barvas-River-I-F-Grant-Collection-Edinburgh-Central-Library-2-scaled.jpg","title":"digging where we stand memories from the airigh shieling for a post covid new","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineOur hyper-globalised, high-octane way of le was stopped in its tracks in a matter of weeks, and many of us found ourselves confined to our local communities, with a great deal of spare time on our hands.The TaD team have – fortunately – been able to continue working from home, and over these past few months I have been lucky enough to have conversations with some of our contributors and their families, speaking about recordings from the past, but naturally reflecting on those times and comparing them with the situation we find ourselves in today.One conversation of note was with a relative of a contributor who was recorded in the early s., the ethnologist and previous TaD columnist, Mairi MacFadyen, referred to Alastair McIntosh’s idea that we should ‘dig where we stand’ in order to find meaning and to regain a ‘sense of place’.Mairi then explains: “The idea is that by researching and learning about our own history and the place we are living, we – as iniduals and as groups – can regain some control over the understanding of our lives and our inter-connectedness..”, or the shieling. – the seasonal moving of livestock and people, still practiced today in many parts of the world including the mountainous regions of Norway, Alpine and sub-Alpine Europe, and the Pyrenees.In the Highlands, the practice was widespread until the early to mid-th century when much of the moorland on which the communites had their shielings were claimed by the landowners and used for sheep runs, and for hunting., where the contributors are well aware of the custom of going to the shieling in their parents’ and grandparents’ generation... # of the sheep.Historically, this allowed the unenclosed crops in the township to grow undisturbed, and it allowed the livestock to take advantage of the superior seasonal grazing on the hills.. – the first day of may.The flitting took a lot of effort, but it was also a time full of excitement, for man and beast:., including cats for hunting the rats, but according to Donald MacDonald, dogs were not taken to the àirigh.On the first day the men would prepare the shieling huts, and the women would prepare a meal for everyone who had helped with the move, before leaving the children and younger women once everything was prepared.In Lewis the people stayed at the àirigh until the beginning of August., and they would come home at the weekends to go to church, often bringing fresh milk with them.. recited here in  by the Rev.

Both creations have been made by the hands of very talented local Cullybackey people.Shellinghill Park in Cullybackey has for some time been the focus of the ‘CCP In Bloom’ team. Colourful flower beds and neatly mown grass has been the focus of their attention - until now.  Following permission from the Mid and East Antrim Council, the park has just acquired a beautully sculpted horse made entirely from horse shoes. This is a unique piece of art which has given the village something to appreciate and be proud of. The creator of this horse is Bertie McNeilly, who is a leading member of the village Bloom team. He is a self taught sculptor who created this le size sculpture using nothing but recycled horseshoes. The shoes were supplied by a local farrier. This specially designed sculpture is something which has added another dimension to their in bloom activities and, being made from horse shoes, might even bring us good luck in any future competitions!Bertie said he had this challenging task in his mind for some time.“We, in the Cullybackey Community Partnership, are always looking for something which will enhance the village and will also appeal to our “In Bloom” judges. It was a big undertaking but I enjoyed the experience,”he said.  Cullybackey Community Partnership are very grateful to Bertie for his generosity in letting them have the benefit of his undoubted skills.They also thank Council for allowing them to use their ground to displaytheir latest acquisition.Knitted flowers displayMeanwhile, CCP have also been working on a knitted crocheted display of flowers in the last few weeks in honour of the NHS and to those who have supported them throughout this crisis. They are all made by people living in and around the Cullybackey area and each have their unique style.  This display can be seen in the Maine Business Centre window . The idea came from local lady Barbara Montgomery who assisted CCP Margaret Murphy to put together this amazing display.Margaret said as well as taking the opportunity to recognise the NHS and all support workers, she would like to thank the Cullybackey people who have taken time to knit or crochet hundreds of flowers to enable them to “put on this amazing display.”CCP have continued throughout this lockdown period to enhance the village with numerous floral displays which has resulted in the village looking amazing!

We have seen a rise in the number of confirmed Covid- cases, the R number increasing and a delay in the reopening of non-food serving pubs.These developments underline the stark reality that the coronavirus is not fading away. It is here for the long term and remains highly infectious. It needs no second invitation to spread.The people of Northern Ireland have done really well in terms of following public advice during this pandemic. Many younger people put their lives on hold to protect their parents and grandparents. Many people at most risk shielded for many months and many people saw their livelihoods suffer. Great sacrices have been made and many lives have been saved as a result.But there have been worrying signs that fatigue has led to carelessness and that some complacency might be creeping in.We remain deeply concerned that Covid- cases could peak sharply here in the autumn or winter. Whether this happens or not is up to us all. The virus doesn#t have a plan - its spread depends on our actions.The consequences for many iniduals and for our health service could be extremely serious - not least because health and social care provision is always especially fragile during winter.However, we should not be defeatist about the months ahead.As ever, the challenge involves plotting a sensible course between complacency and panic.With a sustained collective effort across society, we can stay on top of the situation. We can keep protecting ourselves and others, especially those most vulnerable to the virus.We now know much more about Covid-. We have built up our testing and contact tracing infrastructure and we have some more effective treatments. This remains a vicious virus which can be lethal for many and we need to protect them.As ever, everyone at all levels of the health and social care system will do their best to keep the population as safe as possible. They will not be found wanting. Now that the clapping has stopped, please continue to protect our health service and staff by doing the right thing.Every citizen has to play their part. That means following five key steps:Watch your distance: Keeping your distance remains essential when you are out and about. Remember, the virus doesn#t spread itself. People spread it.Wash hands well and frequently: This is particularly important after touching hard surfaces.Wear face coverings in enclosed spaces and where social distancing is dficult: This is now legally required for certain indoor settings, including shops. Don#t be a droplet spreader. And when you are not wearing a face covering, cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze.Co-operate with the Test, Trace and Protect programme in terms of getting tested and self-isolating when required.Download the StopCOVID NI proximity app to support contact tracing and help break chains of transmission.Given what we have been through as a society this year already, these five steps are surely not beyond us all.Watch, wash, wear. We really must do it to get through it. This is a responsibility on all of us.Dr Michael McBride is Chief Medical Officer and Professor Ian Young is Chief Scientic AdviserBelfast Most ReadNew IRA boss Thomas Mellon ordered Derry mayhem after teen arrestGerry Adams set up Loughgall ambush, claims new bookBangor hotel gives ecstasy sex attacker his old job backCoronavirus: Northern Ireland records first death in four weeksWoman who comforted John Hume in wake of Greysteel breaks silence after  years,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Fty years ago, to mark our centenary the Tele ran ‘The Kind of Ulster I Want’ competition. The young people of Northern Ireland in  were invited to pen a short essay detailing their hopes and dreams for peace and harmony in the future - and what NI would look like in the future.. At the time, -year-old Valerie McCambley, winner of second prize in the - age group, won a £ voucher which she said she would be putting towards a trip abroad with school the following year. “We must realise now before it is too late, that we are tomorrow’s Ulster,” wrote Valerie. “We must affirm that  is now for our history books, but  is for us.”Meanwhile, Jeffrey Nelson, from Belfast, wrote that he “would like to see Ulster full of happy people who have nice homes and who live in peace with their neighbours”.He said he was going to buy an Action Man with “real hair” with his £ consolation voucher. As we gear up to celebrate  years of publication, the Belfastwould love to hear from those past competition winners to find out what they make of Ulster in  - how they ended up spending their voucher.

We also had a wedding on one occasion for a lady who sadly didn#t live very long afterwards but it was a lovely moment.Now, after volunteering and providing refreshments for patients for a remarkable  years between them, the pair, who have become firm friends, say the time has now come for them to hang up their aprons.Liz added: We talked about it at the end of last year and came to a truce that because we had been together for so long that when one went so would the other.We both enjoyed our time here and the feeling of being useful but we wanted to leave while we were still fit.

The solution will be found not on the basis of victory for either, but on the basis of agreement and a partnership between both. The real ision of Ireland is not a line drawn on the map, but in the minds and hearts of its people.” It is hard to describe John Hume as anything but a Hero. His building of a lasting and sustainable peace in Ireland is why he shall be immortalised in history. John could be compared with the greats of Irish Nationalism like O’Connell and Parnell, but the truth of the matter is that John was in a league of his own. googletag.cmd.push  As part of the post-conflict generation, we have John to thank for ensuring that we were able to grow up in a society without violence in our streets, we have John to thank for the fact we can walk any street in Derry with no fear, we have John to thank for guaranteeing that peace would prevail and that the gun would no longer have a place in Irish politics. I find it hard to imagine how Ireland would look today without the influence of John Hume. John’s gt to people all across Ireland and people my age was ironic for such a beloved peacemaker, he taught us how to fight. He taught us how to fight against injustice, how to fight for equality, he taught us how to fight for freedom, how to fight for love, peace and how to fight for a better Ireland which we all can share. He fought with non-violence, he was a pacist, even when confronted with threats, bombs, bullets, and death all around, his morals never shted an inch. John taught us that living for your moral convictions was more righteous than using violent means to achieve your aims. googletag.cmd.push John Hume serves as an example to our post-conflict generation of what we can achieve when we put aside what ides us and instead celebrate what makes us equal. To young people he has shown that we can, in his words, “see an Ireland of partnership where we wage war on want and poverty, where we reach out to the marginalised and dispossessed, where we build together a future that can be as great as our dreams allow.” John’s influence is everywhere throughout the great nation he called home, whether it was through his work in founding the Credit Union movement in Derry and becoming the youngest ever President of the Irish League of Credit Unions, as chair of the University for Derry Committee, his involvement as a civil rights movement leader, his work with the Derry Citizens’ Action Committee, the founding of the SDLP, his positions as MP, MEP and MLA, his role in the ceasefire talks, his work in America or his participation in delivering the Sunningdale Agreement, the Anglo-Irish Agreement or the Good Friday Agreement, John Hume’s le’s work is an indelible inspiration to everyone who calls Ireland home. For me, personally, John Hume is an inspiration, he was a true political titan. I have been asked a number of times since John’s passing why I think everyday people are taking John’s death so personally, here’s why, I feel that John is inextricably linked to everyone in the North, his successes guaranteed that our lives and the lives of our children and grandchildren could be brighter. I think one of the most important lessons we must remember is that John Hume’s work is not finished. We still have to dismantle sectarianism within our society, we still have to work with all shades of the political spectrum, regardless of how much we disagree, in the pursuit of what is best for the people of Ireland. We still must protect civil rights and peace all across the globe from being corroded. We must work together to make a New Ireland and a Shared Ireland, where all people are equal. That is the Ireland John lived for and we must live for too, not only Derry but all of Ireland Mourns John Hume. Go raibh maith agat John, you were truly Ireland’s Greatest.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The facility would link up with the new Magee medical school to train future doctors. The Derry News has learned that plans for a ‘capital build’ project at the Derry hospital are at an ‘early stage’ but have been costed. The development comes shortly after the news emerged on Friday that Ulster University’s Graduate Entry Medical Schoolis now recruiting students for September  intake. The Western Trust has and will be the main partner to the medical school. Professor Louise Dubras, who will lead the course, appeared at a Western Trust board meeting to update members on the GEMS on August . googletag.cmd.push Speaking at the meeting, Mr Alan Moore, Director of Strategic Capital Development, offered a ‘hearty congratulations’ to Prof. Dubras. He made reference to on-site teaching facilities at Altnagelvin Hospital which were included in the business case. In response, Prof. Dubras said: “We costed in to our business case the requirement for a capital build at Altnagelvin Hospital to determine the amount of money that would be required for that. “What our expectation is, is that we wish to work with the Trust and Queen’s University Belfastto have a building which serves everybody and I think it’s really important that this is not two universities, two buildings and duplication of everything. googletag.cmd.push “We’re not big enough to do that and it doesn’t provide good education, the only way that this will work well as we move forward is to have a provision which covers all undergraduate education and that enables post-grad activity to take place there. “That’s really important for students to see and work with foundation year doctors and doctors at other stages of their training so that what you have as a Trust is a culture of education and growing educational excellence in the area – and a single place, which is the hub, is where it needs to happen.” TENACITY Addressing the meeting on behalf of the Trust, Dr Catherine McDonnell expressed her admiration for Prof. Dubras’ ‘patience and tenacity’ over the past two years for ‘sticking with the project’ to deliver a medical school in the North West. She said it is ‘extremely important’ to the hospital in terms of stabilising the medical workforce and creating local jobs. To clear up some ‘confusion’ there may be about the nature of the medical school Prof. Dubras pointed out that it’s not a post-graduate medical school for people who are qualied as doctors and doing a master’s degree. She explained that this school will accept students who will be trained as doctors and their degree could have been in any subject as long as they achieved a :. It will be situated within the faculty of Le and Health Sciences. “The medical school is about supporting local young people and improving the economic potential of the region and tackling long-term social deprivation.” Work is ongoing to refurbish buildings at the Magee campus in readiness for students next year. Prof. Dubras said staff recruitment is an interesting area and people have already expressed an interest in coming to Derry to work. Chairman of the Western Trust board, Sam Pollock, said he believes the medical school will help attract staff to address the ongoing issue of agency costs. Director of Performance and Service Improvement, Mrs Teresa Molloy, said there has been extensive interest from partner organisations such as Fermanagh and Omagh Council about the long-term benefits it could bring. EARLY STAGE In , the Department of Health commissioned a Review of Medical School Places which recommended that Northern Ireland needs  more medical students a year to meet the increasing demand for doctors. At last weeks meeting Prof. Dubras pointed out how the medical school with start off with  students and discussions are continuing with The Executive Office to increase that to . Currently, approximately % of medical graduates in Northern Ireland tend to stay and live within  miles of Queen’s University Belfast after graduation, according to the GMC. The new School of Medicine at Magee will address departmental recommendations by providing access to medical education in the North West, positioning theDerryCity region as an attractive place to study and work. Students will benefit from access to clinical placements across the full range of general practice, medical and surgical specialities with primary care-based experience from week one. This will enable students to develop knowledge and appreciation of the interconnectivity between primary, secondary, social and community-based healthcare. A spokesperson for Ulster University confirmed: “Ulster University continues to engage with local partners including the Western Health and Social Care Trust on medical education. “Discussions around joint additional training sites are at a very early stage and no plans have yet been agreed.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The start of the summer. A time of hope. A time of new beginnings. To celebrate my th birthday, my friends and I had travelled to Belfast on a minibus on a school-night in the middle of A Levels for that momentous YES concert. We were thrilled to get to see Ash and Bono at the Waterfront. We were extra ebullient at the sight of John Hume taking to the stage. The unlikely trio of David Trimble, John and Bono were applauded with yells of “Yesss!”. googletag.cmd.push  The burning pride deep inside on that night could have set the world alight. To the friends I had yet to meet, some of whom were at that concert, I would always be Proud Mary from Derry. I had come of age just in time to vote in the referendum three days later. Not all of us would have that privilege. My sister, Deirdre, who was singing and shouting her heart out for the entire excursion, was  months shy of voting age. In fact she would never get to vote as she was killed in a car accident we were involved in  months later. googletag.cmd.push I had meticulously studied the Good Friday Agreement text during the referendum campaign. As excited as I was to be on my way to Loch an Iuacuteir for Cuacutersa na Casca that Good Friday, my inner political nerd was sorry to be missing all the TV and radio coverage. No mobile phones or social media in those days. Just two days before the signing of the Agreement, I was at Stormont with a delegation of Derry Girls lobbying the British Government for a new school. I was on The Thornhill Talks Team with Mrs Boyle, Miss Hamilton and Head Girl, and my lelong friend, Emmylou. The eyes of the world were on these negotiations and the hand of history was on our shoulders. John Hume took time out to facilitate the meeting withMinister of Education, Tony Worthington MP. John was the architect of the unfolding momentous peace accord, but he was focussed on bread and butter constituency issues. He knew the importance of education in creating opportunities and building inclusive and peaceful communities. I was engaged in current affairs and local politics from a young age. I was fascinated by the work of my godfather, Uncle Mark. His job as John Hume’s parliamentary aide brought him to ious countries. He gted me with great stories and good lessons over the years. I proudly flaunted a “Hume for Europe” Tshirt in . I read newspapers. I listened intently to the kitchen wireless and followed the TV debates. Always rooting for John and rehearsing the Humespeak: You can’t eat a flag. Spill sweat, not blood. Respect ersity. An accident of birth. Dference is the essence of humanity. This language is now common parlance. John brought others on to his page and round to his way of thinking and speaking. It is impossible to consider John’s achievements without recognising the influence of his we and key adviser, Pat. On completion of my A Levels, I had the pleasure of working in the Bayview Terrace constituency office in the run up to the first Assembly elections. I learned so much about public service, not least in witnessing the compassion and care shown by Pat to every person. The office was buzzing. Phone calls were coming in from journalists, humanitarians and politicians from all over the world. I could hear John speaking in French on the phone one minute, then dealing with a constituent on a housing issue the next minute. Pat had time and warmth for everyone. Amidst the flurry, Pat still found time for banter and indulged my frivolous chats about nights out. I still regard Pat as a mentor and hero. I can only try and imagine the extent of sacrices made by Pat and her family over the years. After that short stint in the office, I spent three months working in Seagate , before starting my chapter at Queen’s and all the adventures that came with that and after that. The Omagh atrocity that summer was a stark reminder of the fragility of the hard-earned peace. John Hume was a political giant, a living legend and an international statesman. Above all, he was a Derry champion. He was a man of global thinking and local action. First-hand experience of poverty in his community motivated his relentless quest for social justice, and his role in founding the credit union movement was instrumental in giving opportunities to people and families. His civic leadership in the community was as impressive as his political leadership on the world stage. John Hume was a man of vision. Steadfast in his ambitions. Resolute in pursuit of solution. Willing to work with anyone. Determined not to be distracted by the viliers. He kept his shoulder to the wheel and his eyes on the prize. Not any of the acclaimed world prizes he won . Ultimately the prize for John was the prize for everyone: peace and the prospect of a brighter future. Those coming of age today face immense challenges as we emerge from a global health pandemic and enter a world recession. Climate emergency is real. In this part of the world we face the added challenges of Brexit uncertainty. Today’s generation need an injection of the hope that my generation were given  years ago. We still have much work to do. The “isolation of the West” remains a pertinent issue. The fight for a proper university presence in the city continues. “I sometimes wish it was that summer again…..” We should always maintain a little bit of that summer, even in the middle of the longest winters. The spirit of partnership and reconciliation underpinning the Good Friday Agreement and defining Hume’s pathway must be restored. And we shall overcome.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Entering the school foyer you’re struck that John Hume sits alongside illustrious company in what must have been a golden age of thinkers and creators. A bust made in the Derry man’s honour rests between two gentlemen who excelled in their own fields in Seamus Heaney and Brian Friel.  Each of these men attended the former Bishop Street school around the same time and went on to become giants in their respective disciplines. googletag.cmd.push John Hume’s own journey at the college began in  . “He told his mother he was going to the College and she said, ‘no you’re not, we can’t afford that’, but he passed his Eleven Plus and got in,” current principal Finbar Madden said. Hume was part of the first generation to avail of opportunities through the introduction of the Eleven Plus. It allowed more young people to continue their post-primary education which may go some way to explaining why men like Hume, Friel and Heaney grasped the opportunity with both hands. There was obviously ‘huge talent and ability’, Mr Madden said, as Hume left the school with a scholarship to study at university. googletag.cmd.push He had ambitions of joining the priesthood at the leading Catholic Seminary in Ireland, St Patrick’s College, Maynooth. Hume didn’t complete his clerical studies but instead opted to serve his community in another way. He graduated from the National University of Ireland in  with a bachelor’s degree in French and history and went on to receive a master’s degree. Returning to Derry, Hume would became a teacher at St. Columb’s. Mr Madden said that career lasted from -. At the time, the history curriculum was limited in schools and Hume taught the subject in a broader sense, keen to instil his vision of Ireland’s place in Europe. As he departed, transitioning into a career in politics, some of the key developments in the civil rights movement were starting to unfold. That, however, wasn’t the end of his journey with the school and his legacy endures. The colleges former pupils association present an annual award - the Alumnus Illustrissimus Award - to a past-pupil who has achieved something of major signicance or has made a considerable contribution in his own field. In , the Most Reverend Dr Edward Daly received the inaugural award and the following year John Hume would be recognised for his contribution to politics and peace in Northern Ireland. Mr Madden said: “The school is able to boast of many exceptional students who went out and made their mark locally, nationally and internationally. “The award recognises achievement whatever the field may be sport, science politics, religion and so on.” A proud College boy, Hume maintained connections over the years and wouldfor prize giving ceremonies. “He presented a facsimile of his Nobel prize to the school,” Mr Madden pointed out next to the assembly hall, “and our politics A-level prize is the John Hume prize in government and politics.” “And for as long as he could, he would come every year to prize-giving, he usually turned up unannounced but we always expected him to come, until unfortunately he wasn’t able to. “He had a very, very clear sense of his connectedness with this school and he never lost that right throughout his le. “In a way that many others weren’t able to do, by his connectedness here, by his presence, he was making it clear that St. Columb’s College meant a huge amount to him. “He recognised what the college had helped him to become.” The school’s principal believes that pupils have looked up to Hume over the years and used him as a source of inspiration in their own studies. Mr Madden concluded: “I think Colum Eastwood said it last night, John Hume was Ireland’s Martin Luther King and we recognise that Martin Luther King had a dream and did all he could to achieve it. “I think John Hume did exactly the same thing here.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The club have never tasted adult championship success. With the manner of victory over Glenullin on Sunday afternoon, it would suggest that consistency will be what Eamon Gibson will be looking from his squad during this condensed season. It leaves John Heaneys side with some soul-searching ahead of their clash with Limavady this weekend. From the way Ben McCarron careered through the Glenullin defence in the opening seconds, until the final whistle, they never looked like being reeled in. If anything, they shouldve won by more. If they are to stand up and be counted when the serious heat comes on, they will need a more ruthless streak in front of goal. The pleasing thing for them, they appear to have the raw materials. googletag.cmd.push They will have to take somewhat of a reality check. Glenullin didnt offer the threat many expected and showed signs of the form that found them in relegation trouble last year. It was a big ask for Michael Oacuteg McKeown in his first game in goals to replace the injured Pearse McNicholl and when they failed to secure possession at midfield, it was a long hour for him. Steelstowns runners through the middle hurt them and with Ben McCarron playing as a third midfielder, their mobile attack thrived in the space. Dermot OKane, one the best dead ball kickers in the county, was off colour and Eoin Bradleys relaxed  metre free coming off the post summed up a day they will want to forget. googletag.cmd.push Stephen Cleary played in the reserve game, but was forced off injured and  minutes into the senior game Eoghan Bradleys ankle injury saw him replaced. On came Rory Maguire who had while he had a terric game, he will be disappointed not to have bagged three further goals. Cahir McMonagle will be another option in attack, but its hard to imagine him getting the room he was afforded yesterday when the real action comes to town. Glenullin put Conor Rafferty onto Neil Forester in what seemed like a curtaining job, while Feargal Close pushed back on to Gareth Logue. It was Logie who dictated the game and even when Gerard OKane was sent out to mark him, the Steelstown mans movement caused Glenullin trouble. Steelstown were three points ahead when the first goal chance presented itself, but it fell to Glenullin. Dermot OKane picked out Paul Rafferty in front of goal but the low pile-driver was instinctively turned onto the bar by goalkeeper Marty Dunne. Seconds later Jacob Duffy had the ball over the bar at the other end. Brothers Dermot and Gerard OKane kicked two terric point, but it did little to stem Steelstowns incessant running game. Whoever is going to stop them, cant afford to drop off. They will need a half-forward line that will occupy them and top the overlap. When the first goal came, it was a majestic diagonal ball from full-back Shane OConnor who found Logue in space and his unstoppable shot went to the bottom corner of McKeowns net. Ryan Devine floated over a fine score from distance before Jacob Duffy made the second goal, with the strong-running Maguire blasting to the net. Steelstown missed three point chances before Maguire was blown up for over carrying when through on goal, almost ashe was caught in two minds to flick to the final support runner. Glenullin brought on three substitutes at the break. Brian Mullan was pulled out from goal with Eoin Bradley now stationed at full-forward. Early in the second-half he won a free but somehow spurned it from close range. He missed a chance in front of goal and the attacking unit didnt have the movement that would have tested Steelstown. At times Brian Mullan, who kept trying to push Glenullin forward, tried to float balls forward. The dference being was that the same space wasnt there that Gareth Logue made for the city men. The half took seven minutes to produce a first score. The move began with Dunnes monstrous kick over midfield, Rory Maguire was again involved and when the ball came from a Mark Foley, he was brilliantly denied by Eunan OKanes ing block, before Foley drilled over the . Then came a moment Gibson and his assistant Raymond Tracey wont be too happy with. Mark Foley had the ball at his feet in front of goal, with time to engineer a chance. He opted to lazily soccer the ball to Jacob Duffy who missed without working goalkeeper McKeown. On another day, this lack of urgency could be crucial. Ben McCarron and Darren McDaid, from opposite wings, floated over two sweet scores. And still the goal chances kept flooding in. After a neat move, McCarron and Jason McAleer created another opening but Maguires thundering shot hit the bar before spinning over. Maguire also brought out a fine save from goalkeeper McKeown who brilliant clawed the rebound clear, as the Steelstown attacks kept pouring forward. The chances Steelstown were mounting and missing had no bearing on the result. At the other end a fisted Eoin Bradley effort dropped into Dunnes arms and Conor Rafferty fired over when a goal was on, but it was always going to be Steelstowns day.

The fact he was man of the match in a dominant team tells enough about his performance. The finish for his goal combined power and accuracy to the bottom cover. With Ben McCarron playing further out, it was Logues running that made th Steelstown attack tick. MOMENT OF THE GAMEDUNNE SAVE – There were many scores in the game, but Marty Dunnes save was something . Dermot OKanes ball came in from the wing and Paul Rafferty just pulled on it along the ground and when the shot zipped off the turf, Dunne somehow got enough on the ball to prevent a goal that wouldve levelled the game in the thminute. TURNING POINTQUICK POINTS – While the first half goals gave Steelstown a , having Eoin Bradley lurking at full-forward meant they could not rest easy at the back. There were seven points between the teams with  minutes gone, but in the next five minutes Foley, McCarron, McDaid and McMonagle chipped in with scores to kill off the game.   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

When he tossed a ball in the direction of his six year-old son Barry in the back garden, Barrys reaction was the watershed moment. Instead of catching the ball, he opted to put out his chest. Soccer was his first instinct andColeraine were going to take the first step out of junior football, teaching the basic components, as early as possible, was the priority. Otherwise soccer was always going to have first call on the youth of the Coleraine, Portstewart and Portrush triangle. googletag.cmd.push Fast forward  years and Barry would develop into a wing-forward and top scorer on Derrys  All-Ireland winning minor team and play at senior level for the county.   “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it.” SEAN McGOLDRICK  Richard Carey and Mark McTaggart were other future senior championship winners to go through Coleraines first underage coaching initiative. Armed with long-serving Kevin Mullan, Vinty McMahon and Brian Daly – whose son Barry scored the winning goal in the  final against Lavey – Sean set to work in Dominican College. It had to start somewhere. googletag.cmd.push “It was a question of handling a ball, kicking it out of their hands and running with it – as opposed to dribbling it and chesting it,” McGoldrick said in an interview before the  decider. What Coleraine have achieved with their persistence is nothing short of magnicent. And not against a backdrop of GAA tradition in the area, but one they grew themselves. The hub of it is the McGoldrick family who have formed the spine of teams, but imagine what could be done with the numbers in Derry City. Then again there are not many people in the world like Sean McGoldrick. This column has previously highlighted the lack of players to play senior football for Derry from outside the top flight. Of the  players, in the last  years, only  hail from non-senior clubs. From the city point of view, only Neil Forester, Eoghan Concannon and Ben McCarron from the city have played for the county at senior level. Thats a very sobering thought. Is all the money being invested worth it  You would have to wonder. It is dficult to break the mould against soccer, but more recently it is a totally dferent issue. Many young people in the city are not involved in any sport and the once vibrant Derry and District soccer league has been struggling. Whether we like it or not, unless the city can be properly harnessed then Derry, as a county, are always going to be fighting an uphill battle against the superpowers who are challenging for Sam. The college scene in the county is vibrant, with teams challenging for titles on a regular basis. St Patricks Maghera have led the way for years. St Marys Magherafelt – while having a signicant Tyrone and Antrim representation – have given Derry players a chance to play at a high level. St Pius had qualied for the MacLarnon final. St Colms Draperstown have been punching above their weight - despite picking from two clubs - and St Patricks and Brigids Claudy played in U finals. In Derry City, St Columbs Derry had a strong spine of boarders on their  Hogan Cup winning team. In more recent times, it has always had key players from outlying clubs Claudy and Craigbane. A worrying trend is that, apart from their MacLarnon team, the rest of the younger teams are playing at Grade C level in the new Ulster Schools format. A more recent development has been Cathair Dhoire, the amalgamation team in the city, which gave players in the city a taste of MacRory Cup football. The beauty of the Ulster Schools scene is that players can play at a higher level than they are getting at their club, often at a time when their club team is idle and against players from all over Ulster. It is a great bridge to county minor level. Any school coach I speak to, the first people they credit for success are the coaches in the feeder clubs. At the end of the day, a school just polishes the players and mould them into a team. If, as expected, money becomes available for Derry City to follow what Dublin, and more recently Belfast, are doing then it needs to be used wisely. Every penny that becomes available should be ploughed into getting the highest standard of GAA coaching into primary schools. Not concrete or infrastructure, with Doire Trasna now having their own pitch, coaching should be the only focus. Conrad McGuigan is a teacher in a city school and from a conversation I had with him lately, participation has never been higher. In the last six years the number of teams in the Tower Cup has risen from five to . He rated some of their players skills as every bit as good as what there is in his native Craigbane and surrounding clubs. The raw material is there. There has been a decline in the number of males going into the primary teaching profession andprincipals have extra people coming in to coach GAA as a key component of the schools PE curriculum, it has to be music to their ears. For me, the deal-breaker is accountability. To avail of the coaching, a primary school must have a link to the local club. No link, no deal. And it has to be done properly and a stringent review taken place every year. It wouldnt be hard to cross check names from the school teams with club records and eventually U team sheets. Any school or club not pulling their weight simply gets omitted from the funding. Money cannot be wasted on just ticking a box. There is no point in players learning all the skills and not transferring it to a club. Thats where the real gains are. A player who canpush for the countyminorteamandhave a  plus year club senior career. A rising tide lts all boats and the cream will eventually creep into the senior inter-county scene. Any new plan for the city will be the last throw of the dice at engaging a population base that could transform Derry as a county. It will take time, but unless it isproperly audited there is no point. If they can squeeze every drop of potential like Coleraine did, it would be a serious addition.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The test centre was set up at the Judges Road home of City of Derry Rugby Club in April. However, as revealed recently by Derry Now - https:bit.ly DiqvOu-with the rugby club planning toto sporting action soon, a new base has to be found for the testing centre. The test site has now moved to the Lycra car rarkin Maydown. Initially testing was restricted to health and social care workers, it then accepted key workers and their families who had symptoms and more recently any member of the public with symptoms. googletag.cmd.push These tests can be booked via the Public Health Agency website. Many medical and disease control experts have said that testing and contact tracing is key to tackling the spread of COVID-. The Department has developed a COVID- ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ Strategy which sets out the public health approach to minimising COVID- transmission in the community in Northern Ireland. The key elements of the strategy are testing all people with symptoms of COVID-, contact tracing, providing information and advice on self-isolation, and support to enable people to self-isolate. It says for ‘Test, Trace and Protect’ to work, each citizen in Northern Ireland has a very important role to play. googletag.cmd.push “We must all prepare for the possibility of having to self-isolate and prepare to be tested in order to protect ourselves, our families and our communities. “Symptomatic members of the public are therefore encouraged to get tested early - this will be crucial in controlling the spread of the virus,” a spokesperson added.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

A construction company, HartlandsLtd, and Apex Housing Assocation had applied to build  houses at a large site at Springtown Road. However, planning officers recommended that the application be refused because the site was outside the current limit for housing developments as outlined in the Derry Area Plan. Planners said thatgranted planning permission, the new houses would set an undesirable precedent in terms of housing development in the countryside. The final decision on the application, however, rested with the members of Derry City and Strabane District Councils planning committee. googletag.cmd.push The planning application was discussed for almost two hours at a special meeting of the planning committee on Wednesday. Maura Fox, Head of Planning at the council, said she could not underestimate the signicance of the decision being made in relation to the Springtown plans. During the meeting, speaking on behalf of those behind the housing proposal, Daniel McAteer, described the Derry Area Plan as being hopelessly out of date and out of touch. He said the new houses would help to meet the critical need for social housing in the city. SDLP councillor John Boyle said he was worried about the sustainability of further development in the Springtown Road area, given the large number of houses which have been built in there in recent years. googletag.cmd.push He said there was already a high volume of traffic in the area and more housing would increase this problem. People Before Profit councillor Shaun Harkin said he recognised the desperate need for housing in the city but highlighted the concerns around creating a precedent in what was zoned as a rural area. Sinn Fein councillor Aileen Mellon said the new houses would help tackle the housing crisis in the city. When the issue was put to a vote, four councillors voted to support the recommendation to refuse planning permission, while three councillors voted against the recommendation.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Jim McReynolds, the popular former owner of McReynold’s Bar, died peacefully last week at his home in Dungiven. Mourners at his funeral heard how Jim had given his time generously to his parish, community and family le. “Jim was a man of faith and trusted in God all his le,” Fr Seamus Kelly told the congregation. “He was very involved in the le of this parish, taking up the collection, doing his time working with St Vincent de Paul, helping and supporting people. googletag.cmd.push “Growing up he was an excellent footballer and represented Dungiven with distinction, gaining a place on the Derry minor team in . “He sponsored many groups and clubs down the years, and club members often said that Jim was the saviour of the hurling club on many occasions. “Even when they hadn’t the money, he would have bought hurls and kits where required until they could raise the funds.” Jim was dedicated to the bar, running what Fr Kelly described as a ‘tight ship’, and he helped cement the bar’s place as a community hub in the town. “He ran a tight ship in his pub. He did not make sales or money his god, but often refused to serve customers he thought were too young or who had already had enough to drink,” he said. googletag.cmd.push “McReynold’s Bar has been famous, not only in Dungiven, as it was the only chief landmark for weary and thirsty travellers from all over the world, and it remains as popular today. “Just last year I had a friend or two visiting and the person wanted a pint, so I said I’d take them down to the best pub in town, McReynold’s Bar, and we had a few pints there. “He had a ready ear for customers’ problems, which were always treated confidentially, and he helped countless numbers of people in a iety of ways over the years. “I’m also told Jim enjoyed cooking and often provided the family meal. The children wouldfrom school, and Rose from teaching, to find a dinner waiting for them. “It had been cooked by Jim while he dodged in and out between the bar and the house, keeping the customers happy as well.” Fr Kelly also spoke of how Jim’s love and commitment to his family, in particular his we Rose, shone through in all that he did. “He met and fell in love with a wonderful Drumsurn girl, Rose Boyle, who was a teacher in her local school.” he said.  “Once they met, Rose and Jim had eyes only for each other and naturally they got married in Drumsurn chapel  years ago. “He loved the cottage in Donegal and was in his element entertaining family and friends when he got off there for a break. I’ve no doubt it holds great memories for all the family. “I enjoyed my visits to Jim and Rose when we were able to visit the sick, Fr Joseph and myself always got a great welcome. “Jim was most generous and appreciated having Holy Communion brought to him when he could no longer go to Mass. “He and Rose always sat side-by-side and I could sense the closeness in their relationship together. I know all the family will miss Jim, but especially his dear we, Rose.” Jim is survived by Rose and his children Finvola, Siobhan, Fanchea, Bernard, Bronagh and Ciara. He was the much-loved grandfather of James, Claire, Anne, Michael, Chris, Katy, Patrick, Cathal, Domnaill, Conal, Niall, Ciaran, Oliver, Liam, Ellen-Rose and great grandfather of Darragh. Jim was pre-deceased by his siblings Frances, Mary, Jean, Patsy, Kathleen and Tony.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

Lisa McGee was doing her A-Levels at Thornhill College when the Good Friday Agreement was signed in , and grew up knowing about Mr Humes work for the peace process. He was just there all the time, she recalled. There wasnt a time that you didnt know about him. There was never any debate about it, he was a good man. At a time where everything was debated about and talked about nobody ever questioned that. Not that you would ever have needed to, or have wanted to, question what he was doing. googletag.cmd.push Ms McGee said the news of Mr Humes death on Monday morning came as a shock, despite knowing that he had been ill for some time. He was a hero who walked among us, she said. I got really upset I was surprised at how emotional I felt. We were just so used to having him. It was phenomenal what he did, the influence he had and the amazing vision of what our future should be. Ms McGee believes hundreds of people owe their le to Mr Hume, due to his role in the cessation of violence. He was an incredible person and he was sent here for a reason, she said. googletag.cmd.push I was just thinking yesterday of all the people that may not be herehe hadnt been able to do what he did and built the peace process. When you think of everything he did and he never gave up- thank God. Ms McGee doesnt knowJohn Hume ever watched Derry Girls, but she hopes he would have approved. I dont knowhe ever saw it, but he and Pat knew I was a big fan, she said. I hope they thought it was alright. He was always in the background in the news, so he was present in the show. And Erin chats about him a lot in the Derry Girls book that I did recently. There would be no Derry Girls without John Hume because I wouldnt have had the opportunities that I had,” she added. The Derry writer that she wants her two young children to learn about John Hume as they grow up. There was an amazing image of him on the front of thetoday [Tuesday] and I want to get that framed for the house because its important that they know about him, she said. This was always going to be a very sad time because it was always going to be about looking back over the past and that was a very painful time in our history. It has been a sad thing for me that towards the end of his le he couldnt remember everything he achieved. Thats why we have to remember for him.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

He noticed that for special occasions people in the city rush out to buy a personalised cake from Doherty’s Bakery and thought why not also give them a special memento they can hold on to forever. Christopher Ferry is a Derry man with over  years’ experience in the design industry. He has won ious awards in that time for graphic design and social media management through his work with local businesses. Being on furlough at the moment and confined to his home during lockdown, he felt there was no time like the present to kickstart his own business, aptly named Ferry Clever. googletag.cmd.push It allows people to personalise cards or buy those with famous Derry faces for every occasion. A host of Maiden City icons appear on cards such as John Hume, Nadine Coyle, Micky Doherty , Pat Ramsey and places such as Free Derry Corner, the City Walls and, of course, The Ice Wharf.  Most of them are accompanied by local sayings, for example the common phrase ‘I love you to the moon and back’ is given a local spin to read, ‘I love you to the Bog and back’, with a sketch of the Bogside as the backdrop. It is not just cards but personalised images that can be framed, with a Liverpool-themed design currently proving popular after they were crowned Premier League champions. googletag.cmd.push Families can customise an image of them standing outside the Shankly Gates where it says ‘You’ll Never Walk Alone’. The business has been built at home but Christopher’s ambition is to eventually open a shop in the city centre where the tagline will be ‘make it personal’. Working as a DJ he has established relationships with numerous bars and businesses in the town. “Years and years ago they seen me doing the designs for my own posters, this was back when social media was starting to explode, and they asked meI fancied doing posters for them. “I’d do everything from menus printed in their premises, posters, social media campaigns, to online videos – the lot. “But now I want to go full pelt at it and open my own business.” Recently he was in the town looking for a Father’s Day card and couldn’t find any he liked.  He said: “I thought it would be greatyou could just go on to some place and they could make the card for you. “So I thought, you know what, I’m going to try this as well.” He started off selling on the website Etsy and sales have been rising, ‘people are just buying the cards flat to the mat at the minute’, he added. As someone who is social media savvy, he has been keeping an eye on trends and designing cards accordingly. During lockdown the charity work of local celebrity Micky Doherty was well publicised which is why his image was selected to grace one of the cards.  The ultimate ambition for Christopher is to be the ‘go-to person’ whenever a special occasion comes up. “In Derry, and all over the world, it’s always going to be someone’s birthday, it’s always going to be Christmas, it’s always going to be Father’s Day so I just want them thinking of me for a card.” Micky Doherty said he loved the cards. “Im totally honoured,” he said. “Like someone wants a birthday card with my face on it, he laughed.  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

However, because of the coronavirus restrictions, an audience of only  people will be allowed into each performance. The auditorium at the Playhouse usually has room for  people.

Rather than having all these empty chairs that would be housing absence, we would be housing something of signicance,” he said. Kieran Grfiths, Producer Director of thePlayhouse, said they believed it was a fitting memorial for people who have passed away. “Like a low-laying fog, grief has sat amongst us all this year,” he said. “It’s grey, feels impossible to lt and kicking it sees it rise around us. “Our plan is to honour that grief and to fight through with resilience and creativity to simply try and make something move.” googletag.cmd.push As well as being performed live in front of a small audience, the play will also be broadcast live on the internet.

Chief Executive Paul Clancy has said the Northern Ireland Executive’s decision to make the wearing of face masks mandatory in shops is positive news because it protects both shoppers and staff. The decision also gives more certainty to businesses about the steps that need to be taken to keep people, including staff, safe. In a survey carried out with the Chamber’s members last week, % of  respondents supported the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops by the public. googletag.cmd.push Londonderry Chamber Chief Executive Paul Clancy said: “We are glad to see some certainty on this issue. A vast majority of our own members in the North West are supportive of the mandatory wearing of face masks in shops because they recognise that it protects the health and safety of their own staff, as well as customers. “The reality is that we will all have to make some changes to how we live, work, shop and socialise andthe wearing of face coverings is mandatory, it will help promote more of a cultural change in the acceptability of wearing face coverings. googletag.cmd.push “Shops in the city have put in place new measures and changes which will protect their customers and staff. Many retailers have invested a great deal of time and money to make people feel safe and secure and it is important that customers support the new guidelines. “This has been an enormous time of change, but we must all play our part to protect public health, keep the spread of coronavirus to a minimum and avoid a second wave which will be catastrophic for many businesses. “I hope that people will embrace this change and support local businesses as they try to navigate this new landscape. I would also urge members of the public to be mindful of shop staff and treat them with patience and respect. “The number one priority of retailers is the welfare and safety of their customers and staff and have taken these measures to protect everyone. By shopping local and staying local, we can support small businesses who have been impacted by the lockdown.”  --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The new vaccine research registrywill help large numbers of people to be recruited into trials over the coming months, potentially leading to an effective vaccine being identied and made available to the UK public against coronavirus sooner. It has been developed as part of the UK Government’s Vaccine Taskforce, in partnership with the National Institute for Health Research , NHS Digital, and the Northern Ireland, Scottish and Welsh Governments. Dr Janice Bailie, Assistant Director, RD Division, Public Health Agency, said: “Health researchers are currently working to find a vaccine for COVID-, but without the help of members of the general public willing to participate in vaccine trials, this work will not be able to succeed. googletag.cmd.push “The NHS COVID- vaccine registry allows people to register their interest and be potentially contacted with an offer to participate in clinical studies. “You can sign up to give permission for researchers to contact you about taking part in COVID- vaccine studies. By collecting details about people who are interested in taking part in vaccine studies, the registry service will help cut down the time it takes to find volunteers for vaccine studies. This will help us to carry out studies and find a vaccine faster.” The registry is available to anyone aged  or over, living in the UK. To register, people fill in some personal and contact details, and answer a series of basic health screening questions on an NHS web form atwww.nhs.uk researchcontact. googletag.cmd.push   --If you have a story or want to send a photo or video to us please contact the Derry Now editorial team on    for Derry City stories Or    for County Derry stories.

The league leaders were in danger of dropping their first points of the season after Walter Figuiras first half goal had given the Candystripes the lead, but an own goal from Colm Horgan and a follow up from Roberto Lopes maintained the % record this season. Derry kept their shape throughout an uneventful first half, with Rovers bossing possession, but without ever really causing a threat, a half chance for Danny Lafferty, on histo the Brandywell, the only effort Rovers had in the first half hour. googletag.cmd.push The first half was drting uneventfully towards half time when the first goal arrived out of absolutely nowhere. Eoin Toal collected the ball on half way and decided to join the attack, bursting between two Rovers players before finding Walter Figueira on the left wing. Toal continued into the penalty area in anticipation of a cross, which was duly delivered, but incredibly, the ball eluded both Roberto Lopes and Alan Mannus with the ball sneaking into the net past the bemused Rovers players. Stephen Bradley was far from happy with his teams inability to test Peter Cherrie and midway through the second half he had used all of his substitutes to completely change the look of his attack. googletag.cmd.push Those substitutions had the desired effect as Rovers finally levelled on  minutes, but there was still an element of luck about the goal. Gaffney did well to pick out a cross from the right and a glancing header by Williams went over Cherrie but onto the post before it bounced off the unfortunate Colm Horgan and into the net. Rovers were relentless after that, and, buoyed by the goal, they went in search of a winner, and they thought they had it when Farrugia went in from the left and picked out Williams, but he was denied from close range by a superb save by Peter Cherrie. But the goal was coming and City were unable to defend the resulting short corner, Burke receiving the ball in the area before sending it into the mix where Lopes was on hand to fire it past Cherrie to turn the game completely on its head with just eight minutes remaining. There was a chance late on for a City equaliser when Ciaron Harkin and Colm Horgan combined to set up Figueira, but his effort was too close to Mannus who gathered comfortably. City continued to push in five minutes of added time and they came so close to levelling when Adam Hamills cross was met brilliantly by Harkin who headed onto the crossbar before Mannus somehow kept out Toals follow-up.

Ryan OrsquoHiggins opened the scoring early on before Jerome Johnston and Marty Devlin replied for the Ulster champions.The industrious Paddy Sheridan levelled matters in the tenth minute with Martin McCourt giving the Magpies the slightest lead by the water break.Both sides continued to probe before half time with scores hard to come by. Miceal Rooney put Kilcoo two clear five minutes from the short whistle, while OrsquoHiggins scored a beauty right on half time to leave it - to - to Mickey Moranrsquos side.The lsquoFord got the best possible start to the second half with Conor Maginn and substitute Cathal Burns finding their range to put them ahead. It was tit for tat for the next phase of the game and with ten minutes left Kilcoo lead by one thanks to scores from Jerome Johnston, Paul Greenan and Conor Laverty.The games turning point came on the rd minute.

Parking restrictions will also be in place around the working areas.Ni Water says the investment is part of a programme of work to improve the existing sewers in Downpatrick, which will enhance the local sewerage infrastructure and reduce the risk of out of sewer flooding.It has confirmed that the essential work will involve repairing existing sewers and will mainly be undertaken using underground trenchless techniques, which will signicantly reduce the duration and disruption of the programme.But NI Water is warning that it will be necessary to undertake lsquoopen-digrsquo repairs at some locations due to the condition of the existing sewers.The organisation says that this particular aspect of the work is expected to last just one or two days with contractors also working in the evening, with every effort being made to minimise disruption.ldquoAppropriate traffic management and signage will be in place as the work progresses, said a NI Water spokeswoman.ldquoThe majority of the works will be undertaken during normal working hours. However, to reduce disruption to businesses and the public, some night-time works will be required at key locations.The work will take place at ious locations around the Downpatrick area, including some of the main streets within the town centre.NI Water has confirmed that the contractor working on the Downpatrick scheme mdash Geda Construction mdash will liaise with any affected businesses and properties.The spokeswoman added: ldquoWe appreciate that this work is disruptive and would like to thank the public in advance for their patience as we complete these essential improvement works.ldquoWe are all practising social distancing and our priority is to keep customers and colleagues safe. Please keep your distance and our workers will carry on with their essential work for you.South Down MLA Colin McGrath has met with NI Water officials ahead of work starting in Downpatrick, highlighting the need for communication with the community and the need to complete the scheme quickly.He said it was imperative that consideration was given to the works being done in the evening and at weekends to ensure that the level of public disruption was kept to as low a level as possible.ldquoI canrsquot think of a time in recent memory when Downpatrick has suffered road works after road works than has happened over the past few years, the MLA continued. ldquoIf the public is frustrated by this, it is entirely understandable and entirely justied.ldquoThe past few months have been incredibly worrying and stressful and people are finally able to step out of their homes. Shielding finally came to a end last week and the most vulnerable in our society are able to take those first tentative steps out of their homes again. It would have been altogether unacceptable for them to have to navigate this with works going on in their town.Mr McGrath said that having raised these issues with NI Water, the organisation is planning to use underground trenchless techniques, with contractors also working in the evening.He added: ldquoI will be in regular contact with the project manager to ensure that these works are completed as quickly as possible and due consideration given to the public.Downpatrick area councillor Dermot Curran has appealed to residents and the business community to remain patient as the work progresses.ldquoThis is an important scheme for Downpatrick and, as such, there will inevitably be disruption. NI Water intends to keep this to a minimum and it is important that this is the case, he continued.ldquoThis is a signicant investment in a much-needed scheme to not only upgrade the existing infrastructure, but also prevent so-called out-of-sewer flooding. Upgrading town centre sewers is an important scheme and NI Water must honour its commitment to keep disruption to a minimum.Cllr Curran said improving the town centrersquos waste water infrastructure was good news for residents and the business community.He added :ldquoThe suggested timetable to complete the work is five weeks and I hope that every effort will be made to ensure that back-to-school traffic is not impacted as the start of the new term is less than one month away..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/5th August 2020 Downpatrick Cricket.jpg","title":"Downpatrick see off Saintfield by four runs in close contest  ","story":"WHAT a dference  hours makes in the game of cricket.Downpatrick, who had been humbled by Ballymena on Thursday, got back to winning ways at Saintfield with the batsmen showing some pride and application.Ross Boultwood won the toss and decided to bat first.

extension of the free parking scheme.Cllr Sharvinrsquos suggestion was tabled at the June meeting of the local authorityrsquos Strategic, Policy and Resources when it was also agreed to review the

pandemic and the easing of lockdown restrictions, Cllr Sharvin explained.He revealed that when he used the Irish Street, Scotch Street and Church Street car parks theywere extremely busy and he was heartened by the usage, admitting that he did receive some feedback that there were some all-day parkers taking up vital spaces which would have had a negative impact on our local businesses.Agreement to extend the free parking initiative was accepted by the local authority on Monday following a proposal by Cllr Sharvin.ldquoThe near eight weeks of free car parking have been a great benefit to Downpatrick and in my proposal to extend the scheme until August , I have asked that the car park strategy the council is completing is fast tracked.ldquoThis is important to ensure equality across

Its need has been proven. There was no need to explore the feasibility of anything, she said.Mrs Trainor said the outcome of the meeting with health officials was that politicians, the community and trade unions stood together in demanding theof AE provision.She added: ldquoThis very much reminded me of the early days of the hospital campaign where everyone was saying the same thing. We won the case for the Downe but, from day one, administrators started to strip services from it.ldquoOver recent days what has given me the greatest heart has been the reaction of the politicians, the community and trade unions on the Downe Hospital issue.Mrs Trainor said she hopes that the unity will continue, insisting that when it comes to hospital services, the people of Downe are asking for nothing more than parity with those in other areas.ldquoThere has been substantial underfunding in this district for many years and we need parity with everyone  alongside rural proofing as, for those in authority, the centralisation of services is still very much alive. Their attitude is that everything stops in Belfast, she continued.ldquoBut everything does not have to be centralised in the city. The Downe is a beautul hospital but is being totally underused, yet it is one of the most modern of its kind. There is room to expand to increase service provision and we also want more consultants and staff alongside increased investment for student nurses.Mrs Trainor added: ldquoThere is total unity across the community on these issues and a strong defence of the Downe Hospital.ldquoThe hospital is the single biggest issue in our district.

He was also a greater challenge to unionism than the IRA and successive British and Irish governments.By Alex KaneMonday, th August , : pmUpdated Monday, th August , : pm\"\"Addressing the former Stormont parliament on June ,  – in a three-day debate marking its th anniversary – Hume, deputy leader of the new SDLP, said: “It should be made clear to all people today who say that no change has taken place that this is simply not true. There have been changes in this community and there must be more changes, but it takes time before legislative changes become reality in the lives of the people and,people interfere in the progress of that change by violence then they can only increase the frustration ... progress is not in a straight line but progress is taking place...the choice we face today is a very serious one and it can be expressed very simply – chaos or community.”Brian Faulkner – in his autobiography, Memoirs of a Statesman – said of Hume’s speech: ‘Although he went on to talk of the failure of partition ... he made a spirited denunciation of terrorism ... and I was generally pleased with this response from a person regarded at that time by unionists as one of the most intransigent and bitter opponents of the State.’ Writing about the Sunningdale negotiations two years later, Faulkner cited Humeas a sticking point when it came to issues like police reform, detention, reform of the civil service, the Council of Ireland and the make-up of the new Executive. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...John Hume and SDLP colleagues after a meeting at  Downing Street, where he had more influence than any unionist leaderSome observers argue that Hume deliberately pushed the SDLP in a ‘greener’ direction when he became leader in  because he never forgave unionismfor destroying Sunningdale. Yet Faulkner’s earlier description is of a man who was already regarded by unionists as a bitter opponent a man who was also instrumental in ensuring that there would be no wriggle room on the Council of Ireland – the single issue which galvanised majority unionist opposition to Sunningdale. It tends to be forgotten now that the Ulster Unionist Council – by a substantial majority – supported the White Paper in autumn  which recommended a power-sharing Assembly as a replacement for the prorogued parliament. It also tends to be forgotten that Faulkner took huge personal political risks to ensure a pro-White Paper unionist majority in the  Assembly election. He put his leadership and career on the line for an agreement with the SDLP and yet evidence suggests that Hume was key to ensuring that, right at the heart of the agreement, were the planted seeds of its inevitable destruction.Frank Millar – former general secretary of the UUP, later the London editor of theand one of the shrewdest ever observers of unionism – wrote, in : ‘It was only gradually in the late s that some unionist politicians began to draw the succour and encouragement they could from the SDLP’s consistent stand against IRA violence, and John Hume’s repeated assertion that there was no state of injustice to justy the taking of a single le in Northern Ireland. Yet there was also deep and enduring distrust of Hume. Unionists generally believed that for him it must be a “united Ireland or nothing” and would iniably interpret his talk after Bloody Sunday  of an “agreed Ireland” as code for unity by other means.’My lasting impression of Hume is that he was never particularly interested in unionism or of an ‘agreed’ Northern Ireland. And I’m not sure he ever was. He was unambiguous in his opposition to violence as a strategy to achieve a united Ireland and ferocious in his condemnation of the IRA. I admired him for that approach. He was, in the truest sense of the term, a moral man. Yet his approach to unionism never made sense to me, for how could he hope to embrace unionists within his proposed ‘agreed’ Ireland when he seemed to find it so dficult to establish, let alone sustain, a relationship dialogue with the key players.I’m not, by the way, suggesting that he disliked, let alone hated unionists. I have heard Faulkner, Ian Paisley, John Taylor, Jim Nicholson, Reg Empey, David Trimble and others talk warmly of him yet I have never heard any signicant player within unionism make a convincing case that he was even remotely interested in building an ‘internal’ relationship with unionism. Sunningdale, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Good Friday Agreement were always transition phases for him – temporary means to another long term end.That said, unionism should have tried to engage him. It should also have countered his campaigns in Brussels, London, Dublin and Washington, where, for  years, he bent ears like nobody’s business. What he said over and over and over again since he was first elected to Stormont in was often mocked as his ‘single transferable speech’ yet it worked. I remember hearing a former CEO of Coca-Cola making a point about branding: ‘It may be the best known drink brand in the world, but we know that there’s always someone, somewhere, who doesn’t know the name, so our job is to constantly promote the brand and then continue to remind old and new target audiences.’ That was Hume’s approach to his ‘agreed’ Ireland. And it is a tribute to his relentless messaging that, even with successive UK governments, and with leaderships in Dublin, Brussels and the White Housethe key elements of the single transferable speech found their way into official policy, public statements and assorted initiatives. He is rightly described as a giant of Irish politics. His influence and fingerprints are everywhere. It is astonishing, truly astonishing actually, to note that he had more specic, lasting influence on Downing Street policy than any unionist leader I can think of. He achieved this pre-eminence by democratic methods alone. He was always my political constitutional opponent yet, in the great scheme of things, his battle was always fought with dignity, passion, compassion and honour. For that he deserves respect. ——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

The bricks and mortar in his house came from the same quarry as built mine. The unemployment and poor housing conditions on my side of the Foyle were the same as on his side.

During that time, despite our political dferences we enjoyed a cordial personal relationship and worked together to deliver for people in our constituencies.Gregory Campbell MP signing the Book of Condolences for John Hume in the Guildhall, Londonderry.Picture by Lorcan Doherty   Press EyeThere has been a myriad of ‘defining moments’ in the lives of people here over the last  years but there have been two periods that more than any other shaped the Northern Ireland of . The first period was the birth of the Troubles from  onwards, the second period was the ending of those same Troubles.In the midst of earnest tributes to John Hume, we must not forget or be mistaken about what happened in those two periods. The period - was the one with the highest death toll in the Troubles. What happened then to the unionist minority in the City of Hume and Campbell has been almost completely overlooked in the commentary of recent days. The exodus of unionists occurred when peaceful nationalism and violent republicanism was on the rise. Nothing was done by nationalist leaders to highlight it let alone prevent it. If in a unionist majority city virtually an entire nationalist minority in the main part of that city, had fled, mostly under threat, with dozens of funeral corteges being their final farewell, would those leaders have been so silent If this had happened when any unionist leader was prominent, it would have seen them pilloried and rightly criticised, yet this is what happened between  and  in Londonderry to unionists. It wasn’t highlighted by mainstream nationalist leaders at the time, and no mainstream media outlet referred to it this week. The much vaunted ‘need for balance’ was conspicuously absent.At the other end of the timescale was the - period just before the ceasefires. At that early stage, only a few people were aware of the Hume Adams discussions.Very few were also aware of the scale of the security services infiltration of the Provisional IRA. The wider public had no knowledge of those who would later be outed as agents from within the secret ranks of the IRA. Martin McGuinness in the documentary ‘Real Lives’ had said in the early s thatsomeone showed the IRA ‘another way’ to achieve their objective, apart from violence, they would take it.The mainstream journalistic narrative following John Hume’s death both locally and internationally was effectively that the IRA had to be cajoled and dragged into a gradual move towards peace.Very few journalists recognised that the IRA was desperately seeking a way out of their terror tactic. A Troubles weary people were tiring of their terror and their best ‘activists’ were increasingly known to be agents.That is why the Provos made their long overdue move towards peace. Anyone declaring that peace would not have happened without John Hume, must give voice to the view that a desperate, depleted IRA were looking for an escape route with a long-term united Ireland fig leaf for cover.• Gregory Campbell is DUP MP for East Londonderry——— ———A message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityAs reported in the Penarth Times on Thursday, the town councilsaid the results show ldquowidespread backing for changes.The survey, which attracted  responses, showed  per cent of people thought there should be more outdoor space for pedestrians and businesses.Seventy-five per cent thought parking arrangements needed to change, and  per cent said the town needs to ldquoprepare for the future.Some traders, who oppose the changes ndash specically a one-way traffic system around the town and making Windsor Road and Lower Glebe Street a traffic free zone, have said the questions in the survey were too generalised and misleading.As a result of the survey, Penarth Town Council have proposed the following changes to the original ideas:Windsor Road from Arcot Street to the roundabout as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and buses, with a mph speed limit.Lower Glebe Street as a ldquoshared space for delivery vehicles and disabled bays. Other vehicles should not use Lower Glebe Street as a through road.Bus stops will remain as they are. There were concerns over the impact of a bus stop on Hickman Road for traders, due to air pollution, noise pollution and congestion.A two-way system to remain on Stanwell Road from the library to the traffic lights, to allow easy access to the bus stop on Rectory Road and to prevent congestion and ldquorat running through Hickman Road and Arcot Street. A two-way system to also remain from Windsor Road to Railway Terrace.The number of parking bays has also changed. There will now be  extra bays proposed, with  of them on Plassey Street.The leader of the town council, Cllr Rhiannon Birch, explained the findings and what happens next.ldquoEven before Covid-, town centres across the country were facing issues, including the need to modernise infrastructure, and the impact of online shopping, she said. ldquoThe current pandemic has added to the scale of the challenge.ldquoThe consultation shows that a clear majority recognise the need for a degree of change in the town centre, both for it to survive in the present and to thrive in future.ldquoThe results call for the establishment of a greater degree of safe space and proposals which increase a degree of pedestrianisation whilst also increasing parking spaces.ldquoThe results show substantial agreement on these aims. Reflecting this widespread and clear response, Penarth Town Council calls on our partners in the Vale of Glamorgan Council to embrace the results and recommendations.ldquoSpecically, Penarth Town Council believes that creating a safer environment through the closure of Windsor Road to traffic for part of the day, between Arcot Street and the roundabout, including the Lower Glebe Street, would be the best way to ensure that people can feel confident about shopping safely. It would allow safe use of the space in front of shops, bars, cafes and restaurants.ldquoIt also lessens the need for one-way systems on pavements for pedestrians, which are perplexing for many and hard to implement. These proposals can be achieved in a way which also increases the amount of parking spaces available.The results will now be put to the Vales Planning Committee for consultation.For more information, visit https:www.penarthtowncouncil.gov.uk news survey-results Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Since ing to site Farrans, the contractor in charge of the build, has ensured the contract is completed ready for opening in the Autumn.Farrans has been spearheading the build since initial enabling works got under way early in , creating  jobs on site during construction as part of a project which has delivered at least £. million in direct wages to the local economy.Located at the south side of Craigavon’s balancing lake, the facility is a landmark venue for the area and is situated within a pre-existing network of walking and cycling paths covering around three miles. The council hopes the new leisure centre will welcome visitors from across the borough and beyond to its new -metre pool, a young children’s indoor leisure water feature, a ,m state-of-the-art gym, multiple studios, health and wellbeing suite, sensory room, eight-court sports halls, spin studio, soft play area and an on-site café.It also incorporates an outdoor water sports provision offering a wide range of water based activities including windsurfing, water skiing and paddle sports.

Kiro.“Kiro has given us such respite. He is such a great puppy. He loves walking and is very happy. We couldn’t understand it when we heard clicking sounds on his hips,” said Christopher.He said when they visited the owner of the pups, they saw the puppy’s mother and were assured by the woman they had bought Kiro from that both were in good health. “They all looked to be in good health,” said Christopher.He explained that they took him to the vet for his first injections. “The vet stretched his hips and said everything was Ok,” said Christopher.Kiro“We became concerned as he was starting to ‘bunny hop’ when he was running andwe picked him up he would yelp,” he said.They took Kiro back to the same veterinary surgery for the second set of injections. Christopher said they were told that everything was good.But two weeks ago they noticed his hips were ‘clicking’.This time they went to a vets in Lurgan who said they could feel Kiro’s hips were ‘pretty bad’.“He has Canine Juvenile Hip Dysplasia and it is pretty bad,” said Christopher.The -year-old who isn’t working and is a full time carer for his mother and father, said they had taken out pet insurance but sadly it was not enough cover for this particular condition.He explained that it is a genetic condition and rectying it with a double hip replacement is going to cost around £k. Already they have managed to raise £,.“To give you an idea of how bad his case is, our vet explained that the worst case scenario would be a score of , where malamutes usually sit at around a .. Kiro’s hip scores are a .. This means he will require two hip replacements pretty much as soon as possible.“We understand it’s a dficult time to be asking for donations, and this is a last resort for us. “Our aim is to raise enough funds to get Kiro a double total hip replacement which would give him a new lease of le. “However,we aren’t able to raise enough funds for this, we will be using the money to give Kiro a double partial hip replacement which will help to signicantly reduce his pain. “Our vet also explained to us that by the time he is two years old, his condition will have worsened, therefore it is important we are able to give him the care he needs as soon as possible.”If you would like to help check out the Go Fund Me page here https:www.gofundme f kiros-hip-replacements utm_sourcecustomerutm_mediumcopy_linkutm_campaignp_cf+share-flow-fbclidIwARpDXrMFqgiBCOaISkLOKBos_YVaGicl_YbRFBEIpWJRHJOMYLrkA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

and could bring  jobs to the town, a local councillor has said.By The NewsroomFriday, th August , : pmUpdated Friday, th August , : pm\"\"The application, lodged by applicant Inaltus Ltd on behalf of Curly Properties Ltd is for a retail development with car parking, landscaping, access and associated site works developed atvacant lands north of Millennium Way, Lurgan.Originally submitted in  the planning proposal has been recommended for approval by Council’s planning officers and will,approved, see Home Bargains arrive in town.Speaking in support of the application, Councillor Joe Nelson said it would bring “signicant economic benefits… including some  new jobs” to Lurgan.“I believe the site location is ideal for this development as it provides adequate car parking in situ and is located on Millenium Way which is in fact the relief road for Lurgan Town Centre,” say the SDLP councillor.“Bringing this development to the town while keeping the town centre free from extra congestion is the ideal position.“I strongly support these proposals and trust that the material considerations, associated with the economic and other benefits of the scheme, will be considered in detail by the Council planners.”Upper Bann MLA Jonathan Buckley has expressed “strong support” for the application.“The proposals will see the delivery of a Home Bargains store for Lurgan along with signicant economic benefits including a multi-million pound investment into the local economy and the creation of some  new jobs,” said the DUP MLA“At a time when many people are losing their jobs and many businesses are having to close, proposal such as this, where successful major retailingbusinesses are willing to commit to Lurgan, the Council must give very serious consideration to these proposals.”However, an independentreview of the application by Tom Stokes Associated Planning expressed concerns that rather than support the town centre, the application,approved, is “more likely to create an alternative retail destination to the town centre”.The report said that with  per cent of the Lurgan town centre’s turnover allocated to just two stores, the remaining smaller conveniencestores in Lurgan could be “vulnerable to impact” by the approval of this application.The review also suggested that the proposal would be better suited to the former Tesco site in Castle Lane as it is “a key regeneration site in the town centre”.However, in response to this, the application’s agent, Inaltus Ltd, said: “If this site did not suit Tesco’s servicing requirements, there are no grounds for TSA to suggest it will suit Home Bargains.”In conclusion Inaltus Ltd’s response to TSA assessmentstates that whilst some aspects of the TSA Review can be agreed “other aspects are illogical and do not form a sound basis to refuse the proposal on”.It also notes that no objections have been lodged in over  months and called for the application to be brought before Council’s planning committee.The application is now set to appear before Wednesday’smeeting of the planning committee, with officer’s recommending that the application is approved.-------A message from the
