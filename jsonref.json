It showed him queueing to pay for fuel and, as he did so, suddenly putting his hand on the shoulder of the woman in front of him for no apparent reason.He then walked forward to the alleged victim\u0027s till and could be seen almost immediately reaching out to the woman\u0027s chest area with his left hand. It was clear in the video that her own hands did not leave the counter.Mr Gough claimed she had moved her polo shirt aside herself so he could read the rest of her tattoo - but the CCTV clearly showed that did not happen and he said he could not understand why not. During yesterday\u0027s trial the court heard that the woman cashier in a Gloucester shoppetrol station had a two line sentence about love tattooed just above her right breast. She said it was positioned so it would be covered up by her work polo shirt and she would look \u0027professional.\u0027When Mr Gough approached her, she said: \u0027Hhis fingers went on my top and pulled it down and to the right.\u0027He pulled it across to reveal the full length of my tattoo. His fingers were on the skin of my chest.\u0027She said she asked if he was trying to read the tattoo but he just grinned and did not really respond and he did not question her about it.\u0027When he pulled my top across he leaned his head down and started looking at it,\u0027 she said. \u0027I was quite shocked. I didn\u0027t know what to do. I just wanted to serve him and get him out of the shop.\u0027She estimated his hand was on her for about five seconds.\u0027It was part of my breast - the top part of my breast, a personal place,\u0027 she said. \u0027When he did go my stomach turned. It made me shake. I felt really uncomfortable, I felt like crying. But I didn\u0027t want to make a scene in front of the customers.          After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault\u0027I turned to my colleague and said \u0027He just pulled my top across. Do you mind if I go?\u0027\u0027I felt overwhelmed and emotional. I contacted my mum and I burst into tears. I spoke to my manager and we decided to call the police.\u0027Cross-examined by Tim Burrows, for Mr Gough, she denied that he had asked her about whether the letters \u0027red\u0027 in the tattoo related to Manchester United or Ferrari. He said nothing of the kind, she insisted.Linda Mustoe, the woman in the queue in front of Mr Gough before the incident, told the court he stood quite close behind her and made her feel \u0027uncomfortable.\u0027\u0027Then I felt something touch me. It was a hand on my left shoulder,\u0027 she said. \u0027I quickly looked around and saw the man. He said sorry and moved back. \u0027She said while she was being served Mr Gough went to the next till and after he left she heard the cashier saying \u0027That man has just pulled my top down.\u0027\u0027She was distressed and I said, Actually, he made me feel uncomfortable too. He actually touched me.\u0027In evidence, Mr Gough said the woman\u0027s tattoo was up on her collarbone, not her breast, and he could only see the letters \u0027red\u0027 so he asked \u0027Are you Man U then, or Ferrari?\u0027\u0027She said \u0027Do you want to see it?\u0027 and I said \u0027I don\u0027t mind.\u0027 She pulled it to the side and she laughed.\u0027When I put my hand out I may have flicked her top, I don\u0027t know.\u0027After a half-day trial the magistrates said they believed the woman\u0027s account of what happened but could not be sure beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Gough\u0027s actions were sexually motivated and so found him not guilty of sexual assault.\u0027She said he took hold of her polo shirt and pulled it across to reveal her skin - the CCTV revealed he did,\u0027 said court chairman Andrew Tabor. \u0027He denied touching her at all although grudgingly admitted he might have flicked her clothing. He claimed she opened her shirt to show the tattoo even though CCTV evidence showed her hands not to leave her till.\u0027We are satisfied he did indeed touch her to reveal her tattoo. That action could be perceived to be sexual but we are not convinced that the purpose was sexual.\u0027When the court declared Mr Gough not guilty of sexual assault he raised both hands above his head and said \u0027Correct decision, Sir.\u0027He insisted he had absolutely no sexual motive for what he did.\u0027I have taught 3,000 girls between the ages of 17 and 25 to drive - a total of 90,000 hours in the car on my own with them no problem, and now I get some cock and bull story. I\u0027m sorry, no way,\u0027 he said. Mr Gough appeared on Britain\u0027s Got Talent in May last year and set a world record by reciting the alphabet backwards in four seconds. He also tried to set a new record for telling the most jokes in one minute but dried up and fell well short of his 27 joke target.In 1999 the lifelong driving instructor set a world record after averaging 113 miles per gallon when he drove his car from Exeter to Gloucester. He used only one gallon of unleaded petrol in his 850cc Perodua Nippa car up the M5 but to achieve the record had to go at only 35mph.Then in 2003 Mr Gough set another record by driving a Toyota Yaris 28 miles on just one litre of fuel."},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/03/23/4DE55BB400000578-0-image-m-37_1530656560304.jpg","title":"Meghan Markles mother Doria picks pastries near L home","story":"    Doria Ragland was pictured buying pastries from Shabazz Bakery in downtown Inglewood on Tuesday Nicky Haslam, 78, described them as \u0027frightfully common\u0027 and said it was a blessing in disguise that none made it May\u0027s wedding. \u0027It would kill me\u0027: Oprah insists she will NOT run for...Share this article    Doria was casual for the outing in some patterned linen pants and an orange top           She seemed to be in high spirits as she made her way from the bakery back to her car          The bakery in Inglewood, a city in southwest Los Angeles county, is known for its bean pies Doria has let the media storm surrounding her daughter\u0027s wedding wash over her head. The closest she has come to the media is when she spent six hours at Oprah\u0027s home in Santa Barbara before the wedding. Her visit prompted speculation that she was preparing to give the TV queen a tell-all interview about her daughter\u0027s royal romance. Oprah poured cold water on the rumors afterwards and said the pair spent their time together doing yoga and eating kumquats from a tree in her garden.           A little over a month ago, Doria watched her daughter marry Prince Harry at Windsor Castle.

The Beckham franchise, when it gets going, will also bring a training center and an academy focused on developing local players to the Miami area.The stadium-location quest is just the latest drawn-out chapter in Beckham\u0027s five-years-and-counting marathon to bring MLS back to Miami. The Miami Fusion played from 1998-2001, folding because of poor attendance.Beckham and MLS announced in January that the franchise would be coming to Miami, but nearly every detail about the club remains unclear. There\u0027s no definitive start date - 2020 has been mentioned repeatedly, even though no new stadium could possibly be ready by then - as well as no team name, no logo, no colors, no coaching staff and no front-office personnel.More than a year ago, Miami-Dade County commissioners approved a deal to sell Beckham nearly three acres of county land for $9 million with the belief that it would be the last parcel he needed for a stadium site in the city\u0027s Overtown neighborhood. But that site was never the preferred choice for Beckham and his group anyway, with the original hope being to build on the waterfront near the Port of Miami.The Overtown site now seems all but doomed, though it\u0027s unclear what would happen if city commissioners or voters block the latest Beckham plan.          Beckham preferred a site near the Port of Miami, but traffic from the port\u0027s bridge and from American Airlines Arena - the home of the Miami Heat - made the intersection unusable    In this January 29, 2018, file photo, David Beckham speaks at an event where it was announced that Major League Soccer is bringing an expansion team to Miami.

I generally reply with a witty putdown to make it clear I\u0027m not just a WAG in a shiny car with no clue how to drive it.\u0027          Company boss Maya Hartge is used to attracting attention when she\u0027s driving her Porsche 981 Spyder convertibleWhile the idea that a man might find it hard to cope with a woman driving a fancy car may sound dated, according to John Groeger, Professor of Psychology at Nottingham Trent University, who has a particular interest in motoring, what Maya experiences is a common reaction.Even in 2018, some men find it hard to cope with the idea that many women are now big earners — and savers — and can splash out on whatever car takes their fancy.\u0027One of the things we\u0027ve noticed in our research is that people will get angry and behave aggressively towards drivers they believe are of a lower status than themselves,\u0027 says Professor Groeger.\u0027Sexism is still rife in all areas of life — and there\u0027s plenty of it lurking in the traffic system, too. We know from experimental studies that others make assumptions about our wealth, status, personality or competence based on the vehicle we drive.\u0027We carried out one experiment using two identical white vans, one of them bearing the livery of an emergency services vehicle. Other drivers drove with far more care and respect around the latter than when it was an unmarked white van.\u0027We also compared reactions to vehicles with and without L-plates. We are quicker to blame, and act aggressively, towards people we feel are lower status — those whose cars carry L-plates, for example. We forgive them less easily, yet are quite prepared to exonerate people we feel are more like ourselves.\u0027So we have a clash between the apparent status of the vehicle and the assumed characteristics of the people who drive them.\u0027According to statistics released in April this year by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT), female car ownership is at a record high, and more women than ever are buying into the luxury car market.In recent years, Porsche alone has doubled its sales of vehicles to women. Meanwhile, convertibles are now most likely to be bought by women in their 50s, with sales to this demographic quadrupling in just 15 years.          Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis (pictured)frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.Maya bought her Porsche two years ago as a limited edition, meaning it\u0027s a collectors\u0027 item unlikely to depreciate in value.Her first car was rather different, though.\u0027It was a Fiat Punto HLX 16 valve which cost just over £13,000 when I was 18,\u0027 she recalls. \u0027I worked like a dog, six days a week for a year, in my IT technical support job to save up for it. My friends were out spending their money on having fun and holidaying in Ibiza, but my heart was set on that car.\u0027By the time she was 24 she had her own successful business and had saved enough money to splash out on her first \u0027supercar\u0027 — an Aston Martin DBS coupé that cost around £180,000 and which she still owns.\u0027I buy high performance cars because I love driving them, especially on tracks in the UK and abroad,\u0027 says Maya, who says she inherited her love of fast cars from her father, a former racing driver. She puts her collection of cars to good use by charging for rides in them at events in aid of The Children\u0027s Trust.\u0027I do think it\u0027s a shame that men tar all women with the old stereotype of us not being able to drive or park. When I take my cars on track days, I can see that men there think they\u0027re going to be better drivers than me. I just keep quiet and let my driving prove how wrong they are.\u0027While Maya aims to respond to putdowns with wit and charm, men who take on events director Henrietta Sauleek are less amused when she\u0027s at the wheel of her bright blue £70,000 Audi RS4, which can go from 0-60mph in 4.1 seconds.\u0027On one occasion, in a car park, a man aged about 60 drove slowly past me as I got out of my car. He wound down the window on his family saloon and said to me: \u0027That car is not for a woman.\u0027 What I was thinking is unprintable, but I didn\u0027t give him the satisfaction of a reply.\u0027I\u0027ve had men of all ages cut me up, or they try to stop me joining a lane of traffic if two lanes merge into one. A lot of them are tradesmen in their 30s, driving vans. I doubt they\u0027d do it to my husband if he was driving my car.\u0027Henrietta, 33, who lives in Basingstoke with her husband, a company director and their children, aged four and one, adds: \u0027I\u0027ve had a passion for cars since passing my test at the age of 19, but I\u0027ve never had hassle from men until I got the RS4 a year ago.\u0027I started to think that perhaps it was all in my own head, until last month when the car went into the garage for general maintenance.\u0027She was given a standard Audi A5 saloon as a courtesy car for a couple of weeks while the work was being done.\u0027Suddenly, I was anonymous and invisible on the roads again and didn\u0027t get any aggravation from other drivers,\u0027 she says. \u0027It cemented the fact that I really had been getting derogatory comments from men because I was driving a sports car. I can only assume it\u0027s because they are jealous.\u0027Since getting her RS4 back three weeks ago, she\u0027s again having to put up with sexist assumptions.\u0027We were out as a family a few days ago and were just getting out of the car when a guy walking past said to my husband: \u0027Nice car, mate!\u0027 assuming that it must be his,\u0027 says Henrietta. In fact, her husband drives a rather less flashy VW Golf, albeit top of the range, and says he never gets any trouble at the wheel of either car.It was after spotting a woman at the wheel of a \u0027stunning Porsche\u0027 in a traffic jam 12 years ago that Henrietta vowed to save hard to one day own a sports car herself.\u0027I chose the RS4 purely for me — not to show off but because it\u0027s a stunning car,\u0027 she says. \u0027I\u0027ve worked really hard, we don\u0027t spend much on our social life, and I really appreciate cars.\u0027It\u0027s a fun and empowering car. I love the adrenaline rush I get when I accelerate and the engine roars, but clearly it aggravates certain men. I\u0027ve never experienced any animosity from other women.\u0027 Professor Groeger explains that this sort of reaction is indicative of the human tendency endlessly to compare ourselves to others. It also reveals that many men still see themselves as higher up the social pecking order than women.\u0027Sometimes, when we come off badly, we\u0027re not that upset by it, for example if the other person is a talented sports person driving a great car,\u0027 he says. \u0027But in other cases we feel resentful if we assume that a person has had success in a way that we haven\u0027t, or that we feel is underserved.\u0027So, if a man is well educated, has worked hard and done quite well for himself but sees a woman driving a car he could only dream of being able to afford, he might feel irritated by that, though it\u0027s obviously sexist.\u0027 Zipping around in her Porsche Boxter convertible, Ingrid Lewis frequently finds herself up against men keen to prove they are kings of the road.\u0027Men sit at traffic lights and look at me while revving their engines in anticipation of the lights changing to green, but I tend to be a bit naughty and deliberately leave them standing,\u0027 says Ingrid, who\u0027s now retired from the company she owned and lives with her partner Richard, 62, in Hertfordshire.\u0027They can\u0027t resist overtaking me. If I\u0027m doing 80mph, they want to do 90mph. They glare at me and I can see they\u0027re thinking: \u0027How dare you be in a car like that?\u0027A youthful 70, Ingrid bought her five-year-old Boxter earlier this year (they cost over £40,000 new). Unlike Maya and Henrietta, she says she also encounters aggression from women drivers — and it annoys her because she feels it\u0027s \u0027not sisterly\u0027.\u0027Last week, I was on the motorway in a variable speed area and there was a woman right behind me trying to edge me out of the way so she could get past. Others try to cut me up.\u0027Ingrid\u0027s love affair with sporty cars began when she was 20 and her father bought her a coveted Austin-Healey Sprite.With the roof down on her Boxter, she often attracts admiring glances from men. \u0027Men seem to think me driving a car like this gives them a licence to flirt with me, and even young guys smile at me,\u0027 she says. \u0027I guess those sort of glances are flattering.\u0027And I do see why some men feel they have to compete with me when they see me in the Porsche. I think it stems from cars having been a traditionally macho item.\u0027But they\u0027re just going to have to get used to more women, in better cars, overtaking them in the fast lane.\u0027 "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/12/4DF238A600000578-0-image-m-39_1530789105836.jpg","title":"Can spot venomous snake hiding grass","story":"    A keen eye might be able to pick out the red-bellied black snake hiding in this photoAlmost 60 people had a go at spotting the snake, with only a couple being able to correctly identify the lurking predator. One Facebook commenter made their guess, saying, \u0027Stripy looking long thing!

Travel, Rory Boland, said: ‘Not all customers are comfortable booking online, and they should not be penalised for booking over the phone. Airlines that are charging customers more must be clear and transparent about these additional fees.’Both BA and Tui said the charge represented the extra administration and staff costs involved in offering telephone bookings, while Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of its customers book over the phone.Easyjet said: ‘We encourage passengers to book online. Those using our telephone service are informed of the online discount at the beginning of the call’.It also said that passengers needing special assistance can still receive the online price by phone. The mark-up comes on top of other charges applied by airlines such as passengers being be charged up to £16 to pick their seat. People who choose to put a suitcase in the hold can pay up to £38 for something under 20kg, while going over the weight allowance by the equivalent of a bag of sugar can trigger a £12 charge.          Ryanair said fewer than 0.5 per cent of their customers book over the telephoneAt least one airline now even charges customers a fee of £1.75 each way to take hand luggage into the cabin.A separate survey on airline fees by holiday currency experts FairFX found flight costs can soar once all the add-ons are taken into account.A spokesman said: ‘While many airlines will assign you a seat for free for your journey, if you are travelling with family, young children, friends or a partner, the only way to guarantee you will be sat next to each other is to pay the additional fee to reserve a seat.’FairFX said with each airline imposing its own costs and rules on putting luggage into the hold, it has become both confusing and expensive. For example, Ryanair, Tui and Thomas Cook have a 20kg limit per bag, but the fees vary from £23 to £38. BA, EasyJet and Flybe have a higher 23kg limit and the fees range from £20 to £31. The limit at Jet2 is 22kg and there is a charge of £22.Most short-haul travellers have switched to taking only hand luggage to avoid these fees, but even this is no longer guaranteed to be free. Last summer Jet2 introduced ‘guaranteed cabin luggage’, charging passengers £1.75 each if they want to guarantee their hand luggage does not end up in the hold.FairFX chief Ian Strafford-Taylor said booking holidays has become a ‘financial minefield for families’ and warned them to be aware of the different add-ons, which could soon see the cost of their holidays ‘rocket’. "},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/01/4DF704B200000578-5923739-The_19_year_old_was_crowned_with_the_title_a_year_after_she_inke-m-28_1530838484459.jpg","title":"KFC free chicken winner tattoo fried chicken got Schoolies Gold Coast","story":"    Brooke Collins (pictured) won the \u0027Chicken Cheque\u0027 after the fast food outlet conducted a national search for the best \u0027hilarious story\u0027 about the greasy delicacy          The 19-year-old was crowned with the title a year after she inked her ankle (pictured) with the global icon \u0027KFC\u0027 during a Schoolies trip to the Gold Coast\u0027If that doesn\u0027t show dedication and love for KFC then I dunno what does,\u0027 Brooke wrote alongside her Facebook entry.The Sydney girl said she and her friend \u0027bonded\u0027 over fried chicken during the Year 12 and \u0027wanted to get matching tattoos at schoolies\u0027.\u0027So we got to the Gold Coast and had time to kill before check-in, and basically went and got the tattoos after being at Schoolies for not even half an hour!

Lest we forget: Jewish diarist Anne Frank, pictured in 1940, went into hiding with her family in Amsterdam in 1942, and died in a German Nazi concentration camp three years later, after they were discovered and deportedHowever, he also mentioned that \u0027all the papers have been destroyed there\u0027, because on May 14, 1940, while the Frank family was still on a waiting list for possible visas, the American consulate was devastated during German bombardment and all papers were lost.Even without the loss of their visa application, it would have been difficult for the Franks to immigrate to the United States.With hundreds of thousands of people seeking refuge in the US each year by the time war broke out in 1939, Washington was issuing fewer than 30,000 annual visas.The processing of a visa application also lasted several years and included a huge amount of paper work, and affidavits from relatives or friends in the US.Even with all these demands fulfilled, applicants could still be turned down.The new research focused on the paper trail, looking at documents such as the affidavits of support, testimonies on character and other such items provided to the US authorities in the screening process, in addition to items such as birth certificates, wedding certificates, tax clearances and more.The war further complicated any immigration efforts.          Efforts: Otto Frank, pictured with Anne in 1941, is thought to have tried twice to apply for U.S. visas and once to Cuba but was \u0027thwarted by American bureaucracy, war and time\u0027A renewed attempt in 1941 to get the family to the US failed because all American consulates in Germany-occupied Europe, including the Netherlands, were closed by the Nazis.A visa application to Cuba that same year also never came through.While the Franks were not explicitly denied visas by the American consulate, \u0027their efforts were thwarted by American bureaucracy, war and time\u0027, the historians wrote.\u0027All their attempts failed, so going into hiding was their last attempt trying to get out of the hands of the Nazis,\u0027 said Annemarie Bekker, from the Anne Frank House.The family hid for more than two years during the war and it was then that Anne wrote her famous diary.On August 4, 1944, they were discovered and ultimately deported to Auschwitz. Only Anne\u0027s father survived the war. Anne, who was 15, and her sister died in the Bergen-Belsen camp.After the war, Mr Frank had his daughter\u0027s diary published, and it went on to become a symbol of hope and resilience that has been translated into dozens of languages.The house where the Franks hid was turned into a museum that is one of Amsterdam\u0027s most popular tourist attractions."},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/05/08/4DF02A4400000578-5920215-image-a-1_1530777348406.jpg","title":"Trapped Thai boy pictured England shirt love Three Lions win World Cup","story":"    Sompong Jaiwong, one of the young footballers trapped underground in Thailand, supports England and would \u0027love\u0027 the Three Lions to win the World Cup, his family has revealed.

Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp has wished the Thai cave boys his support while they are stuck in the caveThe players remain trapped despite being reached this week by cave-ing rescuers, who released footage of them looking emaciated but calm, some wearing football shirts.Their harrowing ordeal coincides with the World Cup in Russia and it has not escaped the attention of players.\u0027I\u0027ve been speaking about it with a few of the boys,\u0027 said England defender John Stones, according to British media.\u0027It\u0027s so sad to see where they are and we hope they get out safe and sound.\u0027Japan\u0027s World Cup squad tweeted a video urging the team to \u0027Hang in there!\u0027, while Brazil legend Ronaldo called their plight \u0027terrible\u0027.\u0027The world of football hopes that someone can find a way to take these kids out of there,\u0027 he said, according to CNN.จานนี อินฟานติโน ประธานสหพันธ์ฟุตบอลนานาชาติ (ฟีฟ่า) ได้ส่งจดหมายถึง พล.ต.อ. สมยศ พุ่มพันธุ์ม่วง...Posted by FA Thailand on\u0026nbspThursday, 5 July 2018Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp urged them to \u0027stay strong and know we are with you\u0027, in a video message sent to CNN.\u0027We are following all the news and hoping every second that you see daylight again,\u0027 Klopp said. \u0027We are all very optimistic that it will happen, hopefully in minutes, hours or the next few days.\u0027Meanwhile the Croatian Football Federation said it was \u0027awed\u0027 by the team\u0027s calm under pressure.\u0027We are awed by the bravery and strength that these young boys and their coach have shown amidst such frightening circumstances,\u0027 it said on its website.Many fans on social media said the boys deserved the World Cup trophy for the way they have handled their ordeal.Afp                                                    But Thailand\u0027s Navy SEAL commander indicated that rescuers may have little choice but to attempt the tricky extraction of the group, in the first official admission that they cannot wait out the monsoon underground.\u0027At first, we thought the children could stay for a long time... but now things have changed, we have a limited time,\u0027 Apakorn Yookongkaew told reporters.A sombre mood has clouded the elation from earlier in the week, when the boys were found dishevelled and hungry but alive on a ledge several miles inside the cave.Many of the boys - aged between 11 to 16 - are unable to swim and none has scuba experience, further imperilling any attempt to e out of the cave.Those risks were made all the more immediate by the death of the er, identified as Saman Kunan, who passed out and perished while returning from the chamber where the boys are trapped.  The youngster - known to friends as Pong - dreams of becoming a footballer and representing his nation, according to his former teacherHe was part of a team trying to establish an air line to the chamber where the children are awaiting rescue.The Seal commander said oxygen levels in their shelter had dropped, but said a doctor was with the team monitoring their health.The accident marks the first major setback for the gargantuan effort, which started almost two weeks ago after the \u0027Wild Boars\u0027 team went into the cave in northern Thailand following football practice.Their ordeal has gripped Thailand, with the nation holding its breath for their safe escape.Messages of support for the \u0027Wild Boars\u0027 have come in from across the world, including from football stars in Russia for the World Cup.The unprecedented rescue mission has been dogged by the threat of rains, which complicate pumping water out of the cave system.Intermittent rain hit the already muddy camp site on Friday.The trapped team has been receiving basic training in breathing through ing equipment in case the order to evacuate is given.But authorities are reluctant to allow them to e out of the cave, given the extreme risks.Other options under consideration are waiting out the monsoon - which could take months - or climbing out through a crack in the rock face, if one can be found.  Thai boy trapped in cave dreams of Premier League stardom"},{"url":"https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/07/06/09/4DF842D100000578-0-image-a-3_1530867475018.jpg","title":"Grandfather 81 performs BACKFLIP pool two years going viral trick","story":"    Getting ready!

People of Russia began to eat and sell human limbs due to the food struggle during the Russian famine of 1921          This photo taken in October 1921 shows starving children at Samara Camp during the famine in RussiaRussian academics have previously researched and catalogued examples of cannibalism and corpse eating and in one account described how a woman refused to give over her husband\u0027s dead body because she was using it for meat.The starving peasants were even seen digging up recently buried corpses to retrieve their flesh, as well as eating grass and animals that were previously considered pets. The police took no action as cannabalism was considered a legitimate method of survival.Eventually aid workers from America and Europe arrived and in 1921 one wrote a stomach churning account of what they\u0027d seen: \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Ghastly rumours about sausages prepared with human corpses though officially contradicted, were common. In the market, among rough huckstresses swearing at each other, one heard threats to make sausages of a person.\u0027Annother aid worker reported : \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Under the headline \u0027Mother turns cannibal\u0027, the Mirror reported on January 16,1922: \u0027Famine is so acute in the Pugatjewsk district of Samara that a woman at the village of Mokscha was found eating the corpse of her daughter.\u0027          A couple with their starving children during a famine in the U.S.S.R., circa 1922          This photo taken in 1921 shows a family stricken by famine in the Volga region, Russia, during the Russian Civil War          In this picture taken in October 1921, famine-stricken refugee children are seen in Russia during the Russian Civil WarOther disturbing images from the famine show children suffering with severe malnutrition, their stomachs bloated and almost every bone in their body visible.One of the worst hit places was the city of Samara, situated in the southeastern part of European Russia at the confluence of the Volga and Samara Rivers.Aid from outside Russia was initially rejected by Lenin because he saw it as other countries interfering. Polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen came to the city in 1921 and was horrified by what he saw - almost the entire city was dying from hunger.He raised 40 billion Swiss francs and established up to 900 places where people could get food.Lenin was eventually convinced to let international aid agencies in and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.The American American Relief Administration, who were told they could not help in 1919, were granted access to the sick and starving in 1921 and provided great relief along with European aid agencies such as Save The Children.Lenin died shortly after the famine, in 1924, and was replaced by Joseph Stalin who became the  leader of the Soviet Union.MPs arrive at Chequers for day of discussion around Brexit blueprintJesse Lingard celebrates penalty win on pitch with supportersThai er who died shares video before travelling to caveTrailer for documentary Who Killed Sharon Birchwood?

So it is one-zero for us then.\u0027We do have caviar, but I am pretty sure they can manage without caviar and it will be a good game. Otherwise they are welcome to visit us. It will be a fantastic match between two great teams.\u0027He added: \u0027We had Netherlands and France in our (qualifying) group and we beat Italy in a play off.

But it would be so boring if life was always like that.\u0027He said the Swedish fans would support England if Sweden is knocked out and added: \u0027Harry Kane is a fantastic player and we follow the Premier League in Sweden.

People of Russia began to eat and sell human limbs due to the food struggle during the Russian famine of 1921          This photo taken in October 1921 shows starving children at Samara Camp during the famine in RussiaRussian academics have previously researched and catalogued examples of cannibalism and corpse eating and in one account described how a woman refused to give over her husband\u0027s dead body because she was using it for meat.The starving peasants were even seen digging up recently buried corpses to retrieve their flesh, as well as eating grass and animals that were previously considered pets. The police took no action as cannabalism was considered a legitimate method of survival.Eventually aid workers from America and Europe arrived and in 1921 one wrote a stomach churning account of what they\u0027d seen: \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Ghastly rumours about sausages prepared with human corpses though officially contradicted, were common. In the market, among rough huckstresses swearing at each other, one heard threats to make sausages of a person.\u0027Annother aid worker reported : \u0027Families were killing and devouring fathers, grandfathers and children.\u0027Under the headline \u0027Mother turns cannibal\u0027, the Mirror reported on January 16,1922: \u0027Famine is so acute in the Pugatjewsk district of Samara that a woman at the village of Mokscha was found eating the corpse of her daughter.\u0027          A couple with their starving children during a famine in the U.S.S.R., circa 1922          This photo taken in 1921 shows a family stricken by famine in the Volga region, Russia, during the Russian Civil War          In this picture taken in October 1921, famine-stricken refugee children are seen in Russia during the Russian Civil WarOther disturbing images from the famine show children suffering with severe malnutrition, their stomachs bloated and almost every bone in their body visible.One of the worst hit places was the city of Samara, situated in the southeastern part of European Russia at the confluence of the Volga and Samara Rivers.Aid from outside Russia was initially rejected by Lenin because he saw it as other countries interfering. Polar explorer Fridtjof Nansen came to the city in 1921 and was horrified by what he saw - almost the entire city was dying from hunger.He raised 40 billion Swiss francs and established up to 900 places where people could get food.Lenin was eventually convinced to let international aid agencies in and Nansen was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts.The American American Relief Administration, who were told they could not help in 1919, were granted access to the sick and starving in 1921 and provided great relief along with European aid agencies such as Save The Children.Lenin died shortly after the famine, in 1924, and was replaced by Joseph Stalin who became the  leader of the Soviet Union.MPs arrive at Chequers for day of discussion around Brexit blueprintJesse Lingard celebrates penalty win on pitch with supportersThai er who died shares video before travelling to caveTrailer for documentary Who Killed Sharon Birchwood?

footballing and online prowess into a strong brand, based on his distinctive goal celebration, in which he spells out his initials with his hands          He is now busy building a brand around his celebration and his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027The public\u0027s love of the England team is a million miles from when Sam Allardyce lost his job as England manager  after he was filmed talking to undercover reporters posing as businessmen.Back then, confidence in the national team was at rock bottom.  But now, just two years on, England have rebuilt their public image, thanks to squeaky-clean Gareth Southgate and his squad of fresh-faced young players.Among them is 25-year-old Lingard, who, with four million Instagram followers, is at the head of a group of stars whose social media posts are watched by thousands of young fans.EXCLUSIVE: Sweden\u0027s WAGS will stay at the same hotel as the...EXCLUSIVE: Man dumped by Gareth Southgate\u0027s wife for England...Share this articleA social media hit this week came Jesse filmed fellow young player Trent Alexander-Arnold saying \u0027It\u0027s coming home\u0027 to him on the pitch after the Colombia victory.Lingard has also posted videos of himself dancing in his pants with Ruben Loftus-Cheek in the changing room, being shaved by teammates and celebrating with fans.Such videos give fans a players\u0027 eye view of the World Cup and take supporters inside the England camp in a way never seen before.     He is currently believed to be single are his relationship with Jena Frumes ended in scandal          Jena split from Jesse

his and other players\u0027 tweets and videos are building a new image for the national side, totally distinct from the days of \u0027dentist chair\u0027 drinkathons and Graham Taylor\u0027s \u0027turnips\u0027.Former Twitter head of sport Lewis Wiltshire told The Daily Star: \u0027If there is a player who uses Instagram better or more effectively than Jesse Lingard, I\u0027m yet to see them.\u0027These players are from a generation where they understand and enjoy this stuff.\u0027I\u0027m convinced it\u0027s at the heart of why this England team\u0027s public image is different from, say, 10 years ago.\u0027Mr Wiltshire says he doesn\u0027t believe a representative handles Jesse\u0027s social media for him, as with other players, which may be part of its success.The Manchester United midfielder could now use his performances in the World Cup to launch a strong Beckham-like \u0027brand\u0027.He has used Instagram to give fans a players-eye view of the World Cup, including video of him dancing in his pants in the changing room  He stays close to his grandmother and grandfather, who helped get him into football as a childThree weeks before the tournament, Lingard applied for four trademarks, three centred on his nickname \u0027JLingz\u0027 and another featuring his goal celebration, in which he holds his hands in front of his face and spells out his initials.He has since launched a clothing range, including caps, T-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with his goal celebration logo, which have already all sold out on his website jlingz.com.Andy Sutherden, head of sport  marketing at H+K Strategies, told CityAM: \u0027Jesse Lingard\u0027s team has acknowledged the fact that if he does well in Russia, there’s an immediate opportunity but one with a very short shelf life. \u0027They’re also understanding of the fact that people who become known for something different - think Crouch and the robot - extend their marketing appeal beyond the audience of sport.\u0027 Meanwhile, there is rumours that Manchester United bosses are set to increase his wages from £75,000 to £150,000 to keep other clubs from trying to tempt him away.          The 25-year-old midfielder is one of a new generation of players who is savvy with social media          While communicating with his millions of Instagram followers, he has created a strong brand          He has now used the platform to launch a range of clothing, including these JLingz capsOne thing that makes his social media postings different from some of teammates is the lack of a girlfriend.He dated childhood sweetheart Emma Hyde for five years until he ended it in 2016.He later went out with glamorous US-based Instagram model Jena Frumes, but she dumped him after a tabloid newspaper revealed he had sex with an admin assistant from Sheffield in a hot tub.Jesse remains committed his family, and even has a picture of his mother Kirsty, 49, in his room in Russia.As a boy he attended Beamont Community Primary school in Warrington, where most of the boys his age wanted to play rugby league.His grandfather Ken, a former GB power lifter, was the one who suggested he take up football and ferried him to training sessions and matches.

This is how the great female 17th-century painter Artemisia Gentileschi portrays herself in a sensational, newly uncovered masterpiece that has just been bought by the National Gallery for £3.6m – a record for her work.Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria is a stunning collision of art and reality that sends a raw and intimate message straight from the 1600s to us. Her eyes look away, as if thinking of a painful memory, yet there is a calm in her monumental pose. She’s got the strong, muscular arms Artemisia always gave the women in her paintings and as she ponders the past, the fingers of her left hand rest on a shattered wooden wheel with vicious metal spikes embedded in its rim. Just a few years before she painted this self-portrait, those fingers were deliberately crushed in a courtroom in Rome, when an 18-year-old Gentileschi was publicly subjected to a thumbscrew-like torture called the sibille. Cords were twisted round her fingers then pulled tight, supposedly to ensure her evidence at the trial of the man who raped her was honest.When I saw the painting in the National Gallery’s skylit conservation workshop earlier this week, the atmosphere was intense. I was the first person from outside the gallery, since it acquired the work, to encounter the spellbinding record of her pain and courage. Just weeks ago, I had written in the  about why the National Gallery urgently needs an example of this great artist’s work, so they had invited me to “come and see her”.There’s something very special about seeing a great work of art on an easel, unframed, still with patches of surface dirt and the odd minor abrasion that will be carefully fixed before it goes on public view next year.  The painting was discovered in 2017. For centuries it had been owned by a French family, its authorship forgotten, but last December it was auctioned in Paris and bought by a London dealer. Letizia Treves, the National Gallery’s curator of baroque art, knew the museum had to have it. This is a historic moment for the gallery. Only a tiny proportion of the art it displays is by female artists. Gentileschi’s painting has just become the 20th work by a woman to enter its collection of more than 2,300 European paintings created between the middle ages and the era of Cézanne.As we contemplate Gentileschi’s gaze in the hidden studio, it is obvious I am not the only one who finds this an emotional moment. Treves points out the palm that Gentileschi is holding in her right hand, the symbol of her victory through martyrdom. But does this palm, wonders Treves, look like a paint brush? If so, it adds yet another autobiographical layer. They tried to break her on the wheel, but she survived to become a painter.Larry Keith, the National Gallery’s head of conservation, who is going to restore the painting over the next six to nine months before it goes on show in 2019, points to a small patch he has already cleaned. There’s a lot of deep, subtle shadow there, he explains, that will give the painting a powerful “sculptural” quality once the remains of bad restorations and varnishes are removed.Gentileschi was born in Rome in 1593, the daughter of the painter Orazio Gentileschi. Having an artist for a father was about the only way women could get access to the training expected of artists in Renaissance and baroque Europe. Artemisia grew up in the heart of a thrilling and radical artistic subculture. Her father was a close friend of the hard-living, hard-painting Caravaggio, whose sensual, stark art blew apart convention at the end of the 1500s. As a child, Artemisia must have met Caravaggio many times. Her paintings – including this one – make plain her devotion to his art.Treves looks forward to seeing this painting hanging next to Caravaggio’s masterpieces in a few months time. It shares his raw passion for life. I see it as a dialogue with his Saint Catherine in Madrid’s Thyssen Collection. In both, there is a still, contemplative mood. Yet when you look at the sword Caravaggio’s model holds, or the spikes next to Gentileschi’s fingers, the threat of violence hangs there like a bad memory.Gentileschi’s access to training as a painter came at a terrible price. Agostino Tassi, the painter friend her father hired as an art teacher, made ever-more menacing advances that culminated in rape. As the father of a “dishonoured” 18- year-old daughter, Orazio brought charges. The resulting trial was a cause célèbre as witness after witness attested to Tassi’s bad character – it seemed he had previously murdered his wife. The facts of his attack on Gentileschi were clearly established, not least by her own eloquent account, where she told how she nearly stabbed him to death. Yet Tassi walked away because the Pope, for whom he was painting frescoes, protected him. It was Gentileschi’s name that was tarnished.Gentileschi poses with the wheel, adopting the iconography of Catherine of Alexandria that had been long established by artists like Raphael (whose version is also in the National Gallery). The wheel is a symbol of suffering overcome, a reminder of violence endured. For us it looks like a direct allusion to her ordeal of rape, torture and humiliation. It would have had that meaning for its first audience, too. The 1612 trial made Gentileschi notorious. She painted this testimony in Florence, where she rebuilt her life and career under the patronage of the Grand Duke of Tuscany. Her gory painting Judith Slaying Holofernes, which can still be seen in Florence’s Uffizi Gallery, seems to fantasise revenge in its gruesome vision of a bearded man who has just woken to find one muscular woman pinioning him on his blood-spattered bed while another is halfway through hacking his head off.No one in Gentileschi’s circles in around 1616 could be unaware of her widely publicised story. Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine is perhaps her most explicitly autobiographical work. Her famous Self-Portrait as the Allegory of Painting, in the Royal Collection, depicts her from the side as she energetically goes to work. In the former she looks out, and we are drawn deep into her sensitive face.Artemisia is worth 10 average Old Masters. The combination of her brutalised early life and Caravaggio’s lesson that art and life are the same thing drove her to paint from a previously obscured female perspective. When she painted Judith killing Holofernes or the creepy elders spying on Susanna, she brought a personal point of view to these biblical themes. In her hands, they become studies of gender and power. She put her experience of the violent and unquestioned misogyny of her age, which meant that an 18-year-old aspiring artist was considered fodder for a sexual predator, into art that was honoured and admired by fans from the Medici to England’s Charles I. In Self-Portrait as Saint Catherine of Alexandria she has truly survived. She stands by the broken wheel and defies its spikes. She proclaims her triumphant entry into a male-only profession.Four hundred years on, that triumph is finally complete. Her vision will blaze in the National Gallery next to works by her father Orazio and her creative godfather Caravaggio. This gallery may still have pitifully few paintings by women but it matters hugely that one of them is by this truly great artist. This is one of the most important purchases the National Gallery has ever made."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/26b8ed9034b6b21a391275be6f8c6adb0f63419e/0_0_5694_4049/master/5694.jpg?w=1200\u0026h=630\u0026q=55\u0026auto=format\u0026usm=12\u0026fit=crop\u0026crop=faces%2Centropy\u0026bm=normal\u0026ba=bottom%2Cleft\u0026blend64=aHR0cHM6Ly9hc3NldHMuZ3VpbS5jby51ay9pbWFnZXMvb3ZlcmxheXMvZDM1ODZhNWVmNTc4MTc1NmQyMWEzYjYzNWU1MTcxNDEvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc=\u0026s=c447c75bcfffe8aa24b25c4af1f232be","title":"agence myop photographers at the arles festival in pictures","story":"For the opening week of the Rencontres Internationale de la Photographie, Agence MYOP photographers occupy an abandoned school in the heart of the old city and present 18 exhibitions of new and unseen work"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1bc64d1b061c419b8ab14fb24ed18250d82ab60c/0_341_5120_3072/master/5120.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b9db93ab5da59cff73ff8a90401a0c47","title":"uk house prices rise for second month running says halifax","story":"Mortgage lender says overall the market remains flat, as annual growth rate falls againHouse prices rose for the second month running in June, adding £745 to the value of an average property, but the market remains flat, according to Halifax.Russell Galley, the Halifax’s managing director, said property values remained broadly flat, amid relatively low levels of market activity. However, he added: “We continue to see very positive factors of continuing low mortgage rates, great affordability levels and a robust labour market. The continuing shortage of properties for sale should also continue to support price growth.”Commenting on the figures, Jeremy Leaf, a north London estate agent and former Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors residential chairman, said: “Once again, we are seeing a market in subdued mode, supported broadly for some time by low interest rates and unemployment, as well as more specifically by low stock.”He added that on the ground, “we have reached the limit of what many buyers can afford, so this is not a correction, more a realignment of prices to reflect changes in circumstances”.Jonathan Hopper, managing director of Garrington property finders, said that at a national level, “house prices are stuck in an awkward, shuffling dance – periodically taking one step forward and two steps back”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/418427775559f9579df5710acc5c236981820b73/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b8e385d125f68bc51ec401098fa4d407","title":"brexit tories jeremy corbyn","story":"The party has abandoned business and the union and now cares only about keeping Jeremy Corbyn out of powerOn the night of the Brexit referendum Michael Gove went to bed, full of red wine and smoked beef, before the results were in. He had campaigned to leave the European Union, but his main concern that night was that remain might win by anything up to 15 points. He slept soundly.He was woken the next morning as his wife, the journalist Sarah Vine, turned on the television to see the press gathered outside their house. According to Tim Shipman in All Out War, as he came out of the shower Vine greeted him with Michael Caine’s most famous quote from The Italian Job, after one of his fellow villains blasts a van to smithereens: “You were only supposed to blow the bloody doors off.”The purpose of the Brexit referendum had precious little to do with the EU it was simply the latest in a litany of efforts to quell the decades-long psychodrama within the Conservative party.Not only did it achieve the opposite – deepening and exacerbating the rancour within the party – it spread the infection to the country as a whole. For the past two years our government has been paralysed by an internal party feud that has held the nation’s future hostage.“There are two kinds of European nations,” the Danish finance minister, Kristian Jensen, said last year. “There are small nations and there are countries that have not yet realised they are small nations.” Witnessing that realisation dawn on this government has been painful to watch anticipating the consequences for generations to come has been excruciating.So on Friday at Chequers the government will do what it has been doing for the past two years: spend an inordinate amount of time negotiating with itself before producing a “solution” that is unworkable, only to take it to Brussels and discover it is also unacceptable. The problem is not just that they don’t have a rabbit they don’t even have a hat.Through a series of self-inflicted wounds the Conservative party has reduced itself to this: hovering between delusional and deranged, bluster and buffoonery. Insisting on concessions that have not been offered suggesting solutions that have already been rejected showing up to negotiations with nothing to offer refusing to concede anything, only then to capitulate to everything.For Conservatives this crisis is no longer just about Europe. Brexit has thrown into question their raison d’etre as a party.It’s not difficult to see why. After the British chief executive of the German-owned Siemens, Jürgen Maier, asked for clarity on the deal Britain was looking for – citing Airbus and other companies’ concerns – the nation’s chief diplomat, foreign secretary Boris Johnson, responded, “Fuck\u0026nbspbusiness”.“There are more anti-business Conservatives in the party than at any time in recent history,” the president of the Confederation of British Industry told the Financial Times recently.It used to be the party of the union. But even as its minority government clings to power, thanks to the hardline Democratic Unionist party, Brexit presents perhaps the greatest challenge to the integrity of the United Kingdom for some time. In Scotland the brief surge for independence following the Brexit referendum has waned for now. But for a range of reasons Ireland is different.Johnson finds the apparently irreconcilable concerns in Ireland – about the possibility of a reintroduction of a hard border between north and south, and Unionist worries about retaining the same status as the rest of Britain – “millennium bug stuff”.During a closed-door speech to members of Conservative Way Forward at the Institute of Directors in London last month, he said: “It’s so small and there are so few firms that actually use that border regularly, it’s just beyond belief that we’re allowing the tail to wag the dog in this way … We’re allowing the whole of our agenda to be dictated by this folly.”The issue is not that the Conservatives no longer believe in these things it is that they no longer seem to believe in anything apart from their capacity to remain in power. This alone would not be such a heinous goal if it were accompanied by any real ambition about what to do with the power they have. But they have none. Their domestic agenda is dwarfed by Brexit and they do not have a Brexit agenda they can agree on.So the government limps from crisis to crisis, summit to summit, dragging the country towards a clifftop of unknown altitude, without plan or purpose. Its cabinet is not a balance of talents and expertise but of leave and remain – the sole prism through which all disagreements are viewed. Riven at the highest levels, rudderless at every turn, leaderless in all but name, at the mercy of small numbers, they keep going.The only thing keeping the whole enterprise together at this point is the likelihood that a coup would prompt an election that could make Jeremy Corbyn the prime minister. They fear he will wreck the country – and refuse to give him the pleasure when they are doing such a good job on that front themselves."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b5ebc4cf5b705f75613488abbc632673dcd9b6bf/0_0_5760_3456/master/5760.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=257723e2d947c903cb1d0c45bd786fa9","title":"denver on tap are these the best brews in the us","story":"Artisan ale lovers, hop to it: with dozens upon dozens of top breweries and an annual beer fest to boot, Denver’s craft beer scene is the toast of the country.

One trainer model – the Nike Air Jordan 1 Off-White in a new blue and white “North Carolina” colourway – is likely to become the most in-demand of the convention, according to Sergio Muster, managing director and co-founder of Sneakerness. The style sold out immediately when it was released through retailers last week, priced at around $190 (£144). It is tipped to fetch between £1,000 and £1,500 at the event, where it will be sold by private collectors.Other rare shoes will include the Nike Air Max Parra x Patta Cherrywood, likely to fetch between £3,000 and £5,000, as well as the Kanye West-designed Adidas Yeezy 350 V2 Butter. The bulbous “Dad trainer” trend – the anti-fashion footwear silhouette of the moment – will also be big news, says Muster, with the Yeezy Wave Runner a key style that collectors will be looking out for.Trends are moving faster than ever, thanks to the rapid pace of social media. Muster says: “If Drake wears a pair of Jordans today then everyone will want Jordans on Saturday.” Though sneakerheads’ dedication is a cut above anything seen in the mainstream, their taste has a ripple effect. Their favourite designer, says Muster, is Off-White’s Virgil Abloh, who was recently appointed artistic director of menswear at the world’s biggest luxury brand, Louis Vuitton. The sneaker world, he says, is about preservation of culture and an “appreciation of an aesthetic – people gravitating towards the same thing. It’s a fascinating anthropological study. We are human, we have passions. We want to create a world around us that is not drab. We want to brighten up the place.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9eb5ee6bf1d4a9043d95e6f48ff96a916c3eccb0/142_21_892_535/master/892.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0a69845720adc2dfd88a284cee1e351b","title":"ideal home review steve coogans celebrity chef cooks up a dud","story":"In this unfunny comedy, Coogan plays half of a gay couple thrown into disarray by the unexpected arrival of his grandsonIt always hurts to see a clever British comedy star forced to conform to a tin-eared Hollywood idea of what a posh Brit should sound like. Russell Brand went through it with the Arthur remake, and now Steve Coogan endures the same thing in this entirely disposable comedy about a super-gay celebrity foodie called Erasmus presenting a cookery show on American TV.He bickeringly lives in a lifestyle-magazine-type hacienda with his long-suffering partner and producer Paul – in which role Paul Rudd does his best. They are living the dream, kind of, until a tousle-haired kid turns up out of the blue. Bill (Jack Gore) turns out to be Erasmus’s grandson, via a rashly experimental heterosexual hookup ages ago, that Paul knew nothing about until now.The resulting grownup son is now in jail on drugs charges but he managed to get Bill away before the police showed up, with instructions to look up his granddad in Santa Fe. Yikes! Do you suppose these squabbling selfish gays are going to be furious at first, but then grow to love the kid, and then face a Kramer vs Kramer crisis with the authorities? Of course, Erasmus could quite plausibly have been Bill’s dad, not granddad, and that would have created a more prominent part for the boy’s mother. Disappointingly, there are no interesting roles for women in this film. The movie concludes with a rather solemn series of photos of real-life gay couples with their babies, running over the credits, just to show that this film’s heart is in the right place. And so it is, but this means the film is chary of the cynicism or satire that it initially appears to be serving up. There are simply no funny lines here."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b315df0f64f62df0a831632e70b04fa4a927f9c1/104_0_4119_2472/master/4119.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=78f80a3f2aeefdd2175496d2ba07f0fd","title":"stop harry kane england sweden world cup quarter final","story":"• Andreas Granqvist wary of threat posed by opposite number• Sweden captain warns England not to underestimate themSweden will work to neutralise the threat posed by England’s Harry Kane on Saturday, when the two sides meet in the World Cup quarter final tie in Samara.Sweden’s captain Andreas Granqvist said preventing England from supplying the current top scorer in Russia would be key to his team’s chances.“We know they have Harry Kane, who is really dangerous in the penalty box, so we need to be very strong in the box and try to make sure that they don’t get the service that they need,” Granqvist said, after a Sweden training session at the Samara Arena on Friday afternoon.“He’s incredibly skilled, not just at penalties, but as a striker. He’s good at everything and it’s going to be a very tough match against him. But we’re going to do everything to stop him,” he said.Sweden’s captain said the team spirit in their camp has made up for what is perhaps a lack of quality compared to some of the favourites to win the World Cup. Sweden dispatched the Netherlands and Italy in qualifying and went through to the knockout stage at the expense of Germany, despite losing their game against the defending champions.“We might not have on paper the best team inidually but as a team we’re very high achievers,” he said.Granqvist also became a father for the second time overnight, as his wife gave birth to a baby daughter. He said he had not slept much, but said he was not overwhelmed by the combination of events on and off the pitch.“It’s quite simple, getting a daughter is the most beautiful thing you can get, it’s a dream for every football player to play a quarter-final in the World Cup, I just try to enjoy it, to be present in the now to try get the best possible result,” he said.Sweden’s coach Janne Andersson also pinpointed the spirit of togetherness among the whole squad as the reason behind the progression to Sweden’s first quarter final since 1994. “The joy we feel, we’re in day 45 now together, and even I will have a bad day sometimes. And then you go to your room for a little rest and you come back with new energy and you can contribute to the team,” he said.He said the Swedish side has been preparing a game-plan for potential extra time and penalties, and he already knew which players would take spot-kicks in the event of a penalty shoot-out."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cb9744fe1e97a4b15b7496b55848f3cead8167b7/0_162_4853_2911/master/4853.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ca802a77d9b9cf8c8d0fe2b6c2298c63","title":"talking good game gareth southgate above blather","story":"The England manager has generally avoided clangers and corporate-speak and his sole lapse ‘owning the process’ may have been a radical rhetorical device that workedEvery England manager has had verbal idiosyncrasies and Gareth Southgate is no different. Which is to say: he is different.The most successful performer of the Impossible Job, Sir Alf Ramsey, developed a posh accent seemingly intended to mask his modest roots. But that didn’t mean he was snooty. “I suppose I’ll have to get used to being addressed as Sir,” he said in 1967 after being knighted for ongoing services to commemorative tat vendors. “But if any player gets formal with me I’ll clobber him.”Sir Bobby Robson had a habit of mixing up players’ names, once, reputedly, even confusing that of his captain with his own. “I’m Bryan,” Bryan Robson is said to have replied helpfully. “You’re Bobby.” He was also charmingly prone to letting his enthusiasm run ahead of his thinking. “Look at those olive trees!” he gushed in 1996 when explaining why he enjoyed life at Barcelona after stepping down from England. “They’re 200 years old – from before the age of Christ!”Fabio Capello declared at his unveiling as England manager in 2007 that he would be proficient in the local lingo within a month but, in truth, he never got to grips with it during his four-year reign and tended to convey a vibe best interpreted as “Inglese is for losers”.Roy Hodgson, by contrast, is a celebrated polyglot with a penchant for high-brow literature. So he could express himself beautifully. “That is absolute fucking bollocks,” quoth he in response to criticism following a scruffy 1-0 win over Norway in 2014. Scribes wasted many paragraphs on less pithy ways of saying the same things about his team’s performances.In 2016 Sam Allardyce had just finished greeting everyone when he had to say goodbye.And so to Southgate, who since being entrusted with the national team’s destiny has communicated with refreshing clarity. Thus his speech has matched an approach in which he has defetishised the captain’s armband, removed old hang-ups and pooh-poohed pomposity.He has addressed other issues with similar intelligence and simplicity, whether dismissing Boris Johnson’s grandstanding – “it is of little interest to me what the foreign secretary thinks about it,” he said in March after the politician compared Russia’s hosting of the World Cup to Hitler’s staging of the 1936 Olympics – or calmly confronting media organisations with double-standards. “I’m looking at a room full of journalists and it’s not very multicultural,” he began when asked to discuss racism in English football back when he was under-21 manager.And then this week he spoke about “owning the process” of penalty shooting. It wasn’t the first time, either. When it comes to preparing a football team there are some residents of England’s HQ in St George’s Park who like to sermonise about the “golden thread” running through national teams’ DNA and “ticking the boxes on the pathway” while “sharing the journey”. But Southgate tends to be above that blather, speaking in a way that leaves no doubt what he is talking about. He doesn’t do sloganeering. “Owning the process” is his solitary lapse.It sound suspiciously like the managerial jargon spouted by executives who try to dress up plain ideas in metaphorical cummerbunds. Or waistcoats. As such, it seemed uncharacteristic for Southgate.Probably, then, he has been using it as a radical rhetorical device, a deliberate rupture from his usual speech, so jarring that it reinforced the idea that English players had to change their thinking about penalties. And what better way to do that than by recognising that shooting from the spot is a process, not a lottery or a doomed attempt to break a hex.As for where Southgate picked up the term, who knows? It is already hackneyed in business parlance. Microsoft was using it as many as three years ago. And it has been deployed in other fields since long before that. Catherine Barns edited an issue of Accord magazine in 2002 entitled Owning the Process: Public Participation in Peacekeeping. That might have been handy reading as England prepared for their charm offensive in Russia. The phrase has also been commonly used in counselling, which, come to think of it, seems a good place to have started when seeking solutions to England’s penalty trauma.Having triumphed at last on penalties, England contest a quarter-final against Sweden, a team that plays like Southgate usually speaks: clearly and coherently, sans panache but with punch. They will be hard to beat, no what matter anyone says."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ca5946c7e4360964b92220401cdd2bb5d44f56d/0_34_1988_1193/master/1988.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2cfc8b778bbab7bd282b11720f72f259","title":"englands penalty heroics sweden march on and quarter finals to savour world cup football daily","story":"Max and co discuss England’s first ever penalty shootout win at a World Cup, Sweden progressing, a Mrs Granqvist update, Paul Konchesky and which of our panellists dealt with tonight’s football the best"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dc62cab3bbaa094cc44d986bf72208b02edf4374/0_262_3811_2287/master/3811.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b3a7d8d5e437f8fd26b0c46b04e41eac","title":"world cup 2018 quarter finals buildup russia live","story":"“Dear Daniel,” begins Mac Millings. “I’m sure this is too stupid and too long, but I’ve been enjoying this World Cup so much that I got a bit carried away and made some quarter-final predictions:Uruguay vs. FranceDiego Godín might look like he’s just escaped from the secret room on the top floor of Victor Frankenstein’s gaff, but he and his defesive cohorts mean that Uruguay are as solid at the back as my mate who only eats rice. France, meanwhile, looked as potent as my grandma’s milkman (true story remind me later) in their last game, but Óscar Tabárez won’t have his back line defend quite so far up the pitch as SampaoliMessiMascherano, who left more men hanging than an episode of The Handmaid’s Tale. Even without Cavani, Suarez is more than capable of nicking one. If he does, can France break their skilled, well-drilled opponents down? The way they played against Australia suggests not.Uruguay 1-0 FranceBrazil vs. BelgiumBrazil aren’t nearly as good as everyone (aka, that one article I read) says, as proven by Lozano, Vela, et al. giving them a solid test in the last round (particularly in the first half). Coutinho’s been all right, and Willian has shown flashes, but while Neymar may float like a butterfly, he falls like a drunk (that is, often, and usually of his own doing).Belgium won’t underestimate them like they did Japan. Hazard’s boys may be from a small country, one ided by history, language and culture, with a small population and therefore very infrequent Golden Generations, each of which has a subsequently disproportionate amount of pressure heaped upon their young shoulders, so that, despite some near misses, they’ve never quite...oh.Brazil 2-1 BelgiumRussia vs. CroatiaFor me, Croatia is beauty. The Dalmatian Coast Split’s centuries-old elegance Luka Modrić. Russia, by contrast, is the nation of Stalin, Putin, and the “Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?” audience that routinely sabotaged any contestant who asked for their help. I’ve loved this World Cup. Someone’s got to ruin it.Russia 1-0 CroatiaSweden vs. EnglandIf Harry’s brave boys get the first goal, they should pick off their opponents, but if Sweden score first, England are doomed. For all their other qualities (work ethic, aggression, schadenfreude), the English have always lacked creativity. This is a nation, remember, that voted, as its favourite painting, a ship being towed away for scrap. (An empty cart stuck in a river came second.) Luckily, Sweden’s only chance of a goal is if Marcus Berg (who has, thus far, shown all the manoeuvrability of his Titanic-bothering namesake, coupled with all the accuracy of a Trump-administration mouthpiece) boots one in off Emil Forsberg’s pretty little face.Sweden 3-0 EnglandI totally hated Handmaid’s Tale. No light, no sweep, nowhere to go. “Wes Brown has more significant honours than Wayne Rooney,” tweets Shizola. “Just saying”.Wes Brown was a player. Unfortunately, he got a stack of serious injuries when he was a kid so ended up becoming a tackler when he had the talent to become an everything. Still, his performance at in the second leg of the 2008 European Cup semi-final is the best I’ve ever seen in the flesh, and now his wife’s left, I miss his cameos in the Real Housewives of Cheshire. This is really interesting on patriotism and football in Croatia. “I have to take issue with you over Lukaku,” emails Geoff Saunders. “He has been good, no more than that. The reason I say that I that he has been unable to hold the ball up and enable Belgium’s runners to get beyond him. Look at his performances so far and contrast with what Drogba did for Chelsea - the clearance ball reached him and it stuck, then he brought midfielders into the game. However the match will be won or lost on whether Dembele plays. Witsel has been poor - I do not know why Martinez does not play Dembele, he is the solidity and muscle they need in midfield and he is much more creative than he is given credit for. And, no, I am not a Spurs fan. Brasil replace the excellent Casimiro with Fernandinho - a slight down grade but not by much.”I’m not sure you mean me, but Lukaku is a very different player to Drogba, who was a one-man forward line and big-game specialist. Lukaku is a goalscorer whose link-up play has improved a lot over the past season, and he’s miles ahead of where Drogba was at his age. I agree that Dembele is better than Witsel, but think that Casemiro is much tidier than Fernandinho. “I’m an expat living in Brazil for the past 4 years, back in England for a few weeks to see it come home,” emails Kieran Schofield. “Has everyone been watching the same seleçãoas me? They beat an average Mexican side (Lads, it’s Chicharito and Carlos Vela) who were lucky to scrape through the group stages and suddenly they are favourites? The 7-1 from 2014 still weighs heavily on the shoulders of the players and fans, and I fear another thumping today.”I backed them at the start because they seemed to most settled side, and also have plenty of options for when stuff doesn’t work. I’ve not seen much to make me revise that - they know what they’re doing and have improved in every game. France can beat them, but as I said, Belgium will need everything to go right. Either way, it’s still the greatest country in the world, for my money.Should anyone fancy something to read. I wrote this...I know it’d be bad for football in lots of ways, but I can’t get out of my head the joy and carnage of following my team through a club World Cup. My days.“Have the World Cup quarter-finals ever not included at least one of these teams: Germany, Italy, Spain, Argentina, Netherlands?” asks Barry Yourgrau, whose internet appears to be broken.The answer, though, is no – the closest we came was in 1962, when West Germany were the only one of those nations involved. Trivioh time: do you know your Gary Stevenses from your Gary Stevenses? Test your knowledge of England World Cup squads past with this quiz.As for the other tie, it’s hard to see Belgium finding enough to beat Brazil. The absence of Casemiro will make a difference, and for all their solidity, Brazil have conceded serious chances in every game. But you can rely on a level of performance with them, and you just can’t with the Belgians. They’ll need to play better than they ever have before and hope Brazil have an off-day that is unlikely.So what’s going to happen in today’s matches? Thanks to the Deschamps effect, France lack cohesion, tending to rely on good players doing good stuff, and against Uruguay will not be offered the kind of space in behind that Kylian Mbappé exploited against Argentina. But, in the end, and especially in the absence of Edinson Cavani, they ought to have enough I’d go for 1-0, maybe 2-0 with the second coming on the break and Uruguay battle for an equaliser. No need to thank me.You have not have heard, so: France and Uruguay are playing a quarter-final! This afternoon! By amazing coincidence, today’s Fiver performs a deep e into precisely that subject.Meanwhile, in non-World Cup-related news, Dimitri Payet might be going back to West Ham. Read about it here...And laugh about it here...Afternoon all. Well, this is exciting. Over the next few days we’re going to learn whether or not this World Cup has what it takes. It’s all very well having nice group games and decent last-16 drama, but classic tournaments are defined by what comes thereafter. We need epic matches, and failing great teams, great players for that reason, the highlights in my football-watching career are Mexico 86 and Italia 90, with France 98 just behind. Let’s be having you.I’m off for some lunch, so will pass over to Daniel Harris. See yous in a bit. Sweden have a plan!“We’ve been lucky in India where the segment is hosted by Joe “Footy”, hugely popular here,” writes Latha Ramanathan. “Of his commentators, the one whom our family, extended family, friends, extended friends have favoured is the India Captain, Sunil Chhetri. Wicked sense of humour, incisive insights and comments with a bite. The least liked - a toss up between David James (absurd and stupid comments plus impossible to fathom that drawl) and former United player, Wes Brown, who was straight out impossible to understand!!!”Wes has been a busy man this tournament, he also appeared on the pitch before Colombia v England as a ‘Fifa Legend’. We need to talk about Belgium. Roberto Martínez has been pretty gung-ho thus far with his tactics, and while it worked well in the group stages, Belgium nearly came unstuck against Japan. It will be interesting to see who tries to wrestle control of the ball against Brazil, both teams will want to keep possession but also have the ability to use a more counter-attacking strategy if they so choose. Belgium look a little fragile at the back, so I would expect them to err on the side of caution. I’m really interested to see how Romelu Lukaku gets on, he’s had a fabulous World Cup so far but seems to struggle in games where chances are at a premium.Jonathan Wilson has his own thoughts on the tactical battle tonight. Once Dani Alves was ruled out of the squad through injury, Brazil always looked vulnerable at right-back. Danilo – who on Thursday night was ruled out of the tournament because of an ankle injury – played in the draw against Switzerland, since when Fagner has been deployed there. Vela, and Hirving Lozano when he moved to the Mexican left, both made him look slow on the turn. The problem for Belgium, though, is that their 3-4-2-1 does not necessarily push a player tight up against the full-back. Yannick Carrasco can get forward from left wing-back but he is likely to have his hands full dealing with Willian. That then means Eden Hazard, who operates almost as an inside-left behind Romelu Lukaku, with Dries Mertens alongside him, needs to pull to the left to try to pressure Fagner. But that in turn leaves an additional problem, one that Mexico faced, which is how to get sufficient players into the box to take advantage. If Hazard pulls left, it places great onus on Kevin De Bruyne to get forward to join Mertens and Lukaku in the box.You can read the rest of Jonathan Wilson’s blog right here. Just seen this. Roll on tomorrow. “Hi Michael,” emails Simon Cowley. “In Germany, we don’t even have co-commentators. Just one solitary commentator, alone in the stadium, regularly calling players by the wrong name or contesting correct refereeing decisions. Mostly they sound very, very bored.”Paul Doyle on Gareth Southgate, and why what managers say to the press – and how they say it – matters. A few of you have got in touch re Brazil. “I think the Brazil-hating, for me at least, is two-fold. 1) Neymar 2) They just don’t look like the Brazil’s of old and haven’t for about 12 years. I and a lot of others were brought up on Brazil basically being the Harlem Globetrotters of football total entertainers. This and the 2014 side just look average and perfunctory and they stir nothing in me. I think they’re going to get found out at some stage” – David Penney.“I doubt I am the first to say this but it was certainly not one instance against Mexico that changed things... Indeed, they have been unlikeable since the first game of the tournament DESPITE players like Coutinho being, as pointed out, charming chaps. It is not only Neymar - others too have been guilty of horrendous playacting” – Gary Naylor.“Is this not another case of English fans getting ahead of ourselves… and visualising a final against Belgium being a less-difficult thing than a final against Brazil? Or is it just a nice neighbourly love-in? I think the first” – Sam Hedges.I still have them down as favourites to win the tournament, and I don’t necessarily agree that they haven’t brought the pizazz this year. Considering their last truly great World Cup side was in 2006 (where they were beaten by another star-laden side France), I think they’ve done quite well to bring some samba flair, and stay true to the sensible tactical changes that Tite has brought in. Both centre backs, Thiago Silva and Miranda, have been superb, and the attackdefence balance they have in midfield – Coutinho, Paulinho, Casemiro – is unrivalled. Up front has been hit and miss, and I would not be surprised to see Firmino start against Belgium tonight.Re the third email, I definitely agree, but surely the ideal scenario is winning the World Cup final by beating Brazil. The ultimate glamour tie. OK, OK, we’re getting ahead of ourselves again. Do the world a favour Belgium.It’s amazing how one incident against Mexico can turn public sentiment so greatly against Brazil. Neymar aside, Brazil are a very likeable team: mostly relatively humble stars like Coutinho, Firmino, Casemiro, Paulinho and Gabriel Jesus, a coach that has galvanised and balanced the team since the 7-1 drubbing four years ago, that blue kit – woof. Yet most people I’ve seen are rooting for a Belgium win.Non-World Cup gubbins: Remarkably, Payet could be on his way back to West Ham, although it is likely that Marseille would ask for more than the £25m they paid in January 2017.Sign up to the Recap, here.

He’s that good. Don’t @ me. There’s been a lot of talk about Kylian Mbappé …… and rightly so, after his utterly ridiculous performance against Argentina. But there is simply no way that Uruguay will play with as much defensive reckless abandon as their South American neighbours. While Mbappé was brilliant against Argentina, they played right into The Frenchman’s hands, leaving space in behind which he brilliantly exploited with his lightning pace. Godín and co simply won’t allow that to happen today, Uruguay will sit deep, be nice and compact and France will likely have to unpick the lock. In that regard, Griezmann is much more likely to be a bigger influence for France today. Godín v Griezmann is perhaps the key clash then, the two Atlético team-mates going head-to-head. Godín, in case you didn’t know, is godfather to Griezmann’s daughter, the two are best friends. Again, if you’re catching up, this is the drink Godín is talking about:Another member of that City team, Fabian Delph, is back with the England squad after flying home for the birth of his daughter, who arrived the morning after the win over Colombia.

Ha ha.It’s getting to the stage now that if I open a video on WhatsApp or click on a YouTube link that is NOT related to ‘It’s coming home’, I’m genuinely shocked. Rip those two stars off immediately. Marcus’s piece also features the 1994 Swedish equivalent of ‘It’s coming home’. The amount of hair on show in the video is frankly staggering. Behind me in  Towers, Marcus Christenson has started animately talking very quickly (I assume) in Swedish to somebody on the phone. I have so far only managed to catch the words ‘football’ and ‘Three Lions’ and ‘It’s coming home’ so I think it must be work related. He wrote this very nice piece yesterday (in English) on Thomas Brolin, what it means to grow up in Sweden, enjoy their third-placed finish at the World Cup in 1994 and then move to England in time for the madness of Euro 96.Thanks Jonathan, and yep it most certainly is. But before we get too excited about Saturday, let’s deal with Friday specifically the early kick-off between France and Uruguay. Luckily Paul Doyle has done this handy guide on the history of the fixture …Anyway, as I wistfully consider the ageing process and rewatch the entirety of The Day Today from start to finish I’ll hand you over to Michael Butler. I’m pretty sure that in his capable hands it’s definitely coming home.I don’t mean to be one of those “you know you’re getting old when” bores, but it pains me to think Alan popped up in World Cup, erm, world, as far back as USA 94. Ruddy hell.David Flynn has nudged me in time to comment: “Where the multiverse theory really falls down is in opening up the possibility that somewhere there’s a universe where an England manager realised Gerrard and Lampard couldn’t play together and dropped one of them. Obviously that could never happen. Theory disproved.” So that made me Google “Stephen Hawking” along with “Gerrard” and “Lampard” in the hope one of the great theoretical physicists may have been encouraged to address this very conundrum, and you know what, he sort of did.It’s nearly time for me to sign off, before I do, try this fun little quiz.A fair point, and worth adding that Neymar has been kicked from pillar to post for nearly a decade, and has suffered his share of injuries during that time as well. Kimberley Thonger is convinced football is coming home. “Football may well be coming home, but not to England, rather to Uruguay, World Cup winners in 1930 and 1950. They’ve looked consistently hard to beat, and Suarez is perfectly capable of exploding into life and delivering killer punches.”Phil Porter got me thinking. “A recent study shows the correlation between the amount of chocolate a nation eats and the number of Nobel prize winners it produces. Perhaps someone can do a study on piesworld cups?”Considering the tiny sample size (20 World Cup finals) this kind of study is extremely open to distortion. For example, you could indicate a decent correlation between the consumption of caipirinhas or maté and winning World Cups, such has been the dominance of three South American countries.It’s not pies mind you.The possibilities of a multiverse (see preamble) are being considered below the line. “If we’re really to believe the multiverse theory,” begins Akardyagain, “then every possibly outcome has happened in one dimension... so in that sense England have already won the World Cup. Which means I’m off to down a pint of vodka and run around Chester city centre naked but draped in an England fan crying and screaming.”We could be in for a long and traumatic summer.In case you missed it, Bjorn Kuipers has been announced as referee for England’s quarterfinal with Sweden. Kuipers reffed this year’s Europa League final and the 2014 Champions League final.

I made a joke of it. But the joke carried on for too longI was the class jester at school in the 70s and 80s, because I wanted to be liked. The truth was that I was struggling.I now know that I had a trio of conditions: dyslexia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and Irlen Syndrome, a neurological condition that makes it hard to process visual information. Words swim on the page for me it’s difficult to see them, let alone read them. When I started school 40 years ago, no one picked this up. I just thought it was normal to see words swirling in 3D. I couldn’t understand why I couldn’t read or write like my friends, so I made a joke of it. But the joke carried on for too long.At primary school, I created a persona: Josh. Johnny was the funny, good-looking guy whom everyone loved Josh was the boy inside who wanted to learn, but couldn’t. When I started secondary school, a teacher made me stand on a chair and read. She wanted to show me I was stupid. It was so humiliating that I would shake, and I developed a bad stutter.I continued to fall through the net, emotionally and educationally. Johnny the joker was doing fine – he wasn’t clever, but had lots of mates. Introvert Josh struggled. The only thing I loved was practical biology. I wanted to be a neurologist, but everyone laughed at that.I didn’t talk to any teachers or family about this. I was clever at hiding it. When I had to write anything down, I guessed, forming what I hoped were the right words. I’d copy my friend’s work he knew something was wrong, so let me. I cheated or guessed in tests. I became good at learning by heart.I left school with an O-level in home economics. My big brother Ian, my idol, had joined the military, so I did, too. It was brilliant – practical and physical. I was proud of myself. I was a great soldier – I got my green beret – but I couldn’t write a report.I also had to pretend I wasn’t gay ( it was illegal to be openly gay when I joined) so I had two big secrets for more than 12 years. I came out in my late 20s, but still couldn’t bring myself to tell anyone about the reading and writing.In 1994, I trained to be a medic in the military. Most of the work was in the field and I relied on my team for any written work. I became quite senior, working in war zones. But things unravelled when I did a course in pre-hospital emergency care. I had passed all my practical exams, preparing for them by learning by heart and intently watching people who were good at their job. The problem was that I’d failed the written exam. The examining doctor wanted an explanation. I was embarrassed, but told him I had dyslexia and that I couldn’t read. He urged me to get back into education. I was 34.I applied to do a degree, biological medicine and health sciences, at the Open University. They set me up with an educational psychologist, who told me that my peer group outranked me by 15 years. Then I was diagnosed with Irlen Syndrome and finally everything made sense.It was back to basics on the course. I knew the alphabet and some words, but my vocabulary was small. Using my Disabled Students’ Allowance, I paid for a tutor, who worked with me every week, teaching me to understand words through pictures. It was a bit childish, but it worked. I had a laptop with read-and-write and speak-and-spell programs. Reading material was printed on green paper to help with the Irlen Syndrome – the colour helps my brain correct the distortion. The tutor would look over my OU work, advising me on grammar and spelling mistakes.It took nine years to get that degree – something I had never dreamed of. Now, aged 47, I’m an ambassador for the OU this year I won an award in recognition of the way I’ve embraced education later in life. I now teach pre-hospital emergency care to doctors, nurses, medics and paramedics. I also teach children and adults with learning difficulties, because I want to give others the chances I had. I still struggle to read a menu if I’m not wearing my tinted glasses, but luckily my fiance, Alexandro, is usually on hand to help. I look back and wonder how many other people have struggled with education and where they are now. I’m proof that no one should be discounted, ever. • As told to Camilla Palmer.

Russia 2018 is already well under way: another impossibly exciting, complex, wild-looking Fifa World Cup. And in its shadow, here we are too.Welcome to another mob-handed, obsessively planned, lovingly curated effort to bring you the  and Observer’s World Cup coverage in every conceivable form, to your every conceivable screen. This is the best bit of covering sport. I’ve been going to tournaments for the  since 2008, and looking back I’m still amazed at the sheer amount of hard work and the sheer volume of content produced around these occasions. From minute-by-minute commentary sent directly to you from the vast pulsing brain of some insomniac footballing obsessive powered only by nicotine, chocolate and a haystack of empty energy drink cans. To on-the-scene reports and news from a band of reporters who write and travel and file and follow stories every day, returning to their families five weeks later hunched, unrecognisable figures unable to communicate on any subject beyond wifi quality, mixed zone ticket allocations and how to get to Salvador protea at 3am with a fair-to-decent chance of not being abducted. At the end of which comes the daily web presence and the pristine design and set of the paper itself. All of this arrives with you updated to the second, cobbled together from the corners of some sock-stinking press room, polished by endlessly patient whip-smart subs and made to look lovely by some sleep-deprived awkward genius of a layout designer. It’s no secret our industry is looking to find ways of continuing to do all this. The old way of selling bits of paper doesn’t seem to work. Advertising is a capricious business. Asking our readers to become subscribers, or to contribute to pay for something they value is, in our opinion, the best way forward. So if you like this stuff and think it’s worth helping it to continue, then why not make an additional contribution to the . It only takes a minute and can be as little as £1 if you’re particularly tight or shameless. Yes, sport can be seen as a glorious irrelevance, but it also says something about who we are. And hopefully our coverage makes you sound slightly less unintelligent than you are during a discussion of the reactive gegenpress in the local Wetherspoons. Perhaps it lights up your enjoyment via the frankly brilliant reporting of our football hacks, led of course (damn him) by annual award hoover Danny Taylor, and backed up by the likes of Dominic Fifield, Martha Kelner, Dave Hytner, Stuart James and, with the long range heavy artillery, the mind bogglingly good Marina Hyde. Perhaps you even enjoy reading the World Cup Fiver, following the multi award winning* daily World Cup blog, and listening to Max, Barry and star guests speak their brains over four increasingly hysterical weeks of World Cup Football Daily. Not that there’s anything wrong with that. Either way we will always be here on these occasions. But this is only possible because of your support and because you think what we produce is worth having and – yes – giving something back for in return. Enjoy the football.

But George Ezra’s spin on the classic disguise is more practical – a floppy-brimmed, khaki sunhat from an outdoor-supplies company paired with camouflage-rimmed sunglasses he got at a petrol station – but stylish it is not. In fact, along with his white Nasa T-shirt, the combination makes him look like the Twitter avatar of a man who retweets Piers Morgan. “People look at me,” he admits as we sit in a cafe near his home in west London, “but just because I look awful.”It is 10.30am and today Ezra, 25, is on a whistle-stop radio tour taking in Magic, Absolute, and Radio 1 and 2. The disguise will get a good airing as we will be travelling on foot and by public transport. “If you don’t mind,” Ezra suggests, “I think I’m going to get the bus today.”Ordinarily, a multi-platinum-selling artist travelling with a journalist in this manner would be doing it to prove how humble they are, despite all the No 1 albums (Ezra has two, including Staying at Tamara’s, 2018’s biggest-selling new album) and singles (his latest, Shotgun is such a dead cert for the next day’s top spot that he has already organised a victory barbecue for his friends back in Hertfordshire). But in this instance, like the chin- strap dangling from Ezra’s sunhat, it just seems practicality is key.On the top deck of the No 94, Ezra reflects on Shotgun’s soon-to-be-confirmed rise to No 1. Its predecessor, January’s ebullient Paradise, was a huge hit, but last year his career came close to unravelling. Last June, following the release of 2014’s third-best-selling album, Wanted on Voyage, Ezra was ready to stage his return and released his comeback single Don’t Matter Now. It is hard in the streaming era to define what exactly constitutes a hit, but it is also hard to put a positive spin on two weeks in the Top 70, the high point of Don’t Matter Now’s chart run.This was a reversal of what had happened with Ezra’s first single Budapest, which propelled him to stardom despite originally being issued as a free download: Don’t Matter Now had bombed. “It got a lot of media support,” Ezra says. “People just didn’t want it.”There was a crisis meeting – “and only because I insisted on it” – at Ezra’s label, Columbia. “Can we all just be completely honest about what’s going on?” he asked the room. It was suggested that the album, pencilled in at the end of 2017, be pushed back to 2018. “I said: ‘Won’t we lose momentum?’ Someone stood up and went: ‘There is no fucking momentum.’” The album was pushed back.This episode forced Ezra to reassess his previously laissez-faire approach to success: he didn’t even know the BBC Sound of … poll existed until he was longlisted in 2013, and in one interview he said he didn’t mind whether his career lasted two years or 12.“I don’t want to sound like the inspirational quote on the wall of a secondary school staff room, but Don’t Matter Now failing was the best thing that could have happened to me. I realised how much I must have been taking it all for granted.”He had seen what failure looked like and, to be frank, he wasn’t keen. He even started thinking about alternative employment. “It’s one thing having one single that doesn’t work, but having two in a row is a sign of the end,” he adds. “When we were releasing Paradise, I said, out loud: ‘I’m going to give this everything I’ve got.’”Paradise was such a tightly written, cleverly structured pop song that it seemed like the sort of multi-songwriter banger that major-label artists pull out of a hat when they’re in a tight corner in fact, it was the first single Ezra had written by himself (most of his songs are co-written with Athlete’s Joel Pott). So it was doubly vindicating when it became his highest-charting single to date, peaking at No 2.We arrive at Bauer Radio HQ, home of Absolute and Magic, where Ezra performs a short set for competition winners. Afterwards, he mentions that sometimes he’ll give audiences what he refers to as “an evening with George Ezra”, where he goes into full raconteur mode. Sometimes it works, he says, and sometimes it doesn’t either way, he stands apart from acts you could mention in the same breath such as fellow British and Irish Modern Music Institute graduates Tom Odell and James Bay – because his chat is as engaging as his tunes.This willingness to show personality has extended to things such as a merchandise-plugging promo clip so strange that it landed Ezra a spot on Vic \u0026amp Bob’s Big Night Out. Then there’s his podcast, in which he talks to artists including Ed Sheeran and Elton John.“If you’ve already taken the piss out of yourself, nobody can do it for you,” Ezra reasons. “But it’s not something you can force, or re-create to order. The other day, I had someone from the label on the phone saying: ‘How do you feel about live-tweeting Love Island?’ I was like: ‘Er, I’ve got quite a bit on.’”Not that Ezra is averse to the idea of lightning striking twice. His debut album Wanted on Voyage was based largely on international travels the main narrative of Staying at Tamara’s is about him taking himself off to Barcelona, where his Airbnb turned out to be a den of bohemian creativity. Doesn’t it concern him that he finds it necessary to insert himself into situations in order for inspiration to strike? Does he have to invent situations for his structured-reality pop because he really doesn’t have anything to say?It is more a question of putting himself in places where even mundane ideas seem interesting, Ezra counters. But it seems possible that his need for prompts and the take-it-or-leave-it approach to ambition has roots in his comfortable and secure, semi-rural Hertfordshire upbringing. He never felt the need to escape. Or as he puts it: “I never had big dreams as a kid. I was so happy that I didn’t need them.”With Ezra back in disguise, we head through Soho to the BBC, and talk more about his childhood. The main drama seems to be the teenage growth spurt that prompted him to slouch (“All I wanted to do was not stand out”) which still affects his posture today. He doesn’t think he was negatively affected by the orce of his parents, both teachers, when he was 14: “For the first time, I saw them as humans with their own shit going on – it did me the world of good.” No teenage delinquency? “Well,” he says. “As a child, I used to run through fields of wheat …” So is there anything more to George Ezra than meets the eye? “I’m trying to figure that out myself,” he admits. “I’m not a boy and I’m not a man.”Ezra says he has questioned all this ever since entering an industry that fetishises the tortured genius. “This used to play on my mind when I was first coming out with music: can I just own the fact that I had a wicked upbringing? I wonder if the confusion a lot of people have in their teens is what I’m experiencing now. I’m trying to figure out who I am and I’m trying to work out what I stand for. It’s exhausting.”Between the ages of 21 and 23, Ezra experienced what he describes as “an acute feeling of worthlessness”. It didn’t occur to him during his first album campaign – though he has considered it plenty since – that during that entire period he had been hiding in dressing rooms and backstage areas, reluctant to face his own fans. “I was thinking: ‘I can stay in my little safe place in the dressing room, therefore I don’t have to confront anything, therefore it hasn’t happened’.” Then came the almighty political and cultural debacle that was 2016. “It felt like anything that could have gone wrong did go wrong – it felt like the wrong world to be in if you’re sensitive. Nobody in my life, friends or family or media outlets, had any answers.”Ezra also knew he had to write his second album, but that wasn’t really happening. He slid into habitual thought patterns that he describes as feeling “like a snake eating itself”. The structureless life of a pop star between albums was not helpful. “I’d set the alarm, wake up, go downstairs to write, nothing would come, then I’d just do pointless shit. I’d clean the house. Every single day. I’d make up things to do. Lists of things that didn’t need to exist.”Staying at Tamara’s in Barcelona turned out to facilitate the creative and mental readjustment he had been seeking, and the thought patterns that plagued him began to dissipate. He is wary of generating “My-anxiety-hell” headlines, partly because there have been a handful in the last few months, and he was surprised (“I was either ignorant or naive”) by how the media jumped on the way he discussed mental health. And partly because he knows that his experiences weren’t severe, in the grand scheme of things, and that his solution was straightforward. “But even when people experience less, it’s still something,” he reasons. So when mental health charity Mind asked him if he would consider being an ambassador, he said yes.After a brief on-air chat with Radio 1’s Greg James, during which Shotgun is turned into an ostensibly amusing football anthem, Ezra has his picture taken for the Official Charts Company’s website, suggesting his No 1 is almost certainly in the bag. When we speak again a few days later, Shotgun is at the top of the charts. Ezra calls as he is walking to the chemist for some hayfever pills. Yes, he confirms, he is wearing his awful hat and shades. After we parted ways at the BBC, he watched the England match on a train back to Hertford the night ended with an unexpected session in a basement, playing Dylan covers with his dad and his mates until 1am.As for Friday night’s celebratory barbecue – well, that was a shambles. “The look-at-me-I’m-No-1 angle didn’t go to plan,” he admits. “A friend raised his glass and said, ‘Congratulations to George for being No 1,’ but then another one went, ‘Hang on, haven’t you been No 1 before?’ And I was like, ‘No, that was my album.’ They went: ‘Isn’t that better than a single? That’s 12 songs, not one.’ And I said: ‘Well, kind of, but a single is harder,’ and then the moment had gone and I had to change the subject.”They ended up playing rounders, then lit a sky lantern – but Ezra vetoed its release: the hot weather had left the countryside dry and he didn’t want to be responsible for a fire. The food went down well, though. He’d even prepared a salad. And at the precise moment when he knew he was definitely No 1, he recalls a brief moment of clarity. “It only lasted for a second, then vanished, but everything made sense,” he says.“It felt surreal. And it felt funny. You have to chuckle, don’t you?”George Ezra’s UK tour starts in November"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9d652ccfc61dc2ff623b7cbda096ec4f6f29f54/13_2_1641_985/master/1641.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ac7aae9980b4745a40932bb753a99751","title":"solange collaboration with ikea","story":"The interior design brand has enlisted the soul star to work on a new line. What new spin will she put on the BILLY bookcase? Her big sister Beyoncé might have missed a trick in not teaming up with R Whites to launch 2016’s Lemonade album – just imagine the most fabulous secret lemonade drinker adverts that could have been! – but Solange is evidently a far more savvy businesswoman, with news of her Ikea collaboration recently sweeping the interior designR\u0026ampB crossover world. Yes, Solange’s amorphous Saint Heron “cultural hub” is teaming up with global meatball’n’sofa hub to, we can only hope, make reasonably priced bits of furniture that will make our one-bed flat in Tottenham resemble Solange’s outrageously tasteful New Orleans pad.This isn’t the first time Ikea have teamed up with musicians, but they’re usually on the more under-the-radar side of things. There was electro-lad-ska duo Man Like Me’s performing Jona Lewie’s You’ll Always Find Me in the Kitchen at Parties for the brand back in 2010 and, earlier this year, indie types Teleman playing their single Repeater against a backdrop of rotating rugs and tiny living-room teepees (for children? dogs? misbehaving partners?) through gritted teeth and the assurance that yes, this will fund the third album. This is the first time, however, that Ikea will actually be churning out products – rather than just aggressively colourful promotional videos – with a musician. And an actually famous musician at that. Gosh. The products, too, look set to push the boundaries of Ikea’s usual discreetly functional wares. So step aside lowly CHOSIGT cheese grater and BILLY bookcases with your tired, old, singular uses and say hello to a dazzling new range that will be “exploring architectural and interior design objects with multifunctional use”.We can only imagine the wondrous objects that Solange and Ikea will conjure up over their many meetings in the glamorous surroundings of the Ikea cafe, sipping lingonberry juice and nibbling Daim bars as the creative sparks fly. Our hopes for the range include:1) A huge squidgy pink jacket that is also a cosy daybed for one, in tribute to the Michelin woman candy floss-styled outfit by designer Nadine Goepfert that Solange rocks in the opening few seconds of the Cranes in the Sky video.2) Some nice plants from the garden-centre bit of the shop that, instead of slowly dying in a dark corner of the living room, you can sometimes wear as a bra (again, pls see Cranes in the Sky video for reference).3) Naturally, a boxing ring that also doubles up as an elevator – perfect for giving philandering brothers-in-law a light thrashing. The ads for all of these must-have home improvements should be, much like the video Solange directed for SZA’s The Weekend, be shot from bloody miles away.

Janelle Monáe’s Make Me Feel, meanwhile, is a bisexual update of Prince’s Kiss, with a central refrain – “That’s just the way you make me feel  So real, so good, so fuckin’ real” – paying homage to Sylvester’s earlier gay anthem. And snarling the line “You don’t have to be straight with me  I know what’s under your mask”, Years \u0026amp Years’ Sanctify is based on the tantalising push-pull of sex with a professed straight man. Using interviews to co-sign fans’ interpretations of the lyrics, all three acts have cemented these songs’ status as gay anthems.Occupying more experimental territory, the cult queer artist Ssion’s album O goes darker. A spoken-word skit from Róisín Murphy – “And let’s just kill some time at the club  While we wait for the world to end” – may be a recognition of Trump-era politics. It leads into 1980-99, a Robyn-style alt-pop song in which Sky Ferreira moans: “Do you love me like I’m already dead?” It is reminiscent of gay icon Lana Del Rey’s morbid attitude, and post-Aids crisis gay anthems past that spoke about death: Janet Jackson’s Together Again, TLC’s Waterfalls, Pet Shop Boys’ Being Boring, George Michael’s Jesus to a Child. Or could it just be the more playful use of the word death: when something is so good it makes you just “die”? Sivan certainly deploys this in his song My My My!, exclaiming “I die every night with you!” In an era in which HIV doesn’t have to be a death sentence, death can mean something new to the LGBTQ+ community.But not always. No Tears Left to Cry, Ariana Grande’s first release since 2017, repeats “I’m lovin’, I’m livin’, I’m pickin’ it up”, as if narrating her return to bubblegum pop about overcoming emotional obstacles. This constant principle of her work, along with her vocal support for her gay brother Frankie, had established her as a gay favourite long before the Manchester Arena bombing. Yet with tragedy a relatable theme for LGBTQ+ people – who were among the hundreds affected in May 2017 – and Grande performing Judy Garland’s Somewhere Over the Rainbow at the subsequent One Love charity concert, she acquired gay icon status.Ssion’s Heaven Is My Thing Again, recalling two gay icons in Madonna and Cyndi Lauper, suggests good gays can go to heaven – “Just take, take, take me away  I wanna go to heaven” (a line first delivered on their 2004 breakthrough Heaven) – while Years \u0026amp Years’ Sanctify ascribes gay sex a holiness: “Sanctify the love that you crave  Oh and I won’t, and I won’t, and I won’t be ashamed.” Back on Earth, Kesha’s similarly religious Praying strikes a more sombre tone, ticking Queer’s “hard-won self-esteem” and “torch song for the world-weary” boxes, a defiant riposte to the producer Dr Luke, who she alleged physically, verbally and sexually abused her (he denies all the allegations). Though it was released in 2017, Praying continues to tell a story in 2018, as Dr Luke’s new protege Kim Petras is heralded by the international gay press as “your new favourite popstar”, and supports Sivan on tour. Seemingly Petras’s trans identity – which she prefers not to mention, despite her trans fanbase – is enough of a story of hard-won self-esteem to forgive her involvement with the producer.So with more permissiveness than ever around LGBTQ+ performers, are gay and straight pop cultures, like our clubbing scenes, blending into one? Rita Ora, who came out as bisexual in interviews promoting Girls, a peppy collaboration with Bebe Rexha, Charli XCX and Cardi B, was criticised by queer artists including Hayley Kiyoko and Kehlani for imbuing a song about sapphic intentions with the line “and yeah last night, well we got with a dude”. Was Ora straight-washing lesbian experience, or simply reflecting her experience of bisexuality? A more nuanced interpretation of this could come, the argument goes, from Monáe’s album Dirty Computer or Christine and the Queens’ Girlfriend, which looks at what happens when a woman adopts masculine bravado and sexual assertiveness: “I muscled in for I wanted to hold him.”But who said gay anthems can’t still be daft, misleading fun? LGBTQ+ people withstand enough pain in their everyday lives. And if there is still space for the gloriously silly and catchy YMCA, or MNEK’s current gay anthem Tongue, a song about being dizzily in love containing the ludicrous middle eight “Tippy two, tippy tea, tippy ta-ta-tongue!”, then perhaps there should be space for Rita Ora yelling “sometimes I just wanna kiss girls” too.

As my colleague Philip Oltermann reports, some of them have come up with a simple solution to the Irish border problem - a referendum on whether or not Northern Ireland should remain in the EU.That wouldn’t go down well with Arlene Foster ...Here are some more pictures from Chequers.This was the scene as a queue of ministerial cars lined up this morning.This is the room where the cabinet has been meeting.Barnier says in current circumstances it is becoming even more important to strengthen the single market. It is the foundation of EU unity, he says.And that’s it. The speech is over, but the RTE live feed has cut away.UPDATE: This is from RTE’s Colm O’Mongain.Barnier says the UK’s proposals will facilitate both the UK’s internal debate, and negotiations with the UK.He says he wants to find a solution with the UK, not against the UK.He says the single market is not just a supermarket. It is a common area of social and economic life. It brings a wide choice of products and services, lower prices and better quality, but it also guarantees standards, attracts foreign investment and facilitates research, he says.He says the single market should be adapted so it becomes more inclusive.Barnier says the single market is the EU’s main economic public good.The EU needs to find a solution to Brexit that respects the principles of the single market, he says, but also compatible with the UK’s red lines.But the EU is ready to adapt its offer should the UK’s red lines change, he says.Barnier says the European arrest warrant is linked to the free movement of people. And it is overseen by the European court of justice.He says the EU wants to preserve the benefits of the EAW after Brexit, but there will have to be another mechanism for UK participation.Barnier says there is still “a long way to go” in the Brexit talks, and there is not much time.Turning to Ireland, he says the EU needs “more clarity” and “certainty in the long run”.The EU needs a “cast-iron guarantee” to avoid a hard border, he says.The so-called backstop would apply until another solution is found, ensuring the same “fluidity” at the Irish border. The British government has agreed to this, he says. And it says the issues raised by the EU must be addressed.So now is the time to address them, he says.First, the border must be invisible. That is necessary to protect one of the achievements of the peace process.Second, goods must be able to cross the border without being stopped by customs.Third, farmers must be able to move their goods and livestock across the border.And, fourth, the single electricity market should be maintained.Barnier says, if the status quo is to be maintained for goods, the current limited set of rules should apply. He says the EU’s backstop proposal would avoid the need for regulatory checks on goods crossing the border. And it is important to avoid the need for customs checks, he says.Barnier says it is important to “de-dramatise” the EU’s backstop plans.Michel Barnier runs through a list of problems all countries in the EU have to face.No European country can win these battles alone. That is why he has been a convinced European for so long, he says.He says the EU’s future partnership with the UK needs to cover not just trade but security, foreign policy and defence.First, though, there is need for an agreement on an orderly withdrawal, he says.He says the EU and the UK have agreed on a number of separation issues.It is sometimes easy to forget what has already been agreed. For example, they have agreed that 4.5m citizens (EU nationals in the UK, and Britons living on the continent) can carry on living their lives as normal, he says.This is from the ’s Peter Foster.Michel Barnier is about to start his speech.He is being introduced by the Irish ambassador to the EU.Michel Barnier, the EU’s chief Brexit negotiator, is about to give a speech at the Institute of International and European Affairs in Brussels.I’m back from the Number 10 lobby briefing. On the Chequers meeting, the spokeswoman had very little to say at all, although we did learn that Sir Mark Sedwill, who is currently acting cabinet secretary, won’t be there all day because he is chairing a Cobra meeting in London this afternoon on the novichok poisoning. It was not clear who will stand in when he is away.The cabinet secretary is the person who takes the minutes when the cabinet is meeting. Sedwill, whose day job is national security adviser, is acting cabinet secretary because Sir Jeremy Heywood is ill.Mike Russell, the Scottish government’s cabinet secretary for government business and constitutional relations (he was Brexit minister until last week’s reshuffle), has said that “people do require a say” on the final Brexit deal. The SNP has been broadly sympathetic to the notion of a second referendum, albeit with some reservations, but this is one of the most explicit endorsements of a second referendum we’ve had from a senior SNP figure. Russell told the BBC’s Good Morning Scotland:But I think people do require a say, and we certainly require a say on the final outcome. This is not a second vote, this is a say on the final outcome.I’m off to the Number 10 lobby briefing. I will post again after 11.30am.According to the ’s Anna Mikhailova, the Number 10 spin doctor bragging about the taxi service available for any minister who wants to resign (see 10.07am) did not realise the phone number in question doesn’t work."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/45e4a8e2eaec8265de1ebd6f8e8efb40e617139c/6_642_2561_1536/master/2561.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eb609b9b813211b78c026d871e9e502","title":"team sky tour de france rival education first chris froome jonathan vaughters","story":"Jonathan Vaughters, the manager of the Education First team of last year’s Tour de France runner-up, Rigoberto Urán, has voiced his concerns at the threats being directed towards Chris Froome.Armed police are patrolling team hotels and have been a presence at the Team Sky and Education First hotels in the past 48 hours. Extra security was introduced at the Tour following terrorist attacks in France, but Team Sky also called in security experts from BSkyB to advise on extra measures. “It is really concerning,” Vaughters said of his anxieties over crowd control. “The amount of vitriol and anger directed at Sky is pretty impressive. The barriers need to go further down the mountain climbs, but you can’t barrier 200 kilometres of open road.”Vaughters, a former teammate of Lance Armstrong, was a pivotal witness in the Usada investigation that exposed Armstrong’s systemic doping programme. Yet he is among the growing numbers within cycling who have attacked the lack of confidentiality in the Froome matter.“In this case, it was public, which is really unfortunate and whoever leaked it — because somebody inside the UCI leaked it — it’s just nasty, vindictive behaviour to do that,” he said. “It doesn’t actually allow the system to work in the way that it should in a case involving a restricted substance, as opposed to a banned substance.”Although under normal circumstances the athlete in such a case would be expected to undergo a controlled pharmacokinetic study, this was not insisted on by Wada in Froome’s case.But despite an onslaught of criticism of Wada’s procedures, Vaughters remains supportive of the anti-doping body. “I don’t think Wada is broken. The people involved in anti-doping are incredibly passionate about fairness to athletes.“I’ve been saying for years that cycling should be throwing more money into anti-doping. I think it’s €140,000 that each team contributes to the biological passport, but that’s like a minuscule amount of Team Sky’s budget. Each team should be spending more like five per cent of its total budget on anti-doping.”Vaughters insisted cycling has cleaned up its act, despite many believing that little has changed since the Festina affair of 1998.“That’s just not reality,” he said. “I can say that all day long, but nobody’s going to believe it. It’s not true and I think anyone inside the sport with any genuine knowledge is going to say that’s not true. Unfortunately many people look at us all sceptically.But Vaughters joined those who now think that all relevant details to the case should be made public, despite both Team Sky and Wada declining to do so. “It shouldn’t have been leaked in the first place, but it was, so live with it and now release all the information. Both sides should come to an agreement and release all the pertinent information.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/74ecb6f109ea15218b6bcbe9469f023f72fb556f/0_201_6192_3715/master/6192.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5754ad90abf57c4a59040c4d64d41823","title":"cleveland lebron james los angeles lakers nba","story":"The future hall-of-famer brought a long-awaited title to north-east Ohio but the city doesn’t need a superstar athlete in order to thriveOn Tuesday morning, workers in Cleveland began pulling down the gigantic LeBron James photograph that had sprawled across 10 stories of a building downtown. The messianic mural, with James’s arms thrown wide in the pose of Cleveland’s savior, had become – for many Americans – the image that came to mind when they thought of the city, if they thought about it at all. With James leaving the Cleveland Cavaliers for the Los Angeles Lakers, the banner’s removal seemed to signify the end of an era.But before the picture could be fully dismantled, thunder rumbled and lightning cut a zig-zag pattern in the sky. Rain poured down. The workers scampered to safety. And for a time on Tuesday, Cleveland was left with a half-complete James. Suddenly this became a new symbol for Cleveland: a place that can’t let go of the hometown hero who made a winner out of a city known for losing. The problem with iconic photographs is they never tell the full story. They get twisted into whatever we want them to become. Tuesday wasn’t the first time the banner of James had come down. The photo had rested there before, during James’s first run with the Cavs, only to be yanked down when he abandoned Cleveland for the Miami Heat in 2010. And while the picture might have appeared to the world as an organic celebration of James’s gift to his homeland, it was actually a 100-foot-tall advertisement for Nike, the manufacturer of his lucrative shoe line – a perpetual sales pitch for a very rich basketball player by a very rich sneaker company.One man cannot save a city, not even one who stands 6ft 8in and dunks so hard that the backboard shivers like an earthquake in his wake. The idea that James came home in 2014 to release Cleveland from decades of despair is a wonderful story, one that satisfied many sportswriters, present company included. It was catnip for Nike’s marketers. And it served James well as he grew from a young, naive and entitled superstar into a powerful voice on racism and oppression. The truth is that Cleveland existed for more than 200 years before James returned from Miami and it will exist long after the details of his departure to Los Angeles are forgotten. He played some great basketball. He won a championship in 2016. The city’s five-decade-long sports drought was washed away. There was a parade. People were happy. Then life in Cleveland went on. James understands this better than most. He sat in a makeshift press conference room beneath the arena’s stands on the night the Cavs lost this year’s finals and talked about the championship he had vowed to bring Cleveland when he came back in 2014. “Unfinished business,” he called it. With that business now concluded he hinted that he had been absolved of great responsibility. He wasn’t filling potholes or cutting classroom crowding. There was nothing more he could do for the town. He is just a basketball player. A very good basketball player, but a basketball player nonetheless. As Ken Gordon, a longtime Cleveland sports fan told me in 2015, when the Cavs lost the first of their four finals series with Golden State: “Winning a championship isn’t what defines my life anymore.” Gordon was 63 at the time. His implication was that James and the Cavs had brought joy, but his days were filled with more important things than sports. Cleveland without James will be just fine. The Cavs won’t be able to replace what he brought every night. But they have to believe in the potential of top draft pick Collin Sexton and the franchise’s ability to regenerate itself around players like Kevin Love, Tristan Thompson and JR Smith. The city’s baseball team leads the American League Central by 11.5 games. The Browns have a new quarterback and new hope, even if new Browns quarterbacks usually bring more heartache than hope. Stores and restaurants are opening. Conventions come to town. The city hums with life that has nothing to do with whether the world’s best basketball player is wearing the Cavs uniform.Maybe it is best that James’s picture has come down. Something about that banner always seemed contrived, a message that Cleveland needed a basketball player to believe it was something important. In the end, that story was wrong. James needed to come home and win a title for Cleveland more than Cleveland needed James to come back and win a title for the city. Now life can go on. James can head off to the Lakers and Cleveland can go back to being Cleveland once more.

Temperatures are due to peak at 28C on both days and Andrew Cooper, the clerk of the course, says he has never known such a prolonged dry and hot spell since he started doing the job in 1990.“We had basically no rainfall in June,” he told me. “We’ve had months in the past when we might only have had 6mm or something like that. The last meaningful rain we saw was during Derby week.”Cooper and his team have been putting down 35mm of water every week just to keep the ground from getting any faster, which is an expensive business. He reports the going as good to firm, good in places on the sprint course and adds that he has been putting plenty of water on the tight bend out of the back straight to ensure runners can get some purchase.After the Eclipse crowds have left on Saturday, Cooper would really like to see some rain turning up in the forecast. “Crikey, you’d take anything,” he said. “Everything will benefit from it. We could do with a double-figure amount of rain at least.” But there is no immediate sign of same.Instinctively as a punter, I find myself looking for fast-ground horses with a turn of foot. You’d imagine that would be the only way to go after a month of such weather. But this morning on my Twitter timeline there’s a hard-working analyst suggesting the race-times at Newmarket last weekend equated to good to soft going, so it’s always worth having a look at the early races and the times they’re run in before taking a view.It so happens that my nap on Friday is still waiting for his first win on turf, having scored three times out of four on the all-weather. But I think fast turf is fine for Melting Dew (4.05), a progressive Sir Michael Stoute four-year-old who’s a 7-2 shot for the 10-furlong handicap.He was game at Chelmsford last time, his second run of the year, and it looks like the drop back to this trip has been helpful. He’s still on a winning mark if able to show his best form here, with Ryan Moore riding him for the first time this year.Earlier, a drop back in trip might also be good news for Barbill (1.50), a speedy Mick Channon juvenile who faded in the final furlong of the Coventry when last seen. He won easily despite a slow start over five furlongs at Bath on his debut and I hope to see some of that raw speed here. He’s overlooked at 8-1 in a small field.David Pipe has had a couple of recent winners and I’ll take a chance on his It’s Obvious (4.30) at Newton Abbot. He was fancied for a similar race there last month but fared poorly on his first run back from wind surgery. At 12-1, I’ll take a chance that he’ll be sharper this time, though it could be that the grey is going to need a slower surface."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6904a5936ad1ecbcf4dc88fad67e9f2010b8be20/353_828_4496_2698/master/4496.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5073a12c900b26765e65e89e0fda92d8","title":"shakespeares rose review theatre midsummer nights dream romeo and juliet","story":"★★☆☆☆★★★☆☆ Shakespeare’s Rose theatre, YorkThis new venture offers spinning fairies in an otherwise flat Midsummer Night’s Dream and espresso-fuelled scraps in a more dynamic Romeo and Juliet Surrounded by a “village” of food and drink outlets, with open-air wagon entertainment that nods to York’s theatrical history, the attempt is clearly to create a festival-like sense of event at the heart of the city. That attempt extends to the stage in Juliet Forster’s production of A Midsummer Night’s Dream, one of four Shakespeare plays rotating in rep over the coming weeks. In the modern-meets-Elizabethan interior of the playhouse – an odd marriage of historical detail and decidedly contemporary scaffolding – Forster adorns the much-loved comedy with a surplus of circus tricks. Fairies dangle from ropes and spin in suspended hoops. In the other-worldly space of the woods, where sprites make mischief with lovers, characters are as likely to enter from the heavens as from the wings. These aerial decorations, while often impressive, drag out the running time and do not quite manage to distract from flat, lacklustre performances. There’s a lot happening on stage at once, but not much going on in the acting itself, with precious little sense of the variation or meaning in Shakespeare’s lines. With a few exceptions – most notably Amanda Ryan, whose take on Hippolyta and Oberon subtly flags some of the play’s misogynist undertones – the cast struggle to find a way in to their roles. The pace picks up in the second half, and the best gags, as so often in Dream, are saved for the Mechanicals. It’s not quite enough, though, to compensate for the failings elsewhere. There’s much greater texture of meaning and unforced dynamism of staging in Lindsay Posner’s Romeo and Juliet. Maintaining Shakespeare’s setting of Verona, Posner shunts the action into the 1930s, with love and hate playing out against the backdrop of Mussolini’s Italy. Aside from the odd visual and aural reference, this context is not stressed, but it adds another, half-submerged layer of violence to the action. In this production, languid, sun-drenched cafe-hopping swiftly escalates into espresso-fuelled scraps between the warring Montagues and Capulets. The earlier stages of the show, establishing both hatred and infatuation, are particularly compelling. Posner lightly but vividly paints the social world of the play in bustling street and party scenes. The two lovers, meanwhile, are convincingly youthful and rash in their devotion. From the start, Alexander Vlahos’s Romeo is boyish and impetuous Alexandra Dowling as Juliet greets love with a wide-eyed, breathless wonder. It’s only as the drama approaches its inevitable conclusion that the energy wilts and the production begins to feel as though it is simply counting out the minutes until the anticipated tragedy. For visitors, the experience as a whole – including Elizabethan garden, waxwork figures and overpriced crisps – is perhaps as important as the inidual shows. The sense of novelty, aided by the sunshine, is certainly appealing. It’s worth asking, though, who this experience is really for. With groundling tickets more than double the price of those at the Globe in London and the luxury of a seat costing between £32.95 and £54.95 – not to mention the expensive goodies being hawked in the village – it’s hardly the most accessible of summer celebrations. Not so much Shakespeare for all as Shakespeare for the privileged few.

To celebrate this, each year the peninsula springs to life with music, colour and dancing, as creators from all over London come together for the Urban Village Fete. Curated by Wayne Hemingway, co-founder of Hemingway Design, the event delivers his vision of recreating the type of free festival that once attracted some of the brightest creative minds to Camden and Kensington markets.“Free festivals were the way we communicated,” he says. “There were loads of young designers who went on to become pretty famous. We want to recreate that in Greenwich: getting young creatives in front of tens of thousands of people at a price they can afford.”The fete is now in its fourth year and stretches through an area that is becoming a hub for design. Hemingway hopes that with 15,000 new homes, plus spaces designated for work and play, a sense of creativity and community will blossom on the peninsula, with creatives sharing the area with families. “The event feels generous, and generosity should be a part of urban life,” he says.Hemingway’s company produces dozens of festivals around the UK each year – from Liverpool’s Fine Tuned event to the National Festival of Making in Blackburn. One challenge facing market traders and craftspeople across these events is that shoppers are carrying less cash than ever. Hemingway Design and payments platform Square partnered to equip cash-only traders with Square Readers so they could take cards, many of them for the first time. Here, we meet some of the dozens of makers and creators who brought the Greenwich fete to life. Emily Griffin lives and breathes east London’s creative scene. A Hackney local for 20 years, during the past three she’s built her homewares and accessories business Mahala from the ground up. But while she makes and designs most of what can be found inside her store, the brand is also a family affair. “My husband joined Mahala a year ago and designs the clothes, which we have made in Bow,” says Griffin. “His aunt has a small orchard, so she makes all the lovely oils for us.” Mahala’s clothes and accessories are made to endure, reflecting the family’s thrifty past. Griffin uses military canvas and saddlery to create her bags, and her designs are centred around slow fashion. “I want people to have them for a really long time. I always repair stuff – I’d rather repair than replace,” she says.Building relationships with her customers at events such as the Urban Village Fete is key. “It means we’re not relying on footfall on our street, which is really quiet. Plus, we get to meet people from all over London and farther afield,” she says. The concrete planters found at From the Land (formerly Conpot) are far from the rigid grey slabs the material usually brings to mind. Architect Alastair Mitchell and textile designer Kezia Regan began experimenting in their home with planters made from concrete, before expanding to homewares and surfaces. “Each one uses a different stone source from around the country – Shropshire, Lancashire, Derbyshire – so we’re trying to show that concrete can have all these regional dialects,” says Mitchell.As the business grows, he says the aim is to move away from third-party retailers and sell more through his online store and specialist ceramic fairs, and at events like the Urban Village Fete. To do this, and to make the most of footfall, he has started using cashless payment platform Square. “If you only take cash, most people go away and never come back,” he says. “Just the other day we had someone come to our house who wanted to buy a planter. We were able to take a card payment in our living room.”Sarah Harvey, UK lead for Square, says: “None of us want to have to walk away from a unique item on a market stall just because that trader won’t accept cards, and with our partnership we wanted to make it as easy as possible for shoppers to support independent and creative businesses.” Ayse Özden loves creating with paper. She is one of the founders of WeAct, a London-based stationery store and brand agency with its roots in Turkey. “Greeting cards are a very big thing in Europe, whereas in Istanbul they’re not,” she says. Her family made the move to bring their collections to London two years ago. Her stall at the Urban Village Fete was filled with quirky designs from dictionary clippings underlying colourful illustrations designed by her husband to comical faces splashed across greeting cards and notebook covers. “There’s been a really nice response to the face collection,” she says. “Lots of people are laughing and that was our aim – to help people have fun.” Before making bespoke, one-of-a-kind bags to sell exclusively at markets, Anna P was designing 250-piece collections twice a year for high-street stores. Now she works for herself, and has spent three years collecting vintage textiles that she uses to design and make leather and cloth bags by hand. The designer prefers to sell to people direct, and doesn’t have an online store. Because of the nomadic nature of her stall, she makes sure she has a cashless payment system whenever she’s selling at markets. “I use Square and it’s so quick to take payments – if you have a lot of people and they all want to buy at the same time, just tap it on there and it’s done,” she says.  The bright pops of colour coming from the Keeler \u0026amp Sidaway stall captured the Urban Village Fete’s sunny, holiday vibes. Joe Keeler began his print and stationery company two years ago, as a way of combining his loves of illustration, photography and travelling – the latter of which inspires his art, which often features Californian poolsides and graphic beaches.“I’m an avid photographer, so I’ll take loads of photos and come back and draw from them, or sketch scenes while I’m on location and then work it all together from there,” he says.With a studio based in Bermondsey, Keeler sells his prints through his online store, but makes an exception when it comes to the urban village fete. “This one is the best summery festival things to do in London,” he says. “There are lots of people here.” Visitors to Imogen Johnson-Gilbert’s stall could try on her first collection, made at a Fairtrade factory in Bangalore, a new milestone for her business. Previously, Johnson-Gilbert made all of the Gillian June clothes herself, but the business’s popularity has made that tricky. “We’ve grown to a point where I’ve stopped being able to make it all,” she says.  Isabelle Laight really loves hip-hop, and at the Urban Village Fete she found she was in good company. “You can see everyone being really surprised when they walk past. It’s one of those things you don’t see that often,” she says of her illustrated designs of hip-hop and R\u0026ampB greats on the sides of mugs, plates, and stationery. “Kanye is the most popular. I don’t want him to be, but he is,” says Laight. “My favourite at the moment is Tupac – I’m going through a bit of a phase.” Using Square for payments at the fete, Laight says: “It’s really easy, I just keep it in my pocket, and there’s been no need to troubleshoot because I haven’t had any problems.” Sheffield native Alastair Mason knows a thing or two about pork. “It’s always been a family tradition that we have our pork brined or dipped by the butcher,” he says of his favourite snack. Mason started the Salty Loins food truck in 2015 through sheer frustration: he was unable to get a “decent” pork sandwich in London. “After raving to my friends about not being able to find this kind of pork, I decided to take it upon myself to experiment and came up with my own brine recipe.”Since then, the trained graphic designer has been a staple at London markets such as Maltby Street and Borough, as well as on the Bermondsey “beer mile”. Mason’s menu has expanded to incorporate one of his hometown’s favourite dishes – chips and gravy – plus baby back salt ribs, which he cooks up in front of hungry punters. “It’s good theatre when you’ve got a street food stall, obviously. That and the smell is key to people coming in and trying something new,” he says.Cathryn Quail’s stall on the peninsula looked straight out of the pages of a trendy interiors magazine – but she wants plants to be a part of a sustainable lifestyle rather than feeding an expensive trend. She opened The Botanical Workshop last September to sell plants and teach people how to arrange and take care of them. “It should be something that is affordable, that brings you joy and helps with mindfulness,” she says. “When you buy plants and they stay alive, it’s way more sustainable.”To curb the frustration generated by his bureaucratic job, where he was stuck at a desk each day, Ross Mitchell started curing food. Over three years, his hobby grew to become a business, now called Smoke and Cure. This was his first gig at the Urban Village Fete. “It is always good to meet a new bunch of customers. We were sitting right next to the music stage and among other peer businesses, so we were in good company,” he says.Mitchell has also learned that catering for card payments is now a necessity. “A year ago I wasn’t too fussed about using them, but what I found is it absolutely opens up a whole new line of business,” he says. “With Square you’re allowed to take payment over the phone, which is becoming increasingly important for our particular business.”Learn more about Square"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/341fa6a8ac8d1184e587727bffd8de88b935be3c/722_336_3341_2004/master/3341.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=5339d53a5229e0a76cf2b88545a1ef26","title":"8 of scotland best beaches coast highlands dumfries","story":"The ‘Scotland the Best’ author has been touring the country for 25 years in search of its finest places. Here’s his pick of beaches and seaside villagesMaking a feature of Scotland’s less-travelled coast is a responsibility and a challenge. Even its quieter corners are seeing a tourist boom. Much of the rural north-west, deserted in the romantic imagination, is to all intents “full”. Skye, where accommodation is booked months ahead and camper vans form tailbacks on single-track roads, may be reaching crisis point. Some say we should think of the isle as we do Venice – under threat from the rising tide of tourism. Parts of Edinburgh are becoming an ordeal to visit, and that’s before the festival crowds arrive.But no one wants to turn off the tap. Scotland has what tourists want in buckets: erse and magnificent landscape, history, first-class culture, friendly people and, now, much improved food and drink. Scotland gets tourism and turns out to be really good at it. All we have to do is work out how to manage all these lovely visitors so we don’t kill the capercaillie that laid the golden egg.Visit Scotland, the official tourist body, and Edinburgh city council, keeper of the main gateway to the country, are beginning to focus on how to spread this bounty to unsung parts of Scotland. In line with this strategy, I have picked beaches and coastal villages that are not only discreetly authentic but keen for more visitors. I’ve deliberately avoided those that appeal to the purist seeking a “secret” beach. My own deserted “Pete’s Beach” on the north coast, which I described 25 years ago in the first edition of Scotland the Best, now has a lay-by and, in my selfish view, an annoying zipwire business. All the places below can absorb and accommodate you. For the really secret beaches, there are plenty to find for yourself. This quietly refined village about 45 minutes’ drive from Edinburgh is a good centre for the beaches of East Lothian. Its beach is part of a long sandy stretch of coast. Beachcombers, barbecuers, bold swimmers and kids all have their favourites, such as Tyninghame, Yellowcraig and Seacliff (this last is less frequented, perhaps because you pay two quid to take your car down to it). In all weathers, and the often ethereal East Lothian light, these beaches are a great escape. Down the road in North Berwick, the hotels, restaurants and cafes are all much improved of late. Basically there’s no need to face the throng in the capital.Where to stay and eat The Open Arms hotel in nearby Dirleton has doubles from £90 B\u0026ampB. The Old Clubhouse in Gullane does grills, haggis and veggie dishes.The Road to the Isles from Fort William is the stepping-off point from the mainland – and of everyday life. Boats run to some of Scotland’s most enigmatic islands – Rum, Eigg, Muck – and the Knoydart peninsula (made ever more accessible by the vibrant community of Inverie and the Knoydart Foundation). Arisaig and Mallaig bookend golden beaches, beginning where Loch Morar leaks out to sea on one of the UK’s shortest rivers. Famous Camusdarach beach is just one of many.Where to stay Arisaig House, one of the Highlands’ most laid-back hotels, has doubles for £360 B\u0026ampB for two nights. Doune Stone Lodge is a remote hostelhotel on its own cove where seven nights in a double room with half-board (and packed lunch) costs £570pp. The Knoydart Foundation runs a bunkhouse (dorm beds £18) and a campsite (£7 for two), plus B\u0026ampB and cottage listings. From Spey Bay, where the river slips in to the sea, to Fraserburgh in the north-east, this is some of Scotland’s best coastal scenery, with villages in cliff and cove settings: no rush, no traffic, no noise except sea and birds. Notable are Portsoy, with a 17th-century harbour, a waterside pub and a boat festival Pennan, where much of Local Hero was filmed Gardenstown, with a walk along the water’s edge to coast-clinging Crovie, with great bird-watching cliffs at Troup Head and Cullen, on the main road with a wide beach, a new, cool cafe called Rockpool and a 5km walk to Sunnyside, one of Scotland’s most sublime beaches.Where to stay: Royal Oak Hotel in Cullen is two minutes from the beach, with eight rooms from £80 B\u0026ampB.At the end of the road across the Black Isle peninsula, Cromarty has a times-gone-by atmosphere without being at all twee. Kids run about freely there’s a pink beach and redundant oil platforms in the bay. Unusual delights include the East Church with its clear-glazed windows, Hugh (the geologist) Miller’s Cottage and a brilliant cheese shop. The South Sutor affords a bracing walk round the entrance to Cromarty Firth, with dolphins to spot.Where to stay and eat The Anderson in nearby Fortrose has doubles from £109 B\u0026ampB. Cromarty does have a cute tearoom, Couper’s Creek, and a well-regarded restaurant and pizzeria, Sutor Creek. Islay may not have Skye’s mountains or the small island delights of the Inner Hebrides but a two-hour ferry ride takes you into a thriving community well aware of its responsibilities as custodians of a precious Arcadia. Bowmore, on the Indaal sea loch, is one of several villages with a special relationship with land and sea: the quiet, the seafood, the migrating birds and the peat, a key ingredient in Islay’s world-famous malts. There are countless coves, crannies and wild beaches to discover.Where to stay The Harbour Inn in Bowmore has doubles from £145 B\u0026ampB. Glenegedale House B\u0026ampB, on the way to Port Ellen, has doubles from £90.West of Thurso on the North Coast 500 route are many miles of unspoiled and unsung beaches (apart from my one with the bloody zipwire). Those worth seeking out, in order from Thurso, are: Strathy and Armadale Farr and Torrisdale (the latter gets the mentions but Farr is easier to reach) Coldbackie and Balnakeil by Durness – just after the same-named craft village with its cafe The Whale Tale and an artisan chocolate destination Cocoa Mountain. Durness, a straggly but very Highland village, has a John Lennon Memorial Garden and the Smoo Cave. After Durness, going south, is amazing Assynt. Where to stay Mackay’s Rooms has a “petite” double from £129 B\u0026ampB.Long a weekend retreat across the water from Edinburgh, Elie is the cosiest corner in the East Neuk of Fife. Time moves slowly here, except perhaps at the Ship Inn, a destination pub with a beer garden and cricket pitch on the beach. It’s only half an hour from bustling St Andrews, where tourists replace students in the summer, with lots of cool shopping and places to eat. Placid Elie is defined by its crescent of beach and unruffled sea, and there are walks from here along the Fife Coastal Path to Kingsbarns beach (with its toastie hut) and the Cambo estate and walled garden, or along the Chain Walk from Earlsferry, the conjoined village where the 19th Hole is another pub food destination run by the folk who have the Ship Inn.Where to stay The Ship Inn has doubles from £130 B\u0026ampB. Rufflets is a smart hotel and restaurant near St Andrews, with doubles from £153 B\u0026ampB.Here on the hammerhead peninsula known as the Rhins of Galloway, way south-west of everything else, Portpatrick clusters round its crescent-shaped harbour. Twenty miles away, and often visible from the cliff, is the coast of County Down – Portpatrick used to be Scotland’s most important link with Ireland. Jealously protected by its legions of returning admirers, Portpatrick has a distinctly amiable air: with bars and restaurants along the waterfront, it makes a good centre for roaming the Rhins or starting out on the 212-mile Southern Upland Way. Or, more likely, just hanging out and shooting the southern breeze.Where to stay Knockinaam Lodge has a five-course taster menu dinner, B\u0026ampB from £360 for two. The Crown hotel has doubles from £95 B\u0026ampB.Pete Irvine is author of Scotland the Best, HarperCollins, £15.99"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1f6e3204e5d542fd0166964c63653b12d65ee6f6/0_193_4493_2696/master/4493.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74ce8fa325efe906a3ac2f26e34ec5be","title":"national football museum manchester best of the beautiful game review","story":"Football doesn’t need to come home: it’s already resident in Manchester, where displays of shirts and memorabilia, interactive games and exhibits delight fans young and oldA large, engrossing collection of football exhibits and memorabilia over four floors in Manchester city centre, from shirts worn by greats such as Pelé, Stanley Matthews and Diego Maradona (the one he was wearing when he scored that goal against England at the 1986 World Cup), to a giant homoerotic portrait of Eric Cantona (with Becks and the Neville brothers sitting at his feet like adoring disciples) and the ball used in the 1966 World Cup final. It’s the best of the beautiful game on display.The Jules Rimet trophy was stolen prior to the 1966 World Cup, only to be discovered by Pickles the dog. For fear of losing the trophy again, the FA commissioned a replica and used it for all official functions until 1970. It is now on display at the museum, along with Pickles’ collar and medals (one from the National Canine Defence League, the other from the World Cup Collectors Club). Pickles was adopted as the museum’s mascot in 2014.It’s well-curated, so there’s a penalty shootout zone and other fun stuff for kids that is hands (and feet) on, but there are also in-depth exhibits for bigger kids on subjects such as the history of the World Cup and the Munich air disaster. My favourite was the exhibition of photographs by Stuart Roy Clarke (runs until March 2019), who has been documenting British football for 30 years. His work captures the passion for football that so many supporters feel but find hard to express.Over the summer it is running loads of World Cup-themed events and exhibitions, including “official Panini sticker swap sessions” (every Saturday and Sunday, noon– 2pm).There is branch of the Ryan Giggs and Gary Neville-owned Cafe Football inside the museum. Some wag has run riot with the menu, which includes The ’66 and Special One burgers (from £11.50) and a Mara Doner pizza (£14) – with shredded lamb, red onions and mint aioli – that sounds so contrived it was invented purely for the pun of it. Sandwiches include the Nicky Butty (a club sandwich, £12) and veggie options feature the Clean Sheet (£10) … back of the net! The unhealthy-sounding kids’ menu (£8 for a main, dessert and soft drink) is made up of the usual fast-foodsugary suspects – and even includes the option of a visit to the sweet shop.Yes, but there’s some interesting stuff among all the football books and miniature replica trophies – nostalgic games such as Subbuteo, and Stanley Chow prints of iconic players. For those with deeper pockets, there are framed, signed shirts, boots and gloves from famous former players.It’s next door to Victoria station, hub of the Greater Manchester tram network and departure point for trains across the north of England. And it’s a 20-minute walk or short tram ride from Manchester Piccadilly station.Absolutely – admission is free, though (suggested £3pp) donations are welcome. The optional £6 package allows visitors to get their photographs taken with FA Cup and Premier League replica trophies and have a go on two of the half a dozen interactives, such as the penalty shootout – at the old Wembley goalposts no less – or the Match of the Day commentary challenge. A £25 family day pass allows unlimited access to all the interactive exhibits.From 10am to 5pm every day except Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, Boxing Day and New Year’s Day.910. There’s enough to keep fans absorbed for half a day or longer I went with my grown-up godson and 2½ hours wasn’t nearly long enough for us. There’s also enough of historical interest for the casual browser but non-fans beware: like the game itself, you may wonder what all the fuss is about."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/28a04b417ed3f8571a5148eafd35b173073f2cfe/224_384_3249_1950/master/3249.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6eb43e7442f2435812baa09e140fdcba","title":"border family separation reunited trauma continues","story":"Arnovis Guidos Portillo was reunited with his daughter a month after being detained, but the experience has left her in distress“Papa, where did you go?” Meybelin Portillo, six, asks her father as she clambers onto his lap, tears still in her eyes. She buries her face in his chest and hugs him tightly.Arnovis Guidos Portillo had only stepped out for 15 minutes to pick up an evening order of pupusas (fat tortillas stuffed with cheese, beans or meat) to eat at their home in the tiny Salvadoran village of Corral de Mulas. \bBut since her experience of the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” – which mandated that children of undocumented migrants be removed from their parents – Meybelin has found it hard to spend any time at all away from her father. Even the briefest separation seems to reawaken panic that her father won’t return.“I just went to get pupusas,” Arnovis reassures her. “Don’t worry mi amor.”And then, trying to change the subject, he says: “Hey Meybelin, should we have a swimming lesson tomorrow?” She looks up at him and gives an emphatic nod.Portillo, 26, is a single father, and the two had never spent more than a few hours apart before Meybelin was taken from him on 27 May, after the two were detained at the Texas border. He was deported on 21 June, with no idea where his daughter was – and only made contact with her once he reached a center for returned migrants in San Salvador. After a month apart, the pair was finally reunited last week, when Meybelin was returned to El Salvador. With a wide smile, Arnovis says he has never felt more relieved than when he saw Meybelin in the airport: “I was so happy. We ran towards each other. We’ve never been apart.” But his joy is tempered with concerns about the long-term impact of the experience.“She’s tramautized and extremely anxious – she cried for an hour straight this morning and then again this afternoon. It scares me,” he says.For now, he is trying to distract her, taking her to visit friends or going swimming in the nearby bay. Meybelin is not ready to talk about her time in the US and Arnovis does not want to press her. “She doesn’t like to remember it – she won’t answer questions, she’s quieter than usual,” he says. “This is all so ugly – the situation here, what happened at the border, this process making sure Meybelin’s okay, thinking about what we have to do next … but we’ll be together and whatever happens, happens.”The US president, Donald Trump, reversed the policy of family separations late last month, replacing it with indefinite family detention, but it is unknown how many of the nearly 3,000 children who were separated from their parents have been reunited with their parents or deported alone.A federal judge has since ended deportations of those separated from their children and ordered the administration reunite children under the age of five with their parents within 14 days, and all other children within 30 days. As of 26 June, the US Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services said they had reunified 538 children with parents.But the nightmare is not over for the Guidos Portillo family.Arnovis’ seven-year-old niece, Darlene Roxana Muñoz, is still in a shelter somewhere in Florida. She and her father, José Dolores Muñoz Salinas, 36, had traveled to the border with Arnovis and Meybelin before all four turned themselves into US officials at Hidalgo, with plans to apply for asylum.Agents then separated Darlene and Meybelin from their fathers: Meybelin was sent to Phoenix and Darlene is thought to have been sent to Florida. Arnovis and José were then transferred to Laredo before José was moved by himself to Port Isabel, Texas, where he remains detained.“When’s Darlene coming back?” Meybelin asks later as she picks at her meal. Yancy, Darlene’s mother, forces a smile and with lowered eyes says: “Soon, my dear.”Yancy has spoken to her daughter several times in the past month, but says her husband has not. She says she only knows that she’s in Florida and that her daughter’s caseworker said the pair would be deported together, but did not give a date.According to Salvadoran officials, around 180 Salvadoran children in total were separated from their parents at the border, but the Salvadoran government cannot locate 35 of them. Meybelin’s case was the first known reunification with a deported parent in the country.When he first arrived back to El Salvador, Arnovis had no idea where Meybelin was before American lawyer Jonathan Ryan, executive director of Texas-based legal aid organization Raices, called to tell him she had been in a shelter in Phoenix.The night she finally landed in San Salvador, two vans full of family members had made the three-hour trek to the airport with colorful balloons and welcome signs. Arnovis had spent the morning preparing for her arrival: cleaning her favorite white dress, stringing lights, cooking beans and stuffing a piñata he commissioned to resemble her.Since her return Meybellin has refused to sleep in her own bed, instead spending the night sandwiched between Arnovis and his partner Joanna. And while Arnovis is glad to have her back, he still fears what the future may hold for the family.The pair fled home after Arnovis received death threats from the local street gang which still dominates the town. Since returning, Arnovis says two other friends have left after gang members threatened their lives.For now, he plans to stay in El Salvador, but he is looking into requesting asylum elsewhere – in Canada, Costa Rica, Belize, Panama or any other country where he can work and he and his daughter can be safe.“This is all happiness right now. It’s been a celebration because I’ve got another chance with her, but I need to make sure we are going to be okay,” he says. “And I just don’t know. I just wish the United States would leave a little compassion for us.” Reporting for this article was funded by an Adelante fellowship from the International Women’s Media Foundation"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5fbb9f0d4b9033f955d7d169c9432813f5d4d052/0_812_2140_1284/master/2140.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=08c0044e2e5ae795044860ed21b52cf6","title":"mike pompeo north korea kim jong un rocket man cd nuclear elton john","story":"Secretary of state will also present letter from Donald Trump, who famously called North Korean leader ‘little rocket man’When Mike Pompeo meets Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang, he will reportedly attempt to smooth a path towards denuclearisation with a gift that playfully references a low point in relations between the North Korean leader and Donald Trump: a CD of Elton John’s Rocket Man.The US secretary of state will present Kim with the CD along with a letter from Trump, who memorably turned the song’s title into an epithet after the North stepped up its ballistic missile tests last year.Quoting unnamed sources in Washington, South Korea’s Chosun Ilbo newspaper said the gifts reflected Trump’s belief that Kim would follow through on commitments the leaders agreed at their summit in Singapore last month.Several times last year, Trump referred to the dictator as “little rocket man,” while Kim reciprocated by labelling the president a “mentally deranged dotard”.Trump raised the rocket man reference during their meeting, the newspaper said. Kim said he had never heard the song, it added, prompting the president to ask Pompeo to take the CD with him to Pyongyang on what is his third trip to North Korea since April.The CD is not the first bizarre White House offering to Pyongyang. During their summit, the US and North Korean delegations watched a four-minute video, made in the style of a Hollywood trailer, setting out the North’s stark choice: conflict with a powerful enemy or a peaceful and prosperous future as America’s (denuclearised) partner. The film, a copy of which was given to Kim, casts him and Trump as the architects of a new chapter in world history – “two men, two leaders, one destiny”.As concerns grow that North Korea is upgrading its nuclear capability, despite agreeing to work towards the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, Pompeo said he expected the North to “fill in some details” outlined in the leaders’ Singapore declaration.In an earlier tweet Pompeo said Trump believes Kim wants a “different, brighter future” for North Koreans. “I spoke with @POTUS while we were both in the air. The President told me he believes that Chairman Kim sees a different, brighter future for the people of North Korea. We both hope that’s true,” he said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2055e04330486afba8594cd5bb0c963b5001e31f/0_0_5016_3316/master/5016.jpg?w=700\u0026amp;q=20\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=492ae084a11498f3dc421c3050ad044c 1400w","title":"easy does it the slow travel guide to the peloponnese greece","story":"The majestic peninsula is home to local tavernas, picturesque villages, ancient sites and stunning stretches of coast. Best of all, it’s delightfully unhurried and free of overhyped hotspotsThe Peloponnese, southern Greece’s much-mythologised peninsula, has something of a reputation for philoxenia – the tradition of giving a warm welcome and showing generous hospitality to visitors. It’s also a region that embodies the very ideal of slow travel: local food and drink, plenty of walking, zero stress, tapping ancient rhythms and community spirit.Of course, this comes from the people. But it may also have to do with vital statistics. The peninsula is about the size of Wales, yet receives only a small percentage of tourists in comparison to the big beasts of Corfu, Crete, Rhodes, Halkidiki and others. This means there’s no need to jostle among crowds.A topography of indented coasts, river valleys, steep mountain ranges and small coastal peninsulas encourages rural integrity over road-building. In hundreds of small villages, local ties are strong, there are festivals aplenty, and life revolves around farming and fishing, family and friends – and, naturally, local tavernas.Even the staples are sybaritic, from the famous Kalamata olives and green-gold oil to purple-hued tsakoniki aubergines to barrel-aged feta cheese. Wine grapes have been grown across the sun-baked slopes for centuries.For all its old-world charm, the Peloponnese is also a land of almost unlimited scope for exploration. It’s home to some of the most famous archaeological sites in the world, including Olympia and Ancient Messini, as well as many others lesser-known but no less enthralling. Much of Greece’s mythology originated here, including the main players of the Trojan wars.If you want relaxation, this unique part of Greece delivers in spades. Get the inside track on the must-visit villages, beaches and beauty spots, for the ultimate go-slow break in the Peloponnese ...Mani, the second finger at the southern tip of the Peloponnese and, by extension, mainland Greece itself, is one of the most beautiful regions in the country, with a mountainous spine running down to what were – until relatively recently – some very remote spots. The sun rises late on the coast because of the high Taygetos mountain range. Mornings tend to be lazy affairs where locals and visitors mingle to enjoy leisurely coffees and late breakfasts.It is also home to the pretty town of Kardamili. This laid-back little place is wonderful for walkers planning to hike the Viros gorge ditto for birdwatchers, artists and writers – little wonder that Patrick Leigh Fermor chose this village to be his home. The small beach resort of Stoupa is just a few miles to the south.Eat and drinkAll the local eateries are traditional family-run tavernas – as authentic a Greek culinary experience as you’ll find anywhere.  Kiki’s Taverna, up a side street from the town square, does dishes of the day rather than a set menu – favourites include sea bream and goat’s meat – ensuring produce is fresh and seasonal. It’s really traditional and popular with locals. If you want a stunning view with your meal, try Dioskouri Taverna, which overlooks the little harbour of Kardamili, for a fresh fish and sunset combination. It also sells local sea salt, olive soap and honey.StayThe Liakoto and Anniska hotels are on the sea front with the Taygetos range behind – Kardamili is blessed by both sea and mountain scenery. Anniska has a more traditional look and feel, with a stunning terrace where breakfast is served and drinks flow all day. Liakoto has sea-view rooms with private balconies overlooking the magnificent Messinian Bay. Both hotels have a very high number of repeat guests.This away-from-it-all haven is at the start of a string of fine, sandy beaches, culminating in the fantastic lagoon-like curve of Voidokilia in the heart of the nature reserve here – with wetlands excellent for birding. Close by is the historic town of Pylos, where the naval battle of Navarino was fought in 1827, during the Greek war of independence.Eat and drinkThere is an extensive choice of tavernas and cafes, which are really only busy at weekends and in peak season, when the locals from Pylos come for a swim and a fish lunch. Elia does superb salads, aromatic grilled sardines, and octopus with capers.StayZoe Resort’s 20 attractive studios and apartments have a large swimming pool and gardens leading down to the beach. Or you could opt to stay in the older – but no less charming – 24-room Zoe hotel.This historic town is known for the imposing walls of its Venetian fortress, which stretch out towards the sea. It’s very sleepy spot, with a wide sandy beach shelving very gently into shallow waters.Eat and drinkThe Klimataria restaurant is very well regarded, and eating out in the garden courtyard is a reason to visit in itself. Chicken in mustard sauce is delicious, as are the grilled veggies.StayThe Ulysses hotel, a small and friendly lodging with just nine rooms, is great for the beach.

Since then, local newspapers in British Columbia and the Northwest Territories have logged at least 10 other incidents in which victims described a foul-smelling substance which fell from the sky.Transport Canada, the country’s aviation authority, has received 18 reports of people and vehicles being drenched in the mysterious substance – but said that airplanes weren’t involved in any of them. Allan said that the agency told her that while there were three planes in the area at the time, “no aircraft overflew the intersection noted during the time frame in question”, adding that “there were no malfunctions that would have caused the lavatory waste systems to leak” from any of the airlines. Environmental scientists have suggested the splattering was the result of a “poopsicle” – the phenomena that occurs when a leaking airplane lavatory ices over and then slowly melts as the plane descends.In an email, the agency told Allan it her considered the matter closed.The faecal matter falling from the sky didn’t contain blue colouration, a key an indication it came from a plane, Transport Canada told the  in an email. “The department’s review has concluded that these incidents do not meet the description of blue ice and are therefore not aviation-related.” The Kelowna international airport lists five daily flights arriving in a timeframe similar to the one provided by Allan, between 12.30 and 1.47pm.Allan remains convinced that a plane was the source. “When we looked up there was an airplane flying over us,” she said. A simple DNA test would provide a clear answer, said environmental scientist Robert Young, who added that the smell and the fact that the matter caused conjunctivitis strongly suggests it was faeces.He said, while unlikely, is also also possible the faeces could have been caused by a large bird or series of birds. ‘It’s just a matter of identifying the perpetrator,” he said, adding that: “I don’t think this will be one of the great mysteries of the universe.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/85c8eaf3467c81b8e655ed912b12a3b3f9411a9e/33_158_2447_1468/master/2447.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bbbd9a3098275285d1e9a7e3b7169098","title":"german students reveal exam answers to key brexit questions","story":"Pupils who sat Brexit test say decision to leave EU ‘sounds naive’ and Northern Ireland should vote againHow can the Brexit negotiations move on from the deadlock over the Irish border? According to a group of German students who have sat the first school exam on Britain’s withdrawal from the European Union, the answer could be straightforward: give Northern Ireland a referendum on whether to stay in the UK or the EU.In April, students of English in the southern German state of Baden-Württemberg were asked as part of their school-leaving exams to write about the differences between the hopes connected to Britain’s EU referendum and the reality of Brexit so far.Now that the Abitur – the certificate of general qualification for university entrance, equivalent to the UK’s A-levels – papers have been marked, some students have revealed some of the creative solutions they came up with.“If I understand it correctly, the conflict with the border is there because Northern Ireland voted to stay in the EU,” said Daniel Boppert, 19, a student at the Lessing gymnasium in Karlsruhe, who scored 14 out of 15 points in the written English test.“Now they need a special solution. Perhaps they should have another referendum, but only for those in Northern Ireland, to see if they want to stay in the EU or in the UK under the new conditions after Brexit.”The dispute over the Irish border has proved one of the main sticking points of the Brexit negotiations. Any UK ergence from EU regulations – a key boon for many Brexit advocates – risks creating a hard border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and unravelling the peace process.Boppert said that although he had some sympathy with the Brexit vote, “I don’t really understand it. I can see how the sovereignty idea has some appeal, but surely you can’t get around the fact that the economy will take a hit in the coming years. I don’t know if perhaps Boris Johnson had a special appeal, but it all sounds very naive to me.”His classmate Ole Ermel, 18, said it would be dangerous to revoke the referendum result and hold another UK-wide vote. “It would be absurd to simply void such an important democratic decision. Where would that lead to?” said Ermel, who scored 15 out of 15. “But perhaps they could have a vote only in Northern Ireland?”The exam, sat by about 31,000 students, asked for comment on a drawing by an Indian cartoonist, Paresh Nath, contrasting “Project Fantasy” – represented by a man in a bowler hat soaring to the sky on a UFO – with the realities of economic uncertainty and “job confusion”.“What I got from the cartoon was that the British people had a lot of hopes for Brexit, such as an upturn in the economy, and that these hopes haven’t really been fulfilled,” said Rebecca Gartner, 18. “Instead there has only been uncertainty.”David Blinov, 18, said: “I put that Brexit was a backward step for Europe. We have had 60 years of peace in Europe, and the EU has played an important role in that. Now the danger is that the EU as a whole could collapse.“I can see how people voted to leave because they felt patriotic, but I find patriotism pretty moronic,” he added. “If you happen to have been born in another country then you would have felt patriotic about that country. It’s so random.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e4d28faa13ebe504e3747c6688c90e1dfef48547/0_120_4297_2578/master/4297.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f013bd89a14d776b3f3ea00fb8eeaac6","title":"japan appetite eel same fate bluefin tuna","story":"Diners eat eel for an energy boost in summer, but its popularity has depleted stocksOversized inflatable plastic eels dangle from the ceiling of a supermarket in Tokyo as late afternoon shoppers inspect the real thing – beautifully packaged and prominently displayed – on the shelves below.In specialist restaurants run by generations of the same families, diners eat sweetened broiled eel, which is thought to take the edge off the heat and humidity of a Japanese summer.These annual rites are performed in honour of a dish that has been part of the culinary landscape for centuries. But Japan’s appetite for Anguilla japonica – Japanese freshwater eel – has come at a price.Eel stocks are a fraction of what they were in the 1960s, and conservationists say continued overconsumption could condemn the animal to the same fate as the Pacific bluefin tuna.The environment ministry designated the Japanese eel as an endangered species in 2013. The following year, the International Union of Conservation of Nature added it to its red list of threatened species, blaming overconsumption and environmental damage to the rivers and coastal areas where they spawn and grow.The plight of the eel has come into sharper focus as Japan prepares to mark the Day of the Ox in the lunar calendar – two days that this year fall on 20 July and 1 August – traditionally considered the hottest days of the year.Overfishing of juvenile glass eels, which are transferred to farm ponds where they are fed until they reach maturity, has led to record price rises, forcing restaurants to post notices apologising to customers for charging them significantly more each year for a simple kabayaki.The market price for adult eels rose to a record ¥5,300 (£36) a kg in March, about one and a half times higher than last year, according to the Union of Eel Farmers Cooperatives of Japan.The decline in stocks has been accelerated by illegal fishing, according to Kenzo Kaifu, a professor at Chuo University in Tokyo and an expert on eel conservation.The Day of the Ox, Kaifu said, “might be the perfect opportunity to think a little more deeply about the eel problem we’re facing, and make it a topic of conversation”.On those and other sweltering days throughout the midsummer, people are drawn to skewered fillets of eel that are dipped in a soy-based sweet sauce, cooked slowly over charcoal and served on rice.The dish, which is rich in vitamins, is eaten to provide a much-needed energy boost at the height of summer some believe the smoke from an eel cooking on the grill gives an immediate pick-me-up.Last month, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan agreed to leave the upper limit on catches of juvenile eels unchanged, to the dismay of conservation groups. China, which has the biggest single annual quota of 36 tons, much of which it exports to Japan, routinely shuns multinational efforts to restrict catches.Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora are expected to discuss the increasingly precarious future of the freshwater eel at a meeting next May.Some retailers are already taking action. The supermarket chain Aeon said it would stop procuring Japanese eels whose origin and journey through the supply chain was not properly documented. Instead it will switch to short-fin eels, a cheaper variety commonly found in Indonesia, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper.Some eel farmers are fattening their stocks so a single fish produces enough meat for two dishes, despite concerns that the bigger bones, which are usually barely perceptible, will put off some diners.Despite advances in farming methods, it is still not possible to raise eels from birth to maturity. Fisheries have to catch juvenile eels in the wild before transferring them to farm ponds.Campaigners are calling on consumers to resist the urge to eat Japanese eels this summer and throughout the year.“Even though there is a severe shortage, Japan, Taiwan, Korea have together decided not to reduce the catch quota next season,” said Kazue Komatsubara, oceans campaigner at Greenpeace Japan.“The fishery agency said there was no scientific evidence to support a reduction in catches. But Japan could reduce its catch quota by itself to help the eel population recover. It has to take responsibility as the biggest market for the Japanese eel.“The only way to avoid supporting illegal fishing and to be a responsible consumer who supports sustainable fishing is to stop buying eels.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3556335.1530875651!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"chair of cervicalcheck inquiry receives records from hse","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDr Gabriel Scally had earlier criticised the HSE for a continuing delay in providing documentation to his investigation.

Photograph:  Sean GallupGettyBritish prime minister Theresa May has urged her cabinet to take “another step forward” towards a Brexit deal when they meet in Chequers on Friday, as hardline backbenchers warned against remaining too closely aligned with the European Union. \u0026nbspJacob Rees-Mogg said a leaked proposal for regulatory alignment to be discussed at Chequers would turn Britain into a vassal state, as Downing Street denied that the plan would make a trade deal with the United States impossible.The Spectator reported on Thursday that a document circulated to ministers proposes that\u0026nbsp“the UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food” and would make “an upfront choice to commit by treaty to ongoing harmonisation with EU rules on goods”. The document says the deal “would not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal” as the UK would be unable to recognise the US’s “array of standards”.The prime minister’s official spokeswoman rejected as “categorically untrue” the suggestion Britain would be unable to negotiate a trade deal with the US, whose president, Donald Trump, visits the country next week.“The PM has always been clear that we will seek a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal with the US that reflects the strength of our trading and investment relationship, and as you know the president has also made it clear that he is keen to sit down and talk with the UK about that. And the PM and the president will obviously have a chance to discuss trade next week,” the spokeswoman said. “What I can be very clear on is that it is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.”Brexit secretary David Davis declined on Thursday to deny reports that he had written to Ms May warning that her new customs proposal would be unacceptable to Brussels. The “facilitated customs arrangement” would see Britain leave the EU’s common external tariff but all goods entering the UK would be tracked and charged the EU tariff if they were destined for Europe. Speaking ahead of the Chequers meeting, the prime minister said the cabinet had a great opportunity and a duty to set an ambitious course for the country after Brexit.\u0026nbsp“We have already made good progress – on the text of the withdrawal agreement, by passing the EU Withdrawal Act and in agreeing an implementation period which gives people and business certainty. Now is the time for another step forward. We want a deal that allows us to deliver the benefits of Brexit – taking control of our borders, laws and money and by signing ambitious new trade deals with countries like the US, Australia and New Zealand, ” she said."},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/news/2018/03/13/TELEMMGLPICT000157140466_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqqckM73LBkofRqfnrUGvsfN8kokmBBfZYd8t7cNZkTT8.jpeg?imwidth=450","title":"novichok should do think exposed nerve agent","story":"digitalservices@telegraphMilitary personnel with chemical weapons training have been deployed to Salisbury to aid the investigation into the poisoning of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yuliadigitalservices@telegraphCounter-terror police say a couple left in a critical condition in Wiltshire were exposed to the same nerve agent as former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia earlier this year.The couple, named locally as mother Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley, were discovered in Amesbury, around eight miles from where the Skripals were poisoned with Novichok in March.The incident comes four months after Mr Skripal, 67, and and his 33-year-old daughter were poisoned in a suspected Russian backed assassination attempt and will lead to fears that the public in Salisbury could still be at risk.Mr Skripal, a former double agent, and his daughter, who had been visiting him from Moscow, spent two months in hospital. They were discharged in May and are at a secure location.Novichok was identified as the compound used in the attack by experts at the science and Defence Science and Technology Laboratory at Porton Down. Novichok is not a single toxin but a family of  so called fourth generation nerve agents developed by the Russians in the 1970s and 1980s. In some forms, it is reported to be between five and eight times more toxic than earlier nerve agents, such as VX. It can be stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients which, when mixed, react to produce the weaponised nerve agent. This makes it easier to transport and handle – an advantage for an assassin.Michelle Carlin, senior lecturer in forensic and analytical chemistry at Northumbria University, said that it can be used in the form of an ultra-fine powder as well as as a liquid or vapour. It kills after being ingested or absorbed through the skin.Is it the same batch that affected the Skripals?Dr Carlin said it would be unusual if the couple had been affected by nerve agent from the same source as that used against the Skripals four months ago.She said the new case was surprising and, while it is difficult to speculate over where the poison came from, it would be unexpected if it were from same source.It is difficult to speculate whether this is from the original source used in the Skripal case however, if it was from the same source, it is unusual that it has taken four months for someone to be affected by it, Dr Carlin said.Novichok in Salisbury: How could this happen four months after Skripal attack?What is the risk to the general public?Professor Dame Sally Davies, chief medical officer for England, said the Skripal episode meant officials had a well-established response in place.She said: You do not need to seek advice from a health professional unless you are experiencing symptoms.She also urged not to pick up any unknown or already dangerous objects such as needles and syringes.What should I do if I visited these locations?You should clean clothing and items you had with you while you were there.Clothing that is dry-clean only should be put in two plastic bags (ie. a double layer), tied at the top and stored safely – PHE is reviewing the best way of cleaning these items and will publish information in due course.Items such as phones and handbags should be cleaned with baby wipes. Jewellery, watches and glasses should be washed with warm water and detergent and then rinsed in clean cold water.Should I destroy items of clothing?Public Health England says this is not necessary but if you want to do this put them in two plastic bags, tie them at the top and dispose of  it in an outdoor bin in the normal way.What effect does Novichok have on the body?Novichok, like all nerve agents, disrupts the chemical signals between the nerves and the muscles which control vital organs, said Dr Carlin.This can lead to breathing difficulties, loss of control of bodily functions, increased salivation, convulsions, paralysis.”Outward symptoms may include white eyes, convulsions, drooling and – in the worse cases – coma, respiratory failure and death.Nerve agents can act within minutes but they can also take hours to take effect. Much depends on the exact toxin, the dose and the delivery method. What is the treatment for those exposed to Novichok?Patients exposed to nerve agents are normally given the drug atropine, which reduces muscle spasms and the production of saliva. It needs to be given as soon after exposure as possible – ideally within minutes.It is likely that atropine was used to treat the Skripals, said Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds.Doctors may also use a drug called pralidoxime, an antidote to organophosphate pesticides and chemicals.Treatments for exposure to nerve agentsWhat are the long-term effects of exposure?Little is known about this, although exposure is thought to lead to long-term harm. One of the Russian scientists who helped develop Novichok, Andrei Zheleznyakov, was accidentally exposed and, according to a book about the history of chemical weapons, War of Nerves by Jonathan Tucker, he suffered permanent ill health including hepatitis, epilepsy, severe depression and an inability to concentrate. He died five years after exposure.The Moscow weapons lab that made the deadly Novichok nerve agentIs there a wider risk from Novichok and other chemical and biological weapons in the UK?The greatest risk comes from the fact that the taboo on the use of chemical weapons, which has held for much of the last 100 years, appears to be breaking down.Politician\u0027s must bend every sinew to reestablish this red line, said Hamish De Bretton-Gordon, a former commanding officer of the UK Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Regiment.Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health Security Please review our commenting policyFormer Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif sentenced to 10 years in prison for corruptionGerman coalition reaches watered-deal on migration, including no transit centres Amesbury poisoning: Wiltshire police cannot rule out more people falling ill amid hunt for Novichok-tainted itemEngland\u0026#39s rivers are starting to dry up after the sunniest May and June on recordMoped thieves steal motorbike as owner lies on the road with critical injuries following crashEngland fans rush to Russia after finding ticket \u0026#39loophole\u0026#39 How Cape Town beat the worst drought in its historyThailand cave rescue: Diver dies while trying to save trapped group as time runs outThai boat sinking: 21 bodies pulled from water off Phuket as dozens missingGavin Williamson: give Troubles soldiers amnesty, even if it means including the IRAAnne Frank\u0026#39s family tried to escape to US say researchersUK weather: Hottest day of the year as commuters set to swelter while train disruption continues Isle of Bute: Teenage boy known to Alesha MacPhail\u0026#39s family charged in connection with 6-year-old\u0026#39s deathComment: There\u0026#39s a red line from Syria to Amesbury – and we\u0026#39ve allowed it to be crossedComment: The big question for the Brexit summit: why won’t the Government get a move on?Comment: Anything other than a clean Brexit would be economically disastrous and a betrayal of the British peopleStarbucks sacks employee accused of mocking customer for stutteringComment:  Artists and writers should champion freedom of thought -

The biggest surge was in fans wanting to travel from Leeds to Russia - a three-fold rise in bookings - which may be linked to the fact that about a quarter of Gareth Southgate’s squad hails from Yorkshire.Russia World Cup in pictures: New puff July 3rdKevin Miles, chief executive of the Football Supporters’ Federation, said: “Getting the Fan ID is no longer the issue. Fans have posted their tickets on social media and that’s enough to use that to obtain the Fan ID. Supporters have discovered that the Fan ID and purchase of tickets is not linked by an database. They are not connected.“At the moment we are seeing a lot of chatter about getting to Samara. But fans are going to find it hard to get there in time. The price of flights from Moscow have soared as has the cost of accommodation.”England fans have, until now, steered clear of Russia, deterred by the fears of attacks by Russian hooligans and plunging diplomatic relations following the Kremlin-ordered nerve agent attack on the spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter in Salisbury, Wiltshire, in March.Just England 2,000 fans watched the penalty shootout defeat in the Spartak stadium, outnumbered by at least ten-to-one by Colombians. Gareth Southgate, the England manager, has urged more fans to travel to cheer the team on and it is expected that at least 5,000 England fans will make the difficult journey to Samara.  About 10,000 supporters are anticipated to flood into Moscow if England reach the semi-final and the possible showdown with Russia.Fans already in Russia are now delaying their return home. Kieran O’Mara, 20, from east London, said after the Colombia win: “I wasn’t planning on going to Samara but more savings are being transferred and I’m going to stay on. I was saving up for a car but not now.”Hotels and homeowners have hiked prices in Samara, an industrial city unused to an influx of tourists. Even dingy flats were being advertised for rent at more than £1,000 a night.A two-bedroom flat on Sadovaya street near the downtown area was going for £1,378 on Saturday night despite its garish decor including bright pink floral wallpaper and a cheap sofa covered with a blanket. With no prior reviews on Booking, it appeared to have only recently come on the market.“Villa Chic” on offer outside the city centre was priced at 1,019 a night although it did include .what appeared to be a lapdancing pole in a party room with wall to wall mirrors, sauna and a karaoke machine.The cost of flights out of Samara and back to Moscow have also shot up with one budget airline charging £400 one-way for the one-hour 40 minute flight. Trains are an option but can take 18 hours, which means fans would have to leave Moscow on Friday to make kickoff in Samara the next day.Samara, Russia\u0027s sixth largest city, is an industrial hub of more than a million people located in a bend of the Volga River. The top tourist attraction is a bunker built 120 feet below the ground for Joseph Stalin as the Germans advanced in 1942.The city is known as the centre of the Russian space industry, since the Soyuz rocket, which remains the only way for astronauts to reach the International Space Station, is manufactured there.The British Government has banned ministers, senior officials and members of the Royal family from attending the World Cup following the Skripal poisoning but Labour has suggested shadow ministers could watch England if they wished. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, also called for a national holiday if England won the World Cup.World Cup 2018 | The best of the \u0026#039s coveragePlease review our commenting policyFormer Pakistani PM Nawaz Sharif sentenced to 10 years in prison for corruptionGerman coalition reaches watered-deal on migration, including no transit centres Amesbury poisoning: Wiltshire police cannot rule out more people falling ill amid hunt for Novichok-tainted itemEngland\u0026#39s rivers are starting to dry up after the sunniest May and June on recordMoped thieves steal motorbike as owner lies on the road with critical injuries following crashHow Cape Town beat the worst drought in its historyThailand cave rescue: Diver dies while trying to save trapped group as time runs outThai boat sinking: 21 bodies pulled from water off Phuket as dozens missingGavin Williamson: give Troubles soldiers amnesty, even if it means including the IRAAnne Frank\u0026#39s family tried to escape to US say researchersUK weather: Hottest day of the year as commuters set to swelter while train disruption continues Isle of Bute: Teenage boy known to Alesha MacPhail\u0026#39s family charged in connection with 6-year-old\u0026#39s deathComment: There\u0026#39s a red line from Syria to Amesbury – and we\u0026#39ve allowed it to be crossedComment: The big question for the Brexit summit: why won’t the Government get a move on?Starbucks sacks employee accused of mocking customer for stutteringComment: Anything other than a clean Brexit would be economically disastrous and a betrayal of the British peopleComment:  Artists and writers should champion freedom of thought - that\u0026#39s exactly what we\u0026#39ll be doing this SundayJapan executes sarin gas attack cult leader and six Aum Shinrikyo membersAt least 24 killed in Mexico fireworks explosionDonald Trump imposes first tariffs on China and threatens to target almost all $500 billion Chinese importsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Click here for instructions "},{"url":"https://www.telegraph.co.uk/content/dam/politics/2018/06/29/TELEMMGLPICT000167842186_trans_NvBQzQNjv4BqM37qcIWR9CtrqmiMdQVx7EQJw12-8MukQ1-0NPJsHcY.jpeg?imwidth","title":"anything clean brexit would economically disastrous betrayal","story":"digitalservices@telegraphTheresa May has lost her nerve, and given into the Remain lobbyAt Chequers today, the Cabinet will debate a freshly fudged variant of the UK’s plans to leave the European Union.

He said uncertainty around Brexit was “very discomforting”, and said the company had a duty to speak out about it on behalf of shareholders. “Rest assured that we are taking first preparations as we speak in order to mitigate consequences from whatever Brexit scenario may follow,” Mr Enders said.“Brexit in whatever form, soft or hard, light or clean, whatever you call it, will be damaging for industry, for our industry and damaging for the UK, whatever the outcome will be.”His remarks were made as members of the cabinet gather at Chequers for an anticipated showdown over Theresa May’s new Brexit plan. The prime minister faces a backlash from pro-Brexit MPs after \u0026nbspdocuments circulated to ministers ahead of the summit indicated that the new approach would make it impossible to negotiate a US-UK trade deal. “Let’s see what comes out of Chequers: white smoke, black smoke or no smoke,” said Mr Enders. Airbus is the latest in a string of businesses to warn that the continued lack of clarity on Brexit is going to cause problems for companies operating in the UK. Earlier this week, Jaguar Land Rover warned that it urgently needs “greater certainty” about the future, or it will be forced to move investment overseas, and could ultimately have to shut down UK plants. Stuart Richards, a senior organiser at union GMB, said the car maker’s statement should prompt the government to set aside its “squabbling” and listen to companies’ concerns. “Our members at Jaguar Land Rover do skilled jobs with decent pay and contribute millions to the real economy,” he said.“We cannot afford to lose Jaguar Land Rover and its supply chain – it would be an economic car crash.“The best thing that could come out of the prime minister’s get-together at Chequers is a clear commitment to the UK being part of a customs union with Europe.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

At least 35 selective\u0026nbspschools - of which there are 163 in England - are considering a share of the expansion funding announced by the government\u0026nbspto help create thousands of new places.Analysis from campaign group Comprehensive Future calculates that an additional thousand pupils could attend grammar schools a year - if all proposals for expansion are approved.Campaigners have criticised that spending is going on academic selection during a school funding crisis - and they argue that expanding grammar places causes “serious problems” for nearby secondary schools.Billy Caldwell granted medical cannabis licence for treatment at home Brexit documentary suggests everything would be fine if Boris were PMScottish temperature record declared invalid because of parked vehicleMelissa Benn, chair of Comprehensive Future said: “If these, and further expansions, go ahead, we will see significant changes to our education landscape. Expanding selective school places imbalances local school communities and causes serious problems for nearby secondary schools.”She said surrounding schools will find their intake changes to create “de facto secondary moderns.Grammar schools have under a month to submit bids for the £50m fund - which schools minister Nick Gibb has said could fund up to 4,000 places\u0026nbspa year. Schools will be able to access cash from September.As part of the bids to government, existing grammar schools have to set out what action they will take to boost the number of disadvantaged pupils they admit following criticism of a lack of ersity.Comprehensive Future found consultations for expansions on the websites of 35 selective schools across England - from Kent, London and Essex, to Devon, Manchester, and the West Midlands.It is possible that other grammar schools are seeking funding but have not put their consultations - which are supposed to run for four weeks\u0026nbsp- online ahead of the August deadline.Liam Collins, headteacher of Uplands Community College in East Sussex, said he was “dismayed” to see a Kent grammar school is seeking to offer additional “out of area placements” which will affect his intake.Ian Widdows, founder of the National Association of Secondary Moderns, told The Independent that the expansion of grammar schools exacerbates the challenges that neighbouring secondary moderns face.He added: “Not only does this constitute a significant injection of precious capital funding into just grammar schools but it will also inevitably reduce the future funding levels for years to come at secondary moderns due to reduced student numbers. “All of this is happening at a time when school budgets are already stretched to breaking point and headteachers across the country are talking seriously of an ongoing school funding crisis.”UK news in picturesGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel receives Britain\u0027s Prime Minister Theresa May in Berlin.British police officers stand facing a residential property in Amesbury, England, Wednesday, July 4, 2018.

The setting is spectacular, at the eastern end of Lake Geneva, on the edge of the Swiss Alps. Palm trees line the promenade, there are snowcapped peaks above. You can sit and look at it all day, but when the sun goes down the town shuts down. The vistas here are heavenly, but there’s not a lot to do.Yet for a fortnight each summer, this torpid paradise is transformed. Lighting rigs and big amp stacks spring up along the lakeside. Grizzled musos replace prosperous OAPs. A tax haven for wealthy pensioners becomes the centre of the world music scene, as the Montreux Jazz Festival comes to town.The Montreux Jazz Festival has always been a bit of a misnomer. It started as a jazz festival in 1967, the brainchild of Swiss impresario Claude Nobs. Keith Jarrett played the first festival, Nina Simone played the second, but it’s always doubled as a rock fest, ever since Ten Years After played here in 1969.Since then, Montreux Jazz Festival has become increasingly eclectic. During the 1970s, there were shows by Bo Diddley, Chuck Berry, Carlos Santana, Muddy Waters, John Lee Hooker, Ella Fitzgerald, Aretha Franklin and Roberta Flack. James Brown came here in the 1980s. Miles Davis played here 11 times between 1973 and 1991. In the Noughties, Montreux hosted Stevie Wonder, David Bowie, Leonard Cohen, Run-DMC and Radiohead.This year’s line-up is similarly erse: Rag ‘n’ Bone Man, Nine Inch Nails, Jamiroquai, Massive Attack, Jamie Cullum, John Cale, Iggy Pop, Nick Cave, Steve Winwood, Van Morrison… and the band that put Montreux on the hard-rock roadmap, heavy metal veterans Deep Purple.Even at their headbanging peak, Deep Purple were never really fashionable. They lacked the mystique of other hard rock bands like Led Zeppelin or The Doors. However, in Ritchie Blackmore they had a lead guitarist to rival Led Zep’s Jimmy Page, and in Jon Lord they boasted a keyboard virtuoso the equal of The Doors’ Ray Manzarek.Montreux started as a jazz festival in 1967, but has doubled as a rock event since 1969 (Claude Nobs Archives)Blackmore left the band long ago, and Lord died in 2012, but the three other core members are still going strong: vocalist Ian Gillan, bassist Roger Glover and drummer Ian Paice (the only ever-present since the band started out, 50 years ago). Along with Lord and Blackmore, this trio recorded Deep Purple’s most famous track, in Montreux in 1971, with one of the most familiar riffs in rock history – “Smoke on the Water”.Blackmore’s immortal riff would have been enough to ensure the song’s longevity, but like all the best rock songs it also tells a story. Thankfully, unlike a lot of heavy metal anthems, there’s nothing mystical about it. Instead, it’s a straightforward account, almost journalistic in its brevity, of how Deep Purple recorded their finest album, Machine Head, in Montreux.Formed in 1968 in Hertford, Deep Purple enjoyed some success with their first two albums, but it was when founder members Ritchie Blackmore, Jon Lord and Ian Paice brought in Ian Gillan and Roger Glover that the band took off. Their Concerto for Group and Orchestra (recorded with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra at the Royal Albert Hall) attracted heaps of publicity, and their fourth LP, Deep Purple in Rock (with its iconic Mount Rushmore cover, featuring the anthemic “Child in Time”) made their name.Cale and Nick Cave (Emilien Itim)Yet for Deep Purple, like so many bands before and since, this breakthrough album brought a different set of problems. Recording sessions for their fifth album, Fireball, had to be fitted in around a busy schedule of live dates, from the autumn of 1970 until the summer of 1971. The album wasn’t as successful as its predecessor, and was widely regarded as a sideways step.Consequently, the band resolved to record their sixth album without any interruptions or distractions. Montreux Casino would be empty for three weeks that winter, and Nobs had offered them the use of it. All the recording equipment they needed they could take with them, in a mobile recording studio (borrowed from The Rolling Stones).With Swiss punctuality, Deep Purple arrived in Montreux, ready to start recording. Frank Zappa and his band, The Mothers of Invention, were playing the Casino that afternoon, and then the venue would be theirs. It couldn’t have been any simpler. What could possibly go wrong?Great music documentaries to watch nowGlastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you’re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.

He saw a man in the crowd behind him wielding a couple of roman candles. Gillan wasn’t too perturbed – compared to most fireworks, roman candles are usually fairly harmless – but then the bloke chucked them into the air, and they lodged in the rafters. In no time at all, the building was ablaze. “There’s a fire, please stay calm and make your way out,”\u0026nbspannounced Zappa from the stage.The band retreated to their hotel, and watched the fire from the bar. At first, it looked like the blaze might spread to the surrounding buildings, and set the entire town alight, but thankfully the wind blew the flames towards the lake, sending smoke billowing out across the water. It was like a special effects scene from a movie. They sat up late, watching the Casino burn to the ground.The title came to Glover the next morning, as he woke up in his hotel bedroom, but the other band members laughed it down – they said it sounded too druggy. But then Blackmore came up with a riff, that riff, on the spur of the moment, and they had the beginnings of a song.However, right now, their most pressing problem was finding somewhere – anywhere – to record. Mercifully, no one had been hurt, but the Casino was a smoking ruin. Nobs found a vacant theatre called The Pavillon, which seemed fine, but the sound-proofing was useless. They’d just started playing “Smoke on the Water” when the police arrived to shut them down. Luckily, the roadies kept them out, as the policemen hammered on the doors.There was only one thing wrong. There wasn’t quite enough material. They’d recorded six classic tracks, including “Lazy”, “Highway Star”, “Pictures of Home” and “Space Truckin’”, but it still came up a bit short for a full LP. Then they remembered the demo they’d recorded at The Pavillon, just before the Swiss police threw them out. And so belatedly, “Smoke on the Water” ended up on the LP, almost by accident. Today, it’s not only the most celebrated song on the album, but the most celebrated song they’ve ever played.Léon Francioli played Montreux in 1971 (Claude Nobs Archives)Yet even after it scraped onto the LP, “Smoke on the Water” still took a while to become a classic. The main single from the album was “Never Before”, which only reached number 35 in the UK singles chart and never became a live staple. Only in 1973, when “Smoke on the Water” was released as a single in the US and started getting airplay on American radio stations, did it finally begin to break through.But although “Smoke on the Water” has now acquired legendary stand-alone status, it still sits best amid the album for which it was intended, as track five (if you’re listening to it on a CD or some other rubbish modern format) or – far better – as the first track on side two, if you’re listening to the proper vinyl LP. It tells the story of the album, and that’s where it ought to stay.Deep purple: There are hellebores- and then there are Rodney Davey’sDeep Purple looks ready to rock old star DenmanDeep Purple made some fine LPs before and some fine LPs thereafter, but they never made anything quite as good as Machine Head. So what made it click? The tight timeframe was one factor – adversity was another. Far from home in the dead of winter, in a quiet resort in low season, there was an element of “all hands to the pump”\u0026nbspas everyone mucked in together.This no-nonsense attitude was reflected in the production. Sound engineer Martin Birch did a brilliant job. The sound he created was clean and sparse, never overly ornate or fussy. He gave each instrument room to breathe. There was very little overdubbing. It was such a palaver getting out of the hotel and into the mobile studio that they often didn’t bother listening to the playback. By modern standards, this was virtually a live album.Nobs died in 2013, after a skiing accident, aged 76. The Jazz Festival is his enduring testament (he also gets a shout-out as “Funky Claude”\u0026nbspin “Smoke on the Water”). The Casino was rebuilt on the same spot, but sadly they didn’t recreate the Belle Époque splendour of the original structure. The modern replacement is a Seventies eyesore. Just think: if it hadn’t been for that idiot with the roman candles, that beautiful building would still be there. But, then again, we’d have never heard “Smoke on the Water”.Montreux Jazz Festival runs\u0026nbspuntil 14 July and Deep Purple play on 4 July (mjf.ch)Smoke on the waterEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in rapturesThree hours of Public Enemy: that’s what I got when I let my son have his choice of music in the car recently. Amid his vast collection of Pokemon trading cards is a set featuring the members of Queens of the Stone Age. And one of my favourite moments as a dad was his overjoyed reaction when I told him I’d got us tickets for Metallica. He’s a music-loving father’s dream.\u0026nbspBut what’s good for the goose has to be good for the gander. Or the other way around. So when Taylor Swift announced that her reputation stadium tour was coming to Wembley, it was a case of fair’s fair. It was my daughter’s turn, even if it meant this Metallica Dad agreeing to a descent into musical purgatory on a Friday night instead of catching up with Game of Thrones.\u0026nbsp“On no, you’ll love it, you’ll have such a good time. I’m so jealous!”That was the response of a shockingly large number of female friends and acquaintances, many of whom volunteered to accompany my seven-year-old daughter Rheya\u0026nbspwhen I expressed trepidation at the prospect of an evening in the company of 100,000 screaming Swifties.\u0026nbspThe ersity of those it came from took me aback: people I just couldn’t imagine would be fans were saying it.\u0026nbspThere were culture vultures and rock fans. Twenty-somethings, thirty-somethings, and forty-somethings. Some with no children, others with a hatful, whose daughters, like mine, they were taking. I sometimes found myself saying, “what, you too?”Taylor Swift seems to hold a good chunk of the female population in her thrall. And not a few men too. Quite an achievement for a onetime country singer.\u0026nbspIt seems to be Swift’s particular way with words that has drawn them in. Nashville is renowned for its story tellers. But Swift’s stories have resonated with a far wider constituency than is usual for singers coming from out of that milieu. \u0026nbspRheyaAt her Wembley show, she likened what she does to the opening up her diary. The chronicling of the ups and downs of her love life, her biting back at bad boyfriends, her reflection on experiences many of those who count themselves her fans will have had, speaks to them.\u0026nbspSelina Mills, a writer friend of mine, and one of those who had me saying “what you too?”, says she serves up “emotional truths” with that diary.\u0026nbspAnother friend, Karen Attwood, who runs Nine Media Training, says: “She’s as good with an acoustic guitar as she is with a big pop anthem and I just love her lyrics. She is having a conversation they’re gorgeous, often very funny and sarcastic.”\u0026nbspIt never hurts if you can make ’em smile. Swift does it for her fans in the same way that a cutting rhyme from rapper Chuck D does it for me.

Right now, it’s them against us. This shit is ugly to the core. When it comes to the poor, no lives matter!” Now that’s the sort of the conversation I want to have.\u0026nbspFeeling suitably purged and, yes, a little self-righteous, I felt able to spend an afternoon in the company of Taylor. But after the first half hour I almost felt like saying “look what you made me do”\u0026nbspto Rheya. And my editors, because I didn’t find listening to her latest missive any easier than her fans might find sampling Slayer.\u0026nbspIt’s not that I can’t recognise a good pop song. Everyone has their guilty pleasures. But reputation’s hooks seemed swamped in a sea of expensive production. Here a backing singer trills, there a rapper rhymes, as the vocals tail off into electronic distortion. Meanwhile\u0026nbspSwift reflects on the trials and tribulations not so much of being a teenager, but of being an uber-famous member of the 1 per cent, a bona fide mega star, with the requisite stable of hip hop style feuds.\u0026nbsp1989, her first “official”\u0026nbsppop record, I found more approachable, and memorable. I confess, I already had some familiarity with that album on account of indie troubadour Ryan Adams covering the whole thing. He somehow managed to put a wistful and melancholy sheen on an upbeat and feisty pop record, widely recognised as the highpoint of her career to date. Moving further back, Nashville becomes progressively more noticeable, and Swift’s stories more innocent and easier to hear.\u0026nbspBut what about the show designed to showcase it all? If not the hottest ticket in town, it was certainly the priciest, part of an effort, it has been argued, to neutralise the scalpers who would have profited handsomely through gouging fans had Swift left money on the table.\u0026nbspI have to admit: a part of me was intrigued. I’ve been going to gigs for more than 30 years now (it makes me shudder to have to say that) and I’ve seen almost everything. Metal, indie, jazz, rap, soul, punk and more besides. I’ve been to decaying fleapit clubs, massive arenas, festivals and, yes, even great big stadia.\u0026nbspBut what I’d never experienced before my evening with Swift was one those bona fide pop mega tours the sort of thing featuring a cast of thousands, that takes several planes, and a fleet of trucks to move the thing from to venue to venue, and turns over the GDP of a small country.It was a world apart from the stadium shows I’ve previously been to. The Stone Roses, for example, needed only their songs, together with the odd inflatable ball bouncing up and down in the crowd, to make for a thoroughly memorable occasion last summer, one worth the price of tickets that weren’t exactly cheap themselves.\u0026nbspA Swift show, by contrast, majors as much on spectacle as it does on music. There were, at Wembley, enough huge snakes to send an ophidiophobic fan running for a\u0026nbsptherapist. Apparently their presence stems from an insult the Kardashian married to Kanye West lobbed at her, and they’ve since become something of a trademark. One’s probably pending.\u0026nbspThere was fire, and fireworks, and films. There was the obligatory army of dancers. Everyone was given a light bracelet on their way in, which seemed to change colours at the command of someone armed with an iPad backstage. The effect was actually rather pretty, if not exactly environmentally friendly.\u0026nbspThere was even a sort of floating cage of lights to ferry Swift between the three (count ’em) stages and, at the end, a bloke whom I’m reliably informed was once in One Direction, came on to perform a duet. Neither me nor my daughter were quite sure who he was, although his presence seemed to delight the crowd. \u0026nbspAs for Swift herself? Well, I’ll give her this. She is a star. The moment she strode on to the stage in a pair of sparkly hot pants, the first of about 300 different costumes, you could see that. The audience was in raptures.\u0026nbsp“Thank you for joining us on the reputation stadium tour,” she said. It was a line she repeated several times. I could almost hear the business manager whispering in her ear: “Don’t say anything that could be considered controversial, but make sure you reference the brand at least once every 15 minutes or so. It’s good for T-shirt sales.”In the middle of this assault on the senses I was again left wondering whether Swift isn’t in danger of losing that connection she has forged. But then, about halfway through, with her occupying stage number two, she produced an acoustic guitar and just sang. She did the same with a piano later on. It worked too. Whatever Swift is, she is no manufactured talent, incapable of surviving without studio trickery, and solely reliant on others to play the instruments. It made me wonder if all the extra stuff was really necessary.\u0026nbspThe reputation\u0026nbspalbum may not have done the business 1989 did, and Swift may have strained her connection with some, but her still loyal fans lapped up everything she did.\u0026nbspCrucially, so did my daughter. All my criticisms started to pale before her sheer unabashed joy. It would have made any parent melt, and the zone of protection I thought I’d established by wearing my Metallica tour T-shirt, with a suitably gruesome design, was breached. In a world that seems to grow grimmer by the day, I couldn’t help but be uplifted at my child’s innocent delight. I even found myself enjoying myself, if vicariously.\u0026nbspAttwood says part of Swift’s appeal, as a parent, is that “among all the hyper sexualised pop stars she is a fantastic role model for my daughter”.\u0026nbspTaylor Swift brings Robbie Williams on stage to sing ‘Angels’ Taylor Swift launches UK ‘reputation’ tour in ManchesterTaylor Swift marks Pride Month with heartfelt speech in ChicagoIs Taylor Swift off-loading her Beverly Hills property portfolio?And I get that. Even though with all that branding it sometimes seems as if she’s as much CEO as she is musician, she is, to quote Janet Jackson, in control.I don’t think Taylor will be troubling my speakers in future, but this Metallica Dad was able to make an accommodation with her.There is a postscript that may amuse you. Since getting one of those Amazon Echo Dots, my chip-off-the-old-block son has been constantly playing what he tells me are Geometry Dash composers. They play electronic video game music that leaves me cold.My daughter, meanwhile, has developed an obsession with Metallica’s Master of Puppets, to the extent that sometimes she’s even had me saying “can’t we have something else on?”.\u0026nbspIt means I might have to enjoy our next live experience vicariously.

It was\u0026nbspvery orderly\u0026nbspand professional\u0026nbspbut there was a level of chaos to the amount of layers we had to achieve to really be able to put the Oasis on the screen. I had to go back and forth from the actors to the V Camp tent maybe seven or eight times a day, then to the editing room to see how this was all cutting in, and then outside to shoot the live-action portions of the film. I\u0027ve never really had to make four movies at the same time before.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

And just as indigenous people in the Americas were displaced by European colonists, the same is true of their dogs.”In their paper, published in the journal Science, the researchers compared genetic information from dozens of ancient North American and Siberian dogs ning a period of 9,000 years.Their analysis showed the dogs persisted for a long time but ultimately vanished, which to Dr Laurent Frantz from Queen Mary University of London said\u0026nbspsuggests “something catastrophic must have happened”.Science news in picturesScientists have witnessed the birth of a planet for the first time ever. 224 New human organ discovered that was previously missed by scientistsLayers long thought to be dense, connective tissue are actually a series of fluid-filled compartments researchers have termed the “interstitium”. 324 Previously unknown society lived in Amazon rainforest before Europeans arrived, say archaeologistsWorking in the Brazilian state of Mato Grosso, a team led by archaeologists at the University of Exeter unearthed hundreds of villages hidden in the depths of the rainforest. 424 One in 10 people have traces of cocaine or heroin on fingerprints, study findsMore than one in 10 people were found to have traces of class A drugs on their fingers by scientists developing a new fingerprint-based drug test.524 Nasa releases stunning images of Jupiter\u0027s great red spotThe storm bigger than the Earth, has been swhirling for 350 years.

The scientists tracked a star about as big as our sun as it was pulled from its normal path and into that of a supermassive black hole before being eaten up. They then saw a high-speed flare get thrust out, escaping from the rim of the black hole. Scientists have seen black holes killing and swallowing stars.

The fragment of jaw bone provides evidence of an east-west ide in the evolution of dinosaurs on the North American continent. During the Late Cretaceous period, 66 to 100 million years ago, the land mass was split into two continents by a shallow sea. This sea, the Western Interior Seaway, ran from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. Dinosaurs living in the western continent, called Laramidia, were similar to those found in Asia1824 \u0027Male and female brains\u0027 aren\u0027t realBrains cannot be categorised into female and male, according to the first study to look at sex differences in the whole brain. Specific parts of the brain do show sex differences, but inidual brains rarely have all “male” traits or all “female” traits. Some characteristics are more common in women, while some are more common in men, and some are common in both men and women, according to the study1924 Life on Earth appeared hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thoughtLife may have come to earth 4.1 billion years ago, hundreds of millions of years earlier than we knew. The discovery, made using graphite that was trapped in ancient crystals, could mean that life began almost instantaneously after the Earth was formed. The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said.

The researchers behind it have described the discovery as “a potentially transformational scientific advance”. Previously, life on Earth was understood to have begun when the inner solar system was hit by a massive bombardment from space, which also formed the moon\u0027s cratersNasa has announced that it has found evidence of flowing water on Mars. Scientists have long speculated that Recurring Slope Lineae — or dark patches — on Mars were made up of briny water but the new findings prove that those patches are caused by liquid water, which it has established by finding hydrated salts.2124 Earth could be at risk of meteor impactsEarth could be in danger as our galaxy throws out comets that could hurtle towards us and wipe us out, scientists have warned. Scientists have previously presumed that we are in a relatively safe period for meteor impacts, which are linked with the journey of our sun and its planets, including Earth, through the Milky Way. But some orbits might be more upset than we know, and there is evidence of recent activity, which could mean that we are passing through another meteor shower. Showers of meteors periodically pass through the area where the Earth is, as gravitational disturbances upset the Oort Cloud, which is a shell of icy objects on the edge of the solar system. They happen on a 26-million year cycle, scientists have said, which coincide with mass extinctions over the last 260-million yearsChinese scientists have created genetically-engineered, extra-muscular dogs, after editing the genes of the animals for the first time. The scientists create beagles that have double the amount of muscle mass by deleting a certain gene, reports the MIT Technology Review. The mutant dogs have “more muscles and are expected to have stronger running ability, which is good for hunting, police (military) applications”, Liangxue Lai, one of the researchers on the project. Now the team hope to go on to create other modified dogs, including those that are engineered to have human diseases like muscular dystrophy or Parkinson’s. Since dogs’ anatomy is similar to those of humans’, intentionally creating dogs with certain human genetic traits could allow scientists to further understand how they occur2324 Researchers discover \u0027lost world\u0027 of arctic dinosaursScientists say that the new dinosaur, known as Ugrunaaluk kuukpikensis, “challenges everything we thought about a dinosaur’s physiology”. Florida State University professor of biological science Greg Erickson said: “It creates this natural question. How did they survive up here?”2424 A team of filmmakers in the US have made the first ever scale model of the Solar System in a Nevada desertIllustrations of the Earth and moon show the two to be quite close together, Mr Overstreet said. This is inaccurate, the reason being that these images are not to scale.“It is fascinating that a population of dogs that inhabited many parts of the Americas for thousands of years, and that was an integral part of so many Native American cultures, could have disappeared so rapidly,” said Dr Frantz, who was also a senior author of the study.Today, few modern dogs possess any genetic traces of the ancient breeds.The researchers suggested the dogs’ near-total disappearance from the region was likely a result of both disease and cultural changes brought over by Europeans.It is possible, for example, that European colonists discouraged the sale and breeding of the dogs kept by indigenous Americans.“It is known how indigenous peoples of the Americas suffered from the genocidal practices of European colonists after contact,” said Kelsey Witt, who led part of the genome work as a graduate student at the University of Illinois.\u0026nbsp“What we found is that the dogs of indigenous peoples experienced an even more devastating history and a near-total loss, possibly as a result of forced cultural changes and disease.”Bizarrely, one of the only traces of genetic information from “pre-contact” dogs can be found in a transmissible tumour that spreads between dogs known as CTVT.\u0026nbspIt’s quite incredible to think that possibly the only survivor of a lost dog lineage is a tumour that can spread between dogs as an infection,” added Maire Ní Leathlobhair, co-first author, from the University of Cambridge.\u0026nbsp“Although this cancer’s DNA has mutated over the years, it is still essentially the DNA of that original founder dog from many thousands of years ago.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

As well as being a huge drain on water supplies they can add to water bills and take hours to fill,” said Trewin Restorick, CEO of Hubbub.Polling conducted by the group found that a third of households in the UK own a paddling pool, and 27 per cent intend to fill it up over the weekend, as temperatures across the country once again exceed 30C.UK weather: Temperatures soar as heatwave intensifiesPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonPeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in BrightonPeople enjoying the hot weather and sunshine on the banks of the River Thames in PutneySpectators enjoy the hot weather during day seven of the Nature Valley International at Devonshire ParkHot and sunny day in Hyde Park\u0027s Serpentine lakePeople relax in the warm weather on the beach in EastbournePeople sunbathe as they enjoy the warm weather on Bournemouth beachA person sunbathes on a blow up mattress in the sea off of Bournemouth beach in DorsetA couple relax in the sunshine on the beach in BrightonPeople play in water fountains in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in east LondoChris Bryant from Basingstoke paddle boards at Boscombe Beach in DorsetPeople shelter from the sun beneath umbrellas as they walk in St James\u0027s Park in LondonArianna Espiritu Kelly, 2, eats an ice-cream in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park Victor the Polar Bear enjoys a dip in the water at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People on the beach in BrightonWoman relax in the sunshine on the beach in Hastings, SussexPeople enjoy their lunch break in the sunshine near Tower Bridge in LondonPolice horses drink from a water fountain during the hot weather in Green ParkAnglers fish on New Brighton beach on the Wirral, Merseyside as the sun rises over the Port of Liverpool and the River MerseyA family of lemurs enjoy an ice lolly at Yorkshire Wildlife Park People enjoy the sunshine in St James\u0027s Park in in LondonA duck swims in the algae covered lake in St James\u0027s Park, LondonA couple cycle in the sunshine around Bewl Water in KentA man takes a break in the sun on Southbank, LondonThough Hubbub urged people to be conservative with their pool use, they offered some tactics that will prevent excessive water waste.Among their suggestions were sharing pools among friends and families, using water sterilising tablets instead of refilling every day\u0026nbspand reusing the water to keep the garden hydrated or to wash the car.They also recommended taking quicker showers or avoiding washing the car if people have a weekend of paddling pool fun ahead of them.“No one wants to be a killjoy – it’s really hot and we’re all looking for ways to keep cool and have fun in the sun,” said Mr Restorick.The warning comes as throughout the UK the sustained period of high temperatures plays havoc with the nation’s agriculture and wildlife.Hot weather has sparked concerns among British farmers, who are worried about crops ripening too early and the knock-on effects on milk production and winter food supplies for animals.Britain’s animals are also under pressure, especially those that rely on damp habitats, and wildlife groups have called on the public to\u0026nbsphelp by providing water sources and maintaining damp habitats.Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

The Central Bank of Venezuela, which did not immediately respond to request for comment, has not independently released inflation figures in at least a year.\u0026nbspVenezuelan president, Nicolas Maduro, has passed blame for the roiled economy onto others, including opposition activists and officials in Washington. At a campaign rally in May, he blamed hyperinflation on criminal mafias.But economists point out that Mr Maduro runs the unorthodox policies they say have pushed the country into economic crisis. The socialist leader has repeatedly refused international aid to Venezuela.It\u0027s internal, Professor Hanke said. Government spending continues to accelerate and the sources of revenue start drying up.The government has defaulted on a majority of their outstanding bonds, which economists estimate add up to about $60 billion (£45 million). Foreign exchange reserves have fallen by about $2.5 billion ($1.9 million) in the last three months, according to analysis by Capital Economics.\u0026nbspAs state-run oil industry PDVSA falls apart, economists say a rise in global oil prices is adding to the pain. Brent crude oil is up more than 64 percent this year. And as President Donald Trump cracks down on Iran via zero-tolerance oil sanctions, the international benchmark has rallied more than 8 percent\u0026nbspthis week.Production at PDVSA\u0026nbsp- which accounts for 95 percent of export earnings in the country and a quarter of gross domestic product - was cut in half from January 2016 to January 2018, according to the US Energy Information Administration. And as the crisis deepens, operations are continuing to wane.Those conditions, Professor Hanke said, have all but killed investor sentiment.\u0026nbspThere\u0027s an expectation part of it, too, Professor Hanke added. Everyone who has a bolivar wants to get rid of it like a hot potato because they expect it\u0027s not going to be worth anything tomorrow.The International Monetary Fund estimated in January that Venezuela\u0027s inflation rate could rise as high as 13,000 percent for all of 2018. Professor Hanke was unsurprised by the discrepancy, saying no one can accurately forecast the course or the duration of a hyperinflation.In pictures: The crisis in VenezuelaA girl scavanges for food in the streets of CaracasA man scavenges for food next to girls in the streets of Caracas.

A recent university study found that about 90 percent of civilians were living in poverty last year and most of those surveyed had lost an average of 25 pounds in body weight.\u0026nbspThe hyperinflation is devastating the economy, said Andres Abadia, a senior economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. He expects the economy to contract in 2018, for a fifth consecutive year, and sees no turnaround in the near-term.Mr Abadia said Venezuela is a disaster area and that as long as Mr Maduro is in power, the economy will continue to collapse. But Mr Maduro reaffirmed his\u0026nbsptight grip on power last month, easily winning\u0026nbspanother six-year term in what was widely condemned as a fraudulent election.\u0026nbspMr Maduro tripled wages earlier in June to 3 million bolivars per month, which Reuters reported at the time was equal to just more than a dollar at the black-market exchange rate.When asked if the wage increase might improve living conditions in Venezuela, Professor Hanke replied: No, it\u0027s a joke.

May\u0027s Brexit plan to align UK with EU could JEOPARDISE US trade deal                Tory Brexiteer presents \u0027simple choice\u0027 Theresa May must make on tradeThe Prime Minister is under increasing pressure from EU officials, companies and some lawmakers to move faster with the negotiations to leave the EU, a departure that will be Britain\u0027s biggest trading and foreign policy shift in half a century.The new plan would see Britain closely mirror EU rules, use technology to determine where goods will end up and therefore which tariffs should be applied, and hand Britain the freedom to set its own tariffs on incoming goods.Aides suggest it offers the best of both worlds. A spokeswoman for Mrs May dismissed concerns the proposal would prevent Britain from striking trade deals with countries outside the EU.She said: It is categorically untrue to suggest that we will not be able to strike a trade deal with the US.The PM has always been clear that we will seek a comprehensive and ambitious trade deal with the US.Today\u0027s meeting will not be plain sailing. Mrs May\u0027s Brexit minister, David Davis, has sent her a letter describing the plan as unworkable, a source close to him said.Brexit latest: David Davis and Brexiteer ministers have held a private meeting ahead of ChequersThose wanting a clean break from the EU fear being kept in the EU\u0027s customs sphere, seeing it as a betrayal of Brexit that would curtail Britain\u0027s freedom to negotiate deals with non-EU countries.Tory MP Owen Paterson said: We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.Business minister Greg Clark said he was confident ministers would reach an agreement on future customs plans, with the government focused on supporting jobs.Even if she finds agreement at home, Mrs May still faces the hard task of winning the support of the EU, which poured cold water on her previous suggestions for customs arrangements.Today Mrs May met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and restated her wish to negotiate a deep trade and security partnership after Brexit, her spokesman said.Mrs Merkel again stressed it was the European Commission leading the Brexit negotiations, rather than member states. That may have dampened Mrs May\u0027s hope of winning support from Germany before the Chequers meeting.David Davis meets EU\u0027s chief negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels ahead of a crunch meeting of European Union leaders later this week                    AFPGetty Images1 of 10British Brexit minister David Davis (L) and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier meet at the European Commission in BrusselsWith the clock ticking towards a March departure date and passions running high, Mrs May needs to thrash out an agreement with Brussels urgently.Mrs May was forced to ditch her preferred option for a customs partnership, which would have seen Britain collecting tariffs on goods entering the country on the EU\u0027s behalf, under pressure from Brexit campaigners in her government.They had backed a streamlined customs arrangement now known as max fac, which would see trusted traders allowed to cross borders freely with the aid of automated technology.The facilitated customs arrangement is described by her aides as a way to use the best bits of both options.Mrs May\u0027s plan suggests there will be a type of customs union for physical goods, something that should please manufacturers. But based on the detail offered so far, there is little on how Britain\u0027s much larger services sector would trade with the EU.Several ministers suggested they would read over the plan later on Thursday, ready for a meeting which is expected to run late into the evening. Health minister Jeremy Hunt called for the cabinet to get behind our prime minister.Hours before ministers began the journey to Chequers, a 16th-century manor house 40 miles (60km) northwest of London, businesses issued warnings of what impact their decisions could have.Britain\u0027s biggest carmaker Jaguar Land Rover said a chaotic Brexit would cost it \u0026pound1.2 billion ($1.59 billion) a year, curtailing operations in the United Kingdom, while the retail industry said a no deal might see food rotting at ports.Britain\u0027s biggest union Unite attacked government failure to make progress in negotiations so far.General secretary Len McCluskey said in a statement: \u0026ldquoDrop your red lines and secure a decent deal, one that is to the benefit of the working people of this country."},{"url":"https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/41/183x122/984714_1.jpg","title":"Theresa May Balkans summit London UK leading role Balkan EU accession European Union","story":"The Foreign Affairs Committee (FAC) called on the Prime Minister to aid the Balkan nations in their quest for EU membership and urged the Government to develop a \u0026ldquocredible and independent 10-year plan of action for its relationship with the nations in light of continued pressure from Russia.Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the FAC, commented on the issue, stating: The Western Balkans have come a long way since the 1990s, when the region was engulfed in violence.\u0026ldquoBut the Western Balkans Six have further to go if they are to qualify for EU membership.\u0026ldquoOpposition from some countries around the world will harm their interests and those of neighbouring EU states.

Not Piers, who went on to issue a further challenge: “On Thursday night, you can watch England destroy Belgium, then watch me destroy Love Island straight after.”So I did. No further comment is needed on the first bit of Piers’ equation. But, hell on TV earth, I can’t ignore the second.A “one-off special” called Good Evening Britain which attempted to cash in on the breakfast magic and must have seemed like a great idea until England v Belgium became a loser-takes-all non-event, the wardrobe department shoved Susanna Reid into a Spanish Flamenco dancer’s outfit and someone lost control of the guest list.’Cos all of the pre-publicity for this one assured me there’d be just three present: Danny Dyer, the Labour Party leader and a slightly spooked Pamela Anderson, who set the first alarm ringing by claiming: “When they told me Jeremy Corbyn’s going to be here I thought this was going to be a serious political ­programme.”Why the hell a dissembling old fool like Corbyn would make anyone think that is a bit of a mystery, but ­serious was the last word you’d use to describe Good Evening Britain.They weren’t alone either. The joint was jumping, in fact, with David Ginola, Amir Khan, Ed Balls, Tory MP James Cleverly, Harry Redknapp, BGT comic Daliso Chaponda and live feeds from a reporter in Russia and Andi Peters at Emmerdale’s Woolpack pub.As GEB quickly demonstrated, of course, the reason chat shows don’t invite nine guests to appear is that you instantly have nine chaotic voices clamouring for attention and often talking at cross-purposes.All it then takes is one guest to throw a spanner in the works and the whole vibe collapses, as it duly did when Piers and Susanna started asking Pammie about her French footballer boyfriend, Adil Rami, who she claimed was “doing really well”.Susanna: “He’s not played yet.” I haven’t been watching, I’ve been looking after my father who’s just had a stroke.” When someone drops a bombshell like that, clearly, you need to steer the conversation away pretty sharpish which, in fairness, Piers did by asking Amir Khan: “Do you have a sex ban before fights?”Only with his wife, I’d imagine, Piers, but thanks for asking. It set the perfectly awkward tone for the entire evening. For GEB to be classed as a true TV disaster, though, it still needed three other things to happen.The first were technical glitches, which duly arrived when the satellite link to a bunch of drunk England fans went down. The second was Andi Peters referring to Emmerdale as “Coronation Street”. Check.The third and most important, however, was for one of the guests to get a bit sweary and lairy. Enter Danny Dyer who ensured GEB will enter TV folklore, when he launched into Brexit, asking: “What’s happened to that t**t David Cameron? He’s in Nice with his trotters up. He should be held to account for it . . . t**t.”The far more pertinent bit of his ­contribution, though, was the moment he addressed the host: “Just stop talking, Piers. Just talkin’ talkin’, ramblin’ on.”Breakfast TV would be a hopelessly dull, molly-coddling chore again without Piers’ ego and all his boastful predictions, which just for the record, ended with the following score, on Thursday.Good Evening Britain — 2.91million viewers. Love Island — 3.2million. Boom.Martin Keown: “When you play in midfield you’ve got to have legs.”Guy Mowbray: “We haven’t seen anything of Di Maria in Argentina’s first three games. Although he only played in two of them.”Alan Shearer: “Portugal were very much like Portugal.”And Lee Dixon: “We’ve had five balls that have gone flat. Three times that’s happened.”(Compiled by Graham Wray).WHATEVER our differences elsewhere, I hope there’s one thing on which we’re all agreed.The greatest quiz show in television history is Bullseye.An opinion confirmed when I tapped those magic eight letters into my Sky Planner’s search engine last week, and its back catalogue unfurled before me, including episode one of series one, which, for a TV critic, is like finding the source of the Nile.I don’t expect you to watch every episode, obviously, but if you have time for one, make it episode eight of series two. It’s as funny, heart-warming and brilliantly formatted as you remember. But the most remarkable thing is, hardly any of it would now be considered fit for broadcast.For not only is Jocky Wilson smoking a fag as he attempts the 301 or more challenge, Jim Bowen, can’t help drawing attention to a facial scar on a contestant’s face.“You’ve obviously had an accident, tell us how.” “I was 11 years old, it was a petrol can blew up on a building site.” “Lovely to be able to talk about that, smashing.”Broadsheet newspaper columnists, right-on comedians and other handbag-clasping s of the nation’s morals will, of course, say: “Well thank goodness we’ve moved on since then.” Which is precisely the reason none of them will ever create a show as beautiful as Bullseye or say anything remotely as funny as the bellowing climax to the prize board, on show eight.Bully’s special prize?“What every woman dreams of. A full-length Scandinavian mink coat.”RANDOM TV irritations: Jeremy Corbyn’s insanely annoying habit of giving a triumphant little sniff every time he thinks he’s made a good point.BBC presenters turning Aneurin Bevan into the L Ron Hubbard of their NHS cult. News ­reporters describing everything that’s happened quite a lot as being: “On an industrial scale.”Over-familiar BBC continuity announcers suddenly greeting me with a: “Hi, I’m Russell.” (Don’t care.) And a bite massage therapist from Hollywood called Doctor Dot failing to provide the necessary health and safety warning before she told This Morning’s Eamonn Holmes: “Ruth’s going to be biting you tonight.”’Cos she’d have bitten off more than she could chew if she did.The Chase USA, Brooke Burns: “Alphabetically, what day of the week comes first?” Andy: “Tuesday.”The Chase Australia, Andrew O’Keefe: “In which decade of the 19th Century was the Crimean War fought?”Simon: “The 1950s.”Andrew O’Keefe: “TV series Twin Peaks is set in which fictional town?”Dan: “Transylvania.”“No, Twin Peaks.” NHS cultists gathered last week to applaud, grovel, sing, dance and grin like madmen in its honour.I exaggerate a bit, obviously. The singing and dancing doesn’t begin until tomorrow night on ITV.It was still an unsettling experience though, watching BBC2’s NHS At 70: Live, from The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in Birmingham, hosted by Anita Rani a level eight cultist from The One Show, Nick Robinson and Helen Skelton, who was in the maternity unit warning that we may “hear screaming”.As well as the massed ranks of staff, there were also NHS bigwigs and former patients who were encouraged to stand, clap and thank nurses, doctors, ambulancemen, chemists, the woman on reception, everyone.The nasty suspicion is, of course, that all this BBC worship, which makes Kim Jong-un’s birthday celebrations look really half-ar*ed, carries a political edge and is designed to shut down every single argument apart from the ones that say:A)The NHS needs more money. Or B) the NHS needs a s***load more money.As righteous as it might make them all feel, however, deep down they know it makes for wretchedly dull television.Hence the presence, on this one, of Britain’s Got Talent winner Lost Voice Guy, who not even the resuscitation unit could help with gags like: “Laughter is the best medicine. So instead of going to hospital when you crack your head open you will be prescribed tickets to go and see Russell Brand . . .”AAAAAAAAARRGH!The Chase, Bradley Walsh: “In 2017 which Hollywood star was made a dame at the age of 100?”Will: “Joan Collins.” Oof.King Kylian Mbappe taking the World Cup by the scruff of the neck with France’s thrilling 4-3 victory over Argentina.The Sky Planner’s damningly accurate verdict on Bear’s Mission With Warwick Davis: “Contains scenes of moderate peril.”Love Island narrator Iain Stirling breaking into a water fight discussion to announce: “God I’m lonely.” And the magnificent Laura going all Malcolm Tucker on Wes after he admitted he wanted to “crack on with Megan”.“Do me a favour then, f*** off.” Truly, hell hath no fury like a Scottish woman scorned.GOOD Morning Britain, Wednesday,  rent-a-gob Afua “problematic” Hirsch says: “I am English, but why do I feel uncomfortable ­answering that question?”Because if you ever stopped playing the professional victim and admitted this great liberal democracy had afforded you all the most ­extraordinary privileges in life, including an ­expensive private education, you’d swiftly have no point, purpose, job or income, obviously.ON Monday’s This Morning, the arrival of “Britain’s Sexiest Cow”, a Jersey milker called Char, prompted the obvious Schofield question: “What was the competition?”Two Friesians, an English Longhorn and Naomi Campbell, I’d imagine.THIS week’s winner is Simon Cowell and a Hawaiian feather god from the Royal Academy’s forthcoming Oceania exhibition, which you’ve probably booked already.Emailed in by Spud, of London.Picture research: Amy Reading.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

But they do.Remarkably, one in 20 British nurseries is banning superhero costumes because they believe these colourful outfits are making our children aggressive.This attempted taming of tots doesn’t stop there though.Four in five nurseries won’t allow any weapons — whether they are plastic pirate ­cutlasses or harmless pop guns.This is totally wrong.When I was with my mates on the school yard or messing about on building sites I ­pretended to be Superman or ­a soldier, replaying what I had seen in John Wayne war films.These games teach you vital lessons that you will carry on into later life, like I did with the military.There is kinship, holding your own and negotiating with the kid who is getting a bit rowdy.I learned right and wrong, how to ­interact with others and when I was ­stepping out of line.But it didn’t make me think: “I want to join the Army and kill everyone.” ­Everyone plays those games, and some become accountants.I certainly allowed my daughter to play “fighting” and there is no evidence such activities make people more violent.When kids get out their toy swords or bows there is laughter and joy.This is about the normal competitive urge. Whether it’s sport, watching The X Factor or wishing to be top in your class, there is a desire to win.It is wrong to pretend ­otherwise, because when these kids enter the real world of work they will face a very ­competitive atmosphere.If you don’t fight to get to the top, you will go under.We can’t all be soft and cuddly. ­Societies need people with different talents and attitudes.There is a clear antipathy towards the armed services as a career in these ­nursery bans.Britain is struggling to find new recruits at the moment, and the last thing we need is children growing up believing this is a bad choice.Being a soldier, sailor or part of the RAF are valid ­professions. We need these real-life superheroes.My daughter considered ­joining the Armed Forces. She looked into the idea of a ­military scholarship when she was 18.I was all for that, but in the end she decided upon ­something else.There is an idea that these games are just for boys, but girls want to be involved as well.Warfare is part of our genetic make up.It has been like this since the time of hunter-gatherers who had to defend their food sources — first their hunting grounds then later, when we became farmers, our lands.The reason we have been so successful as a species is the ability to defend ­ourselves.Back in medieval times kids would play with wooden swords and it was once ­obligatory for all males aged over 14 to practise the longbow on Sundays.We all go “ahhh” when we see puppies or kittens tussling and rolling about with their siblings, but what they are doing is learning to defend themselves.The idea that stopping any gameplay which involves ­fighting is going to change hundreds of thousands of years of human development is ­nonsensical.The complaint that toy weapons fuel a chaotic atmosphere in our nurseries is nothing more than a sign of laziness among the employers and employees.They are taking the easy route by simply banning lively games. This is more about making life easier for the staff than it is about helping our kids. They just want the ­children sitting there passively, possibly watching television or playing on a tablet.That is not what young ­children are about. They have a huge amount of energy to burn, and it is wrong to corral them into increasingly sedate life-styles.We have enough problems with obesity without demanding the next generation sit quietly all day long.The truth is that children will use up calories when they run around pretending to be in Star Wars or The Incredibles.The staff shouldn’t be bringing their own political ideas into the playground. They shouldn’t be making the children conform to what they think. Instead they should be focusing on ­fostering the imaginations of children by allowing them to explore these ideas.Steve Jobs, who helped to bring the iPhone and the iPad to the world, was inspired by Star Trek, and there were quite a few people getting zapped on that.By allowing children to play cops and robbers or pirates or cowboys or superheroes they are developing storytelling skills which will be vital in their ­education.Do we want them to come to read ­William Shakespeare with no prior ­knowledge of what conflict is?Any writer will tell you great storytelling needs drama and to have drama you need conflict.Going back as far as Greek literature there was greed, envy and jealousy underpinning the narrative. These nurseries fail to recognise the quality of the gameplay generated by young minds.They should be harnessing the roleplay and getting involved. The staff could ask why one person is always the baddie and what the kids enjoy about being the goodie.Superhero movies always contain a ­positive moral tale that children can learn from. There is good, there is evil, there is a recognition that someone has acted wrongly and they explore ways to improve our behaviour.When kids play cops and robbers, it is the police who win.The baddie always gets their comeuppance and the cops are the smarter ones.It’s not about arming our children with guns, it’s about arming them with the tools they need to be more creative.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Across the continent millions are sick of having no control over the numbers entering their country.Theresa May must not forget it.When her Remainer Business Secretary Greg Clark says we must maintain free movement of workers, that is NOT control. “Free movement” is the giveaway.If our Government cannot regulate the flow, it will have failed on immigration.THE police and CPS should be ashamed of the shocking ordeal to which they subjected innocent Richard Holden.There was no credible evidence to support the groping claim against the ex-Westminster special adviser.But they put him through 15 months of torture which wrecked his life and career.Their case fell to bits and a bemused jury cleared him in minutes.The CPS and police have a disgraceful recent record for trying to prosecute the flimsiest of sex cases.Even so, how did this one ever get before a judge? Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She was with a tall crew-mate. They were both drinking vodka straight out of the bottle and talking quite loudly.I left them there to go and watch Englands World Cup match at Le Grotte, a bar near the quayside. It is the one all the crews favour. I did not see Rebecca there, though it was quite crowded.I invited her and her colleague to join me and a member of my crew to the Jacuzzi on our sundeck. She said something about a great result for England, but wasnt making a lot of sense otherwise.She was still drinking vodka but could only manage three sips or so. I had to help her down from the sundeck when she left around midnight.Her colleague stayed behind. I got her off the boat OK, and helped her onto her own gangway. I could not go on with her because it was private.Rebecca was very unsteady on her feet. The last I saw of her was when she entered the doors to the ship. It is very sad.Earlier reports that she had left the boat to visit the local bar were incorrect, according to a crew member who said she watched the game aboard the Polonia.The Maltese-registered vessel had arrived at the Italian port last week and was undergoing a changeover ahead of a new arrival.Crew members raised the alarm in the morning when she failed to turn up for breakfast and found her lifeless in her cabin.Colonel Pier Enrico Burri, of the Imperia Carabinieri, yesterday told The Sun Online: The cause of death is still unknown but it seems as though she may have stumbled or slipped inside her cabin and hit her head or neck hard, breaking her vertebrae.She seems to have died between 12pm and 1am and her body was found about 8am. An Italian member of crew rang to alert us.The body was on the floor. The cabin was single, she slept there alone and very small as they are on boats. Her suitcases were on the floor as though she were rearranging things.She may have hit her head on the door of the cabin or while getting her suitcase down. These cabins are very constrained.He added: There was no blood and no traces of violence or other people. It seems as if no one else was on board when she died.The autopsy has to be done still but it looks like an accident.And Matteo Andracco, the lawyer representing the boats owners, said the boats chief engineer heard her alarm go off about 6.30am.After a few minutes when she didnt turn it off he went in and saw she was not moving, so they called an ambulance. In her room there were two levels, a lower level with the bed and an upper level with a small bathroom.It seems likely she fell down the five or six steps between the levels. So far nobody is under investigation. Police believe it was just an unlucky accident.Neighbours of Rebeccas, in Londons trendy Notting Hill, paid tribute to her, saying she was a genuinely nice person who always said hello.One, called Chris, said: She never caused any trouble here. She kept herself to herself, but always said hello to me and my kids.He added: Its genuinely shocking to hear, she was so young. Its always the nice ones it happens to. I hope for the family gets this sorted out soon."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418359725.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"uk heatwave river teme photos dries up","story":"The River Teme has all but disappeared in the space of a few days — leading to a mission to rescue hundreds of fish.Environment Agency workers lifted more than 500 salmon and trout from remaining small pockets of water this week before they vanished in the scorching sun.There are fears that continuous dry weather expected over the coming days — expected to beat the record hot spell of 1976 — could cause similar problems with the Upper River Wye also currently at a low level.The government has asked for the public to conserve more water and take no longer than four minutes in the shower.A hosepipe ban has also been enforced in Northern Ireland amid record temperatures, with Belfast recording 29.5C this week."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT0004183837411.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meghan markle prince harry jewellery commonwealth event marlborough house","story":"The royal couple, who tied the knot on May 19, were photographed hand-in-hand as they walked towards Londons Marlborough House.The Duchess of Sussex, 36, seemed to have left her jewellery at home and was just wearing a pair of stud earrings, her engagement ring and wedding ring.But the former Suits actress still looked glamorous in a yellow dress which was designed by Lady Gagas stylist, Brandon Maxwell.She had her hair in a bun for the event which was hosted by Commonwealth Secretary-General Baroness Scotland.Prior the event, royal fans had been speculating that the pair had stopped holding hands in public after Harry appeared to rebuff her attempts last week.Before their wedding in Windsor, Berks, the couple were always openly affectionate in public, possibly more so than other royal couple.But last week Meghan moved her hand in her husband’s direction at the Young Leaders Reception at Buckingham Palace - but he quickly clasped his hands away from her.It soon emerged that Harry, 33, was following traditional etiquette.Body language expert Robin Kermode previously told the MailOnline: “The Queen rarely holds hands with her husband in public and this seems to have set an unwritten precedent for the other royals.”Harrys brother Prince William typically avoids holding hands with the Duchess of Cambridge during official visits.But it seems they are not following traditional etiquette as they were seen holding hands at the Your Commonwealth Youth Challenge reception on Thursday afternoon.It marks the culmination of the Commonwealth Secretariats youth leadership workshop.The workshop brings together the newly-elected Commonwealth Youth Council Executive and leaders of the Commonwealth youth networks.It aims to encourage them to think about the future, and their role in shaping it.The royal couple will meet those who have taken part to hear about their ideas, including individuals from Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga ahead of their tour to the region this autumn."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000341886711.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"britains traffic set to soar by 30 thanks to enormous rise in vans on the road delivering online shopping","story":"The online shopping boom was yesterday predicted by the Department of Transport to see the miles driven by lights good vehicles soar between now and 2040.Official figures revealed Brits drove 327.1BILLION miles in 2017 – a new all-time high.

and could quit if they fail.The whole Cabinet is staging a 12-hour meeting at Chequers, the PMs country home, to decide on the UKs negotiating stance.Ministers have had their phones taken off them so they cant leak any details or appeal for support from aides and allies.And theyve been warned that if they do end up quitting, they wont be able to get home in their ministerial cars - meaning theyll have to call a taxi instead, or walk miles to the nearest train station.Brexiteer MPs have offered to give them a lift if they do quit - backbencher Peter Bone said: I will be on my way with my car, 4 seats available, guess another couple of cars will be required!Downing Street chiefs hope the PM can emerge late tonight with a fully formed Brexit plan - avoiding the constant sniping which has marked the process so far.Mrs May has angered Brexit backers by proposing a plan which would tie us closely to Brussels rules in a bid to keep trade flowing freely.Half a dozen Eurosceptic ministers held a separate meeting last night to hammer out their own stance.They will tell the PM she must keep Britain free to set our own rules on goods - or risk losing out on a bumper trade deal with the US.Jacob Rees-Mogg, who leads a group of Brexiteer backbenchers, said the proposed plan is not Brexit and urged the Cabinet to reject it.Mrs May is braced for senior figures such as Boris Johnson and David Davis to walk out if she cant talk them round.Number 10 has reportedly drawn up plans for an emergency reshuffle so the big beasts can be rapidly replaced if they do resign - with pro-Brexit junior ministers called in to meet the PM, in case they need to be suddenly promoted.But in a boost for the PM, its claimed Boris met David Cameron last night - and the former Prime Minister convinced him he has to back Mrs May.The PM also won round Trade Secretary Liam Fox, a passionate Brexiteer, by holding one-on-one talks with him in Downing Street after his meeting with the other pro-Leave ministers.The other Brexiteers who are still on the fence include Michael Gove, Penny Mordaunt, Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom.Mrs Mays de facto deputy David Lidington was sent out to bat for her this morning to persuade wavering ministers they should pledge support.He told the BBCs Today programme: What the PM is wanting to do today is to have a package of proposals that delivers on the referendum vote.We need to do that in a way that minimises the disruption to British jobs, British trade and investment in our country.The New Customs Partnership which would see Britain collect tariffs on behalf of the EU was rejected outright by Brexiteers in the Cabinet.And trade experts warned that the technology needed to make Max Fac - a solution which replaces border controls with electronic monitoring - work wont be ready in time for Brexit.The third way is designed to bring a compromise on customs between the two systems.Britain would scrap the blanket tariffs applied by the EU on most goods coming in from outside Europe, and instead set its own import duties.That is essential in letting the UK strike new trade deals with the rest of the world, with goods coming in tariff-free from countries such as the US.But to enable big companies to continue using supply chains which span the whole of Europe, Britain will continue to apply EU tariffs on around 4 per cent of products - classified as unfinished goods.And European tariffs will also be put on goods which pass through Britains ports on their way to the EU, but never enter the domestic economy.Another measure which would tie the UK closely to the EU is Mrs Mays proposal for full regulatory alignment for goods.That means Britain would copy European regulations on what products can be sold in shops.Its intended to ensure goods can still be imported and exported freely, while avoiding curbs on the services sector which makes up most of our economy.But it could prove controversial because it may hinder trade deals with countries who have different standards for their goods.But ex-minister David Jones warned: This is going to be less than the full Brexit that weve had repeated promises of from the Prime Minister.Nicky Morgan, the former Education Secretary turned pro-EU rebel, said any Cabinet ministers who cant get behind the PM should quit rather than sniping at her internally.She added: What we cannot see is a position that is briefed out tomorrow morning and over the next 48 hours Cabinet ministers begin to undermine and query it.Arriving at the summit today, Chief Whip Julian Smith - who is central to ensuring Mrs Mays plans can make it through the Commons - said he was ready and raring to go.And Liz Truss, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, revealed she was preparing for the marathon meeting by eating a breakfast of cold pizza.Mr Smiths deputy Chris Pincher last night asked Tory MPs to show public support for the Prime Minister by tweeting out a message of unity ahead of the Chequers talks.But Labour have mocked the summit -

as it would be an extremely rare species needing conservation.SNH, which promotes Scottish wildlife and natural habitats, said the 17-year-old code of practice remained relevant today.The organisations Nick Halfhide said: There was a lot of activity on the loch at the time about Nessie.So, partly serious and partly for a bit of fun, we drew up a contingency plan about how we would help Nessie if and when she was found.Some of the lessons we learned then have been relevant when we have reintroduced species like sea eagles, and were used when, a couple of years ago, four new species were found in the sea off the west coast.He added the plan would need to be updated when Nessie is discovered, and local communities and businesses on the shores of Loch Ness would be consulted.The discovery would lead to a boom in tourism to the Loch, which already attracts 400,000 visitors a year from around the world because of the legend.Tales of a monster go back nearly 1,500 years to when Irish missionary St Columba is said to have encountered a beast in the River Ness in 565AD.More recently there have been numerous sightings and pictures - some of which turned out to be faked but others remain unexplained.The creatures appearance has been described as resembling a plesiosaur, an ancient sea monster that died out with the dinosaurs.Earlier this year an international team of scientists gathered environmental DNA from Loch Ness for analysis.The study will aim to confirm what species live there - including possibly any unknown animals that might be lurking in the 754ft depths.A road built alongside the 23-mile lake made it easier for people to visit and sightings of the monster soon followed.The most famous is the surgeons photograph taken by Dr Kenneth Wilson in 1934 and published in the Daily Mail.It fooled people for 40 years and ignited worldwide curiosity in the local myth.But in 1975 the image was exposed as a hoax, created with a wooden head and neck attached to a toy submarine.There have been more than 1,000 sightings since, and a host of documentaries attempting to explain the legend.One of the most convincing photographs showed a brown dinosaur-like hump arching out of the water in 2012.Local tour boat operator George Edwards later admitted he faked it for a bit of fun using a fibreglass prop from a 2011 National Geographic documentary.Last month First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted the Loch Ness Monster exists in an interview with ITVs Good Morning Britain.Over the years various efforts have tried and failed to find the beast.In 1987 a £1million exploration called Operation Deepscan used a fleet of 24 boats which used sonar equipment to trawled 23-mile long lake.Nessie must have been hiding because the team came back with nothing.Steve Feltham is recognised by the Guinness Book of Records for the longest continuous Nessie-hunting vigil after moving to Loch Ness from Dorset 27 years ago.He has not seen it yet, but there are ten reported sighting a year on average.In November nine-year-old Sam Knight believed he snapped the monsters fin breaking the surface during a cruise with mum Jo.And last June Australian tourists Peter Jackson and Phillippa Wearne caught a serpentine object on camera while driving along the shore."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/NINTCHDBPICT000418164776.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"john lewis bans shopper epilepsy every uk store","story":"Paul Chambers, 54, from Solihull, West Midlands, suffers from epilepsy and needed the goods to be visually perfect.Mr Chambers had spent £900 for the Samsung and Panasonic televisions he bought from the store over a three year period.But he recalls experiencing a number of problems with all of them, including ghosting, calibrating and pixelating.John Lewis told Mr Chambers they were ending their business relationship with him because they were unable to meet [his] service needs and could not meet [his] expectations, BirminghamLive reported.Mr Chambers said: Every time I have taken them back the staff have been very friendly so I was shocked to receive this letter.They have banned me from every John Lewis in the country and I cant buy anything off them online.The letter read: In light of your recent enquiries we now feel it necessary, and prudent, to terminate our business relationship with you.This decision applies to all John Lewis Department stores, JohnLewis and Waitrose.

Tory Leave-backers held dramatic crisis talks last night just hours before the Prime Minister summoned ministers to agree a \u0027softer\u0027 Brexit plan at a marathon 12-hour clash.  Top Tories arrived at her 16th Century country retreat this morning in their sleek ministerial cars - and could be leaving after dark in a taxi. A No10 source warned the Prime Minister had already drawn up an emergency reshuffle plan if she\u0027s hit with mass resignations by Brexiteers - and those who quit must take a taxi the 40 miles back to London. Until then they are being locked in and surrendering their mobile phones to prevent leaks. The source told the Politico website: A select number of ego-driven, leadership-dominated Cabinet ministers need to support the PM in the best interests of the UK.  Or their spots will be taken by a talented new generation of MPs who will sweep them away. Tory Leaver Peter Bone offered to give a lift to fleets of resigning Brexiteers to save them the taxi fare. I will be on my way with my car, 4 seats available, guess another couple of cars will be required! he tweeted.   International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt was one of the earliest arrivals at Chequers for the all-day Cabinet session. Justice Secretary David Gauke and Transport Secretary Chris Grayling were both spotted being driven in. And Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss inexplicably had pizza for breakfast.   Young Remain voters held aloft a banner declaring your Brexit deal screws our future this morning outside the PM\u0027s Buckinghamshire bolthole. But furious Brexiteer Tories fear the 120-page plan will not be \u0027hard Brexit\u0027 enough.  They erupted into fury after it emerged the White Paper, which promises alignment with EU rules on goods, could make a trade deal with the US much harder.  Theresa May\u0027s deputy David Lidington today denied a trade deal with the US would be impossible - and said the claims were pretty selective leaks of gobbets from Cabinet papers.  But he did not deny they were accurate - saying only they were misquoted.  Instead he said: It’s like one of these theatre reviews that says this was not a brilliant performance and it goes up outside as \u0027brilliant\u0027. Mr Lidington said he was “confident the Cabinet will have a “concrete position that everyone will be able to sign up to” when the summit ends at 10pm. But seven top-level Brexiteers including Boris Johnson and Michael Gove were spotted meeting last night in what is expected to be a bid to harden up the plans. Boris Johnson also met former Prime Minister David Cameron, The Times reported - though exactly what they said is disputed. Theresa May has put off key decisions about whether to choose \u0027hard\u0027 or \u0027soft\u0027 Brexit, far or close links with the EU, for months due to Tory splits. Want to keep up to date with the latest from Westminster? Sign up to our newsletter to receive regular news, expert comment and analysis from our Mirror Politics team.  Now she must make hard choices with just weeks of negotiation time left before the EU\u0027s October deadline. The key split is over how customs rules should work after Brexit. Mrs May had put forward two options - but both were rejected. Now she has put forward a third way, known as a Facilitated Customs Arrangement, that would let Britain set its own tariffs on goods in exchange for closely following EU standards. Brexiteer ex-minister David Jones said Theresa May\u0027s deal looked not very good at all.  He warned the red lines of leaving the customs union, single market and jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice would be breached by what is being proposed today. But Remain-backing former Cabinet minister Nicky Morgan said ministers who don\u0027t fall in line should resign. If somebody said \u0027I just cannot live with this, this is not what I want\u0027 then yes, I think that they would have to think about their position, she told the BBC. Tory Mayor of the West Midlands Andy Street urged ministers who refuse to get behind Theresa May’s Brexit strategy to “get off the bus”. Mrs May added: This is about agreeing an approach that delivers decisively on the verdict of the British people – an approach that is in the best interests of the UK and the EU, and crucially, one that commands the support of the public and Parliament. Labour issued a mocking \u0027Cabinet survival kit\u0027 with a can to kick down the road - and a packet of fudge for if Theresa May continues to fudge her options.  Shadow Brexit minister Jenny Chapman said: Tory infighting over Brexit has got so serious Labour has been left with little choice but to try and offer ministers a helping hand before this latest peace summit. “But there is a serious point to this. Every single day the Government wastes arguing with itself puts jobs and the economy at risk and increases the chances of the UK crashing out without a deal. No deal would be the worst possible outcome for our country. The EU has a \u0027customs union\u0027. This means the 28 states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU are taxed at 10%. Being in this customs union helps the UK, because the EU is our biggest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. Theresa May wants the UK to leave it because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. But this creates a huge row with Brussels - and a headache of how to keep the border open between Northern Ireland (UK) and the Republic (EU). Britain was looking at two options: Customs partnership: Liked by Remainers, branded idiotic by Brexiteers. Britain would stick close to EU tariffs on imports and collect them on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, firms would be able to reclaim the difference. Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: Liked by Brexiteers, but could cost firms \u0026pound20bn a year. Would keep the UK separate from Brussels rules. High-tech tracking devices would try to cut bureaucracy. E.g. Trusted” firms could pay tariffs at regular intervals, not every time they cross a border. Both options were rejected so now Tories are reportedly considering this \u0027third way\u0027: Facilitated Customs Arrangement: A compromise. The UK would leave blanket EU tariffs, allowing us to set our own import duties. But if goods are unfinished or destined to end up in the EU, Britain would still collect EU tariffs on Brussels\u0027 behalf. And crucially, the UK would keep many of the same rules - regulatory alignment - as the EU on standards of goods."},{"url":null,"title":"its time back theresa brexit","story":"NewsopinionIt\u0027s time to back Theresa May on Brexit, chair of leading pro-Remain group tells warring ToriesLord Malloch Brown urges warring cabinet ministers to fall in behind the Prime Minister at tomorrow\u0027s Chequers summit\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByLord Malloch Brown17:10, 5 JUL 2018Newsopinion (Image: REUTERS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet politics updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailIt is time to give Theresa May a break.

And I say this as Chairman of Best for Britain, a leading campaign group calling for an end to Brexit, that has sought to challenge and oppose the Government at every turn. Why? Because our country is a victim of prolonged uncertainty.

Investment, workers, skilled and unskilled, are melting away as uncertainty stretches into years if not decades.  At the moment the Prime Minister and her warring team are hiding behind their own disputes over the terms of Brexit to avoid engaging in the real negotiation with Brussels. The reckless personal ambition driving these factions is surely close to treason. Its time to bring these Oxford Union debating games to an end. The British people deserve to be finally told what the vote to Leave will mean in real terms: How will we live up to our historic commitments to both sides in Northern Ireland to allow open and unrestricted trade Which sectors will or won’t enjoy frictionless trade and for how long how will we safeguard our public services in trade deal negotiations what are the government’s concrete proposals to protect our access to clinical trials and to vital medicines and treatments, on which people’s lives depend What is the their plan to maintain cross-border supply chains in our important manufacturing sectors such as the car industry or pharmaceuticals what is the deal for services that comprise a much bigger share of our economy but seem overlooked in the discussions how do we solve the complex issue of freedom of movement "},{"url":null,"title":"what chequers welcome prime ministers","story":"NewsWhat is Chequers?

One aide to the Prime Minister warned ‘blood on the carpet is no bad thing’ as she faces the threat of a mass resignation. It\u0027s an apt phrase - because Chequers wouldn\u0027t be out of place in a murder mystery. Ministers have been told that their phones will be confiscated on arrival at the luxurious Buckinghamshire retreat to avoid leaks. And between wood-panelled walls and sumptous grounds, talks are expected to last late into the night.  The PM’s country retreat has played host to many important talks in the past, including last year when Mrs May met with senior aides and pollsters to discuss the pros and cons of calling the snap election that resulted in her losing her majority. But what is Chequers and why is it being used for these crucial talks? Here’s everything you need to know…  Chequers is a luxurious country house found just outside of Great Missenden in Buckinghamshire, about 41 miles from 10 Downing Street. One theory is it is named after the chequer trees that grow on the estate. It’s not the biggest of stately homes, with just 10 bedrooms (Buckingham Palace has 240) but it has vast swathes of land - around 1,500 acres are at the owner’s disposal. It also features a huge art collection, with 190 pieces dating from the early sixteenth century to a 1937 piece by none other than Winston Churchill.  It was built in its present form in 1565 by the High Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, William Hawtrey, though historians say there has been a manor house on the site since the Roman era. The house has been connected to many important events and personalities in British history. One of its owners was a grandson of the puritanical Lord Protector, Oliver Cromwell. Why does Theresa May get to stay there?  Chequers has been at the disposal of the Prime Minister of the day since it was gifted to the nation by its then-owners Lord and Lady Lee in 1917. The Chequers Act of 1917, which was given Royal Assent on 20 December 1917, established the house as the country residence of the Prime Minister. In the past, most PMs were landed aristocrats who already had country retreats, but for those with lesser means like Lloyd George it was necessary to have an estate to host foreign dignitaries and the like.  Interestingly, this was the first Act of Parliament to even acknowledge the existence of a Prime Minister, even though the title had been used unofficially for over a century. Since Lloyd George first stayed there in 1921, Chequers has been used by PMs for crunch summits and meetings like today’s - but also for family Chrsitmases and simply relaxing weekends amid the stresses of office. What famous events have taken place there?

The woman has also banned guests from checking their phones during the game and will have a sign at the venue to remind them that it\u0027s a football free zone. In response, some of the guests have threatened not to attend due to her attitude.  The woman reportedly posted on Facebook that she had had received multiple requests from guests wanting to know if the football will be shown.  It prompted Mumsnet user \u0027arghhhhhhh\u0027, who claims to know the woman, to post a comment on the website\u0027s \u0027Am I being Unreasonable\u0027 thread.  It said: Just been on fb and someone I know (though not well and I am nit invited to the wedding!) is getting married on Saturday. Obviously England are playing. She has it a status on saying she has had multiple requests from guests wanting to know if the football will be shown. Her status basically says she\u0027s angry at the messages she\u0027s had and under no circumstances will the football be shown. It\u0027s her wedding and the day is about that and that only. She\u0027s asked that no one checks their phones during the match and is even going to have a sign made for when people enter the venue as a reminder it\u0027s a football free zone. Now she\u0027s had a fair few comments - a couple even say they wouldn\u0027t attend if they were invited due to her attitude What\u0027s everyone\u0027s opinions?  The Mumsnet user said that she\u0027d happily screen the game. The atmosphere would be amazing. I\u0027d be jumping around with everyone else in my dress, she said. Also a great way to break up the day. The day goes so fast for the bride and groom but the day guests....it can be such a long and tiring day. What a great way to break up the day! Also, we are doing well, we haven\u0027t been in this situation where we may actually have a good chance of WINNING!!!! for years and probably never will again. The whole country is routing for them. Even people who don\u0027t like football are into it. I just don\u0027t think it\u0027s fair to expect people not to watch it, or not even check their phones! But she added that she understood the bride-to-be\u0027s frustrations and, as she\u0027d got married herself recently, she knew the stress of planning.  Other Mumsnet users agreed the match should be shown. FootballsComingHome said: I would show it, everyone\u0027s going to be checking phones otherwise, my dad was at a wedding in 66 and they showed the match at the reception until it went to extra time, then the bride put a stop to it so they all went to the pub instead.

Top financial consultant Sanjay Naker preyed on his victim after she was asked to leave a bar in London Bridge for being too drunk. The married 28-year-old had been outside the bar at about 4am and started talking to the 18-year-old. On the CCTV, Naker appeared to show concern for her welfare by picking her up when she fell and offering her his jacket. At one point, he gave her a piggback. But then the PricewaterhouseCoopers worker tried to kiss the victim before she pushed him away.  CCTV shows him pulling her in the opposite direction to where she was walking and eventually succeeded, dragging her to a secluded corner on The Queens Walk. He then raped her and sexually assaulted her.  Security staff working nearby went to investigate after seeing the suspicious behaviour on CCTV. They found the teenager unconscious on the ground with her underwear pulled down and called the ambulance. Naker said he had met the victim in a club nearby, gave them his details and left the scene.  The victim was taken to hospital to recover, and later to Haven rape crisis centre where the sexual offences were confirmed. Sanjay Naker, of Wood Green, London, was jailed for eight years today after being found guilty at Inner London Crown Court of three counts of oral rape, one count of attempted rape and one count of sexual assault. Investigating officer, detective constable Aidan Kersley, from the Met’s Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command, said: “Naker deliberately targeted his victim as someone intoxicated and vulnerable. “After talking to her for a matter of minutes, he managed to drag her to a secluded area where he raped her. She has no memory of what happened.

The celebrity stylist has created a number of looks so those attending Pride events around the world will be safe. But in a powerful twist, each of his outfits features a must-have item that represents the persecution faced by members of the LGBT+ community globally. In one, a distressed leather jacket is centre stage - a protective layer for Pride in Istanbul where in 2015 police fired rubber bullets into the crowd. Another features make up wipes - an essential item at Pride in Uganda 2016, where anyone breaking gender boundaries was sexually assaulted by the Ugandan police. And one includes a black woollen hat, for those in Indonesia where trans people with long hair were rounded up by police and had their hair forcibly cut.  Gok joined forces with Gay Times and LGBT+ movement, All Out, ahead of this Saturday\u0027s Pride in London. Despite much advocation for LGBT+ rights in the UK over recent years, the community still faces discrimination across the globe every day. According to All Out, in more than 70 countries, it is a crime to be gay. In 10, it can cost you your life. Gok said: We created the #GlobalPrideMakeover to raise awareness for equality around the globe, and just how fortunate we are here in the UK to take part in a Pride parade, have parties and march without a fear for our lives - unlike some of the countries that we mention in this film. This film does not hide away from the message: this is probably one of the most honest things I\u0027ve ever done. I ask every single person to not only watch this video but also to share it among their communities and friends, school and colleagues at work. All Out executive director Matt Beard said, “Every single day, people face violence, jail time, death threats, or worse, just because of who they are or who they love. As a global movement for love and equality our aim is to mobilise thousands of people around the world to stand up for LGBT+ rights.

But as nice as it is to have stolen the Australian summer, us Brits just aren\u0027t used to coping with sudden rises in temperature. Still, all it really takes is a bit of preparation. Here are our tips for keeping comfortable and safe in this glorious weather. Now get out there and enjoy! Hydrate early, hydrate often    Your body is two-thirds water and you need to keep it topped up. If you don\u0027t you\u0027ll get headaches and may also be more tired than usual. Hydration is, as most things are, even more important for little ones. According to the British Nutrition Foundation children are less heat tolerant than adults and have a higher percentage of water in their bodies. They\u0027re also tricky little monkeys who rarely remember to drink unless reminded. The key then, is going to be making it fun to grab a drink. If you have an outdoor power socket in your garden then connect up the Halfords 40 Litre Coolbox, \u0026pound85 (was \u0026pound110, save \u0026pound25) and fill it with drinks. That way your kids can get their own chilled drink - they\u0027ll love this. You can just as easily put the coolbox inside if you don\u0027t have an outdoor power outlet. Alternatively, if you If you are planning to be out and about, you can also charge the cooler from your car\u0027s 12v power outlet. Make staying hydrated even more fun for the kids with a set of plastic Rainbow Tumblers, \u0026pound3 (half price).  Be skin-savvy Being outside in the sunshine is enjoyable, but its UV rays can do lasting damage to your skin. Applying a high SPF sun cream is vital - but it\u0027s also best to avoid exposing your skin to direct sun for prolonged periods, especially between midday and 3pm, when the sun is strongest. This is especially important for kids. So with a cloudless, beautiful summer sky you\u0027re going to need to create some shade. If you\u0027re at the beach, then a dedicated shelter will help. Halfords\u0027 Beach Shelter offers a 30+ UV protection. If you\u0027re spending most of the day out in the garden and the kids are in and out of the paddling pool, you may need more protection. The Halfords 300 Gazebo costs just \u0026pound69 ( was \u0026pound90, save \u0026pound21) and has a UV 50+ rating.  When choosing a gazebo or shelter for the sunny weather it\u0027s worth understanding those UV protection numbers. With a 50+ rating the gazebo should stop around 97 to 98 per cent of the UV radiation from the sun. This, combined with sun cream will help keep you all much safer. With any gazebo you might also want to consider some weights to go along with it. Just because it\u0027s sunny, doesn\u0027t mean it can\u0027t also be a bit blowy out! Baby, it\u0027s hot outside The hot weather can feel uncomfortable for adults, but it\u0027s particularly important to keep babies in the shade - as they are less able to sweat to cool down and their skin is very sensitive. So it\u0027s worth investing in a stroller or pram with a decent sun visor if you are taking your little one out and about in the sun.  The Joie Mirus Scenic Stroller, \u0026pound120, is an affordable modern stroller which comes with a SPF 50+ sun canopy. (It can also be paired with either the Joie Gemm or Joie Juva Infant Car Seat, to create a travel system, with no adapter needed.)  For playing in the garden or trips to the beach, grab the Halfords Infant Playshade, \u0026pound25. It pops up and down in less than 10 seconds and is made from specially tested material that provides a 50+ UV protection factor. Stay cool in the car  It\u0027s fair to say we love most things about summer, but getting into a hot car on a sweltering day isn\u0027t one of them. Did you know your air conditioning loses charge every year, making it less efficient and making your car warmer? Halfords now offers a FREE Air Con Check, to check your refrigerant levels and see if they need to be topped up for optimal performance. If they do need topping up, you can purchase air con essentials from store to recharge at home or, you can book in for an air con recharge service and Halfords can take care of it for you. You can also keep out the worst of the heat by investing in a windscreen shield to reflect the sun\u0027s glare. The Halfords All Weather Windscreen Shield is just \u0026pound7.99 - and when winter eventually does roll around, you can also use it to protect against the build up of snow and frost.

The Met Office has forecast highs up to 33C this week and 35C next week - after a row of scorching days between 29C and 33C. And the heat is forecast to remain through the second half of July and August, computer models show. Britain reached a peak coming in hotter than 29C Barbados. The heatwave has left Brits feeling uncomfortably hot with many people saying they have struggled to sleep. So when will it end? When will rain?   Why is it so hot? High pressure over the UK is causing high levels of sunshine and clear skies. Unlike our usual hot spells that are down to warm air pushing in from the continent, this heatwave is caused by the weather lifting the temperature day on day.    How long will the UK heatwave last? Forecasters say the uncomfortable, sweaty nights show no sign of disappearing. Met Office forecaster Nicola Maxey said: “The high pressure which is causing the high temperatures looks like it\u0027s staying over the UK, certainly into next week and the week after.  It looks like the dry, warm weather will continue until the end of the month.  There could be the occasional shower and the temperatures might dip to the low 20s but there\u0027s no sign of an end to the heat.  And forecast models point to above-average temperatures for much of July and August.”  What areas will it affect? Temperatures will be in the high 20s on Friday across the south and in certain parts of the midlands.  Highs of 30C are expected throughout the weekend with 33C forecast next week.  Northern Scotland may get cooler while the South and West of England will remain hot through to the weekend.   When will it rain? The Met Office has issued a weather warning for thunderstorms - the first such advisory since the service was introduced. Ms Maxey said there are indications of unsettled conditions in the coming weeks but they will only be blips in the warm conditions. There is the odd chance of a shower but it looks like the dry conditions will continue.  When was it last this hot? The Weather Outlook forecaster Brian Gaze said: “Parallels with the famous 1976 summer can be made. Ex-BBC and Met Office forecaster John Hammond of weather trending said: “Hot and dry weather breeds hot and dry weather. This effect was seen in 1976. This spell ending seems increasingly unlikely through the first half of July.” Metweather forecaster Jo Farrow Paul Michael White said: “The storms are no breakdown as the heatwave will keep on cooking.”  Record temperatures Last month was one of the hottest for almost 400 years. June bordered on the top 10 hottest since records began 359 years ago in 1659, Met Office figures show. The average temperature during the month was 16.4C, 2.2C above normal, from June 1-29 in central England, the region enclosed by the Thames, Lancashire and Bristol. UK-wide, June’s 14.5C average temperature – up 1.5C - verged on the hottest since 1976, Met Office data shows. June’s UK rainfall was down by 52 per cent, worsening drought fears. The UK record temperature for the month is 36.7C registered at Heathrow on July 1, 2015. Bookmakers have slashed the odds of records being broken.

Linda Martin watched with pride as her daughter Maryanne Pilling, now 46, married the love of her life, Tommy Pilling, 60, in July 1995.  The couple tied the knot in a beautiful ceremony at a church in Shoeburyness, Essex, with Maryanne dressed in a Cinderella-style gown. And almost a quarter of a century on, they remain happily married, sharing kisses and cuddles and making amazing memories every day. Maryanne, who lives with Tommy in Southend-on-Sea, tells her husband she loves him three times a day and lights up when she speaks of him.  As well as sharing tender embraces and cooking dinner together, the couple also go out to concerts, play football and laugh with loved ones. Their love has defied both the odds and critics - who have previously called Linda a \u0027bad mother\u0027 for allowing Maryanne to get married. Some have even deemed the couple\u0027s relationship disgusting. But as far as Linda is concerned, the fact her daughter has found somebody to love is the best thing she could have ever wished for. The mum said: I wish I could have found a love like it in my life - because it\u0027s very honest, it\u0027s very true and it really is a beautiful thing.  She spoke out about her inspirational daughter and son-in-law on Jo Piazza\u0027s Committed podcast ahead of their wedding anniversary.   She also told the host: I can always remember saying I don\u0027t care what she [Maryanne] achieves, I just hope to God she finds somebody to love. And she did, she has. And to me, that\u0027s the best thing I could have ever wished for her. Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s fairytale relationship began 28 years ago. The couple, who share a passion for cooking, met through fate in 1990 while working in a local training centre for people with disabilities. At the time, Maryanne was 19 - 13 years younger than Tommy. But from the moment they met, they shared an incredible connection. When asked what she thought of her first encounter with her future husband, Maryanne told Jo: That I love him. Just true love. It wasn\u0027t long after that Maryanne brought Tommy home to meet her family. She giggled happily as she proudly introduced him.  That\u0027s when I realised my little girl was falling in love, said Linda. Although Tommy was fairly quiet, Maryanne soon brought him out of his shell. And a year after they met, things became very serious. Deciding he wished to propose to his beloved girlfriend, a besotted Tommy bought a plastic ring for her from a vending machine. He then gave it to Maryanne, who was elated. She excitedly showed her mum the ring, saying Tommy wants us to get engaged. Linda, who admitted her first thought was good God, sat down with her daughter and Tommy and asked them what they wanted. Tommy said I want to marry Maryanne and Maryanne obviously said the same, she said in the podcast, named \u0027Love Me Tender\u0027. I said \u0027right well we better do something about this officially then\u0027.  She took the couple to get a proper ring and for the next four years, they remained engaged, getting to know each other properly. And in mid-July 1995, they tied the knot in a perfect\u0027 ceremony, surrounded by hundreds of family and friends, and so much love. Linda said her daughter looked stunning in her white dress, tiara and long veil, while Tommy donned a made-to-measure suit. For their honeymoon, the couple stayed in a seafront hotel. Afterwards, Tommy moved into Maryanne’s family home. However, amid the post-wedding bliss, Linda received cruel messages telling her that she shouldn\u0027t have allowed her daughter to get married. But she told Jo: For me as a mother, I would have felt I\u0027d failed her if I hadn\u0027t acknowledged the fact that she was in love with somebody.  Maryanne and Tommy later moved into their own flat. Today, they continue to live independently there, next door to both of their mums and across the road from Maryanne\u0027s sister, Lindi. And despite needing assistance from their loved ones with most aspects of their life, including cooking and washing, they manage superbly. They go out on dates and day trips and, recently, Tommy celebrated his 60th birthday with a huge party. As always, his wife was by his side. Pictures of the happy pair - who were thought to be the first couple with Down\u0027s syndrome to wed in 1995 - are regularly posted online.  A Facebook page, set up by Lindi, follows Maryanne and Tommy\u0027s romance and has amassed more than 40,000 followers.

Julie Shann, 55, says that she was told she had terminal lung cancer with “very little” time left to live.  But the diagnosis turned out to be incorrect.  As Julie began planning for her own funeral, she sold her family heirlooms and precious antiques to pay for the costs, reports the Hull Daily Mail .  A month later and experts in Hull Royal Infirmary told her she had never had the devastating disease, and her doctor was not qualified to give her the diagnosis.  For a month I was made to think that I was dying and had to plan my own funeral - it was absolutely heartbreaking said Julie. I tried to stay strong for my children who were supporting me but also grieving, and gave them a brave face, but behind closed doors I cried and cried. I cried myself to sleep at night and every time I went to bed, I didn\u0027t know if I would be waking up again the next morning. It was so horrible to think that every day could have been my last day. Julie said she had been giving the devastating diagnosis when she visited her GP in January 2015, just two months after suffering a stroke. She says she then began to sell off her possessions, believing she was going to die, including her grandmother\u0027s wedding ring and eternity ring, as well as treasured antiques and gold jewellery that would ordinarily be passed down to her children. I had to sell off nearly all my prized possessions to pay for my funeral as I didn\u0027t have the money for it and didn\u0027t want to leave my family with the burden,” she said. “I had to sell my nana\u0027s wedding ring and eternity ring, all my gold and antiques that I had, all of which were meant to be passed down to my kids.” "},{"url":null,"title":"prince louis christening guests who","story":"NewsPrince Louis christening guests: Who Kate and William will invite to their son\u0027s baptismThere\u0027s a lot of big names expected to be in the Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace for the service\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByAndrew SnellHomepage Editor13:14, 6 JUL 2018Updated13:15, 6 JUL 2018NewsKate, William and George at Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening in 2015 (Image: PA)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email The year\u0027s next big royal event is just around the corner, with Prince Louis\u0027 christening coming up this weekend.   But in contrast to uncle Prince Harry\u0027s wedding to Meghan Markle in May - where stars like David Beckham and George Clooney got an invite - this is set to be a cosier family affair.  But that\u0027s not to say there won\u0027t be some big names in attendance.  All of the most senior royals are expected to be at the Chapel Royal at St James\u0027s Palace for the event.  As well as Louis\u0027 parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, his siblings Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 3, will also be there.  Royal grandad Prince Charles will also be at the service, along with his wife the Duchess of Cornwall. Louis\u0027 great-grandmother the Queen is expected to attend, despite pulling out of an event last week due to illness.  Her Majesty missed a service at St Paul\u0027s Cathedral marking the 200th anniversary of the Order of St Michael and St George because she was feeling under the weather.   It\u0027s not known if Prince Philip will attend the event. The Duke of Edinburgh, who turned 97 last month, retired from public engagements in 2017. He has only made rare appearances since, and underwent hip surgery in April.  But he was up and about for Harry and Meghan\u0027s wedding in May, and was seen last month attending a polo match with The Queen .  As for the Duchess\u0027 side of the family, we can expect to see her parents Michael and Carole Middleton, along with her brother James. Her pregnant sister Pippa should also be there, with her banker husband James Matthews.   As for Louis\u0027 godparents, the Cambridges have not yet announced who they\u0027ve asked to take on the roles.  The bookies\u0027 favourite to be one of the godfathers is Prince William\u0027s outgoing private secretary Miguel Head, while his former nanny Tiggy Legge-Bourke is tipped to be a godmother. Whoever is picked, there\u0027s likely to be few of them. Royals favour having a lot of godparents - William has six, George has seven, and Charlotte has five.  Will Harry and Meghan be at the christening? One of the big talking points of Princess Charlotte\u0027s christening is that her uncle Harry wasn\u0027t there. The Prince admitted he was a \u0027bad uncle\u0027 after missing the service in 2015 because he was away on a planned charity trip to Africa.  Simson Uri-Khob, who runs Save The Rhino, told the Mail on Sunday th royal told one of his companions: What a bad uncle I am! I should really be there. But today I am here, this is where I want to be. Luckily, this time he is in London, so it would be very surprising if he and Meghan missed the ceremony.

The fast-food outlet in Digby, Exeter, has been accused of having a \u0027shocking\u0027 rat and maggot by a former employee. The pictures show inside the restaurant including a rubbish-strewn area, greasy appliances and burnt rice. But KFC has defended the branch saying significant changes have been made - and that it now has a five-star hygiene rating. Greg Cook, 31, who used to work at the restaurant, told Devon Live : “There’s a big maggot and rat problem at that store. “When I used to turn up at 6am for my shift, you would always see them running back to their little dens.  It was a regular issue and customers had even pointed it out to the management. “But if you look at the state of the place and how rubbish is left out all the time, then you can understand why. “The defrosting cabinets are supposed to be cleaned two times a day, but this doesn’t happen, and it got so bad that the place got filled with maggots.” Mr Cook says the stress of working at the KFC outlet took its toll, and he eventually left two months ago in order to move closer to his pregnant girlfriend in Dawlish. He says the stress got so bad a few years ago that he was signed off for a month and was given medication.  And he revealed he was even spat at by one disgruntled customer, who had been told that the restaurant was running low on popcorn chicken . He said: “My hair was falling out, it got that bad. “Things got really bad during the chicken shortage earlier this year as well. “I was even spat at when I told a customer that we were short on popcorn chicken. It was horrible. “All in all, though, the whole place is a joke.

Dylan Williams, 6, baffled doctors who initially thought the swelling on the right side of his face was caused by either mumps, a tooth abscess or an allergy. But the horrifying truth was that the youngster had one of the world\u0027s rarest cancers which had enveloped his body. Mum, Siobhan O\u0027Flynn, told Mirror: “A couple more days and he would have died. Tumours were pushing out his eye, wrapping around his brain, spine, shoulder blades, ribs and kidneys. “No one could believe that he’d survived - he was riddled with tumours, even his central nervous system was infiltrated. I am forever grateful to the NHS for catching it when they did. ”  Siobhan, 44, said that a swollen cheek had been the only physical sign that her \u0027healthy, robust little boy\u0027 could be so gravely ill. “He had just started year one and I noticed a swollen cheek. My wonderful GP was abroad so I took him to the locum doctor several times and we were told that he might have mumps but I just knew that was not it. Then we took him to the dentist a couple of times thinking it might be a mouth abscess. One night he woke up in pain after his lips suddenly swelled up. We rushed him to A\u0026ampE and they gave him steroids and anti-histamine and the swelling went down so they thought it was an allergy.  But his cheek was still swollen and when his brilliant GP got back she immediately referred us to the dental clinic in hospital where he had an X-Ray and ultrasound.”     And the first X-Ray revealed this enormous mass in his head. The consultant kept us very calm and called a colleague to examine the scans. Then they took ultrasound images of Dylan\u0027s head and it was very quiet in the room as they looked at them. I knew something was wrong but I assumed it was just an abscess. They asked to speak to me alone, sat me down and said \u0027we\u0027re greatly concerned.\u0027 But I wasn\u0027t grasping the gravity of the situation so they said, \u0027Siobhan, what\u0027s the worst thing you can imagine?\u0027 Then I knew and I just collapsed. It was pure shock. But you go straight into doing things so you don\u0027t really have time to process it too much.  He was riddled with cancer but there had been no indication. He had seemed like a healthy, robust little boy. He was eating, going to school. A swollen cheek was the only physical indication. He was admitted to hospital the same day and had biopsies, CT scans, MRIs, X-Rays and blood tests. In his first MRI one of his eyes looked bigger than the other because the tumour was pushing it out.     I had to call his big brother Ruairi to break the news and all I could hear was sobbing on the other end of the phone as I tried to reassure him that we were doing all we could to help Dylan and he was in the best place possible to receive care. With childhood cancer there\u0027s no known reason or cause. Some children are born with it. No one really understands why. Five days later, on Christmas Eve 2016, Siobhan and her partner Nick Williams, 48, were given an exact diagnosis. Their son had stage 4 B-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and he needed to start on intensive chemotherapy straight away.  Although the B-cell subtype of lymphoblastic lymphoma rarely manifests as solid tumours outside the lymph nodes, Dylan had many tumours all over his head and torso. Dr Richard Simcock, a Consultant Advisor at the Macmillan Cancer Support charity told Mirror that Dylan\u0027s form of cancer was very rare. He said that lymphoblastic lymphoma is itself a rare disease, occurring in about 11 cases per million population per year, usually presenting as enlarged lymph glands (lymphadenopathy). But only approximately 25% of that small total present with extranodal involvement (i.e. tumours not in the lymph glands), making Dylan\u0027s presentation particularly unusual. Mum-of-two Siobhan said: Dylan was lying in the hospital bed with what looked like 100 people suddenly working on him. It was intense and I was told later on that if his chemo did not start then he probably would not be here now. He was given the chemo drug Methotrexate which is bright orange and so nasty the nurses wear face shields and gloves over their elbows when they administer it.  You just don\u0027t know what\u0027s happening. It\u0027s an overwhelming feeling being helpless to help your child and you have to look to the professionals to do something. You\u0027re instinct as a mother is to pick him up and hold him but you can\u0027t. His cancer was so rare they had not seen it in the hospital for 17 years. His initial chemo lasted 8-9 months, it was really intense and the side effects were difficult. He was so weak he could barely walk. His long hair fell out and he struggled to write due to nerve damage. He had constant sickness, was incredibly fatigued and in constant pain.  At one point he had so many mouth ulcers he couldn\u0027t even smile. He was housebound for weeks and couldn\u0027t go to school, the hospital or the shops after his immune system became so weak that he could not fight off anything. His friends could not even come to play with him. If he even caught a cold he would have to be hospitalised for 48 hours on an extreme course of antibiotics. So far, Dylan has received 28 general anaesthetics, 55 rounds of chemo and 20 lumbar punctures. Every month, he has Methotrexate injected directly into his spine to flood his spinal fluid with the toxic but cancer-killing drug which then flows up to his brain to keep the aggressive tumours at bay.  But the difficult treatment plan managed to shrink Dylan\u0027s aggressive tumours and saved the little boy\u0027s life. Siobhan said: “The conclusion was that the chemo started working just in time. Without the referral from my GP and the fast response of the consultant who saw him he quite simply wouldn’t have made it.  Dylan\u0027s at school today which is good, he\u0027s getting stronger and I\u0027m hoping he might manage the whole day. Siobhan, from Cardiff, has two sons - her eldest Ruairi is 18 and Dylan is now 7.   She writes a blog called www.TheLittleBigC which helps her process the pain, fear and trauma of minding an acutely ill child while raising awareness about cancer.    Being on this journey makes you realise how many kids are in a similar situation. Cancer changes your perspective and makes you re-evaluate what really matters in life.  You suddenly have to find the resilience to help your child deal with whatever they will have to face. But the irony of going through a tough situation is that it brings peculiar positives I never would have thought of.  It\u0027s brought us even closer as a family and it has made us stronger. Siobhan said that Dylan is improving every day but the future is still uncertain.       Now Dylan looks great. His hair is growing back and he is regaining his strength. He\u0027s started to ride his bike again and it just gives me the most immense pleasure to do regular things like bring him to the park and see him eat ice cream. Or see him able to play with his friends again. It\u0027s a cliche but it\u0027s true that the little things in life are the most important. Lymphoblastic lymphoma (LL) is a rare type of fast-growing non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).  It mainly affects people under 35. It is similar to acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) and is treated in a similar way. LL starts when white blood cells, called lymphocytes, become abnormal and grow in an uncontrolled way. The abnormal lymphocytes build up in one or more parts of the body. The most common symptom is a painless swelling in neck, armpit or chest. Other symptoms may include:  • breathlessness  • cough  • chest pain  • night sweats  • weight loss  • high temperatures (fevers). LL can affect other areas of the body. Other symptoms depend on where in the body the lymphoma is growing. To diagnose lymphoma, a doctor removes a sample of cells (biopsy) from an affected area to be checked for abnormal cells. You will also have tests and scans to find out more about the lymphoma. LL is treated with chemotherapy. Some people may have radiotherapy. Sometimes a stem cell transplant is used to treat LL that comes back. You may be invited to join a clinical trial looking at new ways of treating LL. You can talk about this with your lymphoma doctor.

We don\u0027t know what his prognosis is and he will probably need to be monitored all his life. He may never be able to have children, his heart will always have to be checked due to the affects of chemo, he has nerve damage and he may always have mobility issues.

The heat is expected to top the previous record of 32C - and temperatures are going to stay high this weekend and into next week.  However, there is still little sign of any prolonged rainfall with no significant precipitation recorded since the end of May. Some scattered showers will develop over Britain during the weekend but most areas will remain dry and warm. An amber level heatwave alert has been issued for western parts of England with temperatures soaring over the next few days. London and the South East will bear the brunt of the sweltering conditions — which will last into tomorrow as England take on Sweden in the World Cup quarter final in Russia.    High pressure will dominate the weather with prolonged periods of sunshine and more scorching air from the continent blocking any periods of cooler, unsettled Atlantic conditions. This has created an area of clear air above the UK, where cloud is suppressed and winds have been low to allow maximum heat to come through from the sun. Hot conditions are expected to continue into next week. It may be sporadically cloudy and slightly fresher in the northwest at times with a little more rain or drizzle . However, for those wanting a respite from the heat, there is some hope on the horizon.   More unsettled weather may start to develop later this month with occasional spells of more changeable conditions edging across the UK, particularly in the north and northwest. But to end the month, it looks as though the hot, dry weather will return for much of the country with plenty of warm sunshine. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “A slightly slacker pressure pattern will allow marginally cloudier, cooler and more showery weather to end the week, but temperatures remain in the mid to high 20s C widely and staying dry and sunny for most.

Yvonne Radcliff, 74, had to turn around and go home after heading for a day out to Birmingham\u0027s new \u0026pound7 million Legoland Discovery Centre. She had set off from her home in Hall Green in the city to the new attraction which opened on Thursday. But the Lego-loving pensioner had her plans for a day out shattered when a staff member told her that no adults could enter without a child.  Yvonne told Birmingham Live: “I couldn’t believe it.  Adults make Lego, it’s wonderful. Yet I wasn’t allowed in because I didn’t have a kid with me. You couldn’t make it up really.  “I think Lego is fascinating. I’ve watched documentaries on TV and saw it was opening in town. “I told my daughter I fancied a day out to see it, so I got on the train to Snow Hill and walked the rest of the way there. “Once I got there, I walked in and a girl stopped me and said I wasn’t allowed in. She said it’s the rules - I must be accompanied by a child. She added: “I was shocked and appalled to tell you the truth. It’s nonsense really. “A family was in front of me so I said can I walk in with them as they had children, she just said ‘No, you’re a stranger’.  “You’d thought they’d take pity on a pensioner - and the kids aren’t off school yet. “I just had to walk away and go back home.”  The Legoland Discovery Centre website states that “adults must be accompanied by children to enter Legoland Discovery Centre”.  The new venue is, however, staging an adult-only evening for Lego fans on July 11 between 5pm and 7pm. In a detailed statement, a spokesman for Legoland said: “LEGOLAND Discovery Centre’s are not theme parks but small, indoor attractions specifically conceived and designed from a child’s perspective to provide safe and fun environments for families with children aged 3-10 to enjoy together.

You probably aren\u0027t expecting to be bombarded with messages about loo roll because of it - but that\u0027s exactly what happened to a 30-year-old writer. Hana Michels took to Twitter to reveal the bizarre occurance. She shared a snap from her dating profile, which she\u0027s had for over a year. The comedic shot shows Hana in the bathroom, wrapped in a towel, with a shower cap on her head, pulling a face as she brushes her teeth.  However it\u0027s not the funny pose which has people in a flap. It\u0027s the toilet roll in the background. Hana tweeted that since launching her profile, 23 men have messaged her to say she is \u0027incorrect about toilet paper\u0027. The post, which has been shared over 2,000 times, provoked a debate about the right direction in which to hang a toilet roll on a holder.  There was a pretty equal split between people who thought her way was right, and people who thought she was wrong. One person said: I don\u0027t have Tinder... but if I did, I\u0027d be trying to find your profile right now just to tell you that you are correct about toilet paper. Another added: Make it 24, you god damned monster. Some people tried to delve into the reasoning for which way you should hang the paper.

Rachel Lapierre\u0027s big win in 2013 saw her bag a guaranteed $1,000 (\u0026pound605) every week for the rest of her life. But instead of spoiling herself, the former beauty queen has been giving her money to prop up her amazing charity. The Canadian was already involved in helping others work when her numbers came up.  But she is now using her winnings to bring joy to other people in her native Montreal, as well as countries like Haiti Sengal and India, BBC reports.  Her work ranges from providing hot food and clothes to the homeless in Quebec to street clinics in Kolkata. The selfless Ms Lapierre said: Money is money. When you\u0027re born you don\u0027t have anything.  And when you go [die], you go with nothing but your memories. You go with what you did here in life. We just try to promote good deeds. Good deeds can be so many things. It can be a bike, it can be food, it can be transport to go to the hospital. It can even be just listening to somebody on the phone because they are lonely. I think happiness comes from the heart. It\u0027s nice to have a new home or car. It can be really fun - but you don\u0027t need that to be happy. Kind Rachel, 56, left her nursing career behind her just months after winning the Lotto.  And she wasted no time launching her very own charity Le Book Humanitaire .   In the 1980s Rachel\u0027s life was very different. She joined a local modelling school and as a result entered Miss Quebec. She won in 1982, and aged 21 toured Canada in the following year. But while the world of pageants and modelling might seem a million miles from running a charity, Rachel sees similarities. She said: At 20, I loved helping, but I did not know that I would necessarily go in that direction. I learnt everything I could. I realised that giving pleasure made me happy and that doing good deeds fed me. Her success led to her setting up her own modelling school, to help young women build careers in the industry.

Although he’s out of the first-team picture right now, he remains highly regarded at Dens.Meanwhile, it was Waddell’s performances in the two Betfred derbies around this time last year that persuaded then Dundee United boss Ray McKinnon, now in charge of the ’Ton, to take him there.While Waddell gets to know his temporary new team-mates, the Dundee squad have settled in at their training camp in the Algarve.They were having double training sessions there today, before Saturday’s bounce game against Mansfield.A second game will follow against SC Farense on Tuesday night, before boss Neil McCann brings the squad back to Scotland next Wednesday.The focus out in Portugal is on making sure the team are ready to go from the first whistle when the Betfred Cup kicks off with a group tie at Stirling Albion next week.For the second year running Neil is stressing the coming come ties are not being considered part of the pre-season build up.He insists the season proper starts with the Stirling game.“I always looked at it that way last year, I didn’t count the Betfred as a warm up to our season, the league season,” he said.“It’s a cup we want to go and do well in so in the pre-season games are vitally important we get the right conditioning into all the players.”\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people job opportunities","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA local manufacturer has several positions available.Due to the steadily increasing demand for its products, the firm is looking to recruit city and guilds qualified bench joiners and wood machinists/CNC operators.Applicants who can demonstrate relevant experience of working in a joinery workshop environment may also be considered.The firm is also also seeking to appoint an experienced project coordinator to take responsibility for the preparation of the documentation necessary to enable manufacture to take place.

It was not bad but I was prepared to see better because of how they have trained.“I have been very pleased with them so far.

The teams coming down will have an expectation to go straight back up.“Then there are teams that have been down there for a while that will have a real go at getting up.“I would probably goes as far as to be saying in Scotland right now it is the toughest league.“The Championship is the most competitive but we are a club that have ambitions and we are one I think should be in the Premiership.

It was my first game for Dundee United and it was great to get started.“It was a pre-season game and the big thing was to get minutes on the pitch and that was good.“And the goal was good for the confidence going forward.“It was the first time all the boys had played together and gave the manager the chance to have a look at us in a game rather than training.”While it goes without saying United have taken something of a gamble by making so many signings in one summer.There have already been nine new arrivals and the manager has revealed he’d like as many as another four before the Betfred Cup kicks off against Arbroath next week.Rather than being daunted by that, though, Aird is relishing the challenge of being part of what could be a completely new team.“It was a position when they signed nine new players that it was the rebuilding of a club.“The number of signings excited me.

Likewise, young Scott Allardice slotted in comfortably alongside Frans in central defence.Originally a midfielder, he’s now impressed a few times in that deeper role and would certainly be worth another look there when the Betfred Cup group matches kick-off in under a fortnight.Returning to the new faces, a clue who will be handed the goalkeeper’s jersey when the competitive action starts was perhaps given when Swiss Benjamin Siegrist was preferred to Slovakian Matej Rakovan in goal.Siegrist was almost caught out when he was slow to field a pass back in the first half but, generally, looked sound.Rakovan did come on for the second half and did nothing wrong but right now it appears he has work to do to be in the side when Arbroath are faced in that first Betfred tie on Saturday week.While the game did fizzle out a bit in the second half, another boost for United was the appearance of James Keatings for the final 15 minutes or so.The attacker’s first season at Tannadice was ruined by injuries but, if he can stay fit, he’s a player who can play a significant part in what lies ahead.It was his shot with ten minutes left that struck the bar and went in off home defender Euan Spark for the second.Keatings then struck the post with a clever curling effort from 16 yards out.Had that gone in, the score would have provided a fairer reflection of United’s good work.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2017/10/59dc8f56e5322-e1530277496193.jpg ","title":"volunteer drivers needed for dundee charity delivering food to impoverished folk","story":"\t\t\t\t\tA new charity aimed at alleviating food poverty among families in Dundee is urgently seeking volunteers to carry out its summer programme.Dundee Bairns delivers breakfasts and lunches to impoverished families in the city during the school holidays.It is looking for delivery drivers and attendants to assist with deliveries during its Summer Fun and Food Programme which begins on Monday July 2 and ends on Friday August 11.The charity provides vans so drivers do not need their own car.

It also aims to guarantee that all commitments to suppliers are fulfilled.The Inverness franchise has been held for about the last two years by American Jack Alldredge who is understood to be from Florida.The company\u0027 managing director Mike Williams said Mr Alldredge had hoped to settle in the UK after visiting the country.\"He loved the idea of living here and fell in love with Inverness,\" Mr Williams said.\"But he has had immigration issues. Sometimes we make it difficult for people to invest in this country. It is a shame.\"For the past 18 months, Mr Alldredge has tried to manage the store from America but the shattering of a glass panel in the building \u0026ndash understood to be leased \u0026ndash was the final straw at the beginning of June.\"Fortunately, no one was hurt,\" Mr Williams said.\u0026nbsp\"In our 18-year history, we have never closed a store apart from relocation so it is sad that after the roof \u0026lsquoexploded\u0026rsquo \u0026ndash which was a glass entrance, leaving a very dangerous situation with other panels \u0026ndash Jack decided to call it a day.\"\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbspMr Williams said he was disappointed for Mr Alldredge as well as the store\u0027 three employees including a manager.As the store was operated as a franchise, Ableworld is not obliged to step in but it is aiming to honour commitments to suppliers and customers.\"Although saddened by the situation, Ableworld will ensure that all suppliers of stock to the company will not lose out and either Highland Mobility (Ableworld Inverness) will settle all accounts or Ableworld UK will satisfy all the suppliers,\" Mr Williams said.\"Also no customer will lose out on their present deposits or product delivery of orders.\"Ableworld will be setting up support networks for past customers of products and writing to customers explaining the situation.\"Too many businesses in our industry and others pull the plug and leave their customers and suppliers high and dry which is something we will not do.\"He also revealed the company was actively looking to open another franchise in the Inverness area.Inverness MP Drew Hendry said the store\u0027 closure would be a great loss to many disabled people. Citing the high-profile case of city guesthouse owners Russell and Ellen Felber who are fighting deportation to America, Mr Hendry said this was another example of how immigration policies were not working.\u0026nbsp\"I am already working with countless other local families facing a similar fate, including the Felbers whose ongoing battle to stay in Inverness is utterly heart-breaking,\" Mr Hendry said.Inverness disability rights campaigner David Sansum said there were few mobility aid suppliers in the city while the next nearest store was about 40 miles away in Forres.\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp\"I\u0026rsquom sure the closure of Ableworld will leave a big gap,\" he said. \"It is shame.\"\u0026nbspIn recent months, there have been a spate of incidents at Inverness retail parks where glass panels have fallen from overhead canopies.In March, Highland Council urged building owners with glazed canopies to check adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements were in place while Inverness South councillor Ken Gowans called for glass panels to be removed from canopies at all the city\u0027 retail parks.Friday 6 Jul 2018 1:35 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.inverness-courier.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/01828000/01828031.jpg","title":"Druim Ba wind farm rejected","story":"Plans for 10 turbines at Druim Ba between Kiltarlity and Abriachan have been rejected today by the Scottish Government after a second public inquiry.\u0026nbspGeneral wind farm campaigner Lyndsey Ward was \"delighted\"She said: \"The community has had seven years of wind farm developers trying to get a wind farm in that area.

contemporary issues of sustainability and local culture.\"The new low-impact buildings, which are similar to the highly popular Nordic summer huts, will provide comfortable accommodation for schools,

changes to a funding formula which he claims leaves busy urban routes at a serious disadvantage.Milton Crescent in Hilton is to be completely resurfaced at a cost of \u0026pound100,000 and the work is due to start on Monday.Other roads across the city \u0026ndash including Midmills Road in the Crown area and Caledonian Road and Montague Row in Dalneigh are also set to have their potholes filled in.But Ness-side councillor Ron MacWilliam has called for a rethink on the way damaged roads are prioritised.At present, funds are allocated according to a formula which gives more weighting to length of road than traffic volumes.As a result, Mr MacWilliam said roads in Inverness were having less money spent on them than rural roads in the far north of Sutherland. He also said more needed to be done if city drivers were going to notice any significant difference.\"The fact the council is now looking to repair roads within the city is a start, but there are a lot of routes \u0026ndash particularly in areas such as Hilton and Lochardil \u0026ndash which are still very bad,\" he told the Courier.\"The roads budget is woefully inadequate. The roads office has a fantastic team but they are fighting a losing battle.\"With regards to the funding formula, Mr MacWilliam said he was continuing to press the matter but he faced strong opposition from the much larger number of Highland councillors who represent rural wards.However, residents in Milton Crescent are just happy that work there is finally going ahead.Edward Dyce (76) relies on his vehicle to get around and said: \"I have had a lot of problems with my car because of the road surface. It\u0027 getting worse because of the amount of traffic.\"A lot of people use the road and the potholes have become a real problem.

Cristiano is obsessed with how he looks and would be furious with the mirror if it told him things he didn’t like. But that’s something he can take charge of himself and by all accounts his personal regime, aimed at leaving him able to keep on winning the Ballon D’Or and Champions League, is astonishing.But he’s also obsessed by how Real Madrid treat him. Which is something he feels he’s taking charge of too, by being their most important player (potentially ever) – but justifiably or otherwise it has been a long time since he’s been satisfied either with their treatment of him or by his salary.Now Juventus, I’d say, look an unlikely way for him to spend the autumn of his career, but two things play here. Firstly, when he scored that astonishing overhead kick in the quarter-finals of the Champions League in Turin the Juve crowd spontaneously applauded him and that hit Cristiano where he lives. He loved that and said so, publicly. Juve’s planning started there.Secondly, Juve have earned 275 million euros from the Champions League between 2014-2017 alone, a chunk of which they are clearly disposed to invest in a guy who turns 34 in February and who wants to be paid a basic 25m per season plus 5m in bonuses.It’s bonkers, but if you don’t shoot you don’t score.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"emergency services respond to underground explosion in dundee","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPolice and fire services are responding to a major incident in Dundee’s Greenmarket area.Local people have reported hearing a loud explosion at around 8.30am and emergency services were quick to reach the scene.A cordon has been thrown up and onlookers asked to stay well back, according to one witness.Police said buildings in the area had been evacuated as a precaution.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningexpress.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2018/07/Dogs-die-in-hot-cars-398x564.jpg ","title":"more than 10 people every day have called the sspca worried about dogs in hot cars","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThe Scottish SPCA has seen a major increase in the number of calls for people concerned about dogs in hot cars.In just 16 days, between June 18 and July 4, there were 210 calls from members of the public.And over the past year the charity has seen an 80% increase in the number of calls on this issue.Scottish SPCA chief superintendent Mike Flynn said: \u0026#8220We\u0026#8217re very concerned at the number of reports we\u0026#8217re receiving about dogs being left inside cars during the hot weather.\u0026#8220Owners need to understand that it\u0026#8217s completely unacceptable to leave a dog in a vehicle in these searing temperatures, even for a short period of time with the windows down.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards.

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

Sheryl is a Lochgilphead woman \u0026#8211 middle-aged, celibate without choice and with plummeting self-confidence and a loathing for her body shape. Belly dancing appears to let Sheryl, and Kerrie, rediscover a love of their own body.\u0026#8216You’re using parts of your body, probably out of commission for a while, like the pelvis and it makes a part of the body, you’re maybe not keen on, sexy.\u0026#8217The female characters in the book get up to what loud ladies in a small town would enjoy gossip and drama.\u0026#8216There is an element of bitchiness about it, which I exaggerated in the book. Or maybe it was just me that was bitching.\u0026#8217But two books later in the series, Kerrie is changing direction. Her new book, Rebel Without A Clue, is a sci-fi dystopian novel about a male alien from a female-dominated planet landing in Glasgow.\u0026#8216There’s actually not a lot of sex in my books,\u0026#8217 says Kerrie. \u0026#8216Except maybe nobody having any.\u0026#8217The story starts out as a reversal of The Handmaid’s Tale, with women of this planet no longer needing men to reproduce and evolves, through a plot described as \u0026#8216mad\u0026#8217, into an outsiders perspective of Glasgow.\u0026#8216The male alien Legless goes down to earth and goes around fertilising all these women, and doesn’t understand this world where he’s in charge.\u0026#8216Most of the time I was the only woman living in a culture different from my own. I began to see stories in outsiders.\u0026#8217Being an Australian in Scotland \u0026#8211 and on top of that marrying into a Bangladeshi family \u0026#8211 would give that outlook, of everything being familiar but just off a little. The language is the same, with the accents different. The rural community is the same, only with less terrifying monsters to deal with in Argyll. This is the outlook Legless finds himself in as a dominated man in a world of dominant men.Such an off-the-wall plot with no clear message makes the book an ink blot test \u0026#8211 you take what you’re looking for from it. Maybe you even see something else with another look.Kerrie explained: \u0026#8216Originally I wanted it to be all humour. I suppose I’m driven about power and control and it’s really fascinating when you start to think about it because people dominate in quite small ways.\u0026#8217So maybe the point was to gain the women’s perspective for men to relate to?Kerrie is currently working on her fifth book, the sequel to her dystopian sci-fi named Rebel Without A Bra, and she will keep belly dancing around Lochgilphead.\u0026#8216At the beginning you just write, and you just open up your mind and stuff comes out and you’ll find that all this stuff comes out that you didn’t realise you were thinking about. It’s amazing.

However, the away team were really up against it from the start. The Ardnamurchan ladies were clearly also up for the game and had a full squad to choose from. With some key players out and one new player making her debut, the nine player squad from Dunadd started strongly. They had several early chances but just couldn\u0026#8217t find the back of the net.There were some crunching tackles and tasty challenges in the first half the Ardnamurchan ladies were keen to neutralise the strength of Dunadd defender Iona McCulloch, often doubling up on her. Referee Beth MacDonald had her work cut out trying to contain tempers as tensions ran high both on and off the pitch.The first half ended 0-0 and Dunadd left the field feeling like they hadn\u0026#8217t performed to their usual high standards. After a rousing half time team talk, Dunadd were keen to get an early goal in the second half to help settle them and to perhaps go on and build from there.And that is exactly what they did. Straight from the throw up, Grace Drummond caught the ball cleanly, sending it sailing over the defence\u0026#8217s heads. Leone Airlie ran on to it and struck it smoothly, low beyond the keeper.However, the home team responded positively and had Dunadd pinned back in their own half for the next five minutes. On 40 minutes, a fortunate strike from wide left bounced past a few players and found it\u0026#8217s way into the corner of the Dunadd net, 1-1.Dunadd were not despondent and regrouped to press again. However, minutes later Ardnamurchan broke and finished well making it 2-1.Again the referee had to step in to break up some fierce challenges as Ardnamurchan continued to goad McCulloch. However, the young Dunadd defender answered the contentious tackles in the best possible way. In the 51st minute she collected a loose ball and broke away from her marker. After dodging past three players she shot high and scored a certain goal of the season contender, pinging it sweetly into the top corner.The remainder of the game saw both teams coming close to winners. Ellie Hetherington making some crucial blocks and tackles, clearing the ball to safety time and time again. Dunadd held on to grind out the result and retain their unbeaten record and hold on to top spot in south division two.After a summer break, Dunadd will travel to third placed GMA on Sunday August 5 in another crucial game as they search to get back to winning ways.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"its gonna be a close shave gavin","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 29/06/18, 7:01 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowIt\u0026#8217s been eight months in the making, but it\u0026#8217s getting hairy now.The razors, however, will soon sort that out for Gavin Allan.He has been growing his flowing locks and bushy beard since October last year, but Gavin will be shorn for charity on Saturday June 30.Gavin\u0026#8217s head and beard shave is being carried out in aid of Motor Neurone Disease (MND) research and the Doddie Weir Foundation.Former Scottish rugby international lock forward Doddie Weir revealed in June 2017 he was suffering from MND, a degenerative condition affecting the nerves in the brain and spinal cord that tell your muscles what to do.

Isabelle Cairns, of Ayr, has hit out at the amount of rubbish being left on the beach. And the Financial Adviser feels that the council could do more. Isabelle said: “There are two beaches here, one part gets cleaned and one doesn’t. “Between Doonfoot side and the Pavillion is generally clean. “But the rest is neglected. “There was a petition signed about this and the fact the council have stopped cleaning parts of the beach. “There are plastic bottles all over the place, I even saw dirty nappies lying. “I get that it costs a lot of money to get staff out, but there are other options for the council.  “They could get community workers in, the ones who are serving community payback orders.” Isabelle claims that Ayr has little to offer outside the beach these days. She said: “What’s in Ayr now? It’s a ghost town. “There is not a lot about, but the beach is an attraction that brings in people from all over the country. “Walking along the beach seeing this mess was nothing short of disgusting. “It gets to me as it’s such a beautiful beach. “What you also have to think about is that all kinds of rubbish is going to be washed out to sea when the tide comes in.  “It’s just going to get even worse going forward as the schools are now off. “More people will be going to the beach and it’s just going to become an absolute travesty. “People have no respect for the beach, but the council should have someone cleaning up when it’s like that.” A council spokesman said: “We monitor our beaches closely and work within the national guidance and with available resources to keep our beaches looking their best, so they can be enjoyed by local people and visitors alike. “We clean and litter-pick the full stretch of Ayr Beach and ask people to dispose of their waste in our bins rather than abandoning rubbish on the sand. “The section from Cromwell Road to the Pier is not routinely mechanically cleaned as it’s classed as an amenity beach rather than a recreational beach, but the stretch is still managed on a regular basis.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12863891.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/8898834.jpg","title":"full time ayr united can","story":"NewsFull-time Ayr United can make their Mark in Ladbrokes ChampionshipThe Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:31, 6 JUL 2018NewsMark Roberts (Image: SNS Group)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMark Roberts insists that being full-time could make all the difference for Ayr United this time round in the Championship. The Honest Men were relegated at the first time of asking in the second tier in the 2016/17 season when they finished bottom with 33 points. But former Ayr hitman and manager, Roberts, reckons being part-time was what held them back. Marko, who played second tier football with Ayr under Brian Reid, said: “I think Ayr will be fine, I really do. “Being full-time in that league is a massive thing. “The last few times Ayr have been in that league it has been very difficult to compete with the full-time teams. “But the fact they have got that now will make a big difference and I don’t think they will have any issues staying in the league. “When I was there under Brian Reid, being part-time was what held us back. “You didn’t have enough time to go and work on things on a daily basis but Ayr will have that now.  “You can beat any team in a one-off game but over the course of a season of 36 games it’s difficult to compete. “But the fans should be excited this time as there should be no problem – Ayr can even start looking up rather than looking down.” Roberts, who hit the net 43 times for Ayr, was more than impressed with Ayr’s impressive goal-scoring form last season as they topped League One, pipping Raith on the final game of the season. He said: “I thought they were really good to watch. “You always thought they were going to score every game they played. “And I don’t mean just scoring one, you always thought they’d grab three or four. “Sometimes they were left open all over the park – but they had too much quality up front and that’s the reason they went up. “Fair play to them as they had three really good strikers in Shankland, Moore and Moffat.” Roberts added: “The way the league was won was certainly a bit of a way to win it.  “I’ve been in teams that have won titles and been promoted with five or six games to go, which gives you a great feeling of accomplishment, but there’s nothing more exciting than winning the title in the last 10 minutes of the season. “Both teams had the chance to run away with it but kept faltering.” Roberts managed Ayr for three years before getting sacked, He then had a player/coach role at Clyde for a season. He has now gone back to playing at Junior Cup finalists Hurlford United. But he insists that his managing days aren’t over.  He said: “I won’t give up on it, I just wanted to play again for now. The best days of your life are when you’re kicking a ball and I am still fit enough.  “Any manager who tells you they prefer coaching is talking rubbish. When you’re out there playing it’s  just great.  “I do want to get back to managing eventually though, but it’s all about finding the right club and what suits my life at the minute.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"holiday goer caused ruckus prestwick","story":"NewsHoliday-goer caused ruckus at Prestwick AirportIan Graham acted in an aggressive and intimidating manner towards Steven Ringtoul, and made threats of violence in the presence of children.\u0026nbspShareByAyrshire Post16:00, 28 JUN 2018NewsAyr Sheriff Court (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeSee our privacy noticeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA holidaygoer who caused a ruckus at Prestwick Airport has been fined.

closed, listening to the soothing sounds of tranquil music, gently guided by their teacher as they breathe deeply, exhaling all worries away and their minds drift off\u0026hellip\nNow, I know you must be wondering, what on earth are they teaching at Peebles High School? What about prelims, exams, studying, grades?\nBut what do all these pressures bring to the fragile mind of a young person, and how do they process the stress to ensure their mental wellbeing?\nIn steps Suzi Gibson, who has been running mindful meditation sessions with Peebles High pupils as part of Health Week for the past five years.\nAnd so a group of pupils dropped their pencils, calculators and chemistry tools and walked through the doors of a more unique classroom setting, kicking off their school shoes and leaving their cares behind them as the lay in the comfort of Space 108 in Peebles.\nCan mindfulness meditation really help pupils concentrate amid the distractions of 21st century living?\nI decided to experience for myself the sessions offered freely to the pupils by Suzi, who guided sessions at the high school before opening her studio at Greenside, Peebles, in January 2016.\nAdmittedly I had always been a bit sceptical about meditation. I mean seriously, how can sitting on a floor in the lotus position, inhaling the pleasant oil aroma while the ambient sounds of dolphins singing and ocean waves crash, bring me peace of mind?\nI\u0026rsquom a wife, mother, writer, and like most people, my life is busy and my head is bursting with thoughts from which there\u0026rsquos no escape.\nBut I entered the beautiful airy studio with an open-mind and intrigued about the experiences of the pupils.\nOn this particular afternoon, I feel like I\u0026rsquove got the weight of the world on my shoulders. Thoughts are racing through my head like a train out of control. But immediately I feel a sense of calmness speaking to Suzi, as she explains the techniques she is using and gently guides me through the smooth ride to a quiet mind\u0026hellipand I am, going, going, gone\u0026hellip\nI am in a state of deep peace and the mind is calm, so much so, when I hear Suzi\u0026rsquos soft instruction to open my eyes \u0026ndash I don\u0026rsquot want to. I love it here.\nSo now I can see why meditation could potentially tackle a myriad of problems suffered by young students, including mental health. This is a growing problem in the Scottish Borders, with evidence suggesting almost 2,000 children and young people in the region will experience mental ill health at some point in their lives.\nThe sessions are offered to groups of pupils from S1 to S3, who arrive at the studio giggling with excitement and anticipation for their new experience.\nSuzi explained: \"There are some nerves and awareness of peers, especially if there is a mix of ages. The great thing is, once they close their eyes, it becomes completely about their own experience. Fidgeting and chatting stops, there is a sense of calm, and some sleep which is great because they perhaps need it.\"\nEach group is given an insight into the benefits of meditation, as well as exploring how stress becomes unhealthy, warning signs, and how to build resilience through practical techniques that can help reduce anxiety.\nThe meditation guru shared skills with the pupils which, if put into practice daily, can be life-changing.\nSuzi said: \"They are all very relaxed and quite amazed at the experience. I hope they leave with the knowledge that they have the ability to create calmness within themselves using some of the techniques they have learned, leading to greater concentration, focus, creativity and well rested teens.\"\nThe visible difference in the pupils during the session at Space 108 has astounded school staff. \"Some of the teachers and staff who have attended over the years can\u0026rsquot quite believe the quiet and calm that begins to settle in the room. I\u0026rsquove had a few parents afterwards tell me how much their kids enjoyed it,\" said Suzi.\n\"There is a lot of anxiety and tension in our kids today, sometimes a feeling of being relaxed is a little alien to them, then they experience it. That\u0026rsquos the important bit, they have an experience of relaxation and calm, not an intellectual understanding that it is good for them, but an actual experience.\"\nResearch has proven that mindfulness and meditation is very beneficial to a person\u0026rsquos mental health, and many schools are incorporating it into their classrooms, teaching philosophies, and disciplinary programs.\nIn fact, some schools are choosing to replace detention with meditation with it even being used as behavioural therapy in classrooms.\nWhether this trend will catch on remains to be seen, as there are many parents who still prefer traditional discipline, with youngsters being given their marching orders to the principal\u0026rsquos office for unruly behaviour.\nBut one thing is certain, the pupils of Peebles High School reaped the benefits of their mindful meditation sessions with Suzi during Health Week last month.\nPrincipal teacher of pastoral care Kirsteen Robertson, said: \"The studio is beautiful, the students immediately notice how soothing the space is, the lovely smell and lighting. The sessions give our students strategies to relax, think calmly, reducing stress and anxiety and improve sleep. It\u0026rsquos just amazing to see how some of them react.\"\nHaving embraced meditation and its healing benefits, I leave the studio feeling renewed, carefree and a little lighter on my feet. The everyday worries and thoughts I described like a train racing out of control?

window as children relax, enjoy the outdoors and get stuck into their favourite hobbies.Asthma UK is launching a campaign urging parents of children with asthma to make sure they take their usual preventer medicine and keep up a routine over the school break.The medicine builds up over time so will help to protect their child from an asthma attack during the summer holiday and once they return to school.Every 10 seconds someone has a potentially life-threatening asthma attack in the UK and three people die from an asthma attack every day.In September, children are nearly three times more likely to be admitted to hospital because of an asthma attack than in August, partly due to seasonal triggers such as cold and flu viruses.If a child hasn’t kept up their preventer medicine routine over the school holidays, they will be at greater risk of reacting to these triggers.The good news is that by taking a few simple steps, parents can help their child to avoid asthma attacks and enjoy the summer as much as anyone else:Keep up your child’s usual preventer medicine routine, usually a brown inhaler.Make sure your child has an up-to-date written asthma action plan, which you can download from Asthma UK’s website, and share this with anyone who will be looking after them as using one means they’re less likely to end up in hospital for their asthma.Track your child’s asthma symptoms using a diary or a symptom calendar.Prepare for going back to school by arranging for your child to have an asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse to check your child’s medicines and make sure your child has spare, in-date reliever inhalers to take into school.Parents whose children have asthma can access support through our nurse helpline.Last year we helped nearly 1,000 parents who called on behalf of their child with asthma.For information and support on how to manage your child’s asthma during the summer or to download a written asthma action plan visit

the other house, shouting, but she could not see if there was anyone else present.She came away from the window but 15 minutes later, when she heard \u0026#8216a smash\u0026#8217, she returned to see if anyone was hurt and saw Deavy leaving the property\u0026#8217s garden, \u0026#8216still angry\u0026#8217, she said.She said he threw a trolley that was in the garden to the side.Deavy\u0026#8217s defence solicitor, Mr Buchanan, asked the witness if what she had heard had just been an argument between two people, and if the two were \u0026#8216giving as good as they got\u0026#8217.The witness said that although she heard two voices, she could not hear what they were saying.The second witness, whose window was smashed, said Deavy had been taken to her property in a state of intoxication.Although he was usually welcome, she asked him to leave because he was drunk.When he did not, she decided to leave the property and go for a walk around the block and when she returned, Deavy was gone.When he returned later, the witness pretended she was not in.She said Deavy was chapping the door but she had closed the curtains.At some point she heard a bang and thought that Deavy may have fallen into the wheelie bins outside, but when she went to check she saw that the shopping trolley was over on its side, near to where it had been before.She said: \u0026#8216I sat in silence so he would think I was still away out.\u0026#8217Later, the woman went shopping and when she returned home, she found her window smashed so she called the police.She said that she would not have phoned the police about the earlier events if the window had not been smashed.Mr Buchanan said there was \u0026#8216no evidence at all\u0026#8217 of swearing or violence, and that there was nothing to suggest his knocking on her door was untoward.He said it had been \u0026#8216a drunk man, knocking at the door of a property at which he was welcome.\u0026#8217Procurator fiscal depute Eoin McGinty said it \u0026#8216could not have been any clearer that he was not welcome\u0026#8217 and cited the witness walking around the block and closing her curtains to avoid Deavy.Finding the charge against Deavy not proven, Sheriff Hughes said he thought the accused probably broke the window but there was insufficient evidence to prove it beyond reasonable doubt.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"campbeltowns european drum major champion","story":"Last Saturday, Campbeltown drum major Liam Renton, 25, won his second European title: 2018 European Adult Drum

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.

She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.

Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.  The mussel shell is one of two works of art funded by Tesco at a cost of \u0026pound76,000 as part of the council\u0026rsquos Percent for Art policy, which was a condition of planning consent for the company\u0026rsquos present store.

Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"phonebox-removed-from-centre-of-haddington","story":"  The phonebox, outside the police station on Court Street, was removed by BT last Tuesday.

Among the issues highlighted at the public meeting were long waits to get through to the surgery by telephone failure of repeat prescriptions poor communication with patients very long waiting times to see a named GP lack of continuity of care and treatment difficulties with NHS 24 and test results not being given out by doctors.  Concerns were also raised about GP training and recruitment, the area\u0026rsquos growing population causing additional pressures on local health services, the cost of calling the surgery and the idea of an online booking system.  Last Wednesday, Ms Dugdale asked the Scottish Government what discussions it has had with NHS Lothian regarding general practitioner services in Musselburgh.  Shona Robison, who was Cabinet Secretary for Health and Sport at the time, said: \u0026ldquoNHS 24 is delivering a pilot at the Riverside GP practice in Musselburgh whereby it is triaging patients who have requested same-day GP appointments. Where appropriate, NHS 24 will signpost patients to areas of the primary care system that are better placed to meet their needs, often more swiftly. \u0026ldquoIndications are that the pilot is working well, with a number of patients signposted to more appropriate support, freeing up GPs to deal with patients with more complex needs. A full evaluation is underway with a report due in the coming weeks, which will be shared with health boards and integration authorities.  Ms Dugdale commented: \u0026ldquoEarlier this month, 200 angry Musselburgh residents turned out at a public meeting because they have had real and persistent difficulties in accessing GPs locally. They do not think that the pilot is working that well. Many of the problems are caused by a GP shortage - a point that the practice and the British Medical Association have acknowledged. Can the cabinet secretary explain to my constituents why they have to phone NHS 24 to see their GP and when she expects Scotland\u0026rsquos GP shortage to be resolved?  Ms Robison said: \u0026ldquoThe pilot that NHS 24 is running is a system that has worked well elsewhere and that has had strong evaluation, so I urge Kezia Dugdale to wait for the formal evaluation of the pilot. I am happy for her to be furnished with the evaluation if she would be interested in that.  \u0026ldquoWith regard to the way forward for general practice, she will be aware of the new contract that has been put in place with substantial resources to back it up. In this financial year, we will invest \u0026pound100 million to support the new contract, and we also have the ambition to increase the number of GPs by at least 800 over the next 10 years. In addition, the multidisciplinary team will make sure that we can reduce the workload of GPs.  Mr Whitfield told the Courier: \u0026ldquoAt the recent GP public meeting, Kezia and I agreed to take the concerns raised back to the practice, but also to NHS Lothian and the Scottish Government. Kezia has acted swiftly to challenge the Health Secretary on the issue and demand she does more to alleviate the problems experienced in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoWe have also passed on the issues and questions highlighted at the meeting to the practice. Once we receive a response we will share it with those who attended. We will also keep up the pressure locally and nationally for further action to help patients here receive the service they need.  Mr Dugdale later said the appropriate steps needed to be taken to support \u0026ldquostruggling GP practices and prevent further closures.  Miles Briggs, Lothian Conservative MSP, who also took part in the Holyrood debate, later said: \u0026ldquoThe Health Secretary\u0026rsquos assurance that the pilot is working well in Musselburgh is totally at odds with the experience of many local patients who have expressed very real concerns about delays in getting through and arranging a routine GP appointment.  \u0026ldquoMinisters and NHS Lothian need to respond to what are genuine issues being experienced by local residents and to take urgent action to address these."},{"url":null,"title":"harry-potter-stars-are-heading-to-musselburgh-this-summer","story":"  Stars of the movies will be taking part in the summer event which is being held at Loretto School and raising funds for Children\u0026rsquos Hospices Across Scotland (CHAS).

Searching for frog spawn and wee tadpoles is often a key childhood memory. But there are things we know about without really knowing about them.  This thought came to me as I searched for tadpoles and wee frogs in a pond last weekend with a group of parents and their children.  I love nature and believe it is a powerful part of all of us, which is why going to the woods or the beach, or just the general \u0026lsquocountryside\u0026rsquo, is an antidote for the stress of life.  But the truth is we don\u0026rsquot really have to go far to reach nature it\u0026rsquos all around us.  The spider\u0026rsquos web on the hedge, the birds on the roof that wake us in the mornings, the self-seeded flowers which grow in places all around our towns, the trees which blossom then turn our streets green, the wee beasties in our garden soil, the list goes on and on.  Yet it is so easy to rush past all the magic which is just on our doorstep.  And as I watched the wee frogs swimming in the pond last week, I discovered just how much I don\u0026rsquot know and have missed.  That\u0026rsquos the joy of having young children, I think: they are a passport for you as a \u0026lsquogrown-up\u0026rsquo to explore the world with a sense of fascination that we all once had, and can be rekindled.  You see, I\u0026rsquod never actually thought about how a tadpole changes into a frog.  In the day-to-day living of life I suppose it\u0026rsquos understandable it is not an issue we will spend too much time thinking about.  But as I watched the wee frogs come up from the mud to the surface to breathe, then swim down again, I realised we were looking down on a simple but fascinating miracle of nature.  Then a wee frog literally jumped from a stone onto my son\u0026rsquos hand.  He could have squashed it or even been frightened by it, but instead he said \u0026ldquowow.  The wee creature jumped from his hand onto mine, obviously looking for a way back to the safety of the water.  Carefully, and a bit reluctantly, he helped the wee \u0026lsquobaby frog\u0026rsquo back into the water where it swam back down to the mud.  That\u0026rsquos when I realised I knew about the process without knowing about it.  There were some frogs which looked like late developers compared to their cousins, for they seemed to be more tadpole than frog, still swimming about with a tail between their developing frog legs.  The whole spectacle was, honestly, fascinating. I found myself being in awe at the process that we all know about but don\u0026rsquot really know about.  And so as summer has reached us, I am determined to make it a Safari of Discovery on our doorstep.  I will share this journey with you the places, stories and folklore attached to them. And while I cannot claim to be an expert on nature, I know its spiritual importance and I think that is a good beginning.  My first port of call will be the wood of what my kids call the \u0026ldquoserpent trees.  Where is that? You\u0026rsquoll find out next week!  In the meantime, I will have to keep this week\u0026rsquos page short as it is my daughter Manja\u0026rsquos ninth birthday and I have mermaid tails to connect. . ."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7697530.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"council-calls-for-rejection-of-substation-plans","story":"  East Lothian Council will submit its formal objection to the proposals to a Scottish Government reporter after officials were given the unanimous support of elected councillors at a meeting of the local authority on Tuesday.  A planning application for the substation by Inch Cape Offshore Limited (ICOL) was called in by Scottish Ministers in a controversial move in April and will now be decided by the reporter instead of the council.  ICOL wants to bring offshore energy from a planned windfarm off the Angus coast onto land at Cockenzie by building the substation on the footprint of the former power station.  A previous planning application siting the substation further inland had been given planning permission but that permission lapsed instead of renewing it, ICOL decided to pursue a new site.  In its argument to Scottish Ministers, the council will state that the substation is \u0026ldquonot the best use of the land and point out that planning permission had been given at another site.  Councillor Norman Hampshire said: \u0026ldquoBecause of the location, we have to recommend it should be refused. We have done a lot of work to move this proposal forward and this action jeopardises that.  \u0026ldquoI think if everybody had worked together we could have got a development on a site the council, developers and communities could have supported.  Earlier this month, representatives of ICOL were challenged by Prestonpans Community Council to name any independent party that support the planned location of the substation.  Brian Weddell, community council chairman, told the ICOL representatives that there had been no public consultation about the new site.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are against it, Cockenzie and Port Seton Community Council are against it, East Lothian Council and Scottish Natural Heritage are against it.  \u0026ldquoShow us anyone, apart from Inch Cape, who think it is a good site.  Ian Johnson, ICOL project manager, said: \u0026ldquoWe are naturally disappointed that East Lothian Council officers have recommended refusal to the application on the grounds that it could prejudice future development of the area. ICOL have been and will continue to work with the council to look at options to reduce the footprint of the site and ensure that other potential future developments can co-exist next to the substation.  However, he made it clear there were no plans to consider an alternative site, telling the Courier: \u0026ldquoWe have no intention of moving the proposed site of the onshore transmission works again.

Boasting one of the oldest golf courses in the world \u0026ndash Musselburgh Links, The Old Course \u0026ndash the town was once home to the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers, who now play at Muirfield, near Gullane.  The Honourable Company brought other Edinburgh clubs to the town such as Royal Burgess, Bruntsfield and the Warrender.  The exhibition celebrates the days from 1836 to the early 20th century when Musselburgh was at the forefront of the game\u0026rsquos development.  It not only celebrates the golf clubs which played in the town over the years but also the many golf club and ball makers, and professional players, who made their living in the town between 1836 and 1900 \u0026ndash a period of dramatic growth in the game.  The display has been organised by Musselburgh Museum and Heritage Group in partnership with Mungo Park, whose great-grandfather Willie Park Senior, from Wallyford, won the first Open Championship at Prestwick in 1860 and went on to be a four-time Open champion.  Willie\u0026rsquos brother Mungo and son Willie Junior were also Open champions at Musselburgh Links.  Two other local men \u0026ndash Bob Ferguson, who won a hat-trick of Open Championships, and David Brown \u0026ndash complete the town\u0026rsquos five Open champions, with 11 wins between them.  Support for the exhibition has also been received from East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos economic development and strategic investment department and Musselburgh Common Good Fund.  The exhibition, which runs from July 6 to September 1, is to be officially opened by Lord Wemyss, whose family has been involved with golf since the early 18th century.  On display are a large number of golf items and memorabilia donated by golf clubs that were formerly located at Musselburgh Links. Artefacts from the British Golf Museum and private collections can also be viewed.  The exhibition includes significant artefacts that have not been seen publicly in Scotland for decades, among them Charles Lees\u0026rsquo famous painting A Summer Evening on the Musselburgh Links: Golfers, which recently sold at Bonhams.

The land had previously been owned by Sainsbury\u0026rsquos who had permission for a new supermarket there but their long-stalled plans were finally ditched when they sold the land earlier this year.  A public exhibition took place at the town\u0026rsquos John Gray Centre last Tuesday where those behind the plans were on hand to answer local residents\u0026rsquo questions.  Alex Mitchell, director of Zander Planning, admitted there had been a \u0026ldquomixed reaction from the people who turned up.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have had a great turnout \u0026ndash some people have been supportive and think that it will be of benefit to the town but others are worried about what it will do to the town centre.  Alastair Dickie, development director at Ediston Real Estate, which are behind the plans, added: \u0026ldquoI think there have been a lot of valid comments.  The names of the businesses looking to move into the site have not yet been revealed but it is hoped that their identities will become public by the time a planning application is submitted to East Lothian Council.  Mr Mitchell hopes a detailed planning application will be lodged before the end of the summer. He said: \u0026ldquoIf we can get an application in by about September then we\u0026rsquore probably looking at six months for planning [approval]. If we get [that] we could be on-site in spring 2019.  \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom sure retailers would want to be open before Christmas but that is probably a bit tight so we\u0026rsquod be looking at early 2020.  Mr Mitchell also attempted to allay fears over the volume of traffic on the road by adding: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore looking to create a filter lane so people coming in [to the new retail park] would not cause queues for people getting into the town.  Paul Darling, one of the planning liaison officers at the town\u0026rsquos community council, attended the exhibition.  He said the buildings proposed were \u0026ldquougly but added: \u0026ldquoI am not against the plans, I just think the buildings have to be more in-keeping with the rest of the town.  \u0026ldquoI think that it could actually bring people to the town but it is a bit of a worry what could happen to the shops in the town centre.

Among those representing the Dundee university is Emily Peterson, from Dunbar.

The team, who make up Blacklight Games, created Firepoint \u0026ndash a first-person mixed reality simulator which aims to bring a new level of realism to firefighter training.  Using HoloLens and Windows Mixed Reality technology, the game allows trainees to see through the eyes of a firefighter as they make their way through a multi-storey training ground tackling a variety of different issues.  It is hoped the simulator can eventually be used at open days or recruitment fairs.  The former Dunbar Grammar School pupil told the Courier the idea had evolved over time before resulting in the final product.  Originally, proposals looked at creating a game involving a maze.  However, a discussion with a firefighter saw the focus of the project, which is the work of eight third year students, change.  Emily said: \u0026ldquoMatthew McAuley, from our team, had a friend who worked for the fire service.  \u0026ldquoI think he got the initial from there and said why don\u0026rsquot we come up with that.  \u0026ldquoWe had been making the initial concept like a maze and it is something you can still see in the final build of the game.

A team from Manchester University was crowned the overall UK winner with Abertay finishing as the runner-up.  Now, both universities will send teams to the final.

Mrs Paul said that, while she was not against giving young people a place of their own, she felt the shelter \u0026ndash which sits to the rear of the home the couple have lived in for 18 years \u0026ndash was not the right location.

Derek Costello, club convenor, said: \u0026ldquoPancreatic Cancer Scotland is the Labour club\u0026rsquos nominated charity and we will continue to support Walter\u0026rsquos family and friends in their fundraising efforts in memory of Walter, who was a well-loved and respected member of our club.  Fiona Brown from the charity was delighted to receive the cheque and said the proceeds would go to help raise awareness of pancreatic cancer, which is the fifth most common cause of cancer death in the UK as the majority of patients are diagnosed too late for potentially curative surgery.  Walter, who lived in Prestonpans with Janet, was just 60 when he died. He had been diagnosed with the disease only 29 days earlier.  Wife Janet has vowed to continue campaigning to raise funds and awareness in her husband\u0026rsquos memory.  She said: \u0026ldquoI cannot thank everyone enough for the support they have given me and my family over the past 18 months.  \u0026ldquoRaising awareness of pancreatic cancer is just as important as the fundraising and I would urge everyone to learn and understand the symptoms of this \u0026lsquosilent cancer\u0026rsquo.  November is Pancreatic Cancer Awareness months and more information can be found on the charities website www.pancanscot.org."},{"url":null,"title":"rnli-called-out-after-man-blisters-feet-at-belhaven-beach","story":"  Dunbar\u0026rsquos RNLI crew was called out on Saturday (June 30) evening after reports of a man burning his feet at Belhaven Beach.  The volunteers arrived on the scene shortly after 5.35pm to find the man with \u0026ldquosevere blisters on his feet and in considerable pain.  A spokesman for the Dunbar RNLI said: \u0026ldquoHe and his partner had been enjoying a barbecue on the beach.  \u0026ldquoWhen the barbecue cooled they moved it elsewhere but the man stood on sand where the disposable tray had been sitting.  \u0026ldquoThe heat of the sand was such his feet blistered.  \u0026ldquoCrew members used burn bags to protect the man\u0026rsquos feet as they, with help from two surfers, transferred him to the lifeboat.  \u0026ldquoThey then headed to the nearby chalets at Shore Road, where an ambulance crew was waiting to treat the man for his injuries.  The RNLI thanked the two surfers for raising the alarm and also offering assistance in guiding the crew to the exact location and transferring the man for treatment.  The spokesman added: \u0026ldquoThe recent warm weather is ideal for beach barbecues but we would urge people to take care.  \u0026ldquoEven when a barbecue has cooled the heat of the sand underneath can be considerable, as this man\u0026rsquos injuries demonstrated."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024011.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"university-delight-for-inspirational-paul","story":"  Paul Hannigan was just 12 years old when doctors discovered three tumours on his brain, called a multifocal germinoma, which were affecting his sight.  They also found five secondary tumours at the top of his spine.  By the age of 13, the brave teenager had completed a high dose of radiotherapy to his brain and spinal cord following a biopsy.  Despite his health challenges, Paul, who is now 30, received a Bachelor of Engineering with Honours in Computer Systems and Networks degree at a graduation ceremony at the Usher Hall last week.  His family, including mum Angela, 52, and sisters Laura, 34, and Aleigh, 21, were filled with pride to see him receive his degree.  He was also awarded the Rob Kemmer Prize, receiving \u0026pound100 in recognition of his \u0026ldquooutstanding achievements on his individual programme of study.  Paul, of Burns Wynd, is now planning to return to Napier after the summer to complete his Master\u0026rsquos Degree.  Angela, who has been Paul\u0026rsquos full-time carer, said: \u0026ldquoI\u0026rsquom incredibly proud of Paul.  \u0026ldquoDespite his challenges he just gets on with things and has achieved his degree.  \u0026ldquoHe has had a tough life but he does not give up and is an incredibly caring young man.  \u0026ldquoNothing is going to stop Paul.  Angela revealed that Paul was a pupil at Musselburgh Grammar School when his condition was first diagnosed.  She said: \u0026ldquoPaul was having trouble with his eyesight and the school contacted me to say they thought it was getting worse.  \u0026ldquoIt was when he was referred to the Eye Pavilion in Edinburgh they discovered the tumours were the cause of it.  \u0026ldquoHe had multifocal germinoma tumours and secondary cancer caused the spinal lesions.  Although the radiotherapy cured his tumour, it had other detrimental effects.  Paul is registered blind as a result of the radiotherapy to his visual nerves and also has a curvature of the spine.  The pituitary gland in his brain has failed completely, so he needs to take hormone replacements and he also finds it difficult to open his jaw, which is thought to be due to scar tissue following radiotherapy.  It was when he was working as a volunteer at Musselburgh Citizens Advice Bureau that Paul first became interested in developing his computer skills, attending both Edinburgh College and Napier for four years.  Angela said: \u0026ldquoPaul doesn\u0026rsquot have an assistant at Napier and he travels there independently.  \u0026ldquoHe has some vision out of the side of one eye and the centre of the other.  \u0026ldquoThe university helped with extra large screens for him and giving him more time his teachers are all delighted for him.  Paul hopes that his achievement will inspire others with illness and disabilities to follow their dreams and aspirations.  He said: \u0026ldquoTo graduate with a degree is massive. It took a while to get here from secondary school.  \u0026ldquoI am looking forward to returning to Napier for a year to do my Master\u0026rsquos Degree. They have given huge support.  Paul is hoping to get a job based in computer security once he finishes his studies."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/8024055.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"couple-get-permission-to-turn-old-bar-back-into-pub","story":"  Michael and Wendy Peters took over the Gardeners Arms in Haddington in 2011 when its licence had come under review because of problems experienced by previous management.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board last Thursday heard that since the Peters took charge of the pub there had not been a single complaint about it.  Now the couple have applied for permission to turn the building next door \u0026ndash which currently operates as Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen \u0026ndash into a pub which they plan to name the New Pheasant.  The name is a reference to the building\u0026rsquos previous history as The Pheasant pub before it shut in 2009.  Mr and Mrs Peters\u0026rsquo agent highlighted articles in the Courier to the licensing board that showed the problems at the Gardeners Arms before the couple took it over.  He said: \u0026ldquoBefore they took over there were some interesting Courier articles which described the pub as a disgrace.  \u0026ldquoSince they took over, the Courier articles were about a disgraced pub being turned around.  Applying for a major variation to the current licence held by Jo\u0026rsquos Kitchen, the agent said that the Peters\u0026rsquo current role managing the Gardeners Arms was coming to an end next month and they were keen to move on to their own establishment.  The board heard two objections had been received, along with two letters of support, all from neighbouring residents.  Both objections raised concerns about noise, as well as pointing out that there were already three pubs in the town with \u0026lsquoto let\u0026rsquo signs up. But the board was told the fact other pubs were available to let was not relevant.  Rudy Fruzynski, East Lothian licensing standards officer, told the board he was happy to support the application, confirming that there had been no complaints about the operation of the Gardeners Arms since the Peters took over.  He added: \u0026ldquoIn recent times, the anti-social behaviour team has received a substantial complaint made by a resident in the area complaining about late-evening noise with persons congregating on Market Street and using nearby Cross Lane as a thoroughfare from High Street.  \u0026ldquoThis problem cannot be directly attributed to licensed premises on Market Street. It is more likely to be related to the make-up of the area as a whole, being a focal point for persons seeking the services of many different types of business that are open in the evenings, particularly at weekends.  The board unanimously approved the application, with a request from Police Scotland agreed for children under the age of 15 to vacate the new premises by 8pm and 16 and 17-year-olds to leave by 10pm.  A request from Police Scotland for outdoor drinking hours to be reduced from 9pm to 8pm was not supported by the licensing board as it conflicted with the current hours for the Gardeners Arms."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/6802523.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"earwigs-eat-into-coastal-car-park-profits","story":"  Calls have been made for a detailed review of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos parking charges policy at the county\u0026rsquos coastal car parks amid claims by opponents that once the costs had been taken away the entire scheme only made a profit of about \u0026pound6,000 in its second year.  And council official admitted that while the income from the charges was increasing year on year, it was not expected to come close to the \u0026pound300,000 included in the administration\u0026rsquos budget for this financial year, with an estimated gross income of \u0026pound238,000 predicted.  It was also revealed at a meeting of the council\u0026rsquos policy and performance review committee that the council pays the Earl of Wemyss one third of the income from Longniddry Bents car parks No 1, No 2 and No 3, on top of a \u0026pound10,000 lease, as the car parks are part of the Wemyss and March Estate.  Since the introduction of the charges in 2015, those three car parks have brought in just under \u0026pound75,000 in income.  In total, the money collected from the 10 coastal car park sites which charge since it was introduced has been \u0026pound343,212.45.  However, the cost of the scheme was questioned at the meeting.  East Lothian Council introduced a \u0026pound2-a-day charge for using the three Longniddry Bents car parks and those at Barn Ness, Gullane Bents, John Muir Country Park, Shore Road at Belhaven, Tyninghame Links, Whitesands and Yellowcraig in 2015.  The initial cost of introducing the scheme, which included ticketing machines, signs and introducing double yellow lines at various locations, was about \u0026pound900,000.  A further \u0026pound425,000 is earmarked to be invested this year in improving toilet facilities at the Longniddry car parks.  Season passes are available for \u0026pound40 a year and just under 3,000 are currently being used.  A report on the income from the car parks revealed that in its first year the scheme brought in \u0026pound98,795 with costs of \u0026pound4,977.  However, it said in its second year the gross income was just over \u0026pound169,000 while costs rose substantially to nearly \u0026pound94,000.  In the last financial year, gross income grew to \u0026pound188,000 while the costs were at about \u0026pound83,000.  Among the reasons given for the rise in costs were \u0026pound55,000 which is paid towards East Lothian\u0026rsquos private parking attendants and the cost of replacing machines which had been vandalised by people trying to break into them, as well as rental fees for the Longniddry car parks and payment to a private company which collects the money from the machines and provides IT access so they can be monitored.  Peter Forsyth, service manager with the council, said the cost of replacing four machines last year had been \u0026pound25,000 and he revealed there was an unusual bug problem.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe have been affected by equipment failure due to bugs, earwigs and such, who like to nest in the equipment. They are not covered by our warranty.  Councillor Paul McLennan, who is part of the SNP Group which has opposed the car park fees from the start, said he estimated that, between costs of the scheme and interest generated from the initial loans, in its second year it would have made just \u0026pound6,000 profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe business case is not stacking up.  However, Jim Lamond, the council\u0026rsquos head of finance, said the scheme was never intended to make profits.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is not in the budget as an income-generating activity. It is in there for improving the coastal car parks and ultimately that has been done.  Councillor Jeremy Findlay (Con) said people in his ward in Gullane did not feel they were seeing improvement in facilities at their car park. He said: \u0026ldquoIt was sold to people as a way to invest in facilities and they are not seeing it.  However, Councillor John McMillan (Lab), cabinet spokesperson for economic development, said a review would have to take in the bigger picture.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt needs to look at the impact on economic development and benefits it is bringing into East Lothian as well.  The committee agreed to ask for a detailed review of the scheme."},{"url":null,"title":"delve-into-haddingtons-history-this-summer","story":"  An exhibition of the history of Haddington opened its doors at the John Gray Centre last week in the town as it celebrates 700 years since King Robert The Bruce awarded it a Royal Charter.  The collection looks at seven centuries of life in the town and was officially opened by Provost John McMillan who brought along a portrait of his grandfather, who shared his name and joined the army in 1918 as one of many underage young men keen to defend their country.  Mr McMillan said he hoped the exhibition would encourage people to explore their own family history and look into their ancestry.  The Bruce Charter, which is the oldest document held in the John Gray archives, is not on display during the exhibition because it has to be kept in conservation conditions, but people can view it during the archive\u0027s opening hours.  Some of the less ancient items were on display at the Haddington Show at the weekend when archivists from the centre set up a stall in the crafts tent.  There they displayed some old images from shows gone by and a book of the show\u0027s records from 1820.  Interestingly some of the family names in the nearly 200-year-old records were still well know in the communities.  Exploring themes such as royalty, religion, health, education, wartime and crime and punishment, the exhibition aims to bring stories from the archives to life.  Haddington was one of the most important towns in medieval Scotland, and even had a royal palace, the birthplace of King Alexander II.  One of the items on display is a sick note from Mary Queen of Scots \u0026ndash the Queen asks the burgh to excuse Philip Gibson from military service because he was too corpulent to ride his horse!  Other characters featured include Agnes Blaik and Elizabeth Golight, two ladies of ill repute who were accused of entertaining dragoons. Both were convicted \u0026ndash Elizabeth Golight in particular was named a \u0026lsquovicious strumpet\u0026rsquo by the court. They were sentenced to stand at the market cross with a paper announcing their crime attached to their clothes, and thereafter they were to be drummed out of the town.  In medieval Haddington crime certainly did not pay and punishments were harsh. Criminals could be sentenced to death and the burgh account books include costs for building the gallows and the purchase of ropes for executions.  Gallows Green (where Bellevue House stands) gets its name from being the place the gallows were situated, and there is evidence that hangings also took place from the Nungate bridge.  Punishments for lesser crimes were harsh and cruel \u0026ndash those caught stealing could be sentenced to a whipping by the hangman, banished from the burgh, branded with the town key, or have an ear nailed to the pillory post!  While much of the exhibition concentrates on the medieval period more modern topics including the Glasgow Overspill are featured.  In 1958 Haddington signed the first Overspill Agreement in Scotland with Glasgow which was bursting at the seams with a post war housing crisis while other parts of the country were sparse. Haddington Town Council agreed to provide 250 houses for Glasgow families, increasing the town\u0027s population by 20 per cent.  which would result in a 20% increase in population. The original Overspill Agreement is on display in the exhibition.  This exhibition offers a glimpse into the lives of the townspeople of the past, and tries to demonstrate the central role Haddington played in events of national significance. Seven Centuries of Haddington is on display until the end of September and is well worth a visit."},{"url":null,"title":"new-life-coming-for-pub","story":"  Officers were called to the Masons Arms on Belhaven High Street at 6.50am on March 31 following an undisclosed incident.  Details of what happened have not been released publicly, although the Courier understands that it followed a private function on the premises the previous evening.  In April, Police Scotland asked East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos licensing board to review the pub\u0026rsquos licence and that of its manager Christopher Darling.  However, at a meeting last week, the board was told that Mr Darling had parted company with the pub owners and the premises was currently closed.  James Hughes, who currently runs Dunbar Golf Club, asked the board to consider transferring the licence to him as he revealed ambitious plans to invest \u0026pound50,000 in the business with a view to eventually taking ownership of the property.  Mr Hughes told the board that he was preparing to sign a five-year-lease of the pub with its current owner in a deal which would allow him to buy it at the end of the lease.  He said that there were plans to renovate the building to open it up more and make it a family-friendly site.  Mr Hughes told the meeting: \u0026ldquoWe plan to make it a good country food and beer premises.  \u0026ldquoIt is in an area steeped in history with [Belhaven] Brewery and a popular tourism area, and we want to turn it into a good welcoming family pub.  Mr Hughes, who has been at Dunbar Golf Club for several years, told the board he had more than 23 years of experience in the licensed trade and had worked in Edinburgh before moving to East Lothian.  He said that if given approval to go ahead the pub could re-open early next year.

Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  We were inundated with hundreds of votes from across Scotland, the UK and as far afield as the Netherlands, Sweden and the US, and our quest got folk talking and reminiscing in offices, pubs and on social media, revisiting and celebrating the music that has been the soundtrack to their lives.  So, here we have it: Scotland\u0026rsquos top 10 favourite albums.  10 \u0026ndash Raintown, Deacon Blue, 1987    The band\u0026rsquos debut is packed to the rafters with sheer quality and from beginning to end simply never lets up. Dundonian singer-songwriter Ricky Ross showcased his talent, intent and also a keen political and social awareness across 13 songs, among them Scotland\u0026rsquos other national anthem, Dignity.  9 \u0026ndash High Land, Hard Rain, Aztec Camera, 1983    Could Roddy Frame really only have been 18 when he recorded Oblivious, Walk Out to Winter and We Could Send Letters? East Kilbride\u0026rsquos boy wonder emerges fully formed on this astonishing debut album from 1983, having soaked up the pop, soul and punk influences of his prodigious musical youth and reimagined them as perfectly-crafted jangle-pop. The sound of young Scotland has rarely sounded this fresh.  8 \u0026ndash Strange Kind of Love, Love and Money, 1988    Though Love and Money\u0026rsquos particular brand of literate, glossy soul-pop looked to America for inspiration, lyrics about \u0026ldquoraining on Jocelyn Square were resolutely, affectionately Glaswegian. In another place, another time, Love and Money could have been the biggest band in the world.  7 \u0026ndash If You\u0026rsquore Feeling Sinister, Belle and Sebastian, 1996    Second albums are supposed to be difficult but Belle and Sebastian arguably never surpassed the stunning collection of songs that comprised their sophomore effort, giving a masterclass in how to mix melody, melancholy, nostalgia and humour.  6 \u0026ndash Bandwagonesque, Teenage Fanclub, 1991    The album that thrust Teenage Fanclub into the indie big league. From opening track The Concept to the closing echoes of Is This Music?, it is jam-packed with all the qualities fans have come to love about Bellshill\u0026rsquos finest four-piece: Byrds-influenced, melody-rich songs delivered in an endearing, gently shambolic fashion.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  5 \u0026ndash Heaven Or Las Vegas, The Cocteau Twins, 1990    Elizabeth Fraser\u0026rsquos otherworldly voice set over Robin Guthrie\u0026rsquos ethereal soundtrack is one of Scotland\u0026rsquos greatest musical pleasures and treasures, and this most accessible of Cocteau\u0026rsquos albums is simply awash with blissed-out grandeur. Could they really have been from Grangemouth? Oh yes.  4 \u0026ndash A Walk Across the Rooftops, The Blue Nile, 1984    Sounding nothing like anything else that came out of Scotland, the UK or indeed anywhere else in 1984, this debut fused spare synth precision with exuberant vocal sincerity to stunning effect. Tinseltown in the Rain, that bittersweet slice of cinematic perfection, remains the ultimate ode to Glasgow.  3 \u0026ndash The Midnight Organ Fight, Frightened Rabbit, 2008    Since Scott Hutchison\u0026rsquos untimely death in May, listening to the music he and his bandmates created has been a particularly sad and difficult task. But this album is simply too good to stop listening to. Revisiting is painful but cathartic, and like all of the \u0026nbspHutchison\u0026rsquos work, it makes you feel like it\u0026rsquos okay to be sad.\u0026nbsp  2 \u0026ndash I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything, The Trashcan Sinatras, 1993    From post-Smiths jangleism on their debut the Ayrshire gang blossomed to reveal an emotionally rich and enduring marriage of musicality and lyrical nous never before seen within spitting distance of Irvine or anywhere else, crowned by flawless performances by one of Scottish pop\u0026rsquos most devastating singers, Eddi Reader\u0026rsquos younger brother Frank.  1 \u0026ndash Hats, The Blue Nile, 1989    Only seven songs in length, Hats is a masterpiece of love, loss and redemption writ large over a lush, soulful and at times overwhelmingly beautiful soundscape, inseparable from the city of its birth, Glasgow. For almost 30 years it has offered endless inspiration and comfort. \u0026ldquoWhen all the rainy pavements lead to you, sings a heartbroken Paul Buchanan on From a Late Night Train. The rainy pavements of Glasgow will always lead to Hats.  Herald writers pick their favourite Scottish albums  Here\u0027s what you said about Hats:  Christine Gardner, Rotterdam: Head and shoulders above the rest. A magnificent album that I continue to listen to regularly after almost 30 years. It is quite simply a masterpiece. It continues to draw you in, delight your senses, touch your emotions and somehow mirror your own very personal experiences. And yet it is also essentially Scottish \u0026ndash maybe something to do with our collective psyche, despite all our individual differences.  Martin McCarthy: Hats has so many layers, from dreamy songs like Over the Hillside and Let\u0026rsquos Go Out Tonight to more upbeat songs like Headlights on the Parade and \u0026ldquoThe Downtown Lights.  Saturday Night is just a sublime song, I love the pitch perfect bass, the stunning keyboards and Paul Buchanan\u0027s emotional voice. This was played at our wedding to a full dancefloor and will always be so special. The songs on Hats convey love, beauty, pain and loss, and can push me to tears of utter joy and euphoria.  Alex Watkins: It\u0026rsquos the album I always return to just something about the memories and emotions it always conjures up.  Kevin Jackson: Hats is the best album ever recorded anywhere by anyone. It touches you in a way that others must stand back in awe and adoration of. It is a thing of perfection. When some of the finest innovative talents of our time see it as one of the greatest albums ever, it is because it has no peers.  Peter Morgan: I\u0027m going to plump for Hats, that lush, aching, bruised and battered homage to love and loss.  John Reader: I listen to a lot of music, including lots of new stuff but always have Hats on at some point every week. Still hooks me in with its lush simplicity. I remember saying to someone more than 25 years ago that of all the music around at that time I reckoned I\u0027d be listening to Hats for the rest of my life. Not wrong so far.  Colin Lunn: I love A Walk Across the Rooftops, the best first album by any group, not only in Scotland but worldwide. However, Hats was probably a better, more perfect album although it didn\u0026rsquot have the same influence. Tough, tough choice but I\u0026rsquoll go for Hats by a very, very fine margin.  Here\u0026rsquos what you had to say about some of the other music on the list:  Kyle Wallace: I\u0027ve Seen Everything by the Trashcan Sinatras is part of the soundtrack to my life. Listened to it through my dad\u0027s death and the college years. So many great songs associated with great memories.  John Richards: This was a very difficult choice. Scottish groups (I\u0027m Welsh) have a disproportionately large place in my music collection \u0026ndash particularly those who came to prominence in the 1980s. My top 20 regularly features the work of the Blue Nile, Danny Wilson, Aztec Camera, Deacon Blue and Love \u0026amp Money. However, it\u0027s got to be an album from the year I turned 19, when I went to university and the myriad possibilities that life had to offer opened up before me. The song (and album) that soundtracked that life-changing period is still my favourite Scottish album: Strange Kind of Love by Love \u0026amp Money.  Stuart Duncan: My vote is for The Midnight Organ Fight by Frightened Rabbit. An album that, as your writer said, \u0026ldquomakes it feel it\u0026rsquos OK to be sad. The lyrics hit home more than any album I\u0026rsquove ever listened to. Scott Hutchison gave me a feeling that everything was going to be OK, that I would get through things. I\u0026rsquod say he helped changed me as a person. It still hasn\u0026rsquot stuck in that he\u0026rsquos no longer here [Hutchsion took his own life in May] but my vote would be the same regardless of the circumstances.  Danny Tennyson: My favourite album by a Scottish band \u0026ndash or any other band for that matter \u0026ndash has to High Land Hard Rain, by Aztec Camera. The fact that Roddy was probably only 15 or 16 when he wrote most of the tracks for the album makes it all the more remarkable. He continues to be a genius to this day.  Shane Brown, Illinois: Why is it that I live in the centre boring part of America (the states you fly over to get somewhere else interesting), and should by location and birthright be a huge fan of Slipknot, but instead find myself with a vast collection of Scottish indiepop? From the Cocteaus to the Fannies, Belle \u0026amp Sebastian to Teen Canteen, Scottish indiepop has been the soundtrack to my life. How and why the music of your land speaks to me, I\u0027ll never know, but no album speaks to my soul more than Cake by the Trashcan Sinatras \u0026ndash a record I find as comforting as a cup of coffee on a cold winter morning. I really, really love it to this day, and why those lads aren\u0027t universally revered as musical genius is beyond me to this day. I\u0027ve travelled hundreds of miles to see them live and I\u0027ll continue to do so as long as they grace us with the occasional American tour.  John Jauchler, Connecticut: Lots of good stuff on your list, but my vote goes to the Trashcan Sinatras\u0026rsquo I\u0026rsquove Seen Everything. Outstanding musicians and really nice guys as well. Their music has made a difference in my life.

However, part-time students do not have access to the range of loans and bursaries available to full-time students making the cost of studying much harder to meet.  Susan Stewart, director of the Open University in Scotland, has called for the issue to be addressed in a forthcoming Scottish Government consultation.  Ms Stewart said a recent independent review of financial support, chaired by Virgin Money chief executive Jayne-Anne Gadhia, had an opportunity to address the issue, but had \u0026ldquoexcluded part-time students from its recommendations.  art-time study also includes higher proportions of disabled, low income and students from disadvantaged backgrounds compared to full-time study.  Writing in The Herald, Ms Stewart said: \u0026ldquoThese 236,000 part-time students, whether at college or university, aren\u0026rsquot currently eligible for financial support.  \u0026ldquoThe review was a chance to fix that. After all, it cited fairness, parity and clarity as its guiding principles.  Ms Stewart said Open University students often talked about an \u0026ldquoearnings trap where, having left school and started work, they found the cost of rent and childcare too much to pursue part-time study.  She added: \u0026ldquoPutting part-time students at a disadvantage based on the way they need to study doesn\u0026rsquot make sense and is not fair.  \u0026ldquoIt\u0026rsquos also an economic necessity. Demographic trends show us that, in a world of rapidly changing technology, we don\u0026rsquot have enough young people to fill the jobs we know are coming soon.  \u0026ldquoScotland is a small country and we need to take advantage of the talents of all of our people which means they need to be able to re-skill and upskill in order to change jobs and careers \u0026ndash for most people already in work, that means studying part-time.  The call for parity for part-time students was backed by academics and student representatives.  Mary Senior, Scotland Official for the University and College Union, said changes to student funding were a step in the right direction, but more needed to be done.  She said: \u0026ldquoThere needs to be greater flexibility with the timing of loan and bursary payments to address hardship issues students can face over the summer, and we need to ensure vital financial assistance is extended to part-time students.  Liam McCabe, president of student body NUS Scotland, welcomed the Scottish Government\u0026rsquos intention to look at the issue of part-time students.  He added: \u0026ldquoWe hope to see any future recommendations being probably resourced, and aimed at creating greater equity in the system.  Part-time higher education students, regardless of income or background, are not currently eligible for student maintenance support in Scotland.  Students earning less than \u0026pound25,000 may be eligible for the part-time fee grant, which waives tuition fees."},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8028173.jpg?type=article-full","title":"thousands-of-new-scots-homes-bankrolled-by-record-european-loan","story":"  The Wheatley Group unveiled \u0026pound185 million of new funding from the European Investment Bank to help build and improve thousands of affordable homes across Scotland in a landmark deal hailed as by the First Minister as a benefit of Scotland\u0027s EU links.  It also marks a significant step in the wider push to tackle homelessness, high-rents and other housing hardships.  As part of the groundswell Wheatley Group earlier linked up with Edinburgh social enterprise Social Bite, which started as a sandwich bar and won the high-profile support of Prince Harry and George Clooney, to provide flats in Glasgow and across central Scotland for homeless people through the charity Housing First.  The EIB loan, described as being \"by far the largest of its type made in Scotland\", is linked to a commitment by Wheatley to invest \u0026pound400m over the next three years in affordable housing.    Above: Jonathan Taylor,\u0026nbsp Amy Rigby, Nicola Sturgeon, Kyle Wilson  This also includes refurbishing existing homes to meet new Scottish and EU energy-efficiency standards, helping tenants cut energy bills, and housing and integrating refugees into communities.  The deal was announced in Glasgow by EIB vice president Jonathan Taylor at a community event attended by Nicola Sturgeon and tenants, staff and apprentices from across Wheatley, along with local politicians, business, community and social housing leaders.  It takes the amount of funding raised by Wheatley in the past four years to \u0026pound800m and comes in the week the group was confirmed \u0026ndash for the second year running \u0026ndash as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes.  Wheatley is forging ahead with an ambitious building programme, from 2015 through to 2025, of 7,500 affordable new homes across the country in communities including Balloch, Dumbarton, Glasgow, West Lothian, Edinburgh and North Berwick.  Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish Government is committed to reaching its target of 50,000 new affordable homes in three years time \"ensuring people have access to quality housing is a fundamental part of building a fair and equal society\".  She said the deal is \"also another reminder of how Scotland benefits from the EU and its institutions\".  Martin Armstrong, Wheatley chief executive, said the loan enables expansion \"but it is about so much more than simply bricks and mortar\".  \"Wheatley\u0026rsquos mission is to make lives, not just homes, better.\"  The group comprises six registered social landlords: Glasgow Housing Association, Dunedin Canmore, Cube Housing Association, Loretto Housing, West Lothian Housing Partnership and Barony Housing Association.  Alastair MacNish, Wheatley chairman, said: \u0026ldquoIt will help us to consolidate our position as the UK\u0026rsquos largest builder of social-rented homes, which we hold close as a badge of honour at a time when the availability and supply of affordable housing is such an acute priority.  Mr Taylor, speaking at the funding announcement at the Reidvale Neighbourhood Centre in Gallowgate, Glasgow, where GHA, is building 143 homes, said: \"New investment in social housing is crucial to increase the number of affordable homes and cut heating bills in existing properties.  \"This week\u0026rsquos visit to Glasgow provides a valuable opportunity to see how upgrading existing properties and construction of new social housing will improve lives, create skilled jobs, benefit local suppliers and cut heating bills in homes for hundreds of families.  The new \u0026pound185m EIB loan, along with future investments, will enable Wheatley to maintain a building programme of around 650 homes a year from 2021 to early 2025."},{"url":null,"title":"students-from-royal-conservatoire-of-scotland-are-amongst-most-employable-in-uk","story":"  New figures show the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland is the best in the country for graduate employability - and fourth in the UK.  More than 99 per cent of graduates from the conservatoire are in employment or further education six months after graduating.  Robert Gordon University, in Aberdeen, has the second highest employability in Scotland with 97.6 per cent of students securing a job or further study.  Professor Jeffrey Sharkey, principal of the conservatoire, said graduates made a lasting impact across the globe in their specialist fields.  He said: \"The conservatoire is the only place in Europe where you can study all of the performing arts on the one campus and our innovative, multi-disciplinary curriculum equips students with the skills, knowledge and experience to enable them to flourish in the professional world.  \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos national conservatoire is already recognised as one of the most distinctive institutions of its kind in the world and this latest endorsement further cements our status as a national and international centre of excellence for the performing arts.

He said: \"Of all students who graduated last year, some 95.3 per cent were in employment or further study which is higher than the UK average and a real testament to the time and energy our institutions are investing in employability and ensuring that graduates are ready for the world of work.  \"Taken together with recent data revealing that graduates from Scottish universities earn more on average than graduates from elsewhere in the UK, these results demonstrate that our graduates can look forward to very successful careers after their studies.\""},{"url":null,"title":"theresa-may-facing-cabinet-backlash-over-last-ditch-brexit-plan","story":"  The Prime Minister was criticised by leading Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg and former ministers who said she had abandoned her own red line on quitting the EU single market.  One MP called it a \u0026ldquobotch and a \u0026ldquocomplete mess that broke Tory manifesto promises.  The ferocious backlash piles pressure on pro-Brexit cabinet ministers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove to reject Mrs May\u0026rsquos soft Brexit idea at a crunch meeting at Chequers today.  The pair tonight conferred with Brexit Secretary David Davis and other Eurosceptic ministers, including Esther Mcvey and Andrew Leadsom, in Mr Johnson\u0026rsquos office.  It followed reports that Mr Davis was also unhappy about the plan, telling Mrs May the EU would reject it because it would rely on the UK policing EU import tariffs.  Despite backing a single market in goods, the 100-page paper says the UK should diverge from EU rules on services, something Brussels has already dismissed as cherry picking.  After months of kicking the can down the road to avoid walk-outs from her divided cabinet, today\u0027s\u0026nbspmeeting is supposed to settle the UK\u0026rsquos preferred Brexit plan for customs and trade.  A White Paper next week should then form the basis of negotiations with the 27 other EU nations before the October deadline for a EU-UK deal.  Speaking after meeting German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Thursday, Mrs May said she had gathered her cabinet \u0026ldquoto decide on a substantive way forward.  Mrs Merkel said Brexit talks were now entering a \u0026ldquocrucial phase.  The UK\u0026rsquos ability to strike trade deals is seen as a cornerstone of Brexit by its supporters.  However papers given to the Cabinet for the crunch meeting at Chequers about the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint propose a \u0026ldquoharmonisation of UK and EU rules that could scupper this.  They said the UK should make an \u0026ldquoupfront choice to align its rules with the rest of Europe on goods and agriculture, something which would antagonise the US in particular.  Donald Trump\u0026rsquos commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, has already said he wants a post-Brexit UK to open itself up to US goods such as GM crops and chlorinated chicken, which are banned under EU standards, as part of broader transatlantic trading arrangements.  But the Chequers paper says \u0026ldquothe UK should maintain a common rulebook for all goods including agri-food, acknowledging this \u0026ldquowould not allow the UK to accommodate a likely ask from the US in a future trade deal as the UK could not recognise US standards.  Mr Rees-Mogg, chair of a 60-strong group of Eurosceptic Tory MPs, said ending the UK\u0026rsquos regulatory alignment with Europe was a \u0026ldquored line and Mrs May should tear up the plan.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is not Brexit. This common rulebook means that we are essentially a vassal state. This would be directly contrary to the Prime Minister\u0027s own assurances.\"  Former Environment Secretary Owen Paterson said the plan was a botch, a complete mess and a \u0026ldquocomplete breach of Mrs May\u0026rsquos manifesto commitments to leave the single market, the customs union and the European Court of Justice.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe could not eliminate tariffs to reduce prices for consumers and businesses, or strike free trade deals. This would deny the economy the full benefits of Brexit... and be completely at odds with what 17.4m voted for. We would be out of Europe but still run by Europe.  Former Brexit minister David Jones added: \u0026ldquoQuite simply, this is not what people voted for in 2016. This is not Brexit.  Scottish Brexit Secretary Michael Russell said the Tories had become \u0026ldquothe lemming party.  Scottish Secretary David Mundell repeatedly refused to rule out resignations when Mrs May\u0026rsquos deeply divided cabinet assembles at her country retreat today.  He said: \u0026ldquoI think there will be robust discussions. Of course people have strong views in relation to leaving the EU. But at the end of the day it\u0027s about reaching an agreement.  \"I\u0027m confident that we can, and everybody should rally round that.  He said he would ensure any deal protected \u0026ldquothe integrity of the United Kingdom.  After a meeting with UK ministers in London on Thursday, Mr Russell published a list of demands - mostly the status quo - the SNP government wants to see in the UK blueprint.  Sebastian Kurtz, the Austrian Chancellor, said he would support delaying Brexit beyond March 2019 to allow more time for talks to ensure the Irish border issue was resolved.  He said: \u0026ldquoOur goal is to reach agreement [on the border]. If that\u0026rsquos not possible we need to avoid a hard Brexit. If not, it\u0026rsquos good to keep negotiating.  Asked if that meant extending the two-year Article 50 process, he said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquoll see?  Meanwhile Germany Industry UK, which represents 100 companies including BMW, Lufthansa and ThyssenKrupp said it needed \u0026ldquocertainty and clarity about the way forward sooner rather than later over Brexit or German investment in the UK would suffer.  Jaguar Land Rover, Britain\u0026rsquos biggest vehicle manufacturer employing 40,000 people, this week said a bad Brexit would force it to rethink an \u0026pound80bn investment in the UK.  Unite general secretary Len McCluskey said the government was playing \u0026ldquoRussian roulette with tens of thousands of jobs by a government that \u0026ldquoplaces its survival, indulging narrow, extremist views, above the well-being of the people of this country.  Jaguar boss Dr Ralf Speth said the firm and its suppliers faced an \u0026ldquounpredictable future if frictionless trade with the EU and unrestricted access to the single market ended with Brexit."},{"url":null,"title":"questions-asked-of-russia-after-novichok-couple-handled-contaminated-item","story":"  It comes after police say a couple who are critically ill may have been exposed to Novichok from handling a contaminated item.  Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley are currently fighting for their lives in hospital after being poisoned by the toxic chemical substance in Amesbury, Wiltshire, at the weekend.  It follows the highly publicised attack on former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia in Salisbury in March.  Home Secretary Sajid Javid has demanded that the Kremlin provide an explanation for the two episodes, which investigators believe may be linked.  In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Javid said: \"The eyes of the world are currently on Russia, not least because of the World Cup.  \"It is now time that the Russian state comes forward and explains exactly what has gone on.\"  Making clear that the UK will \"stand up to the actions that threaten our security\", he added: \"It is completely unacceptable for our people to be either deliberate or accidental targets, or for our streets, our parks, our towns, to be dumping grounds for poison.\"  Mr Javid told MPs that he \"cannot rule out\" the possibility that the Novichok found in Amesbury was from the same batch used in the Salisbury attack.  However the Russian Embassy has hit back, accusing the Government of trying to \"muddy the waters\" and \"frighten its own citizens\".  Officers were called to a home in Muggleton Road on Saturday morning when 44-year-old Dawn Sturgess collapsed.  They were called back later that day when Charlie Rowley, 45, also fell ill.  Because the highest concentration of Novichok was found on the couple\u0027s hands, police believe the item they handled could be a container or reciprocal -- such as a vial or syringe -- used to transport the nerve agent for the initial attack on the Skripals and discarded in a public place.  Novichok remains highly toxic for a considerable period of time, so even the tiniest trace remaining in a container picked up by the victims could account for their severe illness.  It was initially believed that the two patients had possibly been using drugs from a contaminated batch, police said.  But after further tests, authorities declared a major incident and on Wednesday night counter-terror police assumed responsibility for the investigation after the Government\u0027s Porton Down laboratory concluded that the pair had been exposed to Novichok.  In a press conference, Chief Constable Kier Pritchard of Wiltshire Police defended his force\u0027s initial response, saying that he \"fully supports\" the decisions taken by officers who thought the couple had initially fallen ill after taking illegal drugs.  Amid questions about the post-Salisbury clean-up operation, Home Secretary Javid said the risk to the public remained low.  He added: \"We have taken a very robust approach to decontamination and there is no evidence that either the man or the woman in hospital visited any of the places that were visited by the Skripals.  \"Our strong working assumption is that the couple came into contact with the nerve agent in a different location to the sites which have been part of the original clean-up operation.\"  Earlier yesterday, Security Minister Ben Wallace said the Amesbury couple were not directly targeted.  Mr Wallace told BBC Radio 4\u0027s Today programme: \"The working assumption would be that these are victims of either the consequence of the previous attack, or something else, but not that they were directly targeted.\"  Linking the incident to the attack on the Skripals, Mr Wallace said: \"I think what we said at the time was that this was a brazen and reckless attack in the heart of a very peaceful part of the United Kingdom, and that is part of the anger I feel about the Russian state is that they chose to use clearly a very, very toxic, highly dangerous weapon.\"  Prime Minister Theresa May declared that Salisbury is \"very much open for business\" after residents raised fears that the new case will hamper the local economy.  The Met said that around 100 detectives from the Counter Terrorism Network are working alongside colleagues from Wiltshire police.  Six sites visited by Mr Rowley and Ms Sturgess before they fell ill have been cordoned off. Police have extended this to include all of Muggleton Road and outside the supported living where Ms Sturgess lived.  Debbie Stark, deputy director for Public Health England in the South West, said that anyone who may have been in any of the cordoned-off areas after 10pm last Friday should take some precautionary measures about washing clothing and cleaning jewellery.  The episode in Salisbury - the first use of a nerve agent in Europe since the Second World War - sparked international outrage.  Mr Skripal and his daughter have since left hospital.  A Russian Embassy spokesman said: \"All allegations of Russia\u0027s involvement in the incidents in Salisbury and Amesbury are merely speculative and are not based on objective data of the investigation.\""},{"url":"http://www.heraldscotland.com/resources/images/8030619.jpg?type=article-full","title":"snp-childrens-minister-maree-todd-criticised-for-2lbs-of-sugar-recipe","story":"  Maree Todd, the minister for children and young people, posted her tablet recipe on Twitter despite government plans to restrict the marketing of junk food in shops.

However he hinted the \"say\" could come in the form of an independence referendum.  Nicola Sturgeon has said she intends to tell Holyrood about the timing of any referendum in the autumn.  Mr Russell said there was \u0026ldquono status quo option available because of Brexit.  He said: \u0026ldquoWe are in the most extraordinary, the most difficult times that I can certainly remember. They are not being helped by certainly the most incompetent UK government I have ever seen.  \"So there needs to be a clear choice. If the choice is Brexit Britain in this chaos and mess or independent membership of the EU, that would be a real choice.  Mr Russell was speaking as UK cabinet ministers headed to the Prime Minister\u0026rsquos country house at Chequers for a crunch meeting on the UK\u0026rsquos Brexit blueprint.  A series of Eurosceptic ministers are unhappy with the PM\u0026rsquos preferred soft Brexit, which would keep the UK aligned with EU rules on goods and agriculture, making it much harder for the UK to strike its own international trade deals, including with the US.  Mr Russell told BBC Radio Scotland there was a lack of reality about Mrs May\u0026rsquos plan, as it tried to carve up the EU\u0026rsquos four indivisible freedoms of goods, services, people and capital.  That lack of reality would \u0026ldquohaunt the UK when it tried to reach a deal with the other 27 EU nations on the proposal, he said.  Asked whether there should be a second European referendum, he said: \u0026ldquoI\u0027ve been very sympathetic to that, the only caveat I\u0027ve expressed, and it needs to be resolved, is what happens if that vote were to repeat what happened two years ago - Scotland to vote to stay and the rest of the UK to vote to leave. We couldn\u0027t do that twice. So that has to be resolved.  \u0026ldquoBut I think people do require a say, and we certainly require a say on the final outcome. This is not a second vote, this is a say on the final outcome.\"  Former SNP deputy leader Jim Sillars has warned the SNP not to support LibDem calls for a second EU referendum, as it could set a precedent to re-run a Yes vote on independence.  The LibDems claimed Mr Russell was coming round to their idea of a \u0027People\u0027s Vote\u0027 on the Brexit deal.  MSP Tavish Scott said: \"It appears the SNP are finally starting to see the light. Mike Russell is right that the British people deserve to have the final say on whether Theresa May\u0026rsquos ropey Brexit deal is good enough.  \"He does however need to give up on the constant caveats. This isn\u0026rsquot about political posturing. It\u0026rsquos about warding off economic disaster.  \u0026ldquoPolitical momentum is building for a People\u0026rsquos Vote and hundreds of thousands have taken to the streets to fight for one.

During questions in the Commons, he asked the Minister for Universities, Science, Research and Innovation what the UK Government is doing to increase the take-up of STEM subjects - guaranteeing a generation of well-equipped workers.        Scottish Conservative Mr Clark said: “The Oil \u0026amp Gas Technology Centre in Aberdeen is a major promoter of STEM subjects.“Does the Minister agree that it is essential to prioritise the take-up of STEM subjects if we are to have the engineers and technicians that we need for the future?”Sam Gyimah MP said the English school system had welcomed 17% more entrants to STEM A-levels since 2010, adding:“However, there is clearly a lot more to do, which is why we are focused on doing a lot through careers and through the university system.”                                                                                                        The UK Government is investing an additional £406 million in skills, including maths and digital, including an advanced maths premium, and an £84 million programme to improve the teaching of computing.After the session, Mr Clark said Scotland is behind England in science, maths and reading.He added: “There is also a shortage of STEM teachers in Scotland and it risks undermining children’s opportunities, including at Inverurie Academy in my constituency.“We have to catch up with England and re-establish the world-class education system we once had.                                                                                                        “That’s why it’s disappointing the SNP have deprioritised its education Bill.\"                                                                    "},{"url":null,"title":"encouraging prospects for beef and sheep markets","story":"\t\tThe transformation in the weather since mid-May and the consequent quick growth of grass has given Aberdeen and Northern Marts\u0026#8217 sales of breeding stock a massive boost in recent weeks.\t\t\t\tThe average price of heifers with calves at foot at the latest sale at Thainstone Centre was £150 up on the first seasonal sale at the beginning of May and £350 higher than last year, ANM head of livestock, John Angus reports.                                                    “It is encouraging that we have had more buyers round the ring at the May breeding stock sales and good quality heifers with calves at foot have been making £2,400 to £3,000 a unit,” said Mr Angus.                                                    “We had very little grass growth at the time of the first sale but the situation had completely changed by the time of the next sale three weeks later.”        Mr Angus said the strong trade indicated that confidence was returning to the beef industry and it was good to see herds replacing breeding stock on the back of buoyant prices for store cattle and a measure of stability in the prime cattle market.Highlights included a record price of 13,000gns for a Simmental bull at the spring bull sale at Thainstone and a heifer and calves selling for up to £5,200.“The prospects for the beef market for the second half of the year are looking good, but there are real concerns about the rising cost of fodder and straw due to the diversion of distillery co-products into the energy market and the switch to ryegrass on some farms to feed anaerobic digesters,” he said. “We could do with some rain to make sure silage crops bulk up although some farmers have been cutting grass early for silage out of fear of grass burning up.”Although some older farmers were tending to cut back breeding cow numbers to make life easier for themselves, there were fewer suckler herd dispersals this spring and very few cows and calves have been coming on the market.                                                                                                        Prime and cull cattle manager, Tim McDonald, expects the steady trade for prime cattle to continue and perhaps strengthen in the next few weeks and reports a particularly strong trade for fleshy cull cows. He is looking to England’s involvement in the World Cup in Russia, coupled with the forecast of good weather, to stimulate barbecue parties south of the border and boost the burger market.“The cull cow market has shown a big lift since April when farmers were too busy trying to catch up with drilling and the late spring. Demand for good, fleshy cows for the processing market is particularly strong and we have seen prices hit a top of £1,830,” said Mr McDonald.He also suggests it would be worthwhile for dairy farmers to consider feeding cull dairy cows to put on more flesh rather than marketing them in lean condition at the end of lactation.“The auction system is leading the way in cull cow prices and dairy farmers have the opportunity of making more money from well-fleshed cull dairy cows to supplement their income from milk,” he said.                                                                                                        The first real marker of the new season will be the show and sale of store cattle at Thainstone Centre on Friday, July 13, and as always some of the top suckled calves and stores from the summer shows will be on offer at the annual Spectacular show and sale on August 24.Turning to the sheep market, the phenomenal market for old season lamb continued right through the spring and ANM’s weekly sale at Thainstone Centre was still attracting up to 2,000 head right to the end of May.Prices peaked on April 5 when 4,782 head averaged 284.3p/kg (£126.21/head) with record numbers the following week attracting a massive entry of 7,952 to average 250.5p (£109.72/head).“The strongly rising market saw the auction ring come into its own as prices increased week after week,” said deputy livestock manager, Colin Slessor. “The level of prices achieved would never have been attained without the auction system leading the way and resulting in the strongest spring market for sheep we have seen for many years.“Those hoggs will have been bought in the trough of last autumn’s store trade when prices were down £5/head on the year. Finishers have enjoyed the double benefit of a lower purchase price and a high sale price which will have boosted margins and should augur well for this year’s autumn store lamb sales.”                                                                                                        Trade is being driven by a combination of strong demand, both on the home market and for the export market to Europe, and reduced imports from New Zealand.This season’s prime lamb market has started off on a high with some lambs hitting £130 - £140/head, and the cull ewe trade also rising sharply, peaking at £200 with pure Texels and Suffolks realising £170 - £190/head.The prospects remain encouraging and numbers will start building up from July onwards. Again, the auction system will be a vital element in ensuring producers achieve the best price available on the market.Despite weather problems during lambing, many farms are reporting a good lambing and good lamb numbers. The fantastic weather through May has transformed the performance of lambs as grass growth has taken off and lambs are set to reach the market early and in good order.The availability of grass has also triggered the market for ewes with lambs at foot with prices up around £10/head. Mule hoggs with single lambs have been making up to £140/head.“The strong prime market will hopefully impact positively on store markets which were in the doldrums last autumn,” says Mr Slessor.“The store lamb trade has been buoyant and prices have increased significantly, with finishers achieving good margins on last year’s lambs. Lamb producers in the Highlands and Islands certainly need a lift in price to give them a much needed boost following last year’s disappointing autumn trade.”With more ewe lambs being culled this year, rather than retained for breeding, trade and demand for gimmers is also likely to be stronger.Aberdeen and Northern Marts’ auction staff look forward to meeting customers at the forthcoming summer shows. The mart will have stands at the New Deer, Caithness, Turriff, Black Isle and Keith shows where auctioneers and field staff will be present to discuss the prospects for the autumn trade.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin.

Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general.

A memorandum of understanding had been signed with Wick.\u0026ldquoAll three were strongly engaged with us but we chose Fraserburgh, he said. \u0026ldquoThere was not a single reason for choosing Fraserburgh but a combination of circumstances.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism. It will be \u0026ldquoapplied consistently and fairly across Highland, a council spokeswoman said.Under the plan, the budget and decisions on parking would be devolved to local committees with revenue reinvested locally.Friday 6 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":"https://www.johnogroat-journal.co.uk/imagelibrary/Client_Images/Client00007/04116000/04116272.jpg","title":"Wick High School pupils light up UK Apps for Good finals with bike success","story":"\u0026nbspThey won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals in London on Wednesday night after wowing the competition judges with their Light Bike \u0026ndash which deploys smart lights to help cyclists safe and visible.The pupils \u0026ndash Nicholas Mann (13), from Ulbster, Caleb James (14), from Kirk, Lewis Buchan (14), Russell Mackenzie (13) and Steven Gunn (16), all Wick \u0026ndash were led by their computing science teacher Chris Aitken.Speaking after the finals at London\u0026rsquos Rich Mix venue, Mr Aitken said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore absolutely delighted to have won the Emerging Technology award at the UK Apps for Good finals.

You might even be able to buy your own one!The pupils had been working on the concept of improving cycling safety since January and came up with the idea of covering a bike in Led lights.The bike was coded using a BBC micro:bit and buttons were wired up to have functions such as working indicators, brake lights \u0026ndash which turn the whole bike red \u0026ndash and a speedometer, as well as customisable colours.Pupils taking part in Apps for Good explore all aspects of product development, from the initial idea and programming to product design and marketing.Mr Aitken says he hopes to build on the success of the Light Bike by setting up an Inventors\u0026rsquo Club in Wick High and possibly a CoderDojo \u0026ndash part of a network of computer programming clubs \u0026ndash for primary children.This week\u0026rsquos category win was the latest in a series of Apps for Good achievements by teams from Wick High.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove been incredibly lucky to have seen success now at the Apps for Good Awards for six years running \u0026ndash an unbeaten record, Mr Aitken said.\u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove seen our ideas evolve from the creation of wireframe prototypes to full-blown apps and we\u0026rsquore now pushing the boundaries further with the introduction of Internet of Things, physical computing, and very soon we\u0026rsquoll be starting machine learning / artificial intelligence with our pupils.\u0026ldquoAs always, I\u0026rsquom excited for what the future may bring for Wick High School pupils.Friday 6 Jul 2018 1:37 PM\u0026nbsp\u0026nbsp"},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"July 6, 2018 at 11:41 amOrkney\u0026#8217s footballers take on Wick Academy, while another football side is preparing for their first-ever match during this weekend\u0026#8217s sport.

This follows a wave of criticism towards bus services in the county, which saw members of the public brand Stagecoach \u0026#8220a disgrace.\u0026#8221The hearing was called to consider failings in relation to the provision of contracted school services and local bus services, many of which were caused by vehicle breakdowns. The traffic commissioner was concerned about the standard of vehicle roadworthiness and presentation.In particular she heard evidence from the Stagecoach Managing Director in Scotland, Mr Robert Andrew, who took the opportunity to apologise in public to OIC officials for the company’s failures. The inquiry also saw representatives from the council give evidence.After hearing this evidence, as well as making a visit to the bus operator’s Kirkwall depot, Miss Aitken also made an order to reduce the number of vehicles authorised on licence held by Highland Country Buses Ltd — the subsidiary of Stagecoach which serves the Highlands and Islands. Of the 210 vehicles which had been licensed, 30 will  now be unlicensed until Miss Aitken is satisfied with the compliance of the company to its licenses and contracts.In response to this, Stagecoach North Scotland managing director, David Liston, said: \u0026#8220We understand the importance of reliable and high-quality bus services to local communities in the Highlands and Islands.\u0026#8220Since these issues arose, we have taken steps to ensure that there are robust maintenance and operational processes in place across our business in the north of Scotland, and we are continuing to focus in particular on fleet reliability and presentation.\u0026#8220We understand the frustrations local people have at times expressed and we would like to reassure our customers that we are working hard to deliver better bus services. In her decision, the Traffic Commissioner has asked that we make a contribution totalling £20,500 to the schools in Orkney, and we are happy to do so.\u0026#8220We are currently arranging for this sum to be paid to Orkney Islands Council for onward payment to the schools.\u0026#8221The Traffic commissioner has clarified that this payment of  £20,500 is not compensatory in nature and does not affect any contractual obligations between the Council and Stagecoach. It is, rather, an ex gratia payment. The Traffic Commissioner decided on this course of action rather than ordering a payment to be made to Scottish Government.This sum is to be split between schools in the county:Orkney Islands Council has responded positively to this decision by the traffic commissioner.\u0026#8220We welcome the outcome of the public inquiry called by the Traffic Commissioner held in Kirkwall on June 5, particularly the decision to distribute the payment locally to our schools,\u0026#8221 a council spokeswoman said.\u0026#8220We’ll continue to work closely with the Traffic Commissioner and Stagecoach on service improvements.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

I would again assure all involved that to date, a decision has not been taken by the council to discontinue using the St Colm’s building.”\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Each of the three winding barrels will have a small motor fitted, and a sensor, which will automatically detect when the clock has wound down to a certain level. In addition, the clock will also be fitted with a pendulum regulator, which will ensure the clock time is more accurate.Cathedral custodian Fran Hollinrake said: \u0026#8220It is the end of an era. It was always a great workout climbing the tower stairs and manually winding the clock, but it was just becoming too impractical with all our other duties. The clock will still be the clock, it will just have a couple of new bits added on.\u0026#8221The previous clock on St Magnus Cathedral dated from 1761, and was made by Hugh Gordon, a clockmaker in Aberdeen. But during the early 20th century, as part of the Sheriff Thoms bequest, a new timepiece was commissioned that would see the cathedral through the 20th century and beyond. The present clock was made when the world was at war, in 1915, although it was not actually installed until 1919, the same week that the Treaty of Versailles was signed that ended the First World War.James Ritchie and Son (Clockmakers) was founded in 1809, and the company specialised in large steeple and public clocks, both making and restoring. If you are familiar with Princes Street Gardens in Edinburgh, you will know the world-famous Floral Clock, not far from Waverley Station. It was made in 1903 by Ritchie\u0026#8217s, and was the first of its kind in the world.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

Pam\u0026rsquos paintings are absolutely fantastic and we hope this event is a great success.\"Since the age of 63, Pam\u0026nbsphas painted hundreds of pictures, been a member of art groups and exhibited locally.Until recently she also\u0026nbspknitted clothes for infants in the special baby unit at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness and was a puzzle enthusiast, winning the Ross-shire Journal crossword at the age of 99.She celebrated her 100th birthday surrounded by friends and family at the Church of Scotland Hall in the village last year after a neighbour of 36 years\u0026rsquo standing, Joyce Fraser, decided to organise something special to mark the milestone event.Mrs Foster was also joined by friends from the local WRI and art group, along with\u0026nbspstaff and residents of the care home she was about to move to.

In this kind of heat, just don’t risk it.“Our advice is that owners should leave their dogs at home if they are going to be left in the car for any length of time at all.            “When left at home, owners should ensure their dogs have access to fresh water at all times and that there is adequate ventilation in the room. If dogs are being kept outdoors, they must have an area of shelter where they can escape the heat of the sun.”Among the advice for pet owners is to allow dogs access to paddling pools, and using damp blankets for them to lie on in the shade during hot weather. SSPCA Deputy Superintendent Peter Fleming went on to give general advice for pet owners, “In this hot weather we would advise the public to ensure their pets stay hydrated, cool and a fresh supply of water should always be available.“Sometimes just keeping a window open at home or putting on a fan to let the air circulate the room will help provide a cool temperature for them.“Please don’t forget about wild animals too, who will benefit from bowls of water left in the garden.”"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4754753.1528987528!/image/image.jpg","title":"in pictures how to make your own scottish morning rolls","story":"\t\tMorning rolls are one of Scotland\u0026#8217s best loved foods, Scottish food writer Fraser Wright provides a recipe on how to make your own.\t\t\t\tYou need to start these the night before you want to eat them, however they last well and toast very well too.            What you’ll need:              • 500g Canadian strong white bread flour (or a flour with a high gluten content, i.e. at least 14 per cent) • 30g lard or vegetable shortening • 10g sugar • 10g salt • 5g fast action yeast             • 400ml cold water For the Coating • 50g plain flour • 50g rice cones/flourView our STEP BY STEP GALLERY HERE            Method: 1 Rub the fat into the flour in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the sugar, salt and yeast. 2 Now pour in the water and mix until it is all incorporated. This is a wet dough but when you are using bread flour with such a high gluten content it can easily take that much water without becoming sloppy. 3 Remove the dough from the bowl and knead it for 1 minute until the dough has just become smooth with all the ingredients thoroughly combined. 4 With such a long ferment you don’t need to knead it too much. Put the dough back into the bowl and cover loosely with cling film. Put the bowl in the refrigerator to leave it to ferment for 12 – 16 hours.             5 The next morning combine the rice cones and plain flour for the coating. Take a large baking sheet and dust it liberally with the coating mixture (make sure to leave enough to coat the rolls). 6 Empty the dough on to a work surface which has been liberally dusted with the rice/flour coating mixture. This is where a large silicone spatula or scraper is useful. 7 Now using a dough scraper divide the dough into 8 pieces. Don’t worry if it is sticky or messy as these rolls aren’t supposed to look perfect. 8 Dust your fingers with the coating mixture and take each piece of dough, one at a time, and dip it into the coating mixture and place it on the baking sheet. They don’t need to be in the shape of a roll but try to keep in the air that is inside the dough. 9 Do this with each piece, placing them near to each other so that when they rise they will bake together. Despite the stickiness of this dough the coating mixture works wonders for stopping the dough from sticking to everything. Leave them to rise for 1 – 2 hours or until doubled in size. 10 Bake in a 250˚C preheated oven on a high shelf for 15 – 20 minutes or until the tops are dark. The rolls should be well fired for the right flavour.• Recipe submitted by Fraser Wright Read more: The history of morning rolls, including a recipe for making your ownRead more: A history of the square sausage, including a recipe for making your own"},{"url":"https://res.cloudinary.com/jpress/image/fetch/w_620,f_auto,ar_3:2,q_auto:low,c_fill/if_h_lte_200,c_mfit,h_201/https://www.scotsman.com/webimage/1.4763516.1530642722!/image/image.jpg","title":"professor john elliott what scots and catalans can learn from history","story":"\t\tRelations between Catalonia and Madrid soured in the 1800s as the Romantic Movement took off and inspired a new kind of nationalism, writes John Elliott.\t\t\t\tAs the current generation of Scots and Catalans face up to unusually agonising decisions about the future they want for themselves and their children, it is perhaps salutary to take a step back and consider how and why this dilemma has arisen.            This is what I have tried to do in my book, Scots and Catalans. Union and Disunion, a comparative  history of two peoples without states of their own, whose attempts to define, reassess and perhaps transform their relationship to the larger polities to which they belong has been drawing headlines across the world.             The book begins with the Middle Ages and ends in December 2017 after the flight to Belgium of the Catalan President, Carles Puigdemont, following the failure of a unilateral bid to break away from the Spanish state and establish Catalonia as an independent republic.Many years ago I wrote a study of the origins of the Catalan rebellion of 1640 against the royal government in Madrid – a rebellion that inspired the creation of a Catalan republic which lasted for a week. As I contemplated the unfolding of today’s Catalan separatist movement and the simultaneous rise of Scottish separatism, I thought it might be illuminating to attempt a sustained comparison of the historical experience of the two countries and of the ways in which a sense of national identity has manifested itself over the centuries.READ MORE: Kenny MacAskill: Stop treating Catalonia as a proxy for ScotlandNaturally there are important differences between the two national histories, but differences can be as revealing as similarities in reaching historical conclusions. One obvious difference is that Scotland was for centuries an independent kingdom, whereas Catalonia was never a truly independent state. It was a principality that formed part of a federation, the Crown of Aragon, which was united with the Crown of Castile as a result of the marriage of Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile in 1469. This dynastic union created the country that came to be known as ‘Spain’. Dynastic union between Scotland and England came more than a century later, when James VI of Scotland’s inheritance of the English throne in 1603 created ‘Great Britain’.  The immediate effect of these unions was similar, in the sense that, although both Scotland and Catalonia preserved their traditional forms of government, they were now linked to a far more powerful neighbour. This produced inevitable tensions, and at the start of the 18th century attempts were made to resolve them, although in very different ways. The 1707 Anglo-Scottish Union created a British parliamentary monarchy, in which the Scots surrendered their Edinburgh parliament in exchange for access to England’s expanding commercial and colonial empire.             In 1716, following the surrender of Barcelona two years earlier to the forces of Philip V, who was the monarch of the newly enthroned Bourbon dynasty, Catalonia, like the rest of the Crown of Aragon, was stripped of its traditional laws and liberties, and was merged into what became an authoritarian monarchical Spain.Scotland and Catalonia both benefited economically from the constitutional changes of the early 18th century, although the expansion of Britain’s overseas empire gave the Scots many more opportunities than those enjoyed by the Catalans. The British empire of the 18th and 19th centuries was a joint Anglo-Scottish creation, whereas the Catalans remained on the margins of Spain’s long-established American empire. Instead, they turned their energies to economic development, and became the pioneers of Spanish industrialisation, based on a rapidly growing textile industry. READ MORE: Brian Wilson: Catalonia is evidence of the benefits of a UnionScotland, too, was being transformed by the growth of its industries in the same period, but, unlike Catalonia, it never became the main power-house of the wider, national, economy. The long-term effect of these differences is still to be seen. In Spain, economic and political development were out of kilter in the 19th and early 20th centuries. While Madrid was the country’s political capital, its economic capital was Barcelona. In Britain, London was both.            In the 19th century, Catalonia’s relationship with the government in Madrid soured. This was partly the result of Spain’s chronic political instability in the decades following the Napoleonic invasion and the Peninsular War. But it can also be explained by a pan-European phenomenon, the emergence of a new-style nationalism inspired by the Romantic Movement. The researches of historians, literary scholars and folklorists into the origins of their societies generated a sense of the nation as an organic community with its own distinctive characteristics. Such explorations of the Catalan past helped produce another significant difference between Scotland and Catalonia. It was language that became the point of reference for national identity in Catalonia, in a way that Gaelic would never be for that of Scotland. The Catalans clung to their language when the repressive regime of General Franco sought to replace it with Castilian, the predominant language of Spain. After Franco’s death in 1975, a reaction was inevitable. The autonomous Catalan regime created by the 1978 Constitution of the newly democratic Spain was determined, through its control of the educational system, to ‘Catalanise’ Catalan society in the face of the encroachment of Castilian through the national media. The resulting linguistic question has played a large part in creating the current impasse between Catalonia and the Spanish government.It is one of the ironies of this stand-off that the 30 years between 1978 and the financial collapse of 2008 have been the most prosperous and successful in Catalonia’s colourful history. But the economic crisis gave radical Catalan nationalists a chance to depict Catalonia as the victim of a malign Spanish state, and the inflexibility of a Spanish government determined to treat the secessionist movement as a constitutional question that should properly be left to the courts handed the separatists a propaganda victory that they have exploited to the full. Referendums, whether authorised or unauthorised, as in the Catalan case, are at best blunt instruments for determining the will of the people. In forcing binary choices they can be deeply divisive, and Catalonia is now a bitterly divided society, in which intimidation is being exercised by secessionists who claim to speak for all its inhabitants. A highly creative people with a long and distinguished history, the Catalans deserve better than this.

So it is a shame that Mr Yousaf continues to play the same tired old games, even after the commendable efforts of councillors and MSPs of all parties and none has secured at least some action towards correcting this patently unfair situation.\nThe transport minister is right in congratulating the island councils for their tenacity in pursuing this issue. It\u0026#8217s just a shame it was the actions – or inactions – of his SNP government which forced them to be so tenacious.\nAnd what is now abundantly clear is that, in spite of the SNP\u0026#8217s protests, the money was always available to address this issue. The SNP managed to magic up an extra £170 million yesterday which, apparently, they didn\u0026#8217t have when the budget was first presented. So the question many in the Northern Isles should be asking Mr Yousaf is why didn\u0026#8217t the SNP include fair funding in their draft budget in the first place?\nWhen SNP ministers were trying to dismiss fair funding, I was regularly questioning them in the Scottish Parliament on their commitment. I was meeting with representatives from the island councils – in Lerwick, in Kirkwall and in Edinburgh.\nI put forward the amendment which, accepted by the entire Scottish Parliament (including Mr Yousaf and the SNP), recognised the lifeline nature of our internal ferries. And I wrote to Mr Yousaf and to his boss, Nicola Sturgeon, on the issue.\nSo I suppose it is flattering that, of all the opposition MSPs who voted against the SNP Budget, Mr Yousaf has chosen to single me out in this way for his faux outrage. I would suggest it\u0026#8217s an indication of the effectiveness of my consistent and vocal opposition to the SNP\u0026#8217s attempt to sweep its own fair funding pledge under the carpet.\nAnd in relation to the vote itself, Mr Yousaf seems intent on misleading Shetlanders. The truth is that MSPs do not vote on individual parts of the budget, but rather on the budget as a whole.\nSo, even with the late U-turn on additional ferry funding, this budget remains, overall, a disappointing budget for people and businesses in Shetland. It will mean that many of my constituents – in fact, anyone earning over £26,000 per year – will pay more tax.\nIt will hit the incomes of local people and businesses, something numerous business organisations have warned will harm Scotland\u0026#8217s already sluggish economic growth.

So it is for those local and regional MSPs who supported the SNP\u0026#8217s budget to defend their decision. I simply wasn\u0026#8217t prepared to back a budget which will leave too many local people out of pocket.\nAnd an inconvenient fact Mr Yousaf, too busy patting himself on the back for belatedly delivering something even the SNP in Orkney accept was always an SNP commitment, choses to ignore is that this is only a deal for this year and not a long term solution. So the real risk is that we will have to go through this process all over again for next year\u0026#8217s budget.\nI hope next year, the SNP will deliver a long term settlement on fair funding, not another one off. That a long-term solution will be found that will meet the needs of the local communities so reliant on these lifeline links. And that Mr Yousaf, Derek Mackay and the SNP will avoid the political theatrics that have dominated this year\u0026#8217s budget process.\n Edinburgh.\n If all politicians behaved in this manner it is likely that every budget in every parliament would fail, even though every single clause had enthusiastic and popular local backing no one was willing to support the package as a whole.\n Clearly these are not the section of his constituents Mr Halcro \u0026#8211 Johnston is interested in.\n The tartan Tories are living up to their name for sure and their blind supporters still try to defend them.\nMr Halcrow objects to political parties playing games?\n\nWhich party does Christopher \u0026#8216up-skirting\u0026#8217 Chope belong to again?\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch aerial footage new eric gray centre ","story":"The long-awaited Eric Gray Centre is nearing completion – as shown by aerial footage recently published by contractors DITT Construction.\n\nThe project, costing around £6 million, marks the culmination of years of planning with a feasibility study taking place in 2006.

It’s manufacture uses up valuable natural resources but this is a result of human exploitation. This begs the question, why are humans capable of natural behaviour and unnatural behaviour in what seems to be equal measure?  Is it normal and natural to drive cars, fly in ‘planes, build tower blocks, dig for coal, aim to fly to distant planet ? The list is endless. According to the experts, global warming and ice ages have occurred many times and certainly before life as we know it existed.  We are worried about what are threats to our welfare only because it is a seemingly an alien threat . Surely, if we are able to stand outside ourselves, we are now caught up in a “ normal” event. And in our short sighted stupidity we are adding to the dangers.

Despite a brave and thrilling attempt, resulting in an 11-point victory, realistically the overall result was never really in doubt.\n The Shetland swimmers, led by triple record-breaker Jasmin Smith, once again defeated their hosts by nearly 20 points.\nSuperiority in the water is now a regular occurrence in inter-counties, and the days when Orkney maintained a stranglehold on that event have been confined to distant memory.\nPart of the reason for the continued success could well be the number of swimming clubs around the isles, with Shetland, Lerwick, Delting, South Mainland, Whalsay and the West Side all competing for honours.\nRegular events in Shetland could be just as important as the trips to the mainland, as it helps to forge the competitive element necessary in the inter-county.\nThe only disciplines in which Orkney were successful this year were hockey and netball, where apart from school tournaments in the latter there is no recognised league structure here.\nHuge credit is due to the swimmers and their coaches, and also the many others who put in so much time and effort at the other sports involved in the Stuart Cup.\nHere’s hoping that the hockey and netball contestants will not have long to wait for their own success.\n: : : : : : : :\nOn the subject of hockey, mention needs to be made of former goalkeeper Sarah Couper who is now a qualified A grade umpire.\nShe travelled away last weekend to take charge of two international matches and is off to Swansea today to umpire a home international masters game.\nThis is the pinnacle of officiating in hockey and should be seen as a fine achievement both Couper and the sport in Shetland, which faces the perennial battle for getting a new playing surface.\n: : : : : : : :\nCongratulations are due to the Lerwick Spurs football team which is now through to the fourth round of the Highland Amateur Cup.\nSpurs defeated Ness from the Western Isles 3-0 at Dornoch on Saturday and now face Caithness side Staxigoe in the last-16 clash.\nIt was the first of two successes against a team with the same name in three days and no hangovers were obvious as they returned and picked up an important victory over Ness United in the local premier league on Monday.\nThe other Ness may not mean much to the average Shetland football follower, but some may know it was the club that Angus Murray represented for a long time.\nMurray, who played for Lerwick Thistle for a couple of seasons in the mid-1980s while working at the town’s Co-op, commented on Facebook this week that it was the “wrong half of Lerwick but well done Spurs”.\nHe continued: “The competition is in the doldrums and in need of new talent. It would be quite something if a Shetland team could win it given the logistics. I’ll be watching with interest.”\nPressed on his Shetland connections, Murray went on: “The Spurs of my era were formidable \u0026#8230 Watt Bros, Leask Bros, B Williamson, K Malcolmson et al. I must say I had not heard of Jim Peterson’s passing. A scholar, gentleman and Spurs stalwart, we had many a chat in the Lounge Bar.\n“How removed we are at times. He wrote the The History of Shetland Football 1887-1987, a copy of which I have, one of his many accomplishments I’m sure. All the best in the next games. The competition does islands no favours on balance.”\nMurray, much like the way he used to play, is bang on target here. The tournament organisers do little to help the furthest travelled teams, and Jim Peterson is indeed a massive loss.\nWith the anniversary of the Milne Cup now under two months away, and a competition running (see above) to name Shetland’s greatest team, Murray’s name may be on the minds of a few selectors.\nAnd we could hope that Peterson, although this column is not normally the place for religious connotations, may be looking down and having a dram when the big event happens on 28th July.\n: : : : : : : :\nProfessional footballers, especially in the modern era, obviously have a lot of time on their hands.\nThat could explain why they indulge so much in the absurd tattoos and haircuts which are now commonplace.\nThe latest to make the news is Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling, who has gone and had the image of an AK-47 assault rifle inked on his lower leg.\nSterling, rather bafflingly, claimed the idea was a tribute to his father who was gunned down by a gang in Jamaica when he was just a toddler.\nNot surprisingly Sterling has been criticised by anti-gun campaigners, who demanded he remove the tattoo or be dropped from the England squad.\nRichard Taylor, whose 10-year-old son Damilola died after being attacked by a gang in London, has also accused Sterling of setting a terrible example to fans.\nThe player has now explained that he would never touch a gun and that the tattoo is “unfinished”. Maybe he intends to have a deletion mark added on top of the offending image?\nApparently, Gary Lineker of all people has jumped to Sterling’s defence, claiming it is “weird, unpatriotic and sad” for him to be criticised by the media in such a way prior to the World Cup.\nI’m sorry, but it’s not the fault of newspapers that Sterling appears to be lacking in grey cells. I’ve never been a fan of Lineker, but did think he would show more common sense than this.\nTaylor is correct. It’s a crass act by Sterling and just as daft a move by those who support him.\n: : : : : : : :\nTo end on a more postitive note, surely cyclist Chris Froome has to be one of the UK’s best ever sports performers.\nThe way he destroyed the field to secure the recent Giro d’Italia, the third Grand Tour title he currently holds along with the Tour de France and the Vuelta a España, was incredible.\nSadly this country has not really taken to Froome, otherwise he would have surely already been a recipient of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.\nIf he wins another Tour de France this year, which would be his fifth victory, it would be a travesty if he didn’t receive the personality trophy.\nBarring Harry Kane scoring a hat trick in the final and lifting the World Cup for England next month, which I can’t really see happening, hopefully this will be Froome’s year at last.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"kia pro ceed ","story":"3dr Kia pro-ceed sr7, 4 year warranty remaining, one owner, full Kia service history, VGC inside \u0026amp out\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"talking sport with jim tait 20 ","story":"As I write this all the teams have played at least one match at the World Cup, with hosts Russia and Uruguay becoming first to qualify for the last 16 from group A.\nOn the whole it has been a decent tournament so far, helped by a few shocks along the way and some memorable goals, although perhaps the less said about the commentary and punditry the better.\nFew would have expected Germany to lose to Mexico, or Argentina to be held by Iceland. One of the most remarkable performances in the latter game came from Kari Arnason, recently deemed not good enough by Aberdeen but still able to do a pretty fair job on shackling Lionel Messi.\nThe introduction the Video Assistant Referee system, or VAR as it is commonly known, has caused a few talking points. There was the decision to allow Diego Costa’s first goal for Spain against Portugal, and also to award penalties to France and Sweden against Australia and South Korea respectively.\nThese “assistants” are apparently not even at the game. They are sitting in a office somewhere in Moscow, but bizarrely kitted out in full referees’ uniform!\nWhy on earth they didn’t disallow Switzerland’s equaliser against Brazil is beyond me, however. Everyone seemed to notice Steven Zuber’s push on his marker before making room for himself to head the ball home.\nEveryone that is except the boys in black in Moscow. The ITV panellists were unanimous in their opinion that the goal should have been ruled out. Even Roy Keane, who used to think decapitation was just about permissable, appeared to agree with the others.\nOkay, so we will mention the commentary and punditry. Apart from Keane and Slaven Bilic – I loved it when he said he couldn’t really care less about whether the Swiss leveller should have been allowed or not – there is really no-one who comes with an opinion which makes you think.\nMost of the time they are prattling on about how far England are likely to go, even when the focus is on an entirely different group. And surely it is high time Gary Lineker was pensioned off. His pathetic attempts at puns, which could have been written by a five-year-old, had their day a long time ago.\nMeanwhile in our office “World Cup Sweepstake”, which requires the entrant to basically predict the results all the way through the competition, things aren’t going too badly. Despite obviously getting the Argentina/Iceland and Germany/Mexico games wrong, plus a few others, I remain in contention on the leaderboard.\nSo what about the last 16? I will still stick with the Germans and Argentinians as surely they must improve. My line-up is: Russia v Portugal, Spain v Uruguay, France v Argentina, Croatia v Denmark, Brazil v Sweden, Belgium v Japan, Germany v Switzerland and Senegal v England.\n: : : : : : : :\nThere has already been a healthy entry for our competition to name Shetland’s greatest football team of the past 60 years, but potential selectors still have a week and a half to make their minds up.\nThe main prize, a return trip for two people with car and cabin courtesy of NorthLink Ferries, is definitely not to be sneezed at.

The cricketer with roots connected to these parts was none other than the man of the match himself – batsman Callum MacLeod whose magnificent 140 not out was largely responsible for Scotland’s thrilling win.\nMacLeod’s father Donald attended the Anderson High School in the late 1960s and early 70s. He was a goalkeeper himself, playing for the Ness United team in the Shetland under-18 competitions.\nHe went on to make somewhat of a name for himself as a photographer, working for The Press and Journal and The Scotsman at times before establishing his own business.\nMacLeod (junior) has obviously usurped any success attained by his old man, however. Even before his recent moment of glory he has been an established international batsman, making several centuries at one-day level.\nHe has been good enough to play grade cricket in Sydney, which is no mean feat, has had stints at English counties Warwickshire and Durham and has just signed a contract with Derbyshire.\nIt is going on half a century since I last saw Donald MacLeod, but I know a certain former Whitedale goalkeeper who keeps in touch. If he happens to read this he’ll maybe pass on congratulations from me, and I’m sure a few others, to the family.\n: : : : : : : :\nTwo weeks ago I suggested that having clubs competing in a local league structure could be of great benefit to preparation for junior inter-county sports such as hockey and netball.\nWhile there is no regular junior league set-up in the isles for hockey, it has been pointed out that in netball this exists for primary school-aged players upwards.\nThe sport appears to be thriving at the various age levels, with under-13 and under-17 squads regularly competing on the mainland with success.\nThe Anderson High School team has also regularly sent a team to compete in the Scottish Schools Open competition, where they have performed with distinction over the past few years.\nThe AHS team also plays in division one of the senior netball leagues, while a feeder team called “Hotfooters” was created to provide easier access for youngsters to join the league.\nAccording to the organisers there have been over 1,000 competitive matches in Shetland and 32 competitive matches away from the isles for juniors this season in various leagues and tournaments.\nCoach Sanna Aitken says: “Of course it is disappointing that we lost the junior inter-county this year \u0026#8230 the girls were really gutted.\n“As a coach, I am delighted that the netball continues to be really competitive [with] an incredibly high standard of match demonstrating the hard work and success of the sport and junior set-up in both isles.\n“I am confident when saying the loss was nothing to do with any weaknesses in the local league structure. It just didn’t go our way on the day. Only two years ago it went Shetland’s way where we won on Orkney’s home turf. It’s always a great competitive game.”\nI am happy to set the record straight on this.\n \u0026raquo\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"watch viking bus station to get new graffiti mural ","story":"\n\nMarc Delaye, now based in Inverness, will oversee the graffiti project in August.

This was affectionately branded the \u0026#8220Emmerdale\u0026#8221 farm.\nIn 1998 the firm was one of two which set up in newly opened fish processing units at Gremista, funded by the Lerwick Harbour Trust (now Lerwick Port Authority) and Shetland Enterprise.\nNearly 20 years after that optimistic opening, the storied business is to close its final chapter.\n\u0026#8220We kent it was in the air\u0026#8221, Mr McNab said, \u0026#8220we could see it was in the figures.\u0026#8221\n• More in this week\u0026#8217s print edition of The Shetland Times.\n.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"url":null,"title":"short film celebrates communitys bruck collecting efforts da voar redd up ","story":"\nShetland Amenity Trust has been running the event for 30 years and commissioned the video to highlight the community effort.\nWhat started as a few hundred volunteers clearing beaches in 1998, soon expanded to over 20 per cent of Shetland’s population taking part annually.\nTrust environmental improvement officer Sita Goudie said: “During its 31 years, over 100,000 volunteers have taken part in Da Voar Redd Up, collecting over 1,900 tonnes of bruck.

There is no doubt the English are cute enough to take full advantage of the introduction of VAR system with three penalty kicks so far despatched by captain Harry Kane.\nPenalising defenders for holding at corners and other set pieces is, I have to say, a major step forward. This has been going on for far too long in most levels of football, and thankfully the days of pundits uttering the words “part and parcel of the game” will now be over.\nGrabbing someone in a bear hug is not football – never has been and never will be. I recall a European match some years ago when Glasgow Celtic should have had about six penalties but the referee gave none.\nWhat this needs now is for officials to be in accordance with one another. But sadly, and I can envisage a few whistlers spluttering over their cornflakes at this, the words “consistent” and “referees” are an oxymoron as far as I\u0026#8217m concerned.\nOn the subject of the English progression in the tournament, it has once again thrown up the perennial question of whether Scottish people should support their oldest rivals.\nThere are no doubt many north of the border who would find the prospect of England winning the World Cup a terrifying one. They could even be in the majority. A recent poll suggested that only 15 per cent of Scots would support the English while 28 per cent would back anyone playing against them.\nThe same survey found that only two per cent of Scottish National Party voters would get behind England, although I actually find that figure quite high.\nIt does appear to be the case that Scottish football followers have nothing against English players, many of whom they actually admire, but it is those in the press and the media who they reserve their anger for.\nI sincerely hope that England do go all the way. I have always supported them when Scotland are not involved, and in recent years that has become the norm.\nA few issues do bother me, such as the constant gormless look on Kane’s face and the insistence of manager Gareth Southgate on dressing as if he was taking part in the World Snooker Championships. Someone should tell him that waistcoats are the most pointless item of clothing known to man.\nBut hey, most of it is good. I particularly enjoy the ITV panel and even Ian Wright is growing on me!\n: : : : : : : :\nIt is just over a month since the tragic death of former Aberdeen footballer Neale Cooper and I would like to add my own tribute to the many which have been paid to such a popular man.\nThe late Neale Cooper made a memorable trip to Shetland.\nAt just 19 he was the youngest member of the 1983 European Cup Winners Cup side which defeated Real Madrid in the final at Gothenburg in Sweden.\nAlong with that memorable triumph he was in the team which won two Scottish league titles, four Scottish Cups, a league cup and the European Super Cup, all achieved before he was 24.\nHe later played for Aston Villa, Rangers, Reading, Dunfermline and Ross County, where he later became manager.\nIt was in the summer of 1999, when Ross County were invited to Shetland as guests for Scalloway’s centenary celebrations, that I had the privilege of meeting Cooper.\nThere was a gala dinner in the village hall after the friendly match where County defeated Scalloway 8-2, and he agreed to give me time for a short interview. But not until after his speech, he said, which he was dreading as he hated speaking at formal events.\nSadly the evening dragged on somewhat, with various Scalloway luminaries spending rather more time on stage than was really necessary, and it was approaching 1am when Cooper eventually got his turn.\nI decided to give up on the interview that night, and maybe catch him the following day after a game against a Shetland XI in Lerwick.\nAs I was wandering along the embankment at Gilbertson Park prior to the match I heard someone calling my name, and was surprised to see Cooper running towards me.\nHe was full of apologies about the previous evening, although he had no justification, and he said he would speak to me immediately after the game.\nThe match ended 2-2 and Cooper was generous in his praise for the opposition. Shetland were “as good as any top Highland League side”, he said.\nThe two-day visit had been excellent both from a football point of view and a social one, he added. “It’s been fantastic. We had a great welcome from Scalloway and it was an honour to be invited to their centenary celebrations. I’ve never been to Shetland before and I only found out last week that my mother had been here 40 years ago.”\nFollowing Cooper’s untimely death, and the loss of the first of the Gothenburg greats, there have been many kind words. Colleagues, writers and others have pointed out what a humble, friendly and likeable character he was.\nThey are absolutely correct. I’ve meet a few well-known footballers over the years but I have no difficulty in stating that Neil Cooper was the nicest one of them all.\n: : : : : : : :\nCyclist Chris Froome is now free to go for a record-equalling fifth Tour de France win after his anti-doping case was sensibly dropped.\nThe Team Sky rider had been under investigation by the sport’s world governing body Union Cycliste Internationale but proceedings were closed on Monday.\nFroome, who is bidding to move level with Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault, Jacques Anquetil and Miguel Indurain as the only five-time winners of the tour, has been under intense pressure since an amount of the asthma treatment salbutamol was found in his system.\nGet off this guy’s back and give him a break, I say. Just because he’s the best cyclist in the world does not mean he’s benefiting from a performance-enhancing drug.\n: : : : : : : :\nWith all the buzz of the World Cup an annual competition in southwest London has almost been forgotten about.\nYes, Wimbledon is in full flow once again and the British competitors are as usual struggling to make it into the second week.\nAndy Murray was probably sensible to withdraw, citing that he was not quite ready for five-set matches after his hip operation. There were signs at Queens and Eastbourne, however, that he may be able to scale the heights once more.\nThere is of course a capable replacement in Kyle Edmund, who is seeded having reached the Australian Open semi-finals earlier this year.\nEdmund’s half of the draw looks fairly open, and he could well still be involved come Monday. But of course anything can happen, and by the time you read this he could be gone.

the course of the three weeks.\n\"We do it for the buzz as we all have a passion for extreme weather and it is also a great way to hit the open road and explore new states,\" he added.\nHe agreed that it can be a dangerous hobby but not for the reasons you would think.\n\"People often think tornadoes are the main concern but lightning, giant hail stones and flash flooding are often the hazards that prove most deadly,\" he said.\n\"Careful planning before and during a storm chase is absolutely essential.\"\n\u0026nbsp\nScott now works for MetDesk, a UK-wide weather service, and he took those skills across the Pond with him.\nThe friends used the latest weather model data, satellite and radar observations and invested in a portable internet device to ensure they had the best chance of remaining connected to signal while on the move.\nScott said it is incredibly important that the driver can access accurate directions quickly when faced with dangerous and often changing conditions.\nAlthough they had a few close calls, they managed to avoid getting themselves into \"major trouble\" by knowing when to back off and take shelter.\nThe Newtonmore man explained: \"We avoided driving through storms with tennis ball sized hail stones and 70mph straight line winds.\n\"But at one point we did have to take shelter in a gas station freezer room \u0026ndash the strongest room in the building \u0026ndash due to a tornado with confirmed flying debris just upwind of us.\"\nScott admitted that storm chasing is not for the faint-hearted but that \"it is an experience\" and in the US it is becoming an increasingly popular attraction.\nBecause the adventurers did not know where they would end up at the end of the day, accommodation had to often be found late and in an obscure towns in the middle of nowhere\nScott, who is now safely back in Hertfordshire where the weather is rather less dramatic, added: \"That alone makes the trip more exciting as it holds an incredible depth of freedom.\"\nTornado Alley is the name of the area in the United States where tornadoes are most frequent.\nThe term was coined in 1952 as the title of a research project to study severe weather in areas of Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, South Dakota, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, North Dakota, and Minnesota.\nFriday 6 Jul 2018 1:39
