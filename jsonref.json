Essentially this case is going to take up the rest of this year and if it takes up the rest of this year, that\u0027s the whole of his mother\u0027s Platinum Jubilee.\u0027The only thing he could have done to stop this getting worse is to have pulled the case and stopped it in some way so there was no alternative news. This is going to be crippling if he really is dead set on running this to a trial.\u0027The issue has begun to affect other members of the royal family, with the Duke of Cambridge facing a question about his uncle when he visited London\u0027s Foundling Museum with his wife last week.A broadcast journalist from Sky asked William \u0027Do you support Andrew?\u0027 as the couple left, but he did not respond.Meanwhile legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg said the Duke of York\u0027s demand for a jury trial is him stating \u0027bring it on\u0027. Mr Rozenberg told BBC Breakfast: \u0027Those (a trial by jury) are certainly the words with which this page 11 defence ends but it was Virginia Giuffre who asked for a jury trial, demanded a jury trial, in her claim.\u0027And so what you\u0027ve really got here is Prince Andrew saying, \u0027Bring it on. You want a jury trial? I want a jury trial. You want to bring these claims? Well, in that case, you have to prove everything that you\u0027re saying, because I\u0027m not going to admit to anything\u0027.\u0027He added the case could still settle out of court but added that \u0027nevertheless the prince is saying that he denies everything.\u0027"},{"url":null,"title":"Kate Garraway shuts GMB cancel culture debate comic defends burkas letterbox remark","story":"Share this articleCancel culture is a grave threat to comedy - spiked"},{"url":null,"title":"BBC Today host Justin Webb refuses listen Radio 4 prefers silence station","story":"Share this article ‘We later discovered the paper was meant to go over the top sheet, not over the bottom one, so we completely screwed it up - but Granny survived.’Webb says his ‘barmy’ stepfather, Charles, ‘kept padlocks and changed the garage doors every week or two because he thought the car was being broken into.’His stepfather and mother were both ‘occasionally violent’ to each other. ‘He tried to kill himself one day, on my birthday when I was young. ‘I can remember eating Frosties in our little kitchen and Mum saying, “Charles has taken some pills, so people are going to come, but don\u0027t worry, you carry on.”‘The doctor said “he’s schizophrenic, not too much attempt at resuscitation.” But they did resuscitate him and we never talked about it again.’ ‘Desperately Seeking Wisdom’ podcast interview with Justin Webb by Sir Craig Oliver available Monday"},{"url":null,"title":"The speed camera nightmare thats coming America","story":"Share this articleCelia Israel on Twitter: \u0026quotThank you @SecretaryPete for making transportation safety a priority at the federal level.

His wife tweeted: ‘Thank you everyone for all your support. We are so unbelievably happy to have him back…’Irish businessman Richard O’Halloran said he is looking forward to “doing normal everyday family things” following his return home from China.Mr O’Halloran was reunited with his family in Dublin Airport this morning after he was permitted to leave China following an enforced stay of almost three years.Significant payments will continue to Chinese authorities for years following a deal struck to enable his return.Mr O’Halloran was permitted to leave China on Friday after becoming embroiled in a legal dispute involving the chairman and main shareholder of his Dublin-based company.He was reunited with his family in Dublin Airport this morning and travelled home on an Air France flight via Seoul and Paris Charles de Gaulle, arriving at Dublin Airport at 8.10am on Saturday, a spokesman confirmed.Mr O’Halloran’s wife Tara, who has helped run a high-profile campaign calling for his release over the past three years, tweeted a photo of the family all together shortly after 8am on Saturday.The family have four children – Ben (15), Amber (12), Bella (10) and Scarlett (8).Mr O’Halloran initially flew to China in 2019 during the fallout from a crowdsourcing deal for an aircraft owned by his employer, China International Aviation Leasing Service.However, despite giving evidence against the firm’s one-time chairman Min Jiedong, who was convicted of offences relating to the deal, Mr O’Halloran was prevented from leaving.At one stage, €30 million was demanded of Mr O’Halloran, while hundreds of thousands of euro were paid over to the Chinese authorities derived from income associated with the lease of the plane purchased under the original crowdsourcing deal.Happiness and emotionMr O’Halloran issued a statement this morning on his arrival back home.“This is a day of great happiness and emotion as I rejoin Tara, Ben, Amber, Isabella, and Scarlett after three years,” he said.“There was considerable input by a number of key iniduals who were central in helping to arrive at this positive outcome and it is also important that I take this opportunity to thank and to express my sincere appreciation and that of my family, for the incredible support we have received over the past three years.“Mr Simon Coveney, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, was a key figure in reaching a solution and he invested huge effort over a long period, but particularly in recent weeks, leading to a positive outcome.“My wider family and friends of the family have been so important in the support they provided both in a practical and emotional sense and with Tara I express our sincere gratitude. I would like in particular to thank my mother and father. Throughout the three-year period there have been so many people who have signed petitions, who were active on social media, who wrote letters to newspapers, and who made unsolicited generous contact with my family with offers of support and help. This generosity of spirit can never be repaid.“I would like to sincerely thank The President of Ireland, Mr Michael D Higgins who wrote to his counterpart in China.“A number of politicians at national and European level have been so supportive and I am sure I am missing some, but I have to sincerely express my gratitude to Deputies Charlie Flanagan TD, Peadar Tóibín TD, Eoin Ó Broin TD, Cathal Berry TD and Cormac Devlin TD Senator Michael McDowell, Senator Gerard Craughwell, Senator Barry Ward and in Europe, Barry Andrews MEP, Sean Kelly MEP, and Frances Fitzgerald MEP. Also, Councillor Hazel Chu in Dublin.“I would like to acknowledge the kindness of the people in China who looked after me when I was unwell and also note the support of Consular officials Wendy Dorman-Smith and Alison Meagher.“I would like to sincerely thank the media in Ireland and overseas, for all the interest and support shown to Tara, my family and myself since 2019. The role of the media has been essential in maintaining awareness about the challenging situation I was in and I am very grateful for that. While I realise and understand the huge public interest, as reflected by the media, I hope in the coming period to spend time in private with my family and slowly return to normal living in Ireland.“A number of other people have been very instrumental in the background in assisting in arriving at a solution including Ulick McEvaddy my colleague in CALS Donal Martin Denis O’Brien and my brother David O’Halloran (who resides in the US). I know they are reluctant to take any credit, but I have to acknowledge their help.“Finally, and most importantly, my own family Ben, Amber, Isabella, Scarlett and especially my wife Tara. This has been an incredible challenge for them too and they endured many dark days. But they were always a beacon of light and hope for me and the hundreds of Messenger calls we had helped me to remain positive. Tara was an incredible tower of strength and kept the show on the road. I am home with them now and we are all looking forward to getting to know each other again and doing normal everyday family things.“Once again, my sincere heartfelt thanks to everybody.”Future commitmentsMr O’Halloran had to make two court appearances in Shanghai earlier this week to finalise and sign off on financial arrangements and future commitments to pave the way for the lifting of the exit ban.It is understood the financial commitments relate to future payments from the income on the aircraft that was purchased with money raised from Chinese investors and leased to a Finnish airline.The agreement is also understood to relate to the return of the aircraft to the Chinese authorities when the lease agreement ends in 2026. Monthly payments of more than $100,000 (€90,000) are currently being made to the Chinese authorities.The Chinese embassy in Dublin, confirming that Mr O’Halloran’s exit ban had been lifted, tweeted on Friday that “it is expected that he continues to fulfil his pledges and commitment and undertake his corresponding legal obligations”.The deal came at the culmination of a years-long diplomatic effort, centred on the Department of Foreign Affairs led by Mr Coveney.“This has been a difficult time for Mr O’Halloran and his family,” Mr Coveney said on Friday. “The Government has been actively engaged on the matter throughout and is delighted it has reached a successful result.”Protracted processHis family were said to be delighted at the culmination of a protracted process, which saw them engage in high-profile lobbying for his release. It is understood that his wife, Tara O’Halloran, had been set to appear before the Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs next week.However, there was criticism for the Government. Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Andrews, who lobbied for Mr O’Halloran’s release, said he was “puzzled” that Mr Coveney expressed gratitude to the Chinese authorities for their help when they were responsible for his detention.“It surprised me because it implies the Chinese authorities were blameless in the matter and clearly they weren’t,” he said.“This was a negotiation between the Irish and Chinese authorities. The implication of that is that the Chinese authorities were controlling the process and a process that had no basis in law.”Mr Andrews also criticised the Department of Foreign Affairs for not using the resources of the European Union’s delegation in Beijing to help in Mr O’Halloran’s case.Stay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"post brexit checks for goods moving into north are not fit for purpose eu officials","story":"An anti-NI protocol sign near Larne port, one of the locations of post-Brexit agrifood checks. File photograph: Mark MarlowBloombergEU officials have said that the system for post-Brexit checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland is “not fit for purpose”.A draft report by EU officials, compiled following an audit carried out by the European Commission in June last year, is highly critical of the current system of agrifood checks and recommends a series of changes.Officials say the UK government has “failed to ensure that sufficient resources – human and structural – have been made available to the responsible competent authorities in Northern Ireland”.Since the UK left the EU, new trade arrangements have created economic barriers on the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland, with the aim being to avoid the creation of a hard Border on the island of Ireland.The latter has been achieved by effectively keeping Northern Ireland within the EU’s single market for goods, which has led to the checks on agrifood products crossing the Irish Sea into Northern Ireland from Britain.Staffing was cited as a major issue, with EU officials bemoaning an insufficient number of “suitably qualified staff so that official controls and other official activities can be performed efficiently and effectively”.‘Stunt’This week, Stormont’s DUP First Minister Paul Givan said his party colleague Edwin Poots will order a stop to the controversial checks, but the anticipated move by the North’s Minister for Agriculture has been branded a stunt by other parties in Northern Ireland.The other Executive parties insist Mr Poots does not have the authority to prevent checks required under the terms of the EU-UK Brexit withdrawal agreement, an international treaty.Unionists parties and loyalist groups have long been opposed to the post-Brexit trading arrangements for Northern Ireland, arguing that they damage the union between the region and Britain.The UK and the EU remain in talks as both sides attempt to reach a deal on issues relating to the Northern Ireland protocol, the portion of the withdrawal agreement that has given rise to the trading arrangements.Among the recommendations contained in the report are calls to ensure that the authorities have access to a sufficient number of qualified staff, as well as pointing out the need for better facilities and improved information-sharing.“Undertakings given in the United Kingdom’s unilateral declarations have also not been delivered,” the report concludes.“The system in place for controlling the entry of animals and goods into the EU SPS area via Northern Ireland border control posts does not, and cannot in the current circumstances, function effectively.” – PA How is Brexit affecting you?

It takes seconds to post on social media but the fallout can last much longer. It’s important to think before you post, particularly when a matter is the subject of court proceedings or a Garda investigation. Being fair and accurate is crucial. The potentially serious consequences for overstepping the legal lines include a fine, and even jail, for contempt of court or damages for defamation. Here’s a guide to help stay on the right side of the law when you’re online. What’s the legal position when a person is arrested in connection with a criminal offence?The matter is deemed to be sub judice, meaning it’s before a court or judge, and there are clear limits on what can and cannot be said. From the time an inidual is arrestedcharged, the facts are for a court to decide. An inidual arrested and questioned in connection with a criminal offence should not be identified prior to being charged.Why can’t more details be given?Because we operate in a democracy governed by the rule of law. An accused is entitled to the presumption of innocence unless and until proven guilty. Public discussion of the case, which can sometimes be ill-informed, could prejudice a jury whose role is to decide the facts.So what can I say? It’s best to say nothing when a matter is subject of criminal proceedings. There are good reasons for this, including that information circulated about an accused or crime is sometimes inaccurate and whipping up public opinion against accused people has contributed in the past to people being convicted of offences they didn’t commit. What happens if an arrestedcharged person is identified? It depends on what is said. Anyone who publishes negative material about someone who is arrested leaves themselves open to contempt of court andor defamation proceedings. When material about a charged person, or details of the offence with which they are charged, is published, the consequences can be serious. Apart from exposing its publisher to defamation and contempt proceedings, such publication has potential to derail or even collapse a jury trial.What does defamation mean?Defamation is the publication to at least one other person of comment, inaccurate statements, false reporting or other material capable of causing damage to the reputation of a person, business or other organisation. The Defamation Act 2009 defines a “defamatory statement” as one “that tends to injure a person’s reputation in the eyes of reasonable members of society”. Anyone suing for defamation has to show there was “publication, by any means” of defamatory material concerning them to one, or more than one, person. The Act applies to ALL publications and there is a rising number of cases alleging defamation and contempt of court over online content, including social media posts. A couple received €30,000 damages against their neighbour in county Donegal who had put up a Facebook post making allegations including of an affair. Surely I can say what I like to my friends and family in my WhatsApp groups?There’s a risk in saying what you like, even on WhatsApp, if the content is defamatory. Online defamation is the publication of defamatory statements in e-mails, web postings, Facebook posts, tweets and mobile phone group messaging such as WhatsApp groups. A retweet or simple forwarding of a message can be akin to acting as the original publisher, particularly if further comment is added.What about the likes of Google, Facebook and Twitter? Can they be sued over what’s posted on their sites? E-commerce regulations mean intermediaries such as Google, Facebook and Twitter are excluded from liability under a “hosting defence” for material published on their systems where they are unaware of the defamatory, false or criminal content. If intermediaries are given notice of defamatory material, they are expected to take it down speedily if they want to benefit from the hosting defence and are not deemed to be a publisher.

Mr Coveney said he wrote a letter to the Russian defence minister this week requesting a reconsideration of naval exercises off the Irish coast. “This evening I received a letter confirming the Russian exercises will be relocated outside of Ireland’s EEZ. I welcome this response,” Mr Coveney said on Twitter on Saturday. Russian naval drills were due to be undertaken outside Ireland’s sea territory but within the State’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) about 240km off the coast of west Cork next week. This left Irish fishermen angry at the potential disruption to their traditional fishing grounds with up to 60 trawlers expected to start fishing these waters. Russian ambassador to Ireland Yuriy Filatov confirmed the decision of Russia’s defence minister Sergey Shoigu to relocate the military exercises following requests from the Irish Government and the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, which met the ambassador at the embassy in Dublin earlier this week.Mr Filatov said in a statement that the decision was made by Mr Shoigu as “a gesture of goodwill” with “the aim not to hinder fishing activities by the Irish vessels in the traditional fishing areas”.This week I wrote to my counterpart, the Minister of Defence of Russia, to request a reconsideration of naval exercises off the Irish coast. This evening I received a letter confirming the Russian exercises will be relocated outside of Ireland’s EEZ. I welcome this response.— Simon Coveney (@simoncoveney) Brendan Byrne, chief executive of the Irish Fish Processors and Exporters Association, who along with the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation met the ambassador this week, told The  that he welcomed Russia’s decision to relocate the naval exercises. “It was in an eco-sensitive area. It was in an area that Irish fishermen rely on for their livelihoods because it was in a spawning ground for Irish pelagic fishing stocks,” he said.“It was a sensible decision and we commend them for taking it. I congratulate the entire Irish fishing industry in standing united in their campaign to have these drills moved outside the EEZ.”No harm intendedThe Russian ambassador had previously said that the naval exercises were “not in any way a threat to Ireland or anybody else” and that “no harm is intended” and “no problem is expected”.The Department of Transport had issued a safety notice to all seafarers warning of the exact location of the planned Russian naval drills off the southwest coast.Mr Coveney had also previously said that the plans were “not welcome” but that Ireland did not have the powers to prevent the exercises from happening.“I have made it clear to the Russian ambassador in Ireland that it’s not welcome. This is not a time to increase military activity and tension in the context of what is happening with and in Ukraine at the moment,” he said last week. “It’s important that I brief my colleagues on those intentions. Russia, under international law, can take military exercises in international waters, but the fact they are choosing to do it on the west borders of the EU, off the Irish coast, is something that is in our view not welcome and not wanted right now, particularly in the coming weeks.”ConcernTaoiseach Micheál Martin had also expressed concern for the safety of west Cork fishermen who planned to peacefully protest Russian military exercises by continuing to fish in the area.Mr Martin said his priority was the welfare of the fishermen who are engaging in the protest and he warned them that they should exercise caution.“People have to be first and foremost conscious of safety, and in our view that is not the safest thing to be doing, fishing close to where military drilling is taking place,” he said.“We will at some stage engage with the fishermen on this and take advice on that. There needs to be balance here and proportionality on how it is addressed with safety always at the forefront.”"},{"url":null,"title":"inside","story":"Decades of progress overshadowed by Putin crackdowns and confrontation with WestRussia\u0026rsquos land of the midnight sun said to have inspired creator of Chanel No. 5Atomic icebreakers and floating power plants to help Kremlin develop Arctic shipping routeMinority nations feel squeeze as Putin\u0026rsquos \u0026lsquopower vertical\u0026rsquo crushes republics\u0026rsquo autonomyHistory of bloodshed and tragedy haunts stunning region shared by Muslims and ChristiansOil wealth and new mosque and churches help keep Tatarstan on Kremlin\u0027s sideOfficials claim West wants to \u0026lsquoGermanise\u0026rsquo and instil special identity in strategic regionNato monitors heavily armed Kaliningrad as locals long for borders to reopenAttack on renowned Memorial rights group deepens opposition anger and international alarmSaint Petersburg Letter: Russia\u0026rsquos old imperial capital celebrates 200 years since birth of Crime and Punishment creatorEnergy giant hopes vast forests will offset carbon costs and ease green transitionCircassian heritage trampled and property rows continue as Winter Olympics city boomsKremlin criticised as most Russians reject vaccination and hospitals face huge strainKremlin changes tack on global warming and looks to vast forests to offset emissionsRussia and Japan co-operate on Sakhalin despite row over nearby Kuril islandsIndustry and struggling communities fear wildlife support could stifle Far East developmentCity with echoes of San Francisco is thrillingly original, yet tarnished by graft and neglectGrowing energy, security and diplomatic links between Moscow and Beijing worry WestDecembrist rebels and their aristocratic wives embraced \u0026lsquoreal Russia\u0026rsquo in Siberian exileFears for permafrost as tusk hunters feed Chinese market starved of elephant ivoryInside Russia: Melting permafrost threatens critical infrastructure and feeds global warmingStalin\u0027s popularity growing as Kremlin focuses on Soviet triumphs, not tragediesInside Russia: Party wonders how far it cane press Putin after years in soft \u0026lsquosystemic opposition\u0026rsquo roleInside Russia: More protests planned as officials reject calls to address e-voting complaintsMoscow Letter: Poet\u0026rsquos statue has been a magnet for generations of Russian dissentersOn the eve of an expected sham election, many of Putin\u0026rsquos political opponents are already jailed or dead"},{"url":null,"title":"young africans","story":"Tom Saater has a rags to riches story and a unique insight into Nigeria\u0026rsquos biggest cityIn one of the world\u0026rsquos most dangerous places to attend school, teachers lead lessons and the students comeAfrican country\u0026rsquos tech innovators call for international investment and domestic supportYoung Nigerians dance out onto world stage with pride, confidence and high ambitionWomen-led organisation aims to stop atrocities of dictatorship from reoccurringIn the Gambia, a flourishing comedy scene is used to convey serious messagesStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":null,"title":"american actor restoring downton shabby uncovers castles grisly","story":"It is a majestic castle that would not look out of place as the centrepiece of any glossy TV period drama.However, when an American actor took on the dilapidated Hopwood Hall (nicknamed Downton Shabby) as a DIY project, little did he know that he would uncover a centuries-old feud triggered by a grisly longbow murder.Hopwood DePree\u0027s ancestors used to live at the 15th century grade II listed building on the outskirts of Manchester, but it has stood derelict since the 1920s.DePree plans to restore the castle to its former beauty, with hopes of making it a country retreat, hotel and community hub.But as he delved into the historic building\u0027s past, he discovered that his ancestors had been responsible for killing one of their neighbours.In the 1500s, Ralph Hopwood (one of DePree\u0027s distant relatives) drew his longbow and shot an arrow at a neighbour who had trespassed onto Hopwood land. The arrow pierced the intruder through the chest. He later died in his wife\u0027s arms.DePree discusses the medieval murder in depth in his book Downton Shabby: One American\u0027s Ultimate DIY Adventure Restoring His Family\u0027s English Castle.He moved to the UK from California to begin the renovation after stumbling upon the building while exploring an ancestry website, and felt compelled to reconnect with his past.Since the longbow murder in the 1500s, there have been other intruders at Hopwood Hall.One youngster recently broke in, injuring himself in the process, then left a trail of blood through the building. Before leaving, he eerily wrote help in blood on the walls.Some parts of Hopwood Hall date back to 1426. Lord Byron stayed there briefly in 1811.It has 60 rooms, 812 windows, 35 chimneys and 107 doors.When DePree, 51, first visited the hall, it was vandalised and graffitied.But, with the help of an army of determined local volunteers, he is determined to continue his incredible progress and open Hopwood Hall to the public by 2025.He told The : It\u0027s been a completely unexpected adventure but so rewarding and fun. It\u0027s in full progress and we\u0027ve made a lot of advancements. We want to bring it back to its original grandeur and preserve the estate, and to transform it into an arts and culture venue, with accommodation of 25 bedrooms to host people for retreats. I\u0027d love to live there when it\u0027s ready.We\u0027re doing it in multiple phases, making it wind and water tight. One section will be open for tours this summer. We\u0027ve had so many requests for weddings. I\u0027ve done minor bathroom and kitchen remodelling but nothing of this grand scale - certainly nothing in this time frame!Among the gruelling challenges he and his team have accomplished is painstakingly chipping off the old fashioned cement rendering from the walls and replacing it with more modern plaster.Now people are having biscuits and making tea, enjoying the garden, he said. The lights have come back on. There\u0027s electricity and running water.As DePree delved into his past during the project, he discovered that Ralph Hopwood was not the only one of his ancestors to cause a stir in the community.Lady Susan Hopwood was born in the 1810s and married the heir of the hall, Captain Edward, who legally acquired it in 1880.She was a fierce environmentalist and hired her own personal inspectors to go on the hunt for evidence that cotton mills were polluting the area, with the aim of bringing prosecutions against the mill owners.As a member of a prominent smoke abatement society, she held a gala in aid of the issue at Hopwood Park in 1893 and 5,000 guests turned up to support her.She was an early member of Greenpeace in a way, said DePree. Cotton mills were pouring pollution into the Manchester skyline and she was out there talking about it.His book is available for pre-order on Amazon and will be published in the UK on June 9.More from NewsJustin Trudeau forced to flee official residence as anti-vaccine truck convoy descends on OttawaNorth Korea fires largest missile test since 2017 as it ramps up pressure ahead of Winter OlympicsPrince Harry and Meghan wade into Spotify anti-vax rowPregnant woman forced to appeal to the Taliban after New Zealand Covid rules blocked her from returning home to give birthTories can still reverse their ruinous National Insurance hikeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"greece renews calls elgin marbles return now perfect replicas","story":"The Elgin Marbles should be returned to Greece now that technology has allowed archaeologists to make a millimetre-perfect replica, the country’s ambassador has said.Greece has been trying to get the statues returned to Athens since shortly after they were removed by Lord Elgin and shipped to Britain more than 200 years ago.Plans to make a historically accurate replica of the marbles, which will be indistinguishable from the originals, have been unveiled by the Institute for Digital Archaeology.The Greek Ambassador to the UK, Ioannis Raptakis, welcomed the announcement on Friday night, saying it provided the Government with a “unique opportunity” to return the sculptures.Speaking to The  he said: “Greece is willing to give to the British Museum cultural treasures on loan which have never left the country in return or explore the idea to let the British Museum make a high-quality marble copy not just of the sculptures it has, but of the Parthenon sculptures that are in the Acropolis Museum in Athens.“The discussion involving new technologies in order to create a high-quality copy of the Sculptures is very useful and certainly adds value to the argument that the British government has now a unique opportunity to end an injustice that weighs on all Greek hearts and finally return the Parthenon Sculptures.”Mr Raptakis said it would be a “fantastic statement” for the British Government to assist in the reunification of the Parthenon Sculptures.The plan to copy the section of the Parthenon frieze in the British Museum comes from the Institute for Digital Archaeology (IDA), which created a full-size replica of Syria’s Palmyra Arch which was blown up by Isis in October 2015.The replica arch was unveiled in Trafalgar Square five years ago. It has since been on a journey across Europe, the US and the Middle East and has been seen by an estimated 10 million people, far more than the original ever was.The IDA intends to make a perfect replica of a panel known as a meotope which depicts a fight between a human warrior and a centaur, a half-man, half-horse figure from classical mythology.The Oxford-based institute has pioneered a technique known as 3D Machining. First a digital image is created using photogrammetry, then a robot-operated machine uses chisels in the same way as a human sculptor to carve a copy of the original. The institute is sourcing blocks of marble identical to those used by the sculptor Phidias and his workmen to create the statues and the frieze which ran around the Parthenon’s architrave.The replica will cost an estimated £20,000 and take three to six months to complete. Two copies will be made, one with the damage caused by two and a half millennia of pollution, vandalism, occupying Turkish troops, souvenir hunters, the world’s then-largest explosion when gunpowder stored in the building blew up in 1687, and misguided attempts to clean the marble with acid once it arrived at the museum. The other will be a copy of how it would have looked when new, with missing pieces restored and any damage repaired.The dispute over the marbles has blighted relations between Britain and the Athens government since the 1830s when the modern Greek state was created. Around half the marbles have remained in Athens.Roger Michel, the executive director of the IDA, said experience with the Palmyra Arch has convinced him that a good replica can have the same emotional power as the original. He said: “The people of Britain have formed a deep bond with Greece’s Marbles. They will be missed when they go home.The project has been welcomed by campaigners who want the marbles repatriated. The lawyer Geoffrey Robertson QC, author of Who Owns History: Elgin’s Loot and the Case for Returning Plundered Treasure, said the ability to create exact replicas made the case for returning the originals to Greece unanswerable.More from NewsJustin Trudeau forced to flee official residence as anti-vaccine truck convoy descends on OttawaNorth Korea fires largest missile test since 2017 as it ramps up pressure ahead of Winter OlympicsPrince Harry and Meghan wade into Spotify anti-vax rowPregnant woman forced to appeal to the Taliban after New Zealand Covid rules blocked her from returning home to give birthTories can still reverse their ruinous National Insurance hikeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"britain attractive thousands fleeing hong kong","story":"Ask a thousand people what is the biggest question Britain faces on the subject of immigration, and most would probably cite the trickle of desperate refugees attempting to enter the country across the Channel in small boats. A lot would talk about the post-Brexit exodus of Eastern Europeans and how difficult that has made getting a builder.It is likely not one would be concerned, pleased, or have any view at all on what could turn out to be the biggest ever immigration to the UK: the potential legal arrival of three to five million Hong Kong Chinese people – 70 per cent of the former colony’s population – as they find life under Beijing rule ever more intolerable.Indeed, since the Hong Kong British National (Overseas) visa launched a year ago tomorrow, the influx of Hong Kongers has been proceeding apace without anyone seemingly noticing. According to the latest data published by the Home Office in November, the UK received 88,000 applications – some 2,500 a week – and granted 76,000.Almost all intend to stay few see any prospect of returning to the home they still love. For many, who don’t just dislike their new communist rulers but have already offended them by expressing their views, even returning on holiday would be dangerous.The new arrivals are predominantly not the wealthy Hong Kongers who have been buying up luxury properties in London and investment properties across the country for years, but what in Hong Kong would be called “grassroots” people and here we would call middle class – corporate and civil service employees, IT specialists, engineers, accountants, business owners and their families.Educated, motivated, often strongly Christian, with democratic ideals, good English and – importantly – not inconsiderable funds, they share a desire to make a new life and “not to be any trouble”.And these prospective model British citizens are arriving daily in their hundreds, with boxes of possessions, children, grandparents and even pets. One Hong Konger, starting a fairly modest job that he had already lined up with a luxury goods company in London, told his new colleagues he had spent £3,000 shipping the family guinea pig in the cargo hold: “You don’t want to upset the kids before they’ve even arrived in the country.”Having scrutinised the advantages and attractions of hundreds of possible places to live – property prices, school league tables, hospitals and train links – online, from 6,000 miles away, the newcomers are fanning out across the country, with some arranging home rentals for a year (rent paid upfront, as they have no credit history) to get a feel for an area and pooling information with people back home on WhatsApp groups.Others are ing straight in and buying newbuilds, which many Chinese people love. Some of the more traditional are said to be nervous of secondhand houses because of concerns about ghosts or just a dislike of used possessions. Others still are buying two newbuild homes on the same development. Or three. One will typically be for the family, the second for the elderly parents, the third to rent out to provide the basis of an income.Most buyers pay cash. House prices in Hong Kong, even out in the rural New Territories, are at London levels and selling even a small property can pay for a lot of bricks and mortar in places you might not expect to be on Hong Kong people’s radar, like Warrington (where sales are hitting double figures on one new estate), Ebbsfleet in Kent (ditto) or Okehampton in Cornwall.There are areas the new Hong Kongers favour, such as Kingston and its surrounds in south-west London, but “Hong Kong buyers are location agnostic”, says James Holmear, sales director of Redrow, one of the many housebuilders assiduously cultivating the burgeoning market. “Most of our houses have a Thirties arts and crafts design they love, so they’ll say, often on video calls while they’re still in Hong Kong, ‘We want that house.’ We’ll say, ‘Yes, but where would you like it?’ And they’ll reply, ‘Where are you building them?’ And often, when they’ve researched it, for schools in particular, they’ll buy off-plan before they’ve even arrived here. They move very fast.” Redrow has sold nearly 100 new homes to Hong Kongers since July.When it comes to employment, the newcomers are typically flexible and pragmatic while focused and ambitious. Two years ago, Mike Hui, 38, was in the thick of the democracy protests in Hong Kong as a photographer with the radical tabloid Apple News, which the Beijing-controlled authorities closed down last June. What was happening to his homeland stopped him sleeping and made him cry. “I’m a reporter, but I am a Hong Konger more,” he says.He and his wife, Ardis, who was a training officer for a restaurant chain, saw the way things were going early and got out with their five-year-old daughter, Ellie, before the newspaper was shut down. They headed for Leeds, popular with Hong Kongers and where Hui has a cousin. They brought just 20 boxes of possessions – as well as a not insignificant £1.2 million from the sale of their house in the New Territories.  For now, Hui is delivering meals for a Chinese takeaway, while his wife works in a warehouse. But they have already bought a three-bedroom Redrow semi which will adjoin a house bought by friends from home. And Hui is already doing freelance photography – as well as thinking of setting up his own Chinese takeaway. Ellie, meanwhile, loves her new school.The Hui family’s is a classic story of the Hong Kong newcomer, with its themes of foresight, bravery – they had never been to the UK – self-reliance and financial savvy. There is another sub-theme, too they are vocally grateful to Britain – and specifically to the Conservative Government – for letting them take refuge here and are patriotic towards their new country.“We will never be able to go back to Hong Kong,” says Michael, a young former democracy campaigner, now living in Kingston, “but we’re still proud of it and we don’t want to give it a bad name.” Previously an event organiser, he quickly trained as a men’s barber when he got to London. He is now planning his own salon – before long, he hopes, a chain of them.And therein lies one of many peculiar features of this wave of immigration, which could soon make ex-Hong Kongers one of the most sizeable groups to settle in the UK.Economists have taken note that almost half plan to start their own business – and have the money to do so – that most are aged 30-50 and all are well educated with good English and more than 10 years’ experience in a professional field. This makes them a huge asset – especially to a tired old country with 2.5 million job vacancies.Politically, however, it is treading on thin ice to applaud a huge influx of anglophile, entrepreneurial Chinese people, suggesting as it does that other waves of immigration have been less successful for one reason or another. Which would be rather hurtful to millions of already successful, patriotic immigrants and their children born here.So, search for a public figure of Right or Left saying outright that the Hong Kongers are an asset and you will not find much – even though they patently are. Conservatives, additionally, must have realised that three million or so new citizens who are effectively fleeing socialism – and are hugely thankful to British Tories – could be quite helpful at the ballot box in the near future.Left-wing commentators, meanwhile, have already been growling that “the good migrant narrative” is racist, even if it is celebratory. Academics, similarly, have weighed in against stereotypes of Hong Kongers’ self-reliance and industriousness.Ex-Hong Kongers are a very unusual immigrant population. Some have drawn parallels to previous waves of talented, educated settlers whose lives had been made intolerable by hateful dictators, but rose quickly to the top of all walks of British life. Think only of the Jews fleeing Hitler in the Thirties and the Ugandan Asians thrown out by Idi Amin in 1972. But numbers in each case were tiny – there were just 28,000 Ugandan Asian refugees – and both groups arrived in Britain largely penniless. Most now fleeing Hong Kong are bringing their money with them and are, as one technology company boss keen on employing as many as possible said last week: “Plug and play – they are ready to work, and work smartly, from day one. We have been hugely impressed.”What about the other pervasive stereotype, of genius Hong Kong-born children? A teacher at a small working-class primary school in Nottingham which has taken nine refugee pupils – making them the largest ethnic group on the roll – confirms that it may be exaggerated, but along the right lines.“Not one of these kids has been a problem for us. There’s no need to support them with additional English. They’re highly motivated. One lad who doesn’t say much in class just aced it and got 40 out of 40 in his Year 5 arithmetic test, and also did amazingly well in English. The teacher was really surprised, but we found that they were way ahead of us at his school in Hong Kong.”There are a couple of culture shocks, the teacher adds. “They’re masked up all the time, while our Covid measures amount to opening a window.”To spend any time with the new generation of Hong Kong refugees and see the UK through their enthusiastic, grateful eyes is also rather salutary for any native-born Brit a little jaundiced about today’s UK.Pastor Johnny Chan, who came to Leeds in 1969 and worked as a dentist, now leads one of the city’s five Chinese Christian churches, between the Emmerdale Farm studios and the Headingley cricket ground. Sunday services now attract almost 300 people, including 40 or 50 new immigrant families.“We Chinese think when we go to a new place, we have to respect the people, the traditions and the law of the land,” he says. “And for the new people, freedom, democracy, British culture and the rule of law are wonderful things that they experienced in the past and are now seeing taken away at home.“Also, they are startled by the courtesy here. We Chinese aren’t as courteous as the British. All our people say they’re made incredibly welcome here. We hear lots of stories about neighbours giving people furniture, of them teaching our people how things work that they’ve never seen before – like central heating.”Ask about anti-Chinese racism and he laughs. “The answer is really, no. Not a thing. But you know,” he smiles, “we Chinese can be pretty racist ourselves. We are not about to accuse others without getting our own house in order. We’re just incredibly grateful to the British government for allowing potentially more than three million Hong Kong folks to come here.”Pastor Chan warns that stories of unhappy Hong Kong immigrants will inevitably come up – but that Britain should be a little sceptical about them. “Propaganda is the one thing the Chinese Communist Party is good at,” he says. “When there were stories of empty supermarket shelves and petrol shortages, they made sure the media in Hong Kong went big on it to discourage people from leaving.”Hong Kongers who are loyal to Beijing are a rarity, but not unknown. Christine Lee, a solicitor in Birmingham and London named earlier this month by MI5 as an agent working covertly for the Chinese government, reportedly came with her parents from Hong Kong to Northern Ireland in 1974.Such stories are highly anomalous, however. In Mill Hill, north London, Lore Chan and her husband Bernard, also a dentist but no relation of Pastor Johnny, are active in helping and encouraging new Hong Kong people to settle through the Chinese church in Brook Green, Hammersmith.“There’s a lot for the new people to give up,” Mr Chan says. “As long as their children settle in school, that’s their priority.” Professionals can struggle a little with having to slip down a rung or two into lower quality jobs. “Others go to great efforts to keep up their status and income. Many work through the night online, doing their Hong Kong job – often in finance or tech – and not telling anyone they’re in the UK.”“Some of our younger people like my sister, who was born here, used to say they felt they were born in the wrong country, because they loved Hong Kong so much. But you don’t hear that any more.”More from NewsJustin Trudeau forced to flee official residence as anti-vaccine truck convoy descends on OttawaNorth Korea fires largest missile test since 2017 as it ramps up pressure ahead of Winter OlympicsPrince Harry and Meghan wade into Spotify anti-vax rowPregnant woman forced to appeal to the Taliban after New Zealand Covid rules blocked her from returning home to give birthTories can still reverse their ruinous National Insurance hikeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"former bbc chairman michael grade running lead ofcom telegraph","story":"After a career at the helm of some of the country’s biggest broadcasters, it would surely be a fascinating case of poacher turned gamekeeper.But it has now emerged that Michael Grade, the former chief executive of Channel 4 and former chairman of the BBC, has applied to run Ofcom, the broadcasting regulator.The  understands that the Conservative peer has submitted an application to lead Ofcom, after Paul Dacre, Boris Johnson\u0027s first choice for the role, pulled out of the running last year.This comes after Lord Grade warned the regulator against “taking sides in the culture war” by banning actors in blackface and recently telling the BBC the licence fee is too expensive.Since chairing the BBC between 2004 and 2006, 78-year-old Lord Grade - who is firmly fixed in the public eye for his cigars, red socks and red power braces - has become a fierce critic of some of the broadcaster\u0027s actions.Last week, he praised Nadine Dorries, the Culture Secretary, for her decision to fire the starting pistol for the big debate about what we want from the BBC and how we pay for it.Asked about his application to chair Ofcom, Lord Grade - who in his time backed the likes of EastEnders, The Singing Detective, Friends and ER on his channels and co-financed Trainspotting and Four Weddings and a Funeral - said: I wouldn\u0027t dream of commenting on any rumours.If appointed, it would mark a pinnacle of achievement in the industry for a man who already hails from one of the country’s most renowned entertainment and broadcasting dynasties.After all, one of Lord Grade’s uncles was the noted impresario and media proprietor Lew Grade, who was instrumental in the early days of the ITV network, while his father Leslie ran one of the UK’s most successful light entertainment talent agencies.Lord Grade, who as chairman of Channel 4 was criticised for the sexual content of some of its programmes - including rows over Eurotrash, which featured nudity and transvestism, and Dyke TV - has not always seen eye to eye with the watchdog he now aims to run.Last year, The  disclosed that the peer, who has also served as executive chairman of ITV, had written to Ofcom saying that its investigation into a family-run television channel for showing a 1970s TV programme could set a dangerous precedent.The watchdog was investigating whether Talking Pictures TV breached standards by broadcasting an episode of Rogue\u0027s Rock on Boxing Day, which featured blacked-up actors. The comedy adventure show, known for outlandish plots, ran for three series on ITV in the mid-1970s.In a letter to Dame Melanie Dawes, the Ofcom chief executive, Lord Grade said he was deeply troubled by the investigation and warned that any sanction would ultimately be politically correct censorship.He has also waded into the row over the funding of the BBC. Speaking in the House of Lords last week, Lord Grade said: I wish those in the BBC who asked for more money from the Government would watch their own news bulletins and see what is going on, with people having to decide whether to heat or eat, and the increased use of food banks.There is a complete lack of reality about what is going on in Britain with this regressive tax.I believe in the BBC and I stand with everybody in this House who supports it, but this is not the time for it to be asking for more money. Does the minister agree that the Secretary of State’s decision to fire the starting pistol for the big debate about what we want from the BBC and how we pay for it is a very good step in the right direction and very timely?The appointment process is being re-run after officials blocked Mr Dacre\u0027s bid for the role last year. The new deadline for applications is Wednesday, February 2, and the process is being overseen by Sue Gray, the senior civil servant also tasked with investigating illicit parties in Downing Street.Mr Dacre, the 73-year-old former Daily Mail editor, gave up his designs on the role even when the process was re-run, complaining that without liberal or left-wing associations he would “have more chance of winning the lottery than getting the job”.He attacked “the Blob” of senior civil servants, who he claimed were determined to block figures with his views from taking high-profile public sector roles.The claims would suggest that ministers would also have a battle on their hands to appoint Lord Grade, who regularly makes frank interventions relating to broadcasting, and was appointed to the Lords by David Cameron in 2010.The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport declined to comment on inidual applications for the Ofcom role. The Government has said it is committed to finding the best possible candidate.More from NewsJustin Trudeau forced to flee official residence as anti-vaccine truck convoy descends on OttawaNorth Korea fires largest missile test since 2017 as it ramps up pressure ahead of Winter OlympicsPrince Harry and Meghan wade into Spotify anti-vax rowPregnant woman forced to appeal to the Taliban after New Zealand Covid rules blocked her from returning home to give birthTories can still reverse their ruinous National Insurance hikeMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"covid vaccinations children aged 5","story":"Covid vaccinations for children aged - to roll out this weekJabs will initially go to , kids most clinically at risk from the disease including those with diabetes and learning disabilities or who live in a household where someone is immunosuppressed Image: AFP via Getty ImagesByNigel NelsonPolitical Editor:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan |commentsThe mass rollout of Covid vaccine to children aged between  -  begins this week.

Deputy head of the NHS vaccination programme Dr Nikki Kanani said: “It is important our youngest and most at-risk get protected. We are asking parents not to delay coming forward.” One in  schoolchildren are now off sick or isolating, with cases still going up in younger age groups. Any child who has tested positive will not be able to get jabbed until four weeks after they are clear. More than  million jabs including  million booster doses have been delivered by the NHS so far.

The Prime Minister will spend the weekend at his Chequers retreatBoris is waiting tooopinionByKeir Mudie:,  Jan |commentsI canapost remember ever being so excited over waiting for something to be published.Maybe when I was waiting for the last Rebus to come out . This Sue Gray report is having the same effect. Last thing I check before bed, first thing when I get up. Has it landed  Tragic way to live, really.Westminster is a bit like those books at the moment. I love Ian Rankin but I find myself reading them not for the plots – like I did at the start – but more for what’s been going on with Rebus. And that’s the way things are round here these days. There’s a cost of living crisis coming, war brewing, all sorts of problems, but the most fascinating thing is the psychodrama going on around the PM and Sue Gray.  It was due Thursday, then possibly Friday. Now they reckon it’s due tomorrow. What’s in there, do you think  What’s the hold-up  It seems pretty clear that it’s not going to be good news for the PM. People I speak to in Whitehall tell me they had to change their media lines because it went from “very bad” to “terrible” very quickly. The excitement. Labour is in a slightly tricky position. The bind seems to be, do you want Mr Johnson to stay or keep the pressure on and kick him out  There are two schools of thought. The first is that it would be beneficial to keep him around, kick him repeatedly until the next election and then let him limp into a defeat. The danger with that strategy is thatMr Johnson rides this crisis out we will head into the summer, the Commonwealth Games, the Jubilee celebrations, the weather, and everyone’s mood picks up, and all this becomes a distant memory.  Mr Johnson becomes a good-time PM again. The other danger is that you would be letting a lame duck run the show during an exceptionally dficult time for the country. The other school of thought is that taking a scalp at any time is good. Also,Rishi Sunak is the favourite to take over, it might be quite nice to have him in place. A new billionaire PM – and former hedge fund boss – as we stagger into the cost of living crisis. That’s quite easy to frame for a Labour attack. Anyways. We’ll see. Maybe Tuesday. We are in the hands of Sue Gray, who sounds like she knows what she’s doing and – as civil servants go – is an interesting character. Thorough and no-nonsense are the words used to describe her. Fair is another. Ms Gray used to run a pub in Northern Ireland, which suggests she knows a party when she sees one. And her husband is a country and western singer. Who could not have faith in someone married to a country and western singer  I like that music, which is honest stuff and manages to be very serious while not taking itself too seriously at the same time. I collect some of the funnier titles, like I Wouldn’t Take Her to a Dogfightor You’re A Hard Dog To Keep Under The Porch.

Care England says at least , have gone from residential care since vaccination became compulsory for them in November last year. And a further , working in private homes are set to follow under rules which mean they must have their first jab by Thursday. That equates to one care worker being lost for every elderly and vulnerable person they look after. Care worker Theresa Darby, , of Hersham, Surrey always masks up and wears gloves on visits but she is being sacked this week from her £-an-hour job she has done for six years because she is unvaccinated. She is frightened her enlarged heart caused by cardiomyopathy means the jab would put her in danger. But doctors will not give her a medical exemption. She said: “This stupid and ridiculous government says people can now visit care homes without restrictions.“But it is happy to fire those of us who do the caring..“I’m being blackmailed by the government into having a vaccine which may harm me. It’s disgraceful.”  The Homecare Association estimates that nearly one in five of its members have not been jabbed - and losing them will come on top of , unfilled posts.Frontline NHS staff and home carers need proof of being doubled jabbed by April . Up to , NHS staff will get dismissal warnings from Friday.Unison general secretary Christina McAnea said: “Care is in the grip of a staffing crisis. Homes can ill afford to lose experienced staff. But that’s exactly what’s happening.” Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said: “We strongly support vaccination. But persuasion is likely to be more effective than compulsion among those with genuine fears. “The need is to balance the mitigated risk of infection with the risk of older and disabled people going without vital care. “ Martin Green of charity Care England said it was “grossly unfair” to single out residential staff six months before other care workers. He added: “The virus is not dangerous for certain parts of the sector and not for others. “And mandatory vaccination needs to be accompanied by the necessary resource and support.” Tory backbenchers are pressing ministers to U-turn on the plan as the UK moves out of the pandemic.And Health Secretary Sajid Javid said: “We’re reflecting on it because we do have to accept the virus has changed.”Patricia Marquis of the Royal College of Nursing said: “The Government needs to come up with a fully-funded workforce plan.” Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON UnisonConservative PartyNHSRoyal College of NursingBoris JohnsonCare homesHeart diseaseNursing homesHealth insuranceDisabilityPolitics\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get UK politics insight with our free daily email briefing straight to your inboxInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Six in ten blame lack of money for the dficulties doctors and nurses face in caring for patients but more than half also cite government incompetence as the reason.

Perhaps it will be released as an opera, so it will cost £ for a ticket to see it. Then we’ll see a chorus of tenors singing “why do you leave us, do not forsake us ” Then the sopranos will reply “We go to Waitrose, to fetch more wine,” in red chfon dresses. Then a booming bass roars cheekily “It’s a workplace meeting”, all in Italian. It’s possible the report has become more complicated because it turns out Prince Andrew was at one of the parties.  Or maybe she can’t finish it because there was a -piece swing band playing in the No bathroom throughout lockdown, and  people re-enacting the Battle of El Alamein in the kitchen, so she has to interview all of them. But now the Met Police have been kind enough to make her job simpler. Because they insist her investigation should leave out anything about the parties. And an investigation is always easieryou don’t have to include anything that you were investigating. To keep the police and the Government happy, her report should go: “On Tuesday it was quite sunny. The end.” Then she can pad it out with  pages of dot-to-dot puzzles and a nice picture of farmyard animals, with suggestions for how to colour them in. The police can make their own lives simpler by applying the same rules to themselves. When they investigate a robbery, they can leave out everything about the robbery from their investigation and they’ll be able to complete their task much more quickly. When the police announced they were investigating the parties, we were told this meant the report might be delayed for several more weeks. That would be convenient. Maybe they’ll keep this going. So next time the report’s about to appear, it will be announced that the Vatican are investigating the parties to see whether they constituted a mortal sin. So the report can’t be published until there’s a pronouncement from the Pope. In any case, the Government’s supporters now say the whole business of parties against the rules is “trivia”. Why are we bothering with wine and cakes, when there’s inflation and a might-be-a-war with Russia   This would make sense,when Johnson was reading out the rules every single day for several months, he’d said: “But don’t bother sticking to any of this. “You can do whatever you like, I’d invite your mates round and spend all day naked mud-wrestlingI was you. Remember – Hands – Face – Cake – Bottle – Conga.” But they insisted we absolutely had to stay alone, while they did the opposite. Andyou were cynical, you might suspect thatthey lie so blatantly about that, maybe it’s possible that they lie about everything  as well.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss admitted taxes are never popular as she defended the Governmentaposs plan for a manesto-busting tax rise in April.The Prime Minister has been under pressure from his own backbenchers to ditch plans to for workers, employers and the self-employed to pay .p more in the pound for National Insurance from April  for a year.The £bn a year hike, which was announced last year, will raise cash to tackle Covid backlogs in the NHS and fund social care.But it comes as families face a cost of living crisis, with bills expected to soar when the energy price cap rises.Mr Johnson was reportedly wavering over the decision this week amid fury over the Downing Street partygate saga.But in a joint article with Chancellor Rishi Sunak today, he double down on the plans - despite the pair claiming to be tax-cutting Conservatives and Thatcherites.Reports also suggested that plans to cut VAT on fuel had been abandoned - despite looming rises in energy bills.Ms Truss told the BBC : We are in a very dficult situation. We have spent a lot of money on the Covid crisis, which had public support, whether that was the furlough scheme, whether it was the business support scheme and the reality is we do need to pay this money back.She acknowledged that taxes are never popular but argued that signicant amounts of money spent coping with Covid must be repaid. As soon as possible, we want to be in a position to lower our tax rates, we want to drive economic growth, because ultimately that is what will make our country successful, she said. But we do face a short-term issue, which is that we have spent signicant amounts of money dealing with the Covid crisis that does need to be paid back. But unrest remains among Conservative MPs, with senior backbencher Robert Halfon urging the Government to go back to the drawing board.  He told Sky News that people were facing a real struggle to feed their families and pay for the cost of clothing and the cost of living. Mr Halfon said: I have suggested that the Government looks at windfall taxes on big business, particularly oil companies for example who have been raking it in over the past couple of years, to perhaps increase capital gains tax as well - so that we can raise those funds for the NHS without hitting low-income workers. Labour aposs Lisa Nandy warned itaposs just simply not possible for a lot of people to survivetheir tax burden grows.She urged the Government to rethink the National Insurance rise, adding Labour would come forward with a much fairer taxation system. AskedLabour would repeal the planned tax hike, the Shadow Levelling Up Secretary said: Weaposre hoping that the Government wonapost go ahead with it. Well, look - we wouldnapost bring it in in the first place, let me be absolutely clear with youthere was a Labour government today there would be no rise in National Insurance, people would not be facing the prospect of seeing their incomes squeezed even more. But Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said the pandemic had given ministers an opportunity to smuggle in a big tax rise needed to cover the long-term ever-growing costs of the NHS. Mr Johnson told Times Radio: Evenwe hadnapost had a pandemic and eventhe Government wasnapost doing anything about social care, they would still have needed a rise of something like this because spending on the NHS is just rising inexorably year on year on year. In a way, my view is that the pandemic has given them an excuse to smuggle in the rather big tax rise that they would have had to do in any case.

Kate and Vinny Field, of Leeds, are the owners of two “happy and healthy” Dobermanns Veronica and Regina, Leeds Live reports.The husband and we received a carefully crafted letter calling them “cruel” and “evil” for not taking them on walks despite them having enough exercise. When the pooches joined the family in , Kate used to take them on two walks a day but she was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in June  meaning she’s unable to take them both on walks alone. Now the pair leave them to run freely in their spacious garden and once a week business owner Vinny takes them to a private field where they run freely for around an hour.Kate, who admitted she was “enraged” when she first got the letter, decided to share it on Facebook to ask the owner of the letter to come and speak with them.The letter reads: “Take yoredogs for a walk you cruel evil people. Big dogs like what you have should be taken for a walk and not just left in a garden to probably paddle in their own faeces. This is from all the local dog owners and other disgusted people. We have reported you.”  Kate recalling how she felt when she first read the letter said: “It really enraged me when I first saw it thinking ‘who do they think they are’. “I would love for them to come forward, I would explain I can’t physically walk them.” Vinny questioned: “Itaposs weird. How long must it have taken to stencil every word, they even spelt the second word wrong but it must have taken some painstaking time. They’ve got so much time on their hands that we haven’t got.” Veronia, nicknamed Ronnie, joined the family in April  at eight months old but sadly, she had been mistreated by the previous owners. She also doesn’t like young children and other dogs meaning Kate would have to take her out for walks when she knew they wouldn’t bump into the kids or dogs. Regina, also known as Reggie, was eight weeks old when the couple brought her home. Kate continued: “We’re quite alright people,you have a problem you can come and speak to us. Whether they actually know us or really don’t know much about the dogs. The dogs get enough exercise, I don’t understand where this has come from or why they sent the letter. “I’m not strong enough to take them out. We’ve got one of the largest gardens in our street,you were to go around and run all the wayand to the side of the house, you’d get a lot of exercise. They also have all the downstairs. “With the dogs we got, most people when they see them they’ll cross the road because they’re so scared of them. It’s like you can’t win. The oldest , she doesn’t like young children or other dogs even though she live with another dog. They’re also very protective. “We’re responsible dog owners, they’re happy, healthy and loved. Whoever sent the letter has no idea. A lot of people have said itaposs a hate letter and to report it to the police. “If they have gone to the RSPCA or other animal charities,they came out to see our dogs, they would say there’s no way they’re mistreated.” Another nonsensical stenciled letter was also sent to someone in Meanwood talking about bombs and Kate suspects it could be the same culprit.

Over , people are diagnosed with bowel cancer in the UK every single year, according to Bowel Cancer UK.There are a number of signs of the disease andthe cancer is spotted early there are often greater chances of survival.Bowel Cancer UK explained that bowel cancer is a treatable and curable type of the disease especiallydiagnosed early. Unfortunately, survival rates begin to fall as the disease is allowed to develop, reports The Express.Doctor Belinda Grfiths, who does cancer screenings from The Fleet Street Clinic, has outlined a number of signs.  She said: “The symptoms of bowel cancer can be subtle and can often be confused with symptoms of other, less serious illnesses. “It is important to note that the majority of people with these symptoms do not have bowel cancer but symptoms should not be ignored just in case it is.” The GP states: “You should highlight concerns and symptoms which are present for longer than three-weeks to your doctor so they can investigate the cause. “Delaying investigation could result in bowel cancer being diagnosed at a later stage.”  Doctor Belinda said that persistent and unexplained change in bowel habit such as having more frequent bowel movements, constipation, or having looser stools, lasting for longer than six week is a common sign. Bowel Cancer UK says that one in  men and one in  women will be diagnosed with bowel cancer during their letime. The charity says: “If you have any symptoms, don’t be embarrassed and don’t ignore them.”The NHS explains: When you first see a GP, theyaposll ask about your symptoms and whether you have a family history of bowel cancer.According to the health body, your GP may carry out a number of tests.Theyaposll usually carry out a simple examination of your bottom, known as a digital rectal examination , and examine your tummy . There are some known risk factors, though having one or more risk factors doesn’t mean that you will definitely get bowel cancer, however. Although it is very dficult to research the link between diet and cancer, studies have shown certain foods can definitely affect the risk of bowel cancer. Bowel cancer can be targeted with a range of treatments, based on where your cancer is and how far it has spread. The NHS explains the main treatments are:Surgery – the cancerous section of bowel is removed itaposs the most effective way of curing bowel cancer and in many cases is all you need Chemotherapy – where medicine is used to kill cancer cells Radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells Targeted therapies – a newer group of medicines that increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy and prevents the cancer spreading.Read MoreRead MoreMost Read Dont MissFollow MirrorFacebookTwitterComment MORE ON NHSBowel cancerCancer\" data-immediate\"data-immediate\"Get email updates with the days biggest storiesInvalid EmailSomething went wrong, please try again later.We use your sign-up to provide content in ways youve consented to and to improve our understanding of you.

Ex-detectives and former criminal QCs and profilers are in demand to appear at events looking at infamous murders and unsolved cases. And with ticket prices regularly ranging from £ to £, it seems that crime really does pay. At CrimeCon UK , audiences will meet a whole host of law enforcement experts from ex-DCI Colin Sutton – who helped snare serial killer Levi Bellfield – to former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal, who brought the Rochdale child sex gang to justice.Organisers say Netflix, BBC and ITV dramas recounting some of the UK’s most notorious crimes have fuelled a huge surge in public interest. And they believe the two-day event in London in June could shed fresh light on thousands of unsolved murders.  CrimeCon’s Nancy Baughen said: “There is a global rise in crime fascination. It’s driven by armchair sleuths, especially women, and propelled by the popularity of true crime programmes. “There is no other event in the UK that brings fans and followers of this genre closer to leading crime experts.” Forensic psychologist Kerry Daynes, ex-detective Mark Williams-Thomas and BBC Inside Justice’s Louise Shorter are among the names on the bill.

Shannon Turnbull, , noticed bizarre symptoms such as a tingling sensation and changes to her vision at the start of the year.But when the left side of her body went numb and she was rushed to AE, she was shocked to learn that she had the degenerative condition, Multiple Sclerosis .The mum of two had initially thought she was suffering from a trapped nerve, but after  hours in hospital was without almost allin her left leg.Speaking to EdinburghLive : Around three and a bit weeks now I started to develop what I could only describe as sensitivity on my skin on my back on the lower left side.  To touch it hurt, to even have my clothes on it would hurt, even the temperature affected this. I thought maybe I’d pulled a muscle, I’m sure it’ll sort itself out. As the days went on it got worse, it was rapidly spreading to my tummy. I still didn’t think much of it and was waiting for it to just disappear. I started to develop extreme numbness on the affected areas and as more days went by it was spreading down my leg. By Monday just gone, my lower left back, tummy and thigh were completely numb. I felt asI’d had an epidural! Sharon, who is a mum to her sons, Tommy and Louis, is now learning to walk again with theof just one leg. She said: I visited my doctor and got some blood tests and referred to a neurologist for an appointment in a couple of weeks. She said to contact themsymptoms got any worse. Tuesday morning I woke up and my leg was extremely weak, the numbness had covered my full leg and I wasn’t able to walk as well. The doctor sent me straight up to AE, where I underwent multiple MRI and brain scans. After spending  hours staying in hospital and almost complete loss of my left legI was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis. MS is a lelong condition that affects the brain and nervous system. It is caused by your immune system mistakenly attacking your brain and nerves. Multiple Sclerosis cannot be cured. The moment I was made aware of my diagnosis I knew instantly my le would be changed forever. Within days of her shock diagnosis, Shannon explained her le has already changed dramatically. The family has overhauled their routine and are even having to move to a new home specially adapted to her needs. As well as the physical aspects of the condition, Shannon must now mentally come to terms with her diagnosis, for which there is no cure. She said: Last Saturday I was running around in the soft play with my boys and this Saturday I canapost even walk. Why is le so unfair  The hardest thing to deal with has definitely been the loss of my left leg . Iaposve been walking since I was one and at the age of  Iaposm now having to reteach my leg how to walk again, which is very frustrating and tiring.

Jemma had previously lost a baby boy at  weeks in September  and had been worried history was repeating itself. The beauty salon owner and her partner, Paul Jordan, , a scaffolder, had been trying for a baby for five years, suffered two miscarriages, a stillbirth and had gone through two rounds of IVF to fall pregnant through a donor egg. Jemma, from Worcester, West Midlands, told Daily Star Sunday: I was on a walk with the dog and I just had this feeling I should go and see my consultant. I didnapost have any symptoms, but I just knew I should go in.  It was in my gut - I couldnapost ignore it. It was a motheraposs instinct. It was a cervical infection that meant I lost my previous baby, William. Thankfully, I could hold long enough to give this baby a good chance. He was so tiny when he was born. I got to hold him for just a moment before he was taken away. It was so up and down but he pulled through. Heaposs a fighter. We have such a strong bond. Heaposs such a happy little boy. Jemma was kept in Worcestershire Royal Hospital, Worcester, West Midlands, for two weeks until she went into labour at  weeks - she was then rushed to Birmingham Womenaposs Hospital, West Midlands, to give birth. The coupleaposs baby boy, who they named Axel, was born  weeks early on February , , weighing a tiny lb z.He battled sepsis, seizures, necrotising enderocolitis and had to learn to breathe independently until he was able to be discharged and head home on June , .Ever since meeting her partner Paul in February , the pair knew they wanted to have a baby together. After trying since  the couple were delighted to find out they were pregnant in May .  But they lost the baby at  weeks due to an infection in Jemmaaposs cervix. Losing William was awful, she said. I got to hold him in my arms and say goodbye. But after another miscarriage the couple turned to IVF in a bid to have a family together. They decided to go to Brno, Prague, Czech Republic, to try IVF with a donor egg as it cost them less. In September  they flew out and to the couples delight the treatment worked and they fell pregnant.The pregnancy was going smoothly but while on a walk with her dog Jemma had an inkling that she should go and see her doctor.It was lucky she did as they spotted her cervix was open and measuring mm. They asked me why I came in, she said. Was I in any pain  But I just said it was my instinct. Doctors managed to put a cervical stitch in and Jemma stayed on bed rest in Worcestershire Royal Hospital. At  weeks she was sent to Birmingham Womenaposs Hospital, ready for the imminent birth. Jemma managed to hold on until  weeks when she started experiencing contractions. She managed to have a natural birth and got to hold her son, Axel, before he was whisked away to NICU. Both Jemma and Axel battled sepsis after the birth and their baby boy had a seizure in his first week. After  days in hospital Axel came home with his parents on June , . I always worried that we wouldnapost bond but we did straight away, Jemma said. Now Axel is approaching his first birthday and is a happy little boy. Heaposs such a miracle, Jemma said.

Recently a friend of mine was slowly cycling up the long hill back to his home when a white van raced inches past him. The displaced air of the vehicle caused him to almost topple into the gutter and his heart to pound as he frantically corrected his balance. Understandably enraged, my friend yelled swear words at the rapidly disappearing back license plate as the motor raced up the hill. Suddenly the van came to a screeching halt and the glass and metal barrier that usually separates drivers and cyclists was broken. A man with a beetroot red face and fury in his eyes slammed his boots onto the tarmac, letting out a war cry as he raced towards my two-wheeled pal and flung a foot forwards. It connected with the back of the bike and smashed the rear light.  As little red pieces of plastic sprinkled onto the road below, the righteous driver explained in no-uncertain and spittle-flecked terms that my friend should have been in the bike lane, despite one not existing, and then he should f*** off. Depending on where you sit on the binary ide of drivers and cyclists, you will want this story to finish in one of two ways. Drivers will of course be hoping that the van man properly lands a follow up blow, causing my arrogantly peddling pal to tumble onto the ground to uproarious laughter from the assembled motorists.Cyclists will be hoping that the driver follows in the footsteps of the Reading Road Rage Warrior, whose momentous fall as he vainly chased after a fleeing Lycra-lad was filmed and viewed million times.Whether or not youaposre disappointed to find out that my friend managed to race off to safety, the encounter is one of many which makes clear there is some bad blood between dferent kinds of road users. For the car drivers, the fear of clipping a cyclist as they race through crawling traffic is a sincere and blood pressure raising one. The rage directed towards people peddling two-abreast is just as earnestly felt. For the bike rider, peddling beside a one-tonne hunk of metal on British roads that claimed  cyclistsapos lives and seriously injured , more in  is scary. Unfortunately for those who associate with the former camp, they are in the wrong. Britain used to be a beautul land of rolling green hills, pristine meadows teeming with le and country paths adorned by luscious hedgerows. Since production of the motorcar began in the early th century that beauty has been under constant attack, slowly chipped away in service of the car. Now huge motorways rip through the countryside. Car parks and business zones surround towns gutted of their once vibrant centres. Primary school children are choked by exhaust fumes. As a nation we made a grave mistake when we decided to build our society around personal transport pods rather than building on the early glory of our public transport infrastructure. We didnapost know then that tens of billions of pounds of roads built each decade would not be enough to cope with the staggering demand for motors. We didnapost know then of the catastrophic toll fossil fuels have on the environment. But because the driver feels safe in their metal castle - warm and separate from society and its problems - we bent our country to them. For decades cars and motorists have been the dominant forces on British highways. They are the fastest, the least vulnerable and by far the most plentul. Today the Government has gone some way to right that historic wrong. Changes to the Highway Code that come into force today give power back to the cyclist - a road user who requires a fraction of the tarmac of the driver, is all but emission free and a statistically lower burden on the NHS. The headline change is that cyclists should now ride in the centre of quiet roads, and keep at least . metres away from the kerb edge on busy tracks with fast moving vehicles. They can also ride two-abreast, so long as theyaposre considerate and let motors overtake when itaposs safe to do so, and pass slow or stationary cars either on the right or left. The upshot of this, and a new hierarchy of road users which puts pedestrians and cyclists up the top - as the least dangerous to others - and HGV drivers at the bottom, is greater protection for people on bikes, and more responsibility for those behind the wheel. Whether or not these changes calm the boiling tension between driver and cyclist in the long run, and enshrine what has long been known to be best practice legally, what is clear is that the cleated shoe is now on the other foot. Car drivers have been demoted to secondary citizens on the highways, and cyclists are now kings of the road. And so they should be.

The move at three HQs is yet another sign of the Duke of York being airbrushed from public le. It follows the decision to strip Andrew of his  forces titles as he battles a US sex abuse civil case. Andrew strongly denies wrongdoing. But after losing his roles, his social media pages were deleted and his section on the royal website edited. A senior defence chief said today: “This is yet more evidence of the duke’s fall from grace.” Sources say pictures and paintings of the duke dressed in military finery have been removed from the officers’ and sergeants’ messes of the Grenadier Guards, the Royal Irish Regiment, The Royal Highland Fusiliers and the Royal Lancers.  He is no longer toasted at regimental dinners and all links with units he once represented have been axed. Our source added: “The duke has been the master of his downfall. “His inability to accept ­sensible advice shows a real sense of detachment.” One member of the Royal Irish Regiment said: “There is enormous relief. His ­association had become an embarrassment.”  Some regiments have also signalled to Buckingham Palace that they want a say in which royal becomes the next colonel in chief. A source said: “This must be a once in a letime event.

We saw scores on phones, with some emailing, messaging and even watching TikTok videos.Footage was captured by our guide Mike van Erp, a road safety campaigner whose own father was killed by a drink-driver. Since , Mike has reported , drivers including Guy Ritchie and Chris Eubank. Offenders get a police warning letter and in some cases, prosecution, points and bans. I joined Mike – a carer and dad of two – on the afternoon school run in Hyde Park, London.  Mike, who has , followers online, tells us: “I cross the roads on foot, with my kids and a boy with Down’s syndrome I care for, and I notice how many drivers are fiddling on phones. I’m afraid for him and for my own kids.” Seventeen people died in crashes involving drivers distracted by phones in , latest figures show. Mike’s father Coen, , was killed in Harare, Zimbabwe. Dutchman Mike, who grew up there, says: “I rode out there and saw the wrecked car, a mangled heap of dirty metal, my dad’s body in a blanket.  “I am determined to help others not have to experience such a road death and I’ve realised, through many studies, mobile phone use is worse than drink driving, and that the effects of the heavy mental investment in a remote conversation are much stronger than many realise.”Inside a minute of me joining Mike, we see a BMW driver on the phone. Mike’s £ GoPro, attached to his head, catches her using WhatsApp and email.“I think that’s probably gold standard evidence, I’ll submit that one,” he says.  Soon, we catch a -something man on his phone in his Audi. “He was watching a TikTok video,” Mike says. Broadcaster Jeremy Vine cycles by and declares himself a “big fan” of Mike, telling us: “He’s making the world safer. I love this guy.” We see the driver of a Range Rover taking photos, another scrolling through a playlist and three sending messages. Drivers of expensive cars such as Range Rovers and Teslas are common offenders, Mike says. He regularly sees parents messaging while driving kids.  Celebrity offenders Mike identies get him in the news. Film director Ritchie, , was banned for six months after Mike caught him texting. Former boxer Eubank, , got three penalty points after Mike filmed him running a red light while texting. Mike has been attacked, trolled and even threatened with death by other drivers. But he says: “I had a tough upbringing, so physical danger doesn’t give me much fear.”- Follow Mike at Youtube c cyclingmikeyPhones totally banned We ventured out with Mike three days before new Highway Code rules banned drivers using a phone in any circumstance. The rules apply to drivers stuck in traffic and at red lights – and offenders could face six points on their licences and a £ fine. If a driver has passed their test in the two years before the offence, they will lose their licence. The shake-up prioritises cyclists and pedestrians, with motorists advised to use the Dutch Reach to open the vehicle’s door from inside. This means drivers using their furthest hand from the door to open it, as this forces the body to swivel around, helping to see a cyclist, pedestrian or another vehicle coming from behind.  It is also now acceptable for cyclists to ride in the centre of the road, in some situations. And they are not obliged to use the cycle lane. Drivers who are overtaking cyclists must leave at least . metres of space at up to mph, moredriving faster.

Almost , businesses have stopped trading or gone into administration after taking taxpayer-funded cash to help them in the pandemic.The staggering sum is on top of the £.billion extracted by fraudsters from the emergency Covid schemes like furlough and Eat Out To Help Out.The new details emerged after the minister for counter-fraud, Lord Agnew, resigned in anger at the Government’s inability to tackle scams. The Insolvency Service said it had identied , companies in England, Wales and Scotland that became insolvent between last May and October after getting a Bounce Back loan.  The bank loans, which were fully guaranteed by the Government, were intended to compensate firms for reduced trade during lockdowns. Bosses could apply for up to £, or % of annual turnover. Banks were ordered to ease the usual checks. Many borrowers self-certied financial status. The scheme provided £.billion in credit through . million loans. It is not clear how much the Government will recover. But as the banks will get the dud loans refunded by Government – in other words the taxpayer – it is likely other creditors will get priority.  A government source said the average loan was well below £, and the Bounce Back scheme had been a leline to over ,, firms. A spokesman added: “Businesses are expected to make every effort to repay loans. Most payments are being made as expected.” The Treasury – blasted by Lord Agnew as “having no knowledge or little interest” in fraud – has written off £.billion in Covid scams.

Sharon Kollmar, from Long Island, New York, claims she was desperate to extend her family and have a baby with her fiance, Gus, , who is already a granddad. Sharon, , already has an -year-old son, Aiden, from a previous relationship, but always wanted more kids.After almost a decade of being single, she had started to look into sperm donors. But while explaining her quest to lelong friend and now fiancé, Gus, he suggested that the pair should strike up a relationship and try for a baby together. They ended up having to spend £,on an egg donor and IVF - they welcomed their daughter, Bayleigh Emerson, in September . Sharon said: I so desperately wanted more kids. People thought I was crazy for wanting to start all over again. Iaposd been to see fertility doctors who were dismissive because of my age and told me that although I still had eggs, the chances of me falling pregnant were slim. I was also still single. I was talking to my male friend about everything and out of the blue he said aposwhat about me apos Iaposd never even thought about it before but it seemed like a great idea. He had always been in my and my sonaposs le. So we started dating, and because I was around  and he was , we started trying to conceive straight away. We were trying for two years and hadnapost fallen pregnant, so we looked into donor embryos but the cut off age was . So we turned to donor eggs and found someone who matched my colourings and had fresh eggs, rather than frozen. The process cost us , and I went through rigorous physical testing and preparation. In January , when Sharon was , she underwent the embryo transfer which was successful on the first attempt. When she finally received the doctoraposs call confirming she was pregnant, she says it was the moment she had been waiting for for over a decade. Sharon and Gus, who is already a dad to his -year-old daughter and grandfather to her three children, welcomed their new addition on September , .Sharon added: My pregnancy was pretty textbook, although the baby was bigger this time around so I felt it a little more.But I love being pregnant. People couldnapost understand why we would want another baby at the age of  and . My friendsapos kids were graduating college and getting married. Some of my friends were even grandparents. Gus is even a grandfather and his daughter is . His grandkids are ,  and . So people had a hard time getting their head around it, but it meant the world to us. Sharon gave birth via C-section as there was meconium in her fluids and baby Bayleigh had flipped over out of the ideal delivery position. Sharon claims doctors also incorrectly predicted she would weigh lbs but she was born at a healthy lbs z. She said: Holding her in my arms was incredible. I love having a newborn. It is just as rewarding and satisfying as the first time. I think people thought I would regret it, but I would not change it for the world. When we brought her home and I placed her in my sonaposs arms, his eyes filled with tears and he told her that he had been waiting for her his entire le. It was so special.

Sharon added: I want to give hope to people who thought their chance at parenthood was over. You need to have faith and live your own le, and not what your family and friends expect you to do. Just because you are a bit older, it doesnapost mean the door is shut.  People said was that it wasnapost fair to bring a child into the world at our age because we likely wouldnapost be alive to see them into adulthood or that weaposd be an embarrassment as old parents. But itaposs better to be born to old parents than not at all, and there is no guarantee that a -year-old that has a baby will see that child into adulthood as illnesses and accidents happen all the time. I always knew that I was going to have more children, even though I wasnapost sure how but I just knew that somehow it would all piece together and it has. I couldnapost be happier.

But thanks to a tip from a driving school TikTok account named Driving Test Success @drivingtestsuccess, we no longer need to suffer in the freezing cold before we head to work, as it turns out you can actually get rid of the ice from inside your car as itaposs warming up. Experts at Driving Test Success say you can clear ice cover by simply activating your car windscreen fan, which will heat up the glass from the inside and help to melt the frost, the Express reports. In the companyaposs video, they explained: “Frozen windscreen  Put the temperature on high.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. “Put the front windscreen fan on max. The ice will start to melt from the heat. Wipe away excess water andthe fan to normal. While the tip might seem obvious to some seasoned drivers, several commenters on the video who were new to driving couldnapost believe theyaposd never seen the hack before. One commenter said: Wow, magic! The ice is gone. And another praised the account for all their help, as they wrote: Iaposve learnt so much thanks to your app!  But others were less impressed, as one TikTok user shunned the idea, stating: Wastes more fuel. Just get [out] and scrape it off you lazy so and so.” Driving Test Success is far from the first account to point out the easy de-icing trick either, as another video online from Clear View Driving said road users should use their demister before they start driving. They said: “Now donapost use your windscreen wipers or washers as that wonapost help. Turn on your front and rear demister. “The rear demister also heats up your side mirrors in most new cars. Butthe mirrors are not clear, make sure to clear them before you start driving. “Then, once itaposs done you can use your wipers.” And in the cold winter months, the AA has also encouraged road users to “turn on the warm air blower” and “heated mirrors” to clear frost cover quickly and safely.They explained: “Start the engine and turn on the warm air blower on the windscreen. Switch on the rear windscreen heater and heated mirrors,you have them. Turn on the air-con. Itaposs not just for summer – itaposll remove moisture from the air to stop the car from misting up. “Don’t use your hands to wipe misted-up windows – youaposll leave greasy smears and a diamond ring could scratch the glass. Use a lint-free absorbent clothnecessary. “Stay with your car the whole time while the engineaposs running.” What do you think is the best way to de-ice your car  Let us know in the comments below.

He previously ate a plant-based diet but claimed to suffer from health issues because of it. So instead, heaposs been training his stomach to digest nothing but uncooked meat, including organs and he washes it down with raw animal milk and raw eggs. He claims his favourite meals include chicken breast, steak and swordfish and so far heaposs managed to avoid severe food poisoning. But worryingly he is risking contracting E. coli, salmonella and Shigella.Getthe newsyou want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here.He also faces further health issueshe fails to eat fruit and vegetables, including constipation, haemorrhoids and even scurvy.Posting stomach-churning photos of himself biting into raw flesh, the man has amassed a following online as they wait to see the effects of his bizarre diet. His Instagram page @therawmeatexperiment has .k followers, and the bio explains: Eating raw meat at Whole Foods every day until I die from bacteria SeeingI Live for  days or  years.  His aposcavemanapos diet has also seen him tuck into cow liver and camel milk and tearing into a steak with his teeth. No chewing involved, you can basically just place the cow flesh in your mouth and swallow it, he explained. Pretty tasty, half the cost of a steak, will probably be a weekly meal along with cod. Asked by a follower how he was feeling, he confirmed: Good, I like it so far and feel no reason to stop, no crazy changes either way though. On his th day, he revealed he was able to eat lb of mince in just five minutes - one of his favourites.  A brick of shredded cow and milk of the sheep. Ground beef has become my favourite meal, he said. Due to the low cost, ease of consuming a pound in like  minutes, gathering  calories of absorbable cow and digesting perfectly. He admitted cooked meat tastes a bit better though the raw stuff was growing on him. On day  he ate raw bacon, which one of his followers said looked like a skinned foot. For those concerned about how limited his diet is, he has explained he does occasionally eat potatoes, rice and cooked chicken. And heaposs claimed his pain has gone away since embarking on his new carnivorous diet. When I started eating steak and eggs for breakfast, instead of bagels and smoothies, I felt full for most of the day, and stable, instead of getting dizzy from a carb crash, my pain started to go away, he insisted.

One man who made sure he would stand out from the crowd was Jonathan Swt, who saw an opening for a position within the marketing department of Yorkshire-based printing specialists, Instantprint and decided to get creative with his application. The -year-old made his mark by recycling the companyaposs own flyers in a genius marketing stunt in the company car park - as he placed a flyer advertising his LinkedIn profile on every single car.  Get the news you want straight to your inbox.for a Mirror newsletter here. Marketing Manager Craig Wassell, who was doing the hiring for the position, noticed Jonathanaposs antics on CCTV when he was advised by security to take a closer look at what was going on. And he was so impressed that he decided to invite the man in for an interview. He said: When I looked out of the office window, I could already see that someone had been around leaving flyers on all the car windscreens, and upon closer inspection, it became apparent that the flyers more closely were, in fact, an application for the role I was hiring for. Naturally, we immediately invited Jonathan in for an interview. Craig also shared footage from the CCTV cameras, as well as a picture of the cars, on Twitter - where he admitted Jonathan has become the talk of the office thanks to his stunt. He wrote: We’ve been well and truly ‘flyered’ by a candidate applying for a #job in our marketing team. Every car in the car park is covered in flyers linking to the applicant’s LinkedIn profile! That’s definitely one way to stand out. He’s been the talk of the office since covering everyoneaposs cars in CVs. I love it when we get a #creativejobapplication. Instantprint received over  applications for the position, but thanks to Jonathanaposs stroke of creative genius, he became the lucky candidate to be offered the role and started his new job earlier this month. Craig added: “Jonathan’s application did more than grab my attention. It showed that he’d researched the brand and that he had the right attitude, creativity and sense of humour to fit the team perfectly.

He said: “I remembered seeing Instantprint in the news a while back because a candidate had successfully applied for a design role by having her photograph printed on one of the company’s own roller banners, and thought ‘what a great idea!’ “I wanted my application to make a statement just like that one had and what better way than distributing  flyers with my face on around the company car park ” Have you got a story to share  We want to hear all about it.

However, I know this person doesnapost ask, as they brought their older sibling to my childaposs party a few weeks ago and didnapost ask.I had made packed lunches, so I didnapost have extra boxes. In fact, they didnapost even say when arriving. The very rude child then demanded lunch and a party bag, the mum was oblivious and today was style same. She continued: Today this sibling who is at least  years older than the birthday child took prizes when not enough for the actual friends of the birthday girl. AIBU, or should I and all parties over cater for everyone to bring siblings  A debate ensued in the comment section as other parents flocked to give their opinions.  One wrote: Extremely rude behaviour. Whoever is hosting should say they canapost stay at that start, wrote another. A third added: I hate this new thing of siblings coming to parties. It p****s me right off. Yes, I understand they might have to be there to drop off and the parent not able to stay for the party but that is preferable that an uninvited guest just coming. Parents wouldnapost do it at any other invite so donapost do it at a kids party. If we wanted siblings there we would state it on the invite. If not donapost go or say you will have to drop and go as you have no childcare for sibling. Donapost just invite whoever you want to someone aposs party. A fourth demanded: Why wouldn’t you just say something to the mum  More fool the people who just allow it. Another penned: I’ve had this too, I ran out of party bags for DC’s friends because of unexpected siblings taking them. Lesson learnt and they are kept hidden until going home time. People still bring siblings without asking. It’s annoying, especially when the activity isn’t suitable for their ages. I now put on the invite a message about no siblings.

The mortician gave a full confession when quizzed by copsMadeleine McCann disappeared in Praia da Luz, Portugal on May ,  Image: METROPOLITAN POLICE AFP via GettByJon ClarkePatrick HillNews Reporter:,  Jan Updated:,  Jan The prime suspect in the Madeleine McCann case swapped child abuse images and depraved online messages with an undertaker. The mortician gave “a full confession” when quizzed by German police and admitted he was a “regular customer” of convicted paedophile Christian Brueckner. It is understood material he handed over to officers now forms part of evidence being used against Brueckner. The undertaker, also a convicted sex offender, cannot be named for legal reasons – but he has spoken to the makers of a new documentary about the case, being shown tomorrow night on German TV channel Sat.. The film’s lead investigator Jutta Rabe told the Sunday People: “I’m not sure what he paid but he confirmed they regularly swapped material, all of which he has handed over to detectives.  “We haven’t been able to confirmthey were business partners but he insisted he... has completely mended his ways.” The undertaker, who lives alone, said he was interviewed by the BKA – Germany’s FBI. Miss Rabe said: “He was given a choice, ‘You either admit it and help us then go into therapy or go to prison’. He chose co-operation.” She added: “He is terried of being attacked and horried of his family finding out.” Madeleine, three, vanished from an Algarve apartment in  while on holiday with her twin siblings and parents Kate and Gerry, of Rothley, Leics. In , Brueckner shared a string of sick messages with the undertaker, including some about snatching and imprisoning a toddler. Brueckner talks about making films to “document exactly how she is tormented”. The horrying Skype conversation was found when Brueckner was arrested for molesting his girlfriend’s daughter. He is now behind bars for offences including the  rape of a US widow in Praia da Luz – where Madeleine vanished two years later. German prosecutors say they have “concrete” evidence against him – and he is their only suspect in Madeleine’s case. But they also fear Breuckner has committed at least five other sex crimes, including the rape of an Irish woman, who was attacked in her Portuguese apartment in . The film reveals German police made a huge breakthrough when they unearthed a “partial fingerprint” of Breuckner’s which was found in the Irish victim’s flat. In the documentary, German prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters says he expects Brueckner to be charged with some of the crimes “imminently”.

It’s the nuclear-armed countryaposs seventh test this month which is a record for the state. The Japanese government said North Korea had launched a possible ballistic missile, while South Koreaaposs Joint Chiefs of Staff reported the launch of an unidentied projectile. The ballistic missile launch and the ones before it are a threat to our country, the region and the international community, Japanese government spokesperson Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirokazu Matsuno told a televised briefing.  This series of launches violate UN resolutions and we strongly protest this action by North Korea. Matsuno said thatthe projectile was a standard ballistic missile it is estimated to have reached an altitude of ,km, flown for  minutes, to a distance of km. It makes January the busiest ever for North Koreaaposs missile programme. Analysts say the country’s weapon tests are increasing and developing new capabilities despite strict sanctions and United Nations Security Council resolutions that ban the countryaposs ballistic missile tests. In an address ahead of the New Year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un called for bolstering the military with cutting edge technology at a time when talks with South Korea and the United States have stalled.  Since then, North Korea has conducted a series of launches displaying a dizzying array of weapon types, launch locations, and increasing sophistication. From hypersonic missiles and long-range cruise missiles to missiles launched from railcars and airports, the tests highlight the nuclear-armed stateaposs rapidly expanding and advancing arsenal amid stalled denuclearisation talks. North Korea has not tested its longest-range intercontinental ballistic missiles or nuclear weapons since , but the countryaposs rulers suggested this month they could restart those activities.  Its latest launches included a test of two short-range ballistic missiles and their warheads on Thursday, and an update to a long-range cruise missile system was tested on Tuesday. The tests appear aimed at bolstering national pride ahead of several major North Korean holidays and sending a message of strength, said Le-Eric Easley, a professor of international studies at Ewha University in Seoul.The Kim regime hears external discussions of its domestic weaknesses and sees South Koreaaposs growing strength, he said.So it wants to remind Washington and Seoul that trying to topple it would be too costly. Pyongyang has defended the launches as its sovereign right of self defence. It says they are not directed at any specic country, but accused Washington and Seoul of having hostile policies”. Kim visited a munitions factory last week, where he called for an all-out drive to produce powerful cutting-edge arms”. He touted his devotion to smashing ... the challenges of the US imperialists and their vassal forces seeking to violate their right to self-defence, calling it the harshest-ever adversity”.

It was a really good first taste of men’s football which was physical and tough, and I improved because of that.\"I played up front with Stuart Noble and learned a lot from him and others in the team, including not to wear pink boots. We had a good dressing room and I still keep in touch with some of the players and keep an eye on the scores.“I’d play for Gala on the Saturday and then play for the Hibs reserves in midweek, so I got plenty of game time.

The trial has so far been testing two active drugs and more drugs will be added, in due course, while medicines that prove ineffective will be dropped.Dr Suvankar Pal, Euan MacDonald Centre for MND Research, University of Edinburgh and Co-lead Investigator of MND-SMART, said, “Historically, you would have a two-armed trial that looks at one active drug against a placebo [dummy drug], but this trial design allows us to test many, many more active drugs simultaneously and therefore get a definitive answer [phase ] more quickly, which is a much more efficient way of doing things.”Doddie’s Foundation has a clear vision of a world free of motor neuron disease and was founded in response to his frustration at the lack of options given to MND patients – no effective treatment, no access to meaningful clinical trials and no hope.The aims of the Foundation are to raise funds to aid research into the causes of MND and investigate potential cures and to make grants to iniduals suffering from MND, to enable them to live as fulfilled a le as possible.Olivia Bird, Research and Grants Officer at My Name’ Doddie Foundation, said, “We are delighted to continue our involvement in this landmark trial in MND and it is brilliant to see what progress has been made, despite the challenges of working around a pandemic.“We are incredibly grateful to the trial teams across the UK who have shown commitment and enthusiasm to get the trial up and running, and to our supporters who have gone to extraordinary s to raise much needed funds.”.removeA £, grant was also awarded to Newcastle NHS Foundation Trust to facilitate recruitment of patients in the northeast of England."},{"url":null,"title":"highway-code-changes-make-roads-safer-says-cycling-scotland","story":"CHANGES to the Highway Code have been welcomed by Cycling Scotland, the nation’s cycling organisation.The changes come into effect today and will impact all road users but will have the overall goal of making roads safer for people on foot, bikes and horses.Around , people took part in a consultation, with the UK government saying that most people who responded were in favour of the proposed changes.The change in rules will see users who are most at risk moved to the top of the hierarchy and enforces the idea that motorists need to be more aware of cyclists, and cyclists need to be more aware of pedestrians.Among the many changes, cyclists are advised to ride in the centre of a lane on quieter roads, in slower-moving traffic, and when approaching junctions to make themselves as visible as possible.They can ride two abreast, as is already the case but must allow drivers behind them to overtakeit is safe to do so.Other key amendments include clearer guidance for drivers to leave a distance of at least . metres when overtaking cyclists, and there will also be a recommendation for car occupants to open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder behind them.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opening into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Drivers and motorcyclists should now give priority to cyclists on roundabouts. The guidance will say they should not attempt to overtake people cycling within that person’s lane and should allow people cycling to move across their path as they travel around the roundabout.Cyclists will still be able to remain in the left-hand lane when going across or around a roundabout. The new guidance is due that will tell motorists to pay extra attention to this, taking care not to cut off cyclists doing this.Christopher Johnson, Head of Education and Training, Cycling Scotland said: “We welcome the updates to the Highway Code as one of many actions needed to prevent people being seriously injured and killed on our roads in Scotland..remove“The new hierarchy of road users underpins the changes - those who can cause the greatest harm have the greatest responsibility to reduce the risk to others: people driving will be responsible for ensuring people cycling, walking and wheeling are safe, while people cycling will be responsible for looking out for those walking and wheeling.“Many of the changes to the Highway Code are not new but are clarying or explaining existing rules. We encourage everyone to read the new guidance and follow it, whether you’re walking or wheeling, riding a bike or horse or driving a vehicle.“While good progress has been on road safety overall in the last decade, sadly still too many people are killed or seriously injured while walking or cycling”All road users are urged to study the new rules."},{"url":null,"title":"borders-mps-david-mundell-john-lamont-expenses-revealed","story":"THE two Borders MPs cost the taxpayer around £, last year, new figures reveal.Data on business and staffing costs for the financial year   has been published by the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority .And the figures show that Tweeddale representative David Mundell was the fourth most expensive MP in the UK, claiming £,. – up from £,. last year.Mr Mundell, of the Conservatives, spent around £, on staff wages, approximately £, on rent, and around £, on advertising and contact cards, according to the data.Meanwhile, he paid out more than £, on air travel, around £, on stationery and printing, and approximately £, on a working from home allowance.:Fears that new supermarket would hurt Galashiels laughable, says councillorIn response to the figures, Mr Mundell said: “The constituency I represent is one of the largest and most erse in the whole United Kingdom, stretching from the Scottish border to the Pentland Hills south of Edinburgh, and covering three separate council areas and three separate NHS health boards.“I try at all times to provide the best possible service to my constituents across the more than  inidual communities which make up my constituency and this necessarily involves a level of expenditure that other MPs, representing smaller, less complex constituencies, are not required to incur.”The Dumfriesshire, Clydesdale and Tweeddale MP added: “COVID has made this all the more challenging, including expenditure on local newspaper advertising to help ensure constituents and businesses who have queries about how COVID regulations impact them, or how grants or other forms of support can be accessed, had my office contact details easily to hand.”:Police tasked to target inappropriate and dangerous parking in Borders townAccording to the IPSA data, the average cost of an MP in the UK was £,..removeThe figures show that fellow Westminster representative for the region John Lamont claimed £,. in  .Mr Lamont’s largest type of cost was around £, on staff wages, followed by £, on rent and £, on bought-in services.Meanwhile, the Conservative MP for Berwickshire, Roxburgh and Selkirk spent approximately £, on advertising and contact cards, just under £, on air travel and around £, on a working from home allowance.Mr Lamont’s costs were up on the £,. recorded the year before.:Police appeal for information following reports of graffiti in SelkirkOn the data, he said: “During the last year, we have seen an unprecedented  per cent increase in the number of enquiries and requests for help from local residents.

They’ve got to get money back into people’s pockets.“Right across this country, town centres are not thriving, high streets are falling apart because not only have we seen good wages, good jobs, depart from many parts of the country over recent decades, it’s been turbo-charged in the last  years and right now energy bills are going up, shopping prices are sky high and people are about to face a tax hike.”Ms Nandy branded the plans “regeneration on the cheap”.She told Times Radio: “King’s Cross-style regeneration they’re calling it, but King’s Cross cost £ billion to redevelop, the Government’s stake in it alone was worth more than three times as much as the money that has been allocated to a few parts of the country this morning..remove“Essentially what they’re saying is you can do regeneration on the cheap while welarge sums of your money into one very small corner of the country.“That’s not just missing the point actually, that’s downright insulting to people who have a contribution to make, who have huge ambition for their communities, but are watching their town centres fall apart and their young people have to get out in order to get on.”The work will be spearheaded by the Government’s housing agency Homes England, which will be “refocused” to deliver on the levelling-up agenda.The DHLUC said the areas will benefit from developments combining “housing, leisure, and business in sustainable, walkable, beautul new neighbourhoods”.At the last Budget in October , Mr Sunak announced an extra £. billion to bring , hectares of brownfield land into use.The DLUHC said the newly-available £. billion Brownfield Fund will form part of this allowance.Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said earlier: “This huge investment in infrastructure and regeneration will spread opportunity more evenly and help to reverse the geographical inequalities which still exist in the UK.”A separate £. billion Levelling Up Home Building Fund will also be launched next week.It will provide loans to small and medium-sized builders and developers to deliver , homes, with the vast majority going outside London and the South East.The DHLUC said the cash for this fund was first announced in .Meanwhile, the department has announced seven Mayoral Combined Authoritieswhich are set to benefit from £ million of funding “to transform derelict brownfield sites into vibrant places where people want to live and work”.The seven MCAs – West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Liverpool, South Yorkshire, North of Tyne, and Tees Valley – stand to gain , homes, the DHLUC said.The department added that, as with the £. billion Brownfield Fund, this £ million pot formed part of the £. billion sum pledged by Mr Sunak last year..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Regeneration  ulevelling up u funding is  uvery small beer u  u Labour"},{"url":null,"title":"newcastle-agree-fee-brighton-sign-defender-dan-burn","story":"Newcastle have agreed a fee with Brighton for defender Dan Burn, the PA news agency understands.Completion of the deal ahead of Monday’s transfer deadline would see Burn join full-back Kieran Trippier and striker Chris Wood as new additions to the Magpies’ squad made in the current window.The fee agreed for Burn is believed to be in the region of £million.The -year-old, who spent time in Newcastle’s academy as a youngster, has been with Brighton since joining from Wigan in the summer of .He was immediately loaned back to the Latics before making his Seagulls debut in January  in the FA Cup.Burn has gone on to make  Premier League appearances for Brighton to date.Lyon midfielder Bruno Guimaraes is among the other players Newcastle have been linked with as they look to boost their bid for top-flight survival in their first transfer window under Amanda Staveley’s largely Saudi-backed consortium.Eddie Howe’s team are currently th in the table, a point adrt of th-placed Norwich with a game in hand..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Newcastle agree fee with Brighton to sign defender Dan Burn"},{"url":null,"title":"lidl-b-q-rare-plants-worth-thousands-sold-stores","story":"SHOPPERS at Lidl and BQ are being urged to check for rare plants in those shops that could be worth thousands of pounds.Supermarkets and DIY chains can sometimes stock naturally occurring iations of common house plants, of which some can be quite valuable.There are even cases of iations being mistaken for disease and then being listed for a reduced price as a result, according to MyLondon.Some of these plants are sold at prices of around £ but can sell for a far higher price online, for even just a small part of it like a left or stem.There is no guarantee that your local Lidl or BQ will be stocking a rare house plant, but heres what to look out for.What rare plants are being sold in Lidl and BQ Variegated Monstera DeliciosaIcon of the houseplant world - Monstera deliciosa or Swiss Cheese Plant.

honour the traditional Scots dish with a rendition of one of Robert Burns’ most famous and oft-performed poems: Address To a Haggis.Usually recited by the dinners host, the tongue-in-cheek address has been a long-established focal point of the Burns Supper, a night which celebrates the birth date of the literary legend himself: January , .After the haggis is piped to the table , Burns’ words are recited over the dish as it is cut open and served to the guests.Some say it is wise to cut a small incision in the side of the haggis before it is properly \"cut open\" on the table - tales of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.What is the history of an Address to a Haggis The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , ..removeA quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Address to a Haggis by Robert Burns, in FullFair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labourdight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"First Minister Nicola Sturgeonhas given give her weekly Covid update in parliament today.The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iantwere removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should

This intervention is much required and I truly believe he wants to help the patients at Riverside access the healthcare they require.“I have expressed my frustrations that meeting after meeting has taken place, yet no solution has been proposed to this long-term issue: a frustration the Cabinet Secretary shared with myself and my constituents.“I remain concerned with the access issues at Riverside.

We also continue to work hard on ious other initiatives to allow us to match capacity to patient demand as far as we possibly can.“We work together with our colleagues in the CWIC [Care When It Counts] team to see as many patients as we can each day.“However, we and ELHSCP – which runs the CWIC service – have both noted that we believe each of our teams are already working at capacity, in terms of the volume of healthcare they are able to deliver.“We have consistently offered access to our data and remain eager to work with all relevant parties to try and bring about a solution for our patients.”An ELHSCP spokesperson said: “Riverside Medical Practice, East Lothian Health  Social Care Partnership and NHS Lothian the Primary Care Contracts Organisationand Lothian LMCmet on December .

of guests being scalded by flying contents during enthusiastic recitals have been told.Others say this is part of the fun.The address was composed in the year  - not long after the poet arrived in Scotland’s capital city. There are two stories linked to the poem’s inception - one more romantic than the other.The first version alleges he’d been invited for dinner at the house of a merchant friend, Andrew Bruce, and composed the poem to amuse the wealthy host and his guests.The second, and slightly more charming version, is that he composed the poem off-the-cuff whilst visiting the house of his cabinetmaker friend, John Morrison, in a fit of inspiration brought on by the sight of the luxurious meat pudding.In the th century, haggis would not be a meal enjoyed very often – reserved as an item of extravagance and occasion. Based on Burns’ political persuasion, it’s been speculated that his tribute was ironic in its praise – poking fun at the upper classes who might revere it as an item of luxury.Though the true origin of the poem is debated, it was one of Burns’ first poems to be published in the Edinburgh periodical, The Caledonian Mercury, on December , .A quick video search for an “Address to the Haggis” brings up hundreds of results, ranging from a “Haggis Address for Kids”, recitals at kitchen tables and in dingy restaurants - to a piper in full dress, piping the dish into the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh.  High-society lestyle magazine Tatler recently published an article titled “Where to head for the finest Burns Night supper in London” - it’s clear that the Address to the Haggis can and should be performed in places both high and low. As thousands of Addresses to the Haggis continue to be made the world over, it’s inevitable that each one will have a character of its own - something the Bard himself would surely have approved of. Fair fa your honest, sonsie face, Great chieftain o the pudding-race! Aboon them a ye tak your place, Painch, tripe, or thairm : Weel are ye wordy oa grace As langs my arm. The groaning trencher there ye fill, Your hurdies like a distant hill, Your pin wad help to mend a mill In time oneed, While thro your pores the dews distil Like amber bead. His kne see rustic Labour dight, An cut you up wi ready sleight, Trenching your gushing entrails bright, Like ony ditch And then, O what a glorious sight, Warm-reekin, rich! Then, horn for horn, they stretch an strive: Deil tak the hindmost! on they drive, Till a their weel-swalld kytes belyve Are bent like drums Then auld Guidman, maist like to rive, Bethankit! hums. Is there that owre his French ragout Or olio that wad staw a sow, Or fricassee wad make her spew Wi perfect sconner, Looks down wi sneering, scornfu view On sic a dinner  Poor devil! see him owre his trash, As feckless as witherd rash, His spindle shank, a guid whip-lash His nieve a nit Thro bloody flood or field to dash, O how unfit! But mark the Rustic, haggis-fed, The trembling earth resounds his tread. Clap in his walie nieve a blade, Hell mak it whissle An legs an arms, an heads will sned, Like taps o thrissle. Ye Powrs, wha mak mankind your care, And dish them out their bill o fare, Auld Scotland wants nae skinking ware That jaups in luggies But,ye wish her gratefu prayer Gie her a haggis! "},{"url":null,"title":"covid-scotland-nicola-sturgeon-say-today-face-masks-working-home","story":"The final restrictions that were put in place in response to the Omicron iant were removed on Monday, January .In an update last week the First Minister announced that nightclubs would be able to reopen, and caps on indoor events and table service requirements where alcohol is served would be removed.These measures were put in place in December, alongside a maximum capacity of  people for outdoor events.

adult taking part in organised activities when they are directly interacting with children under the age of five.”Scotlands international travel rules have been brought in line with the rest of the

form.Unvaccinated travellers will need to take a pre-departure test two days before travelling and two days after they arrive back in Scotland. Currently, the international \" fully vaccinated\" definition includes two doses of the Covid vaccine and not the booster dose. However, this is being kept under review. Ms Sturgeon warned that travel restrictions could be reintroduced in light of a new iant so this is constantly being monitored. Ms Sturgeon has been facing renewed calls to remove the requirement for mask-wearing in Scottish schools.Masks are no longer needed in English secondary schools with the requirement being dropped from Thursday  January.Face coverings will no longer need to be worn by adults who are leading activities in childcare and early learning settings with children under  years old. Mask wearing restrictions will be changing in schools due to the increase in cases for this age group but the advice will be kept under \"close and regular review\".The First Minister was expected to outline a strategic framework or  roadmap to move the country to a “less restrictive” society.Ms Strugeon has confirmed that a full outline will be available in the coming weeks. Nicola Sturgeon has encouraged Scots to take note of the Scottish Government’s Distance Aware scheme.The First Minister said badges and lanyards with the Distance Aware logo, indicating the wearer would like extra space, would be available to anyone who wants one.She said: “Soyou or anyone you know is worried about being out and about and would feel safer with a bit more space, please get a Distance Aware badge.“And for everyone ,you see someone wearing the badge or lanyard, give them the space and consideration that they are asking for.”Nicola Sturgeon also updated the Scottish parliament over the latest Covid cases. While the First Minister said that cases remain high, we are starting to see a \"broadly positive picture\"., new cases of COVID- reported have been reported as well as  new reported deaths of people who have tested positiveThere were  people in intensive care on Monday, January  with recently confirmed COVID- and , people were in hospital yesterday with recently confirmed COVID-.Ms Sturgeon also noted that cases among under  years old are on the rise which is why the mask wearing in schools restriction has not been removed.The First

cautious."},{"url":null,"title":"new-highway-code-2022-test-new-rules-starting-today","story":"Major changes to the Highway Code requiring drivers to have more responsibility to look out for cyclists and pedestrians risk failing to boost safety due to not being widely promoted, campaigners have warned.Charity Cycling UK said that a “long-term and well-funded communications campaign” is needed to make people aware of the update.The Highway Code, which contains advice and rules for people on Britain’s roads, is being amended this weekend to introduce a risk-based hierarchy of road users.Here’s everything you need to know about what’s new as the rules of the roads receive an update.Hierarchy of road usersA new hierarchy means people in charge of vehicles that can cause the most harm in the event of a collision have the greatest responsibility to look out for other road users.Walking, cycling or riding in shared spacesCyclists should not overtake people walking or riding a horse in shared spaces closely or at high speed, while pedestrians should take care not to obstruct paths.Positioning of cyclistsCyclists should make themselves as visible as possible by riding in the centre of lanes on quiet roads, in slower-moving traffic and at the approach to junctions.Pedestrians crossing at junctionsTurning traffic should give way when people are crossing or waiting to cross at junctions.Traffic must give way to people on zebra crossings.Overtaking cyclistsDrivers travelling at speeds of up to mph should leave at least . metres when overtaking cyclists.They should give more space when overtaking at higher speeds.Opening car doorsCar occupants should open doors using their hand on the opposite side to the door, making them turn their head to look over their shoulder.This technique, known as the Dutch Reach, reduces the chances of doors being opened into the path of cyclists and motorcyclists.Overtaking cyclists at junctionsWhen cyclists are going straight ahead at a junction, they have priority over traffic waiting to turn into or out of a side road, unless road signs or markings indicate otherwise.Cycling in groupsPeople cycling can ride two abreast but should be considerate of the needs of other road users when in groups.RoundaboutsDrivers should take extra care when entering roundabouts to make sure they do not cut across cyclists.Electric vehicle chargingElectric car owners using a public chargepoint should park near the device and avoid creating a trip hazard from trailing

When filming the promo for Ultravox’s single Vienna, released in January , the song’s singer and co-writer Midge Ure visited the city’s Zentrafriedhof cemetery.He paid homage to the venerated piano manufacturer Carl Schweighofer whose grave features in the video and on the cover of the single’s record sleeve. The vast graveyard contains the final remains of Beethoven, Mozart and, perhaps less revered, Falco who scored international pop hits with the likes of Rock Me Amadeus and Vienna Calling.After arriving at Vienna International Airport, the City Airport Train takes  minutes to transport you to the centre, where I find Café Korb, a traditional coffee house with a Warholian pop art twist.Owned by model Susanne Widl her glamorous presence is everywhere in ious stills that feature on every wall. Once known as The Face, she also enjoyed a storied career as a film and TV actress working with the likes of Burt Lancaster, Sydney Pollack and Columbo star Peter Falk.I order a small Viennese breakfast consisting of coffee and two small rolls with butter and jam. The elderly gentleman at the next table orders a Maria Theresia coffee a double espresso with Cointreau  whipped cream. Other popular iations feature rum or brandy.Patrons enjoy the traditions of the establishment that opened in  and its family roots Widl inherited the cafe when her mother died in  and has run it since. Patrons have included Sigmund Freud, Andy Warhol and Arthur Miller. Even the toilet has a reputation of its own: it’s like walking on the set of Stanley Kubrick’s Clockwork Orange – blending s Art Nouveau with colourful futurism. No doubt the film’s main character Alex, played by Malcolm McDowell, would have found it “real horrorshow”.As he would The Beethoven Frieze, a painting by Gustav Klimt in the Secession Building which pays tribute to the composer’s th symphony. Vienna’s Ludwig van Beethoven walk takes in the Austrian Academy of Sciences where his th Symphony was premiered in December . The House of Music also features a large city map pinpointing Beethoven’s many abodes around the city.Café Korb is close to another Viennese icon St Stephen’s Cathedral. The gothic tower dominates the skyline and is immediately identiable as the city’s main symbol.I decided not to climb the  steps to see the lauded view from the tower room as there was enough to see at ground level with priceless treasures and masterpieces that include the marble fronted St Catherine’s chapel and th century sandstone pulpit with snakes, lizards and frogs all crawling their way up the bannister. Elsewhere gargoyles defend against demons, while saints and martyrs grace the columns which support this massive structure.During World War Two the cathedral was heavily damaged but gradually rebuilt after the war. After leaving the cathedral, I walked the short distance to Judenplatz where I found Rachel Whitehead’s large box-shaped stone monument dedicated to the , Jews murdered by the Nazis. The stone structure, described as an “introverted, non accessible library”, is couched on a plinth displaying the names of the concentration camps where victims perished. Each book represents the le that was lost in this once Jewish ghetto, the doors firmly closed with no way out.The Jewish Museum doesn’t shy away from dficult subjects such as Austria’s initial reluctance to admit its part in the Holocaust and its complicity in sending many, including musicians who played in the Vienna Philharmonic, to their deaths.Scientists and thinkers such as Sigmund Freud were also forced to flee to survive.From here I walk to the Hofburg Palace. I was happy to admire its splendour up close but decided not to enter as I was informed I would need to spend at least half a day here.Walking back to my hotel, I noticed a Nazi-built flak tower which has been repurposed as an aquarium. The anti aircraft monstrosity looms large as a further ugly reminder of the past.More appealing on the eye is the Apollo Kino, an art deco cinema and once a vaudeville stage, built in . My abode for the night is Das Triest where I am given a friendly welcome and shown to my spacious, colourful and al room. As I passed a nearby room a puff of smoky air wafted out, despite it being a non-smoking hotel. I wonderedit were a noirish character in a trilby living out a Third Man fantasy where the characters where often submerged in drting cigarette smoke.For dinner I was recommended the wiener schnitzelat Glacis Beisl. The krautfleckerlwas another popular choice. It’s a friendly eatery popular with locals and tourists.Otherwise a sausage and a drink at the renowned Bitzinger Würstelstand sausage stand has punters, tourists and well-heeled shoppers all queueing patiently for a cult classic. Some sit around the booth chomping their hot dogs, others walk the streets, dog in one hand and a beer in the other. A local in front of me says he’d rather eat here than in the city’s best restaurants. My next stop was the Leopold Museum which contains more than , works and artists such as Egon Schiele and Gustav Klimt, the former inspired record sleeves by David Bowie and Iggy Pop. Schiele’s strange and twisted human distortions are often unsettling and immediately recall iconic sleeves such as Bowie’s Lodger and Iggy Pop’s The Idiot.Bowie also referenced Schiele’s expressive movement on the iconic Heroes album cover. Schiele’s was a short career, his death in  at the age of  was a result of the Spanish flu pandemic he died three days after his pregnant we Edith. To mark  years since Schiele’s death, a public poster campaign by the city of Vienna in  featured works by Schiele from the Leopold Museum in cities such as London, Cologne, Hamburg and New York. Works such as Girl With Orange Stockings were censored in all the cities apart from New York. The advert suggested: “Sorry,  years old but too daring today”. The promotional endeavour undoubtedly brought fresh attention to Schiele where public intellectuals argued his worth and asked the age -old question: is it art or pornography From here, I walk to the Danube River andto the playlist and The Blue Danube by Johann Strauss II. My entry point to this songwas trying to fathom Stanley Kubrick’s : A Space Odyssey before my age entered double digits. This made a welcome last-minute alternative to the bolted museum door and was the perfect spot to finish my whistle-stop tour in the City of Music."},{"url":null,"title":"tv-new-crop-stars-aim-evade-capture-latest-series-channel-4s-celebrity-hunted","story":"TV: A new crop of stars aim to evade capture in the latest series of Channel s Celebrity HuntedCelebrity Hunted HQ Hunters L-R: Deputy Hattie Haslam-Greene, The Chief Lisa Theltspan classtruncategtltspan classtruncate-previewgtaker, and Head of Opltspan classtruncate-full-screengts Ray HowardOlympic silver medallist sprinter Thomas, , and two-time Paralympic gold medallist Whitehead, , who has set world records in full and half marathons, are used to being seen pushing themselves to the limit in packed sports stadiums.However, as one of four pairings for Channel s Celebrity Hunted, they will be hoping to remain as invisible as possible.\"Its such a great  for expressing dferent sides of your personality,\" says Whitehead of the show, adding: \"But also to explore relationships as well, and myself and Iwan have been friends for a while.\"We got along really well before, and I think the kind of le experience we have both had, and being fathers, we wanted to show the humanistic side of our personalities.\"Alongside the other celebrities, who are RuPauls Drag Race UK winner The Vivienne, Made In Chas Oliver Locke and his husband Gareth, they will be staying off the radar for two weeks while being \"hunted\" by a specialist elite team of  people, consisting of former police and intelligence officers.This years team of specialists also features a new addition in the form of the first female chief, Cleveland Police Assistant Chief Constable Lisa Theaker.The programme, ing for a fourth series in aid of Stand Up To Cancer, will also feature reality TV personality Chloe Veitch, Holby City star Chizzy Akudolu and former So Solid Crew member Lisa Maffia.Former Strictly Come Dancing contestant Thomas is as enthusiastic about the on-screen partnership as Whitehead is.

And then as the journey goes on, I very much became the vulnerable young boy inside who was missing home and was scared, and it may sound silly, but I really hope that comes across.\"And also the fact that Richard taught me and we taught each other, its OK not to be OK. And we hug each other.\"When we had to be, we were there for each other and I dont know what made the final cut, but it was definitely a few moments when he could see I was struggling and nothing needed to be said, he just came and gave me a big man hug.\"And I think it was really nice that we were there for each other because to do something like this on your own would have been horric.\"The break from social media and technology was also a bonus, because having a phone on them would mean they could be tracked.\"We slept in barns, we slept in fields, on beaches, wherever, and it was actually kind of quite nice to go back to not have an alarm clock to wake you up or the first thing you do when you wake up is check how many likes you have on Instagram,\" says Thomas.Sprinter Whitehead, who is a double amputee, completed  marathons in  days in  and won gold in  in London at the Paralympic Games in the T m, speaks openly about representation on screen and its importance.He says: \"Theres lots of iniduals out there that have these obstacles and barriers that stop them not only from getting employment but also just accessing le.\"And to break down some of these social barriers, its really important that on the TV and in the media that we show its possible, and seeing is believing.\"Being somebody that grew up in the s, when there wasnt an inclusion spectrum and TV was very white male, now that this, its starting to be more of a representation for the actual audiences watching, thats really important for me.\"And one of the days where we went to do something, we kind of had a conversation where I was like, No Iwan, we need to do this, I want to not only show you that we can change peoples perceptions of what can and cant be done, but also that every decision we make has consequences.

As you can see, these companies have been set up with the intention of making international money transfers easier, more cost-effective, and more accessible for all. These companies are nothing new, and many of them were created to solve a specic issue with sending money abroad. If customers use traditional banks, they are getting a terrible rate, the process is slow, and the fees are high. Naturally, this doesn’t exactly fill the customer with joy.That’s where international money transfer companies enter the picture. Without getting too much into the complexity of how they are able to provide such a competitive service, we will simply say that they are often far more desirable than banks. Basically, that’s because they have managed to cancel out the negatives when sending money abroad and turn them into positives. Of course, the companies then let you send money abroad to a number of dferent countries, with better exchange rates, and with quicker processing speeds. As a reminder, here are the top international money transfer companies:   How Does a Money Transfer Work After highlighting the top money transfer sites in the market right now, and explaining what these companies are able to provide, let’s now look at the specics of sending money abroad, shall we  After all, once you’ve signed up with your chosen , you will no doubt be looking to send money abroad as soon as possible. For that reason, we’ve detailed the exact process right here: As you can see, the process is actually very simple. When setting up your transfer, you will see how much money the recipient will get before you even confirm the transaction. At this moment, you’ll also be able to see what the fees will be. Onlyyou are happy to proceed should you then initiate the transfer, and you’ll need to transfer the exact amount of money to the account of the international money transfer provider.The final part of the process is arguably one of the main advantages of sending money abroad with such companies. You can actually track the progress of your transfer, much like you could doyou sent a parcel abroad. This is another thing that banks don’t provide, which can lead to quite a bit of frustration.How to Choose the Best Money Transfer ProviderWe’ve hammered home some of the main advantages of sending money abroad with these s. However, it’s important to also understand what to look for in terms of the potential pitfalls of these sites. After all, you need to ensure that the positives outweigh the negatives to guarantee a positive and valuable experience. So on that note, here are some of the key areas you need to address with international money transfer sites:SecurityTo gain an idea of how secure a money transfer  might be, there are actually a few subsections to look at. Firstly, and most importantly, you need to check that the  is regulated by the relative authorities in your jurisdiction. Without proof of this, you should not continue to use the site. Secondly, it’s important to look at the customer reviews for any site. It goes without saying that these reviews should reflect the  in a positive light.And finally, you may want to look at what kind of security measures are used for the transactions themselves. This can typically be seen within the ‘FAQ’ or ‘About Us’ section for a .Fees and Exchange RatesWhen you send money abroad, there are two factors that have the potential to make or break the value that you get. As you can see, these two factors are fees and exchange rates. Now, international money transfer sites are typically far more competitive than banks in these areas. After all, that’s what they are there for! On the subject of fees, of course, the lower the fees, the less money you essentially need to burn to send money abroad. However, exchange rates must also be addressed alongside the associated fees.The good thing about money transfer sites is that they offer a rate as close to the intermediary bank rate as possible. This means that your money is converted in the most competitive way possible. Then again, not all s offer the same exchange rates, which is why it’s worthwhile comparing some of the top providers to get the best deal.SpeedIf you were to send money abroad through a bank, it’s pretty common that the money wouldn’t be paid out for several business days. This can be problematicthe person you are sending money to needs it promptly. At the same time, it can be a little frustrating for both parties, including the sender and the receiver. Now, international transfer sites have managed to speed up this process quite dramatically. Instead of several business days to process transactions, these sites will execute the transfer in a matter of hours, or sometimes minutes.As you can imagine, the quicker a site is able to execute your transfer request, the more appealing it becomes.Transfer Options It goes without saying that dferent people will want to send money to dferent countries, and they will want to do so for dferent reasons. And while you might sign up with the intention of sending money to one specic country, you just never know whether you will want to send funds to some other country in the future. For that reason, it’s important to register with sites that support as many countries and as many currencies as possible. This makes the site more extensive, and subsequently more competitive.In terms of how the transfer is actually done, most international money transfer s execute the transaction via a bank transfer. However, there are other options that certain sites support, and these may also suit your preference.ReputationIn order to ensure that you feel comfortable with sending money abroad via a specic , it helps to know that they have a great reputation. Andyou are to gain a full picture as to the reputation of a site, you can look into a few areas. Performing a Google search to look at current and previous customer reviews is one of the most effective things you can do.

After all, money transfer s are widely available, both in terms of the number of them and how to access them - through desktop sites and mobile apps.

Soyou are ready to send money abroad through a trusted and competitive , we’d like to finish by referring you back to the recommended sites above.FAQsIs it safe to send money abroad with these s Absolutely. Each of the money transfer sites that we have recommended are regulated and have been in the business for a number of years. In addition to this, they are used by thousandsnot millions of customers worldwide. What is the most I can send abroad for a single transaction This can y quite signicantly from site to site. Of course, the maximums also y based on what currency you are looking to send. With that said, the maximums are usually quite high indeed, often hitting the six and even the seven-figure range. So unless you were hoping to send signicant sums of money abroad, you needn’t worry too much about this. Must I very my account after signing up Yes - all reputable s will require you to very your details after you have set up a new account.

Secondly, money transfer sites need to ensure that they are doing everything possible to avoid the facilitation of money laundering.Sure, this may seem a little sinister, and % of iniduals are obviously not looking to use the sites for this reason. But it does happen, and for that reason, everyone needs to very their account."},{"url":null,"title":"inspirational-scots-paralympic-medallist-seeks-conquer-antarctica","story":"The impressive landscape, the challenge of simply getting there and the six long months she’d spent in hospital with the news sinking in that she was paralysed from the neck down were a powerful combination.She had become the first woman to hand cycle across the Himalayas and the moment, with the beauty of the mountains stretching before her, the light air filling her lungs and the knowledge that this world didn’t have to be out of reach because of her new disability, was, she says, the moment among all of her many adventures, that means the most.“It was the first journey after I was paralysed,” recalls Karen, who would go on become a gold and silver medal winning Paralympian, adventurer and inspiration for countless others who, having convinced themselves that they couldn’t do something, looked to her and changed their mind.“I was on this ascent through the Himalayas. At the top of a path I stopped, looked around and thought of getting there against all the odds.“It was one of those unbelievable moments,” she continues. “I couldn’t believe when I lay on hospital bed that I would be looking at this.“It was a super profound moment.”She was  years old in , a geologist and keen athlete who had already climbed Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn, and won the Swiss KIMM Mountain Marathon, when she tumbled ft down an Aberdeen sea clf.The accident broke her skull, arms, neck and back, but not her spirit or determination to savour every second of le.Paralysed from the chest down, she left hospital, bought a racechair and set about ticking off an extraordinary series of challenges that would take her to all four corners of the world and paralympic glory.It is an exhausting list: she’s sea kayaked from Canada to Alaska, skied km across the Greenland icecap and climbed the kilometre high overhanging rock-face of El Capitan.She has hand-cycled along the Silk Route, theof Japan and across Tibet, and scaled Yosemites El Capitan, a four day climb of , pull-ups.Somehow amid it all, she found time to win silver at the  Paralympics for handcycling, and followed that with taking gold at the Rio games, despite being hit by a car during her training.She already has an MBE, however, in a few weeks’ time, her remarkable commitment, determination and resilience will be further recognised when she becomes the th recipient of the Scottish Award for Excellence in Mountain Culture.Previous winners of the award, one of the key events of the Fort William Mountain Festival, include mountaineer and author Cameron McNeish, Dr Hamish McInnes, pioneering mountaineer Andrew Nisbett and trailblazing polar explorer, Myrtle Simpson.Karen, who will be speaking at the Festival as part of Biking Night, on Saturday, February , was nominated by the public and her peers for the award. Winning, she says, took her by surprise.“It is a real honour,” she adds. “My soul is rarely peaceful without a mountain in its presence.“On becoming paralysed almost thirty years ago it seemed at first that mountains were a thing of the past.“Thanks to the interesting technology of bikes and skis, and to great friends who have been up for some adventures, mountain landscapes have worked their way even deeper into the fabric of my being.”Today she is in Spain, training for what will undoubtedly become another of many profound moments in her remarkable le.In December, Karen, , from Inverness, will head to the great wilderness of Antarctica. An unforgiving landscape even for those without her devastating disability, she plans to sit-ski from the Antarctic adventure base at Union Glacier to a ‘new pole’, at  degrees latitude and longitude.Joining her will be Iona Somerville, , a graduate of explorer Craig Mathieson’s The Polar Academy which helps specially selected school pupils gain confidence by taking them on a polar expedition.Iona, from Edinburgh, drew on the courage and strength the expedition gave her when she was caught up in the horros of the Manchester Arena bombing.The pair will begin their ‘Pole of Positivity’ challenge in early January, hopefully creating a World and Guinness Record for sit-skiing to the South Pole in the process.More than that, however, the mission is intended to highlight that through the toughest challenges le can throw at someone, surprising things become possible.Antarctica is the final element of Karen’s personal Quest  – a target she set to cover seven continents in nine rides, raising £, for spinal injury charities. The number  is also the atomic number for gold, a throwback to her geology career, and symbolic of achievement.The theme has expanded among her followers – there is now a global community working their way through personal challenges hooked around the number .Karen, meanwhile, has kept the best for last in her Quest challenge. “Antarctica is ultimate challenge,” she says. “It is a place that people in wheelchairs don’t go to.”There are particular dficulties for a wheelchair user - body temperature control, skin care, and using the toilet are just a few. But its remoteness is also part of the attraction.“For most people our biggest disability is our mind and the limitations we put on our bodies. Disability is a state of mind, not a state of body,” she says.“I’ll be going to environment where you get the biggest, most amazing connection to nature, where there’s no manmade world at all.“That wilderness really appeals to me, and I want to spread the message about the power of the wilderness and nature.”Having Iona alongside will bring extra power to the challenge.“There’s a parallel in our stories,” she continues. “We want to share in our journey how dficult le can be everyone knows that from the last couple of years.“I want to remind people to keep believing, to go outside, believe in nature and move your body.“And when you do things with other people you have a common goal.”The Fort William Mountain Festival  runs from Wednesday  to Sunday  February.

It is more important than ever we all get vaccinated to protect ourselves, our family and friends. Boosters increase our protection against the virus up to more than  per cent.We talk to myth-busting medical experts who answer your most frequently asked questions about these essential jabs. vw, px\"  What protection does a booster jab give Dr Emeka Okorocha, who works in AE in London and South East, said: “As a doctor, I have seen first-hand the effect COVID- can have on people. I want to remind everyone you can still get seriously ill with the virus, so it is so important to get the jab to keep ourselves, your friends and loved ones safe. COVID- is highly infectious. The vaccine remains our best line of defence against it. Omicron is highly transmissible and still has the potential to lead to signicant numbers of people in hospital, so it’s so important your immunity is topped up, and to come forward for your first or second doseyou haven’t already. We don’t know what threat any future iants may pose, soyou haven’t come forward for any jabs, it is absolutely essential you do so.”When can you have a booster jab Yorkshire-based Professor Mahendra G Patel OBE, Pharmacy and Inclusion and Diversity Lead, said: “You can get a COVID- booster three months after your second dose and  days after positive COVID test. It’s also not too late to get a first or second dose. Getting the vaccine has never been easier. Everybody aged  and over have now been offered two doses of a COVID- vaccine. If you are  years old or above on the day the vaccinations are taking place in school, you will be able to access a vaccine.If you have not yet had a COVID- vaccine, it’s not too late. Appointments for first doses of COVID- vaccines are still available for anyone unvaccinated.”Is it safe to have a booster jabI’m pregnant London-based Dr Jenny Jardine from Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, who is also seven months pregnant and has had her COVID- booster jab, said: “Both as a doctor and pregnant mother myself, we can now be very confident the COVID- vaccinations provide the best possible protection for you and your unborn child against this virus. I would strongly call on all pregnant women like me,you haven’t had the vaccine yet, to either speak to your GP or midweyou still have questions and then book right away today.”Does a booster jab carry side effects Dr Okorocha said: “The COVID- vaccine is quick, easy and free. Don’t worry about the side effects. Like all medicines, the COVID- vaccines may cause some side effects, but most of these are mild and short-term, lasting no longer than a week, and not everyone gets them. Also,you weren’t able to get your booster dose because you had COVID-, remember to book your jab  days after you no longer have the virus.”How easy is it to get a booster jab Bradford-based NHS Dr Amir Khan said: “We know many people are juggling busy lives, which is exactly why the NHS is making it as easy as possible for you to get your booster. New walkin vaccination sites have been set up across the country, and existing sites have extended their opening hours, so as many people as possible can get jabbed as soon as possible. And, once you’ve had your vaccine, then why not encourage your friends and family to book as well, so we all have the best protection possible.”How effective is a booster jab Prof Patel said: “New analysis of vaccine efficacy by UKHSA has found protection against hospitalisation from vaccines is good against the Omicron iant. When the reduced risk of hospitalisation was combined with vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease, the vaccine effectiveness against hospitalisation was estimated as  per cent two weeks after a booster dose. One dose of any vaccine was associated with a  per cent reduced risk of hospitalisation among symptomatic cases with the Omicron iant, two doses with a  per cent reduction up to  weeks after the second dose and a  per cent reduced risk  or more weeks after the second dose.”Your booster jab is vital vw, px\"  copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

We need to be careful that the national messaging, which currently sits well within larger city areas, does not impact negatively here.“The simple solution is for everyone to maintain the good practices in place that have kept many of us safe to this point.

It is moored on a single tension tether. The subsea location and ability to winch low in the water column enables extreme storm loadings to be avoided so that the device can continue to operate in rough sea conditions. The Waveswing is designed to react to long ocean swell waves as well as short, wind-driven seas, for high energy capture.The £. million prototype project has been funded by Wave Energy Scotlandas part of the Novel Wave Energy Converter development programme. The demonstration at EMEC is also supported by the Interreg North-West Europe’s Ocean DEMO project.Neil Kermode, managing director, EMEC said:“We’re delighted to welcome AWS and the Archimedes Waveswing to Orkney and support its deployment and testing at our site in Scapa Flow.“Real sea deployment is a vital step in proving performance, reliability and survivability of these devices. We know that prototype testing at sea is really valuable to technology developers to check how a technology and its components work and react in the environment prior to scaling up. We are looking forward to helping the team as they prove how to install, operate and maintain their exciting machine in Orkney’s harsh conditions.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

They’ve got to get money back into people’s pockets.“Right across this country, town centres are not thriving, high streets are falling apart because not only have we seen good wages, good jobs, depart from many parts of the country over recent decades, it’s been turbo-charged in the last  years and right now energy bills are going up, shopping prices are sky high and people are about to face a tax hike.”Ms Nandy branded the plans “regeneration on the cheap”.She told Times Radio: “King’s Cross-style regeneration they’re calling it, but King’s Cross cost £ billion to redevelop, the Government’s stake in it alone was worth more than three times as much as the money that has been allocated to a few parts of the country this morning.“Essentially what they’re saying is you can do regeneration on the cheap while welarge sums of your money into one very small corner of the country.“That’s not just missing the point actually, that’s downright insulting to people who have a contribution to make, who have huge ambition for their communities, but are watching their town centres fall apart and their young people have to get out in order to get on.”The work will be spearheaded by the Government’s housing agency Homes England, which will be “refocused” to deliver on the levelling-up agenda.The DHLUC said the areas will benefit from developments combining “housing, leisure, and business in sustainable, walkable, beautul new neighbourhoods”.At the last Budget in October , Mr Sunak announced an extra £. billion to bring , hectares of brownfield land into use.The DLUHC said the newly-available £. billion Brownfield Fund will form part of this allowance.Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said earlier: “This huge investment in infrastructure and regeneration will spread opportunity more evenly and help to reverse the geographical inequalities which still exist in the UK.”A separate £. billion Levelling Up Home Building Fund will also be launched next week.It will provide loans to small and medium-sized builders and developers to deliver , homes, with the vast majority going outside London and the South East.The DHLUC said the cash for this fund was first announced in .Meanwhile, the department has announced seven Mayoral Combined Authoritieswhich are set to benefit from £ million of funding “to transform derelict brownfield sites into vibrant places where people want to live and work”.The seven MCAs – West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Liverpool, South Yorkshire, North of Tyne, and Tees Valley – stand to gain , homes, the DHLUC said.The department added that, as with the £. billion Brownfield Fund, this £ million pot formed part of the £. billion sum pledged by Mr Sunak last year.We want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

She#s in Cruickston # there is quite a big estate there and when I went for a walk there, I came across a park almost every minute of the walk. I was amazed how many there were there.“I put up a post about this on Facebook # as the two parks we have in Portree are not really looked after and are quite dilapidated.“I asked why we can’t do better for our kids here. It started a big conversation and got loads of people talking about it. Lots of parks were mentioned where local groups had got together to develop them, like the one in Plockton and the one in Kyleakin.”Tfany was given a helping hand by friend Gary Shinnie who suggested the old park in Matheson Place, which had been left to rot, and agreed to assemble a squad of volunteers to help clear the site.After chatting to Highland Councillor John Gordon, Drew Millar from the local community council, and the Portree and Braes Community Trust, and a representative from the Lochalsh and Skye Housing Association it was decided that the best way for Tfany to take the project forward would be through the Trust’s Outdoor Activity group.The project was able to acquire £, from the National Lottery, and the group raised £,. last Friday and Saturday at the Co-op in Portree.Commenting on the response, Tfany said: #Friday and Saturday wasn#t just about fundraising it was also about making people aware of the project.“When people were standing and put their signatures down, we were able to explain to them what we were doing, and when they saw the plans, most people said that it was a great idea, and they loved the fact that it had things for children with special needs in it.”The group is raising money through funding applications, a JustGiving page, and is also inviting businesses to get involved in supporting the project too.A D plan of the play park has been made by Kompan, who also worked on the new playpark in Kyleakin.The park will comprise  dferent play activities including four swings, an octopus seesaw, a carousel, a four-tower unit with a tunnel and a slide, it will be able to accommodate  users of all ages.Although there’s still plenty to do to bring the play park to le, Tfany is confident that it will happen, and this year.to donate to project."},{"url":"https://www.whfp.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/Sanas-Padlet-266-x-150-mm-1.jpg","title":"dreuchd ur ann an","story":"An Tìr, An Cànan, ‘S na DaoineADVERTISING FEATURE: NEW YEAR, NEW CAREERAig an àm seo den bhliadhna, bidh sinn tric a’ smaoineachadh air ar dreuchdan atharrachadh agus mar sin is dòcha gum bi an goireas ùr aig Bòrd na Gàidhlig feumail dhuibh ma tha sibh a’ beachdachadh air dreuchd ùr ann an teagasg tro mheadhan na Gàidhlig.’S e goireas didseatach a th’ ann am padlet far a bheil làraich-lìn, sgrìobhainnean agus bhideothan air an cruinneachadh air balla.

They prefer instead to view Gaelic as a natural medium for their music # a not atypical outlook for their island generation raised with the language as part of their education during the s.And this should be encouraging, for the key to the future survival of the language will lie not in its exceptionalism, but in its ordinariness.While Gaelic may be natural to Niteworks, what sets them apart is how they use it. Their trademark sound is forged from the rich Hebridean song tradition of their native communities, and the dance music they listened to in their bedrooms, and later in Glasgow nightclubs.They have just released their third album # A’ Ghrian,– which follows the eponymous debut album of  and Air Fàir An Làwhich came out in .In what should have been one of the marquee events of Glasgow’s Celtic Connections festival, last Friday Niteworks should have been on stage with the Royal Scottish National Orchestra. But to immense frustration and disappointment, Covid restrictions were not been lted in time and the concert has been rescheduled for the summer.Unsurprisingly, lockdown and the pandemic are themes that have influenced the new album, says band member Allan MacDonald.. “It has been over two years since I have been to a club as a punter.“That was a huge part of our lives. I wouldn’t say it has changed our musical tastes, but what we listen to at home now is dferent to what we would listen to in a club.“That has influenced us and the direction we are going as a band. We’re also getting a bit older, there’s two in the band that have young families now and this album is perhaps a bit more reflective than the others.”It is approaching  years since the quartet put on their first gig – at Braes Hall as part of the year of Highland culture celebrations in . Their first EP followed in , and Niteworks have since become regulars on the festival circuit # including annual appearances at SkyeLive in Portree.They aren’t full time as a band, however, and online rehearsing was a familiar process to them long before the outset of the pandemic.Allan, who is from Braes and from a family of pipers, works in renewable energy and is based in London. Synth and keyboard player Innes Strachan from Breakish works in sound production in Glasgow drummer Ruaraidh Graham, also from Breakish, works in Edinburgh for Historic Environment Scotland and bass player Chris Nicolson, from Braes, is with the BBC in Inverness.One of their ‘lockdown projects’ included writing the music to mark Edinburgh’s Hogmanay, and in turn this led to the orchestral collaboration and the more ‘expansive and cinematic’ sound of the new album, says Ruairidh Graham.“We were partly inspired by our work writing the music for Edinburgh’s Hogmanay Fare Well film that reflected on what  had been like for many during the pandemic,” he adds. “The nature of the project required broad expansive sounds, and that led to us going further in that direction through the writing and recording of the album.“Our upcoming orchestral concert for Celtic Connections further reinforced our desire to keep down that path.”There is an abundance of vocal talent to be found on A’ Ghrian, including from long-time collaborators Sian . Celebrated Scottish singers Kathleen MacInnes, Beth Malcolm, Hannah Rarity and Alasdair Whyte also feature, and Niteworks have incorporated English folk and Scots songs into their repertoire for the first time.The album, which was funded by Creative Scotland and recorded in autumn , also features Fiona MacAskill, Aileen Reid and Laura Wilkie of Kinnaris Quintet alongside Susan Appelbe on strings.A’ Ghrian is available to buy on CD and stream and download on all digital s, and the band will tour the until the end of .

We have taken back control of our waters and a year on from the Trade and Co-operation Agreement a positive picture is emerging for our fishing industry, he continued.ldquoWe have seen an increase in quota that will amount to around poundm by  and are investing poundm into coastal communities so that they can benefit from better infrastructure, new jobs and investment in skills.Local councillor Dermot Curran is encouraging people to respond to the consultation exercise, to reduce the impact of fishing on the marine environment, as well as support the industry. And he hopes that all three Co Down fishing ports will benefit from the funding that is to be made available.ldquoI am keen to see more detail to see exactly how Ardglass in particular can benefit from financial support at a time when there is much focus on a range of work that is required at the village harbour, Cllr Curran continued.ldquoThe need to deepen the harbour to facilitate larger vessels is key moving forward, but the need to have a dedicated boat repair facility in the village has also been raised with me. Currently, vessels have to go where to be repaired.ldquoIf Ardglass had its own dedicated repair facility, it would not only be able to service local boats but those based in other ports. Investment to repair boats locally would also create jobs.Cllr Curran said everyone with an interest in the fishing industry should make the most of the opportunity to comment on the detail in the joint fisheries statement.ldquoConfirmation that poundm is being made available for fishing communities is excellent news and I hope that the ports of Ardglass, Kilkeel and Portavogie will be able to share this very welcome additional financial investment, he continued.ldquoThis is an important step forward and clearly Minister Poots is committed to the Co Down fishing industry and the processing industries and communities which rely heavily upon it. This new investment will help safeguard all their respective futures which is good news. The investment will boost the local and regional economy.Last year, it was revealed that investment in the region of poundm is needed to upgrade Ardglass harbour to help maximise the portrsquos future opportunities.The Fishing and Seafood Development Programme reportrsquos recommendations for Ardglass included enhancing capacity at the harbour to provide security for fishing and processing businesses,The report revealed that a survey of the harbour walls in Ardglass showed that some repairs may be required within the next one to two years but their condition will not prevent the deepening of the harbour mdash to nine metres below the waterline mdashthey are stabilised and protected from undermining prior to dredging operations.It says the current water depth and quaysideprevents larger fishing vessels from landing at Ardglass with tankers transporting fish landed in Belfast to the village for processing. Mackerel and Irish Sea herring continue to be landed in Ardglass.The report said there is inadequate space for growing the inshore fleet at the port as the quayside is dominated by the larger demersal fleet and occasional visiting pelagic vessels, with the adjoining marina for the exclusive use of leisure craft.It was also noted that a constraint to the landside development of the harbourrsquos estate is the mixed ownership of existing properties which prevents the Fishery Harbour Authority from having full control over activities at the port and limits the ability to plan strategically..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Caoimhe.jpg","title":"Caoimhe raises £900 for turtle rehabilation scheme in Maldives  ","story":"WHEN it comes to conservation, Downpatrick woman Caoimhe Morgan-Burns practices what she preaches.The  year-old has raised pound by collecting rubbish from the sides of the Ardglass Road and Ballysallagh Road.The money is to go towards the cost of a pound, trip to Naaru Island in the Males in June where Caoimhe will devote four weeks of her time to volunteer at a sea turtle rehabilitation centre.The trip will mean a lot to Caoimhe, a former pupil at Shimna Integrated College in Newcastle, as she will head to Bristol University in September to study Wildle Ecology and Conservation Science.Caoimhe plans to plant some trees on her familyrsquos land so and is thinking up of other fund-raising initiatives towards the cost of the trip.She spent over five hours removing rubbish from the edges of the road and was dismayed by how much she collected from her own home road.ldquoI collected  bin bags full of rubbish.

The winning schools each received pound of NIFQA beef and lamb, kindly sponsored by ABP Food Group.Livestock and Meat Commission education and consumer promotions manager, Sarah Toland, explained that one of the key drivers for the competition was to encourage the use of NIFQA beef and lamb in schools and to complement the organisationrsquos existing schools programme.ldquoWith this in mind we specically targeted food and nutrition teachers and their students when drawing up the criteria for the project, she said.Sarah congratulated the winning schools, noting that as the competition received an encouraging number of entries, to select the top three was no easy task.De La Salle teacher Irene Stokes said the competition helped increase awareness of the importance of sourcing local NIFQA produce.She added: ldquoThis competition allowed our students an opportunity to highlight the vital nutrients that beef and lamb provide and how both can add iety, colour,flavour and texture to any dish. ldquoOur students are also becoming increasingly aware of sourcing meats that have the NIFQA symbol and the impact this has on the local economy.Down High teacher Sharon McKee said the competition was a ldquofabulous way of encouraging students to consider the valuable contribution of red meat in their diet.She added: ldquoOur Year  pupils are currently investigating the nutritional and dietary needs of adolescence so this competition fitted well into our curriculum and brought the theory to le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Downe.jpg","title":"Downe partnership to help map future  ","story":"THE first meeting of a new forum involving health chiefs, hospital campaigners, trade unions and politicians to oversee service provision at the Downe hospital is expected to take place in the spring.The South Eastern Trust mdash which is responsible for the hospital and the delivery of a raft of health and social services across the community mdash has described the creation of the new Downe Health and Care Partnership Forum as exciting.Last summer, South Down MP Chris Hazzard suggested to senior health chiefs that a new partnership involving a range of key players should be established to help map out the most appropriate model of health care for the area and it will soon become a reality.Health chiefs said the forum, which is the first of its kind in Northern Ireland, said the two key objectives are to plan for the future with everyone who uses services in the area and work in partnership to improve the health and wellbeing of the community.The health trust said this is in line with the organisationrsquos so-called ldquoquality  all strategy which puts excellent care at the centre of what it does.Officials say the new forum will consider local population health and social care needs, support people to lead healthier lives and take action to reduce health inequalities.Health trust chief executive, Roisin Coulter, said the organisation wants to work collaboratively with the local community regarding existing health and social care services to plan and design for the future.ldquoWorking in partnership with a wide range of key stakeholders will be vital to the forumrsquos success.

I accused the departmental officials of paralysis by analysis and unfortunately that has proved to be true.ldquoSince then, of course, the traffic congestion, which is now traffic chaos, has been greatly increased by the Irish Street closure, and it should be noted that not a single traffic management action has been initiated in the interval, he continued.NEWCASTLE ndash A cross-community unity campaign has been launched to save Newcastlersquos only public residential home from closure.Mourne House has been targeted for closed by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board but this week local politicians have joined with the Friends of Mourne House in mobilising public support against the plan.Representatives from the Friends group have already met with Board officials in a bid to persuade them to adopt a proposal from the charity, Age Concern, which is offering to take over the management of the  year-old home.DUNDRUM ndash Over pound, damage has been caused in another arson attack in Dundrum.Two caravans were completely destroyed and another badly damaged in the attack at the Bayview Caravan Site off the Dromara Road early on Saturday morning.It is believed the blazes were started in the early hours and two of the caravans were well alight by the time fire crews arrived on the scene.The incident is the latest in a long line of malicious arson attacks in the village which police believe are the work of a pyromaniac.Just before Christmas the villagersquos two primary schools were targeted with the Downshire Primary School sustaining over pound, damage. The arsonist has also attacked Dundrum cricket club, the orange hall and the parochial hall.BRYANSFORD ndash Plans have been announced to convert one of Bryansfordrsquos most historic landmarks into apartments, a craft shop and a restaurant.The former home of the Earl of Roden, close to the gates of Tollymore Park, will be converted into eight apartments, and an outbuilding will be extended to form a craft shop and restaurant facilityplanning permission is granted by the DoE.A further planning application proposes to build a number of luxury apartments on a site to the rear of the building, with an access from the nearby Burrenreagh Road.The building, which comprises extensive outbuildings and a courtyard, was used as a travellersrsquo inn during the last century when the Roden family lived in Tollymore House in the forest park.Since the destruction of Tollymore House the inn has been the home of the present Earl of Roden. In  it was the scene of an antiques robbery in which Lord Roden was tied up and threatened as raiders stole valuable paintings and antiques.Part of the outbuildings were regularly used by youth groups for residential weekends in the Mournes.BALLYNAHINCH ndash The job losses at the Ballynahinch GPT plant mean the lsquoBig Threersquo players in Down District industry no longer top the  jobs mark.GEC Plessey Telecommunications was the last of the lsquoBig Threersquo to employ more than  on one site.The lay-offs mean there are virtually no large-scale industrial employers left in Down.The GPT plant has been set on a steady course of expansion, even after the amalgamation of Plessey, as it then was, with GEC in . It took over the vacant Albion clothing factory on the Antrim Road and at one point last year was employing  people.The number has been whittled away and will be reduced to  employees.The other two major employers have also been hit over the last four years. The Shirley Tannery, owned by English-based Pittard Garnar at the time, employed  until its closure was announced in February . Although it re-opened later that year, the numbers employed has been dramatically scaled down.The decline in the numbers is even more pronounced when it is considered that in its heyday in the late rsquos, the tannery employed up to  people.STRANGFORD ndash There has been a renewed call for a bridge linking Strangford and Portaferry.The newly-formed Strangford Lough Bridge Project Group says a bridge across the Strangford Narrows is the only means of guaranteeing a continuous link across the lough.However, the group accepts that a scheme involving a barrage to harness tidal power would be environmentally unacceptable.Group chairman, Mr James McMullan, from Portaferry, said ldquoI believe there is overwhelming support for a bridge.ldquoPeople in Portaferry are concerned about the future of the DoE ferry service. A bridge has to be the ultimate answer. It would provide a link  hours a day and would not be subject to breakdowns, he continued.And Mr McMullan says he intends to seek the support of local councillors for his proposal.ldquoI accept a barrage would have environmental implications but a bridge on its own would benefit communities on both sides of the lough, he added.RACING ndash A campaign to introduce Sunday horse racing in Britain could result in Sabbath day racing coming under starters orders at Downpatrick.Mr Iain Duff, course registrar at Downpatrick, has given his support to the Jockey Club campaign and is demanding sweeping changes in legislation which prohibits betting on a Sunday.Mr Duff says Downpatrick and Down Royal ndash the Provincersquos other racetrack ndash should be allowed to hold Sunday meetings.Mr Duff says the law could be changed easily by making an Order in Council which would then enable tracks to hold meetings when people are most prepared to go racing on Sunday.He believes the move is needed to bring racing here into line with the Republic where Sunday racing was introduced some years ago.ldquoSunday racing in the Republic has proved to be a wholesale success. Surveys have shown more people go racing on a Sunday than on any other day, he remarked.ldquoYet the Northern Ireland Minister of Agriculture last November rejected the appeals of deputations representation Downpatrick and Down Royal seeking an equal opportunity.Mr Duff said thatSunday racing is permitted, the law relating to gambling would have to be changed.Mr Duff added: ldquoEverybody in racing respects the views of people who may be against Sunday racing, but I donrsquot think they should be allowed to dictate to the majority..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Matt.jpg","title":"Matthew survives on Dancing With The Stars  ","story":"LOVE Islander Matthew MacNabb survived the first public vote in RTErsquos Dancing With The Stars mdash despite gaining the lowest number of points.The Downpatrick man was faced with the challenge of dancing the jive on Sundayrsquos show, known to be notoriously dficult for tall male dancers.Standing at ft in, the  year-old admitted it was tough going, but was personally delighted with his effort with professional dance partner Laura Nolan.Speaking from Dublin on Monday, Matthew told the Recorder: ldquoI was happy with my dance last night as I had a nightmare with it all week trying to get the timing and coordination down.ldquoThat was the best I danced it and I worked so hard all week but I guess giraffes arenrsquot meant to jive.In the end, it was novelist Cathy Kelly who was the first celebrity to leave the show.The local GAA player and digital marketing consultant said he had been overwhelmed by the support and votes he had received.He said: ldquoTo be bottom and to get through shows how amazing people are to vote for me and I really appreciate it.

THE big match of the week saw the top two teams face off against each other as the league leaders from Killyleagh made the trip to Spa to face the only team to have beaten them this year.They were just left to pick up the crumbs as the hosts continued their unbeaten run which led to this big win that no makes them favourites for the league with two games in hand and only eleven points behind with four rounds left to play.Davy Cavan, Paul and Don McNamara were up against Stevie Brown, Kieran McMullan and Ricky Cathcart and after four ends it was all square at -. But then Don upped the pressure and the hosts dominated thefinal ends to run out - winners.On the other mat the home triple of Hilary Cavan, Robin Horner and Graham Christie were playing some great bowls against Paddy Murray and after lting a count of six on the third end would only lose three ends in their - win. At the break the home side had a -shot overall lead.The Saints made a slight comeback in the third game as Philip Woodside, David Anderson and Neil Brown continued their good run of form against Frances and Derek McCann and skip Alan Laughlin, who after losing the first two ends won the next three to go - up before Alan hit back to make it it - after seven ends.This would be as good as it would get as the visitors won the last three ends to finish - winners to secure the only away points of the match.A mention must go to this triple for playing and controlling this game so well, especially as Philip had a throwback to past times with the quality of lead bowls.The last game of the night saw Rose Marie Wylie, Davy Vance and Peter Christie score seven shots from the first two ends against Terry Quinn, Nigel Brown and Tony Ward.They never relinguished this lead as the game finished - in their favour to secure another great win.Surely now no-one can stop Spa from continuing on and finish the season unbeaten and as champions.DROMARA..................... OWENBEG..................... DROMARA made their second trip to Owenbeg and got their best result of the season.They came away with a well deserved draw, but will be thinking they should have had the overall win.On mat one Jim McNeill, Brian and Ann Marie OrsquoHare were playing E Milligan, Marc Crothers and Sean Toman.They shared the end wins and at the end nothing could separate them as it finished -.On the other mat Mark Brady, Niall and Michael McGreevy were involved in an equally close game against Isobel Rooney, Damian Tumelty and David Gibson.After nine ends found themselves three up.Davidrsquos triple tried their best on the last end but could only manage to score two shots to finish - down.With only a couple of shots in it at half-time it was all still to play for. Dromararsquos Denis Kane, Richard Kelly and JamesMcKinney took control of their game against Haydn Tumelty, Dermot Rooney and Liam Higgins and even though they won only four ends and scored  shots to win -, this left Dromara with a five-shot lead in the overall.Owenbeg finally got going in the final game as Nathan Tumelty, Alan Telford and Collie Gibson really put Marie McNeill, Phil and Eamon Kelly to the sword.They only let their opponents score two shots as they scored steadily and heavily to run out victors by a - margin.It has to be said that Nathan was giving his team-mates an easy time with his standard of lead bowls on what are tricky mats.This win was enough to get Owenbeg the extra points and scrape an overall draw.ST MACARTANrsquoS........... MARINA........................ MARINA made the trip to Loughinisland and went home with a good eight points that keeps them the best of the rest after the top two.It was the Saints who got off to the better start with Kevin Cassidy, Ann Marie McGreevy and John Gavin winning - against Norman Gordon, but sadly this would be as good as it would get for the home side.On mat two the visiting triple of Jimmy Graham, John Cummings and Ronan Smyth were involved in a high scoring game against Francie McGreevy with both sides having multiple counts, but it was Ronan who was getting the better of them to finish winners by -.After the break it was back to a low scoring affair between Sammy Hardy, Gerry Toman and Don Corrigan, who were playing Patricia Russell, Roy McKibben and Joey Chambers, who would win the last three ends for a - win.The final game saw Raymond Gelston along with Cecilia Magill and Manzi Cullen score two threes on the first two ends but would not score again until the seventh end against Isobel Cunningham, Henry McDowell and Billy Collom, who finished strongly to win -.All in all, a good nightrsquos bowls for the visitors..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/26_January2022_Control.jpg","title":"Take back control in your life  ","story":"SO here we are officially into . How are your New Year resolutions going How many times do you decide to lsquostop thisrsquo, lsquostart thatrsquo, and find a few weeks later that you have blown it and feel guilty and frustrated with yourself Starting all over again on the back of frustration and then pushing yourself even harder, making it increasingly dficult to stick to your resolution Breaking habits or quitting something on the surface seem like great ideas when wanting to improve your health and well-being. Irsquod love to introduce you to approaches that are foundations that last and make you feel empowered and happier in  and beyond.What I think is essential, when we want to stop a bad habit or make a change in our lives, is to make sure that we are on our own side.Self-compassion is basically being your own best friend. When we are with our best friend, we listen to them. We comfort them and speak on their behalfthey ask us to help them. To get the cogs in motion,answer yes or no to the following questions:Do you find it hard to say no Do you find it dficult to take a compliment Do you criticise yourself often Do you compare yourself to others Do you worry about what others think about you How many were answered lsquoyesrsquo Maybe after everything that we all have been through over the last couple of years,  has the possibility to be the year that you remember as the year you began to take control, to recover and heal.  could be the year when you started loving yourself more.There are three elements that I would like to introduce today that are to be consideredyou want to feel empowered and active in real self-care.AwarenessAwareness begins with the practice of noticing. It helps us be in the present moment and be calm as we take in the sights, sounds and touch mdash even taste mdash around us.Mindfulness and meditation have been trendy in recent years, but from my one-to-one counselling work, quite a few people have said that ldquoit didnrsquot work for them, or ldquoI didnrsquot really see the benefits.Once we talked about that more, we came to the realisation that they were practicing mindfulness to not feel, to escape feeling uncomfortable or to push away dficult or negative thoughts. As a practice, things changed for the better once my clients were made aware that mindfulness was to observe their feelings and observe their thoughts with an open mind as attention was gently brought back to the breath.Taking little pockets of time in our day to consciously pause, taking a few breaths in and out and observe, can immediately let our bodies and minds be calm and focused.The small daily things are the most important things to ensure real change. You can try this little exercise and be aware how your body and mind feels:S  ndash Step back.T ndash Take three deep breaths in and three slow breaths out.O  ndash Observe the thoughts and feelings in that very moment.P ndash Proceed.Awareness also involves being able to see patterns that arise in our thoughts and feelings, as well as the behavioural outcome. Kind of like detective work, we are then able to reframe our thinking, as well as breaking the familiar cycle of judgement and frustration. Just a wee word about practicing awareness mdash it is not about self control. Awareness helps us to begin to understand ourselves and develop self compassion and practice patience .Essentially, self awareness is about empowering ourselves and providing regulation of our body and mind. Self-regulation in turn, seeks to identy and reduce the causes of problems in mood, thought and behaviour.Self-control seeks to inhibit or manage such problems only when they arise. Self-control looks at old methods of punishment and reward to manage behaviour ndash maybe like the way we begin every New Year resolution mdash or every Monday, etc.AcceptanceEspecially when a New Year starts ndash therersquos this pressure to go to extreme measures, with this notion of being accepted more, to be seen and or valued more. But pretty much into the month of January we notice how it can rob us of truly living.We are not human DOINGS ndash we are human BEINGS. I have worked over the last  years as a counsellor and have heard people talk about trying to control their lives, but feeling like it was evading them more and more.Clients found themselves going harder, pushing harder, feeling exhausted, feeling helpless ndash then pulling up their socks and trying again. Although it may go against the grain of whatrsquos familiar, itrsquos healing to ease ourselves from a place of trying mdash to be perfect, as good as others, etc mdash to self-acceptance.Accepting lessens the pressure and helps us go with the flow.Self-acceptance is a journey. If anyone  needs to put pressure on us, itrsquos them who needs to deal with their own expectations mdash not us. Acceptance challenges deeply held beliefs that we are not lsquoworthyrsquo enough or lsquogoodrsquo enough to be whole. Like awareness, acceptance develops self compassion ndash a connected relationship with ourselves.In Dialectical Behavioural Therapy, there is a theory called Radical Acceptance developed by Martina Linehan, who quotes: ldquoRejecting reality turns pain into suffering.It is really tough to accept things how they are, from childhood trauma to unexpected traffic jams. It is really such a relief and sense of clarity when we realise and accept things that we are not in control of.It is absolutely OK to feel whatever we feel in the moment. Itrsquos not just sitting back and letting bad things happen of course. It is quite pro-active from problem solving based on how things actually are, self compassion when paying attention to how we feel in the moment. Meeting emotional pain head on, after all, it is what it is. Acceptance means no more unnecessary suffering.AssertionGabor Mate talks about assertion as a declaration to ourselves and to the world that lsquowe arersquo and that lsquowe are who we arersquo. Itrsquos not being simply able to stand up for ourselves mdash therersquos something more heartfelt than that.Assertion challenges the all too common belief that we must somehow justy our existence. There are lots of things that we can learn about and practice when it comes to assertion in itself, but maybe after reading the first two elements you are realising that our inidual minds, bodies and spirit are all so important.Making decisions about diets, relationships, careers, etc, usually get focused on a lot more during the month of January, as well as quitting things and going cold turkey on habits that have been part of our lives for years.Assertion isnrsquot just a quick course from a manual or podcast about tips and tricks. It is a really important statement of our being. It is a positive valuation of ourselves mdash independent of our history, abilities, personality or the worldrsquos perception of us.In regards to resolutions, assertion doesnrsquot involve action or reaction. Like I said before, it is our BEING, no matterwe take action or not. Assertion helps us be crystal clear about what we value and what is not OK with us as iniduals.From our values we can develop boundaries. Yes, let the rest of the world cope with that, or not. In fact, assertion may be the very opposite of action, not only in the sense of refusing to do something that we do not wish to do, but letting go of the very need to act at all.I really do hope that  gives you gts and wonderful surprises, as well as the comfort and support over dficult times. If you feel that you like to find out more about ways of real self care, developing good habits and creating change, you can contact me on  .For the month of January, I am offering free -minute assessment sessions.

This device is located in a mph zone.A closer examination of the latest PCSP figures reveal that the mph speed in Ardglass was recorded on November  at am.In addition,  drivers were clocked at travelling over mph in the mph zone at the entrance to the village, with almost  percent of drivers detected travelling at between mph and mph. Thirty eight percent of drivers were detected driving at between mph and mph.The provision of the series of electronic devices was in response to community concern about speeding across the district and viewed as part of a major offensive on those who break the law and to encourage drivers to slow down.PCSP officials say the average speeds recorded in Downpatrick, Killyleagh and Newcastle have reduced with no change in Newcastle. However, concern remains about the dangerous speeds that continue to be recorded with some drivers showing a blatant disregard for the speed limits in place.The highest speed recorded at the Strangford Road in Downpatrick was mph in the mph zone at am, with  drivers detected travelling at over mph. Previous speeds recorded at the built-up area have peaked at mph.Residents in the built-up area, which includes a signicant number of houses, a nursing home and local authority depot, have continually expressed concern about the speed of drivers who use the busy road and argue that the speed sign needs to be relocated further back towards the Lecale Park entrance.The highest speed recorded at the Dublin Road in Castlewellan was mph at am, with  drivers recorded travelling in excess of mph, with % of drivers detected travelling between mph and mph.Elsewhere, one driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone at the Dundrum Road in Clough at am, with one driver clocked driving in excess of mph.In Killyleagh, a driver was detected travelling at mph in the mph zone on the approach to the townrsquos Integrated Primary School, with  drivers clocked at over mph. The highest number of offences was recorded at pm.The highest speed recorded at the Newcastlersquos South Promenade was mph, with two drivers recorded travelling at over mph. The highest number of speed offences were recorded around am.Across the council area, the latest figures indicate that recorded speeds have reduced by six percent. The average speed of cars travellingpast each sign was mph in Ardglass and Clough, mph in Castlewellan, mph in Downpatrick, mph in Newcastle and mph in Newcastle.The PCSP is planning to install seven more speed indicator signs with demand for the devices described as ldquohigh with particular interest from residents and councillors in the Downpatrick, Rowallane, Slieve Croob and Mournes district electoral areas.Local councillor Dermot Curran, who lives in Ardglass, has described the mph speed recorded at the Downpatrick Road in the village as ldquotruly shocking.He said while the number of drivers breaking the ious speed limits is reducing, there were a number ldquothumbing their noses at the restrictions in place and posing a serious danger to other road users and pedestrians.ldquoThe fact that drivers are not slowing down in built-up areas, regardless of the time of day, is a real worry. The consequences of a driver losing control of a car travelling at mph is truly frightening.

She lived in the period -AD and was a visionary spiritual leader and inspirational woman, she explained.ldquoBrigid was recognised as a saint from around the seventh century and seven dferent lsquolivesrsquo of St Brigid were written which is indicative of the cult following she had.ldquoHer feast day is on February which is the first day of spring mdash Imbolc in the Celtic calendar. There are three other feasts in the Celtic calendar mdash May , Bealtaine August , Luacutenasa and November,  Samhain. Each of the feasts has associated with it a specic set of beliefs and customs.ldquoThere was a pre-Christian aspect to the feast on February . The main importance of the feast of St Brigid would appear to be that it was a christianisation of one of the key dates in the farming year in Ireland. In earlier centuries in Ireland and in many areas St Brigidrsquos day was observed as a holiday and some farming related activities were not permitted. In , the government of the Republic of Ireland decided to make the February  a bank holiday. This is an inspired choice of date for the new bank holiday.Brigid said the main customs associated with St Brigidrsquos Day are the making of St Brigidrsquos crosses the Briacutedeoacuteg and the Brat Briacutede. These customs were traditionally practiced on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day as according to Celtic timing, night came before day.The custom of making St Brigidrsquos crosses is still widespread throughout Ireland. There are regional iations across Ireland in the design and composition of the cross. The most common one is the simple four armed cross.ldquoThe explanation of the custom is that St Brigid made the cross when she was comforting a dying man who wished to convert to Christianity. She placed it in his hands, explained Brigid. ldquoPeople believe that the St Brigidrsquos cross offers protection from sickness and other forms of adversity for their homes, family and animals.ldquoToday in Co Down farming and non-farming families still want to get a St Brigidrsquos cross for this reason. In Ulster, a three-armed cross was placed in the stable or byre for the protection of animals. Throughout my le I have made St Brigid crosses for our home.ldquoAs a teacher I have taught groups of pupils how to make the cross. It is important that we pass on customs and traditions to the next generation and do not lose the wealth of culture we have in Ireland.She said that the Briacutedeoacuteg is another custom associated with St Brigidrsquos Day. It consisted, or consists, of a group of young people called briacutedeoga, lsquobiddiesrsquoor biddy-boys going from house to house carrying an effigy of St Brigid .The children received some donation at each house visited. Often a doll was made for the occasion. The body of the doll may have been made from a sheaf of straw. A ball of hay, straw or turnip was used to represent the head. It was usually constructed with a strong stick or churn-dash at its core.The use of the churn dash was thought to reflect the saintrsquos association with dairying. A purchased rag doll might be used. Whether a doll was made or purchased, it was a representation of St Brigid and was dressed in white.The original objective of the exercise was the collection of alms for the poor. The group always provided some entertainment for the homes visited with singing or music. The girls and boys in the group dressed up in disguise for the occasion. The custom lasted longest in Co Kerry and still survives today in a few areas.The third important custom which was widespread throughout Ireland is known as the brat Briacutede . A piece of cloth, larger than a hankerchief, was put on a bush outside the home on the eve of St Brigidrsquos feast day and it was not usually brought in until morning.Brigid added: ldquoThe belief was that when St Brigid was travelling around the country that night and she came across the cloth, she blessed it with the curative powers of her cloak. It was put away and used as a healing cloth throughout the year for sickness, pain and as protection against harm. With changes in society this custom has only survived in some areas including the south and west of Ireland.The historian said that Saint Brigid, who is strongly associated with nature and farming, is ldquoa saint for our times. With the environmental crisis facing us we can learn from the reverence which the early Celtic saints, including St Brigid, showed towards nature. They appreciated the fundamental importance of nature to humanity.ldquoThe challenges we face today are much greater than those in the th and th centuries but the need for social justice is the same. May the le of St Brigid be an inspiration to all to take action for a better world.When she died St Brigid was buried beside the high altar in the church in Kildare. Her remains were brought to Downpatrick for reasons of safety at the time of the Viking raids on monasteries and reburied with those of St Patrick and St Colmcille at Down Cathedral.To book a place at pound for one of talks visit https:www.saintpatrickcentre friends saint-brigids-day-experiences..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/13422201.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % lessThose ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local servicesThese adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Please try again later.Submitting...This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google Privacy Policy and Terms of Service apply.Now he seems secure again.Days ago Boris Johnson seemed finished as prime minister. It was being reported last night that the only people who can sack him, Tory MPs, were now beginning to rally behind his leadership.Anda week is a long time, a year is an eternity.Arlene Foster’s demise was sudden. Edwin Poots’s rise to be her DUP successor was swt and his fall from that post almost as fast.Then only weeks ago there seemed to be a Westminster solution to the DUP’s challenge in getting its third leader in quick succession, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, into Stormont without having immediately to give up his Lagan Valley constituency and force a risky by-election there.But then that proposal — a temporary exemption to the double jobbing ban — was pulled from under him and there was fresh focus on how the DUP would manage the ious obstacles to finding a seat for Sir Jeffrey in the constituency where he is long established, but so are Mr Poots and Paul Givan.What then does last night’s political twist within the DUP mean By going for the South Down MLA nomination, Mr Poots was leaving the way clear for Mr Givan and Sir Jeffrey to be DUP MLAs for Lagan Valley .What did Jim Wells make of the Poots bid to move to the constituency in which Mr Wells is long established as the main DUP personality  Perhaps it was a disappointment, after Mr Wells had been such a gushing supporter of Edwin Poots as DUP leader.Or perhaps Mr Wells already knew that he was not going to be on the DUP shortlist, so it was not too much of a problem.Mr Poots will now have to cast around for another constituency.His leadership manoeuvre last May clearly annoyed much of the DUP establishment, who treated his victory with an overt coolness, even contempt, that the party rarely displayed in public towards senior figures, whatever private misgivings there might have been about any of them.Do some such figures now want to bury Mr Poots’s career entirely or were they only motivated by the view that Diane Forsythe was a better standard bearer in South Down One thing that strikes me about Mr Poots is an admirable ability to weather setbacks and even humiliations like his astonishingly brief tenure as DUP leader, and to soldier on without seeming bitter, so he might well cheerfully continue his search for a seat.The ious developments in unionism in recent weeks do not tell us much about ideological direction, except that the UUP and DUP are both chasing the liberal vote.In the case of Doug Beattie, it is a more explicit pitch to the values of the Alliance Party.In the case of Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, it is a move to capture the centre of unionism.But while the DUP is not moving in what anyone would call a strongly liberal direction, and while it still wants to be a broad church, it seems to have calculated that very traditional or fundamentalist Christian voters are sufficiently small in number that it can afford to lose many of them.It cannot afford to lose the growing numbers of people who are moderate on social questions such as abortion policy or same-sex relations. People, in other words, who are by no means radical on such matters but who are not traditionalists on them either.But all these political labels at times seem confused or contradictory.Doug Beattie is a ‘liberal’ who has, as a result of his tweets, potentially fallen foul of voters who have a ‘woke’ outlook on the world. He also took quite a robust unionist line on matters such as legacy and the Irish language.Edwin Poots is a ‘conservative’ who was in fact notably pragmatic on issues such as Gaelic and evenon the Irish Sea border.While it would not be quite right to characterise his politics as ‘liberal’ it was in no way hardline.Where will this all end Over the longer term unionism seems destined to become a centrist-leaning conservative movement. It will always been seen as somewhat on the right of the political spectrum because its primary position is preservation of the status quo. At the moment things seem bad for unionism, but that might not be so for long.There are still signs that very large numbers of voters, probably a comfortable majority, are themselves happy with the status quo.And radical liberal or leftist movements, in both the UK and the United States, have helped to bolster both the Conservative Party in England and the Republican Party in the US. In Northern Ireland, Alliance has been riding high for some years now, and certain polls suggest it could go higher still. But it might yet be damaged by its embracing of what some voters still consider to be ultra liberal values, or its europhilia A thing to watch is support for the TUV. Jim Allister’s standing in opinion polls fluctuates signicantly. He is trying to capture traditionalists, as is obvious from the party name, but also that large number of people who are very strong on the Union but not religious.l Ben Lowryis News Letter editor"},{"url":null,"title":"i hope that jim wells stands for election to stormont as an independent or with another party ","story":"Moment’s silence for crash victim Jon O’Hara at Ulster Rugby game against Scarlets   Jim Wells speaks of ‘confused situation’ as Edwin Poots to stand for election in South DownNewsLatestTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthOpinionPeopleRead ThisSportFootballMotorcyclingRugby UnionOther SportOpinionWhats OnThings To DoArts and EntertainmentNightleRetroLestyleEating OutCarsHomes and GardensHomes and GardensCoronaviruse-PaperFarmingRecommendedEntertainmentTechnologyLestyleHome and GardenFashion and BeautyDealsPuzzlesPublic NoticesFree Happy AdsNewsOpinionI hope that Jim Wells stands for election to Stormont as an independent or with another partyA letter from Lee Maginnis:By LettersSaturday, th January , : amUpdated Saturday, th January , : am  \"       \"  Jim Wells pictured in May  after his re-election to the assembly for South DownI am dismayed at the treatment of Jim Wells by the DUP.

PIC: Rob Youngson Focus Features“I think that I probably began to realise over the years that the leaving of Belfast was really an event that I couldn’t ever escape in its impact,” reflects Sir Kenneth, now . “The film really describes quintessentially a  seconds where my le changed forever, when a mob came down our street, a neighbourhood that otherwise had been very peaceful and harmonious, where we lived side by side with Catholics.“In what followed, which was the street being completely reconfigured into a fortress really, I think a series of things psychologically started to kick in, like they do when youthful experiences have a big impact, that have been with me ever since.“I didn’t know how such a story could manest itself in a film, but at the beginning of this lockdown there were so many similar feelings thrown up of being unsettled, of le providing the unknown, and really a desire to reach for all the things that helped you get through it – humour, human connection, your family, and a search for all the coping mechanisms – music, dancing, anything that asserted le, and fun and certainty at a time when things were so very deeply uncertain.”Kenneth Branagh plays the great Dane in his adapted version of Shakespeares Hamlet in It has taken Sir Kenneth some time to realise that day was “a very, very, I suppose, traumatising thing”.“One of the reasons it takes so long is that a big part of the Northern Ireland DNA is that you don’t go on about stuff like this,” he muses. “You don’t indulge, you don’t suggest that your challenges, your struggles, your problems, are any greater than anybody ’s. “So it’s taken me a long time to get to the point where I realised that remains the truth, but it doesn’t mean that your story doesn’t have some kind of value, quite the opposite, because you begin to recognise that other people might benefit from understanding these moments. with his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in \" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMNDMy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMNDMy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" with his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in \" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Kenwith his older brother Bill as children in Belfast before the family move to England after the outbreak of the Troubles in “Going back to experience it, in the doing of it, the shooting of it, it wasn’t so bad, because so much of that was mechanics. “It was afterwards, as you put it all together, and as it started to have its own le, it began to be a cumulatively more emotional experience. And it has had me quite a bit closer to tears on a day-to-day basis than I might otherwise be. But part of the process was understanding that tears can be helpful.”It was only during the editing process that Sir Kenneth, whose previous directing projects include Thor, Cinderella and Murder On The Orient Express – as well as a string of Shakespeare adaptations, thought about how the film might be received by others who had lived through this period in history.“The film sort of revealed that that’s what it was about, and that’s what it was for. The weight of sadness across the ious incidents, as well as the tenderness and the hard earned joy, just somehow allowed you to recognise that it was tough for everyone and it was a shared tragedy and the wound is still one that is shared by many people.  stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" \"\" width\"\" srcset\"https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w, https:www.newsletter webimg TUFZMTMMzMMDQy.jpg width w\" layout\"intrinsic\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-intrinsic i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"intrinsic\" stars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.PIC:PA Photo Rob Youngson Focus Features.\" fallback layout\"responsive\" \"\" width\"\" src\" img placeholder.png\" class\"i-amphtml-layout-responsive i-amphtml-layout-size-defined\" i-amphtml-layout\"responsive\"Jude Hillstars as Buddy and Jamie Dornan stars as Pa in director Kenneth Branaghs Belfast.

It couldn’t be more personal really, to be able to tell the story.“I left at , Caitriona left at , not to avoid the beginning of a war, but we all did for dferent reasons, and I understand what that means. And I’ve also spent  years going around the world, telling people I’m from Belfast and seeing all kinds of reactions to just that.“And I think this film can help to settle some of the ideas that people have about that place and the people in my place, because we get to see it through the eyes of a normal family and that’s really vital.”Balfe, , who was born in Dublin and grew up right on the border, added: “When I read the script one of the things that impacted upon me was just the compassion and the empathy Ken had for this ordinary working class family who had not asked for this. “We’ve seen many great films about the Troubles, but there’s been an absence of films just about the everyday family, who sort of got caught up among it.”From North Belfast to RADA and playing the great DaneSir Kenneth Charles Branagh was born on December , and trained at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London where he has served as president since . He has been nominated for five Academy Awards, as well as having won three BAFTAs, two Emmy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. Ken was knighted on November ,  and was made a Freeman of Belfast in January . In , he was listed at number  on Thelist of Ireland’s greatest film actors.Branagh has both directed and starred in several film adaptations of William Shakespeare’s plays, including Othello , and most notably Hamletwherein he played the tormented Dane and delivered the lapidary ‘To be or not to be’ speech with perhaps more fervour than any actor before or since. He was nominated for Academy Awards for Best Actor and Best Director for Henry V and for Best Adapted Screenplay for Hamlet.He has starred in innumerable television series and films including Mary Shelly’s Frankenstein , Wallanderand Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets .‘Overnight our street was turned into a war zone’ recalls Branagh of By Joanne SavageKenneth Branagh’s older brother Bill told Ann Ferran of The Sunday Times in : “Ken was a regular little boy growing up in Belfast, who played football in the street. When my father went away he’d bring us back a little matchbox car. I used to keep mine pristine clean, but Ken used to take the tyres off his.”In the same illuminating article, Ken said of the place where he grew up: “The area was predominantly Protestant, but there was a smattering of Catholics. Everybody got on. There was a real sense of community. “We had a large extended family. “Le in Belfast was very grounded and family-orientated, and Bill and I were thrown together - we shared a bed. I remember being in bed next to him, and whichever book he wasn’t reading for school I’d pick up. So I was introduced to Shakespeare through him. “The cardinal sin back in Belfast was to show off or make a fuss. ‘Don’t have any ideas above your station.’ That was my parents’ philosophy. “To them, money was only important for putting a roof over your head it wasn’t an end in itself. And a person’s religion made no dference to my parents, though not everyone in Belfast shared that view. “My Dad was a Protestant, but he was never in the Orange Order.”Sir Ken continued: “My mother had just got pregnant with my sister when things became quite intense in Belfast. One night Bill came running up our street saying: “Get in the house!” We heard a terrible buzzing noise. “I saw a sort of cloud at the bottom of the street, which turned out to be a huge bomb. “Bill pushed Mum and me under a table in the back room. We didn’t know it then, but it was the mob outside, who were picking up the iron gratings from the drains at the side of the roads and throwing them through the windows of the Catholic houses. “Hours later, there were barricades at the top and bottom of the street, while the men ided themselves into vigilante groups. “Our street had turned into a war zone overnight.“In the wake of that, my parents felt uneasy about Belfast. My father, who was a joiner, had been offered a job in England, at a management level, and they decided to take the opportunity.” Branagh added: “The move to England felt at times like some kind of betrayal. The transformation from that very grounded Belfast le, with its comfortable and simple expectations, had a profound effect on me. “I feel that only now do I have a strong sense of who I am in the way that I did in Belfast. “Today I’m less conflicted and guilt-ridden. And, believe me, Jews and Catholics don’t have a monopoly on guilt. “The Protestant work ethic was branded on my forehead:you are fit and talented it is your duty to use it.” Heartfelt tribute to a city with spirit defiantly undimmedFILM REVIEW: BELFASTBy Joanne SavageThis superbly directed film, shot in elegant monochrome, is a nostalgic and fiercely affectionate paean to a city that shaped its director in his heart and soul. Buddy, played by the adorable and wide-eyed Jude Hill, is a double for the young Ken, who, while crushing on the smartest girl in his class, and simply wanting to enjoy trips to the cinema to see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and play in the street with a fake sword and a bin lid, struggles to understand why violence breaks out so suddenly and inexplicably, as he looks up with wonder at his Pa, played masterfully and with real sensitivity by Jamie Dornan, who refuses to be drawn into the persecution of his Catholic neighbours, and emerges as the moral centre of the piece, alongside Caitriona Balfe’s stoical and beautul Ma.Ciaran Hinds and Judi Dench are profoundly affecting as Buddy’s grandparents, full of earthy, Ulsterish wit and tenderness, even as the community outside their humble terraced abode becomes mired in internecine stre.The warmth and humour shared among the family at epicentre of the film stands in stark contrast to the street vigilantes who will no longer tolerate the Catholics among them.There is a wonderful moment where Popis helping Buddy with his maths homework. Pop, ailing in health, tells him to make his answers blurry, to keep the teacher guessing, he might get marked up or down, but does he want to impress his would-be classroom sweetheart or not  Still, Buddy wants to know the right answer. “If there were a right answer son, and we all knew it, would they be doing what they’re doing out there ” muses Pop. Some may find Branagh’s liberally applied doses of sugar to a narrative about the birth of Belfastian tragedy something of a sentimental gloss over the true horrors of , but actually what the much vaunted director achieves here is heroic and defiant: as those who chose violence raged, le still found a way, love triumphed over hatred in most homes and nothing could blot out the fundamental spirit of the right-thinking members of both communities. We’ve all seen gritty films about the Troubles that besieged Belfast, but what Branagh is really saying is that through the eyes of a young boy living with a loving family who protected him, it was still shot through with magic, wonder and people who did not care about who was Catholic or Protestant or neither.Certainly Dornan’s Pa tells Buddy that it doesn’t matterthe girl he loves is a “Catholic or a Hindu or a vegetarian Antichrist” because Everlasting Loveis a flame unextinguished, indeed, as Morrissey might say, a light that never goes out.RATING:  Belfast is in cinemas now."},{"url":"http://www.penarthtimes.co.uk/news/resources/images/13425364.jpg","title":"news","story":"As a subscriber, you are shown % less display advertising when reading our articles.Those ads you do see are predominantly from local businesses promoting local services.

To check the ground temperature, place the back of your hand on the ground. If its too hot to hold comfortably for five seconds, it’s too hot for dogs’ paws..remove• Practise basic, reward-based training when out and about to help your dog to maintain focus and engagement on walks.• Recall is also an area that needs particular attention. Evenyour dog has a great recall at home, its not something that can be guaranteed in unfamiliar environments with exciting new distractions. Games with toys are a fantastic way to help your dog engage with you when there are other distractions around. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.

These adverts enable local businesses to get in front of their target audience – the local communityThe shadow levelling up secretary said the Government’s approach is “downright insulting”, adding that the White Paper “frankly doesn’t appear to be worth the paper that it’s written on”.Wolverhampton and Sheffield will be the first of  areas selected to benefit from a “radical new regeneration programme” launched by the Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities .The chosen locations will be prioritised for a £. billion Brownfield Fund made available from April .Pressed on where the money is coming from, the department claried to the PA news agency that the cash to fund the work was allocated by the Treasury last year.It is part of a £. billion sum for brownfield regeneration promised by Chancellor Rishi Sunak at the last Budget.Ms Nandy told Sky News’s Trevor Phillips on Sunday: “We welcome the small pots of money that have been announced for  places today that’s a small refund on the amount that we’ve lost since the Prime Minister took office, and I think those  places will be glad to have any penny back that they can get, because any penny counts.“But I think there is a profound sense that the Government has really missed the point with the very small beer that they’ve given us this morning. They’ve got to get money back into people’s pockets.“Right across this country, town centres are not thriving, high streets are falling apart because not only have we seen good wages, good jobs, depart from many parts of the country over recent decades, it’s been turbo-charged in the last  years and right now energy bills are going up, shopping prices are sky high and people are about to face a tax hike.”Ms Nandy branded the plans “regeneration on the cheap”.She told Times Radio: “King’s Cross-style regeneration they’re calling it, but King’s Cross cost £ billion to redevelop, the Government’s stake in it alone was worth more than three times as much as the money that has been allocated to a few parts of the country this morning..remove“Essentially what they’re saying is you can do regeneration on the cheap while welarge sums of your money into one very small corner of the country.“That’s not just missing the point actually, that’s downright insulting to people who have a contribution to make, who have huge ambition for their communities, but are watching their town centres fall apart and their young people have to get out in order to get on.”The work will be spearheaded by the Government’s housing agency Homes England, which will be “refocused” to deliver on the levelling-up agenda.The DHLUC said the areas will benefit from developments combining “housing, leisure, and business in sustainable, walkable, beautul new neighbourhoods”.At the last Budget in October , Mr Sunak announced an extra £. billion to bring , hectares of brownfield land into use.The DLUHC said the newly-available £. billion Brownfield Fund will form part of this allowance.Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove said earlier: “This huge investment in infrastructure and regeneration will spread opportunity more evenly and help to reverse the geographical inequalities which still exist in the UK.”A separate £. billion Levelling Up Home Building Fund will also be launched next week.It will provide loans to small and medium-sized builders and developers to deliver , homes, with the vast majority going outside London and the South East.The DHLUC said the cash for this fund was first announced in .Meanwhile, the department has announced seven Mayoral Combined Authoritieswhich are set to benefit from £ million of funding “to transform derelict brownfield sites into vibrant places where people want to live and work”.The seven MCAs – West Midlands, Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire, Liverpool, South Yorkshire, North of Tyne, and Tees Valley – stand to gain , homes, the DHLUC said.The department added that, as with the £. billion Brownfield Fund, this £ million pot formed part of the £. billion sum pledged by Mr Sunak last year..push,i[r].l*new Dateas,ms[]a.asynca.srcgmgagagagagagagagagagaga, title: Regeneration  ulevelling up u funding is  uvery small beer u  u Labour article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log  s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentComments: Our rulesWe want our comments to be a lively and valuable part of our community - a place where readers can debate and engage with the most important local issues.
