Posh spice is making a comeback!?\u0027A third also posted: \u0027Maybe VB could return tonight??\u0027 while one excited fan replied: \u0027She\u0027s gonna come on tonight!\u0027  "},{"url":null,"title":"Britain Cubas staunchest ally Labour win power says John McDonnell","story":"Share this article Founded after a revolution led by Fidel Castro, Cuba has been a Marxist-Leninist one-party state since 1959 and Castro’s brother Raul took over as President in 2008 until last year.And addressing Cuba’s ambassador to London, Teresita Vicente Sotolongo, at the Rail and Maritime Transport Union’s Cuba Garden Party, Mr McDonnell said: ‘When the Election comes and I believe when a Labour government is elected, not if, we will be your staunchest allies to support the Cuban revolution. That means political support but it means also support, financial and on trade, to ensure that we prevent any attacks on Cuba that Trump may launch, economically or politically, or any other form. We stand with you comrades.’         The news came on the same day that Mr Trump banned US cruise ships from calling at the island state, to ‘keep US dollars out of the hands of Cuban military, intelligence and security services’, according to US Treasury Secretary Steven MnuchinHis speech was greeted with rapturous applause from the 200-strong crowd before Mr McDonnell posed for pictures for one of Cuba’s tightly controlled newspapers as attendees chanted ‘Viva Cuba’ and ‘Viva socialismo’.The event, held at the headquarters of the RMT, one of the most militant and Left-wing trade unions in Britain, saw delegates waving Cuban flags while a Cuban flag also flew from a pole atop the building. Guests at the event in Clapham, South London, enjoyed a free bar, a hog roast and even indulged in Havana cigars at £10 each, as well as music from a Cuban salsa band and the raffle prize was two return air tickets to Cuba.The speech came just two weeks after Mr McDonnell distanced himself from the Cuban regime, claiming ‘it was never socialism’ in an interview with The Times.His speech at the RMT HQ drew fierce criticism, with Conservative MP Andrew Lewer saying: ‘It is shocking that Mr McDonnell is promising British taxpayers’ support to the failed Cuban communist dictatorship, which locks up its political opponents and whose repressed people do not even have enough food to eat.’Dr Julian Lewis MP, chairman of the Defence Select Committee added: ‘With John McDonnell, as with Jeremy Corbyn, what you see is what you will get.’He added: ‘They have always held these pro-Marxist views and they always will.’"},{"url":null,"title":"Four Rochdale grooming gang members Britain","story":"Share this article Maggie Oliver, the detective who resigned from Greater Manchester Police and turned whistle-blower over the botched Rochdale inquiry, said: \u0027It doesn\u0027t surprise me they won\u0027t be straight with their answers after all this time because they don\u0027t want a public backlash.\u0027Ultimately the truth does have a way of coming out.

Theresa May, who was Home Secretary when the men were jailed said the four dual citizens should be deportedAt a previous hearing, judges noted the decision to strip an inidual of UK citizenship, called a deprivation order, does not automatically lead to deportation order.They said it was \u0027reasonable to assume\u0027, however, that a deprivation order is a prelude to a deportation.Lawyers said it is probable the four will invoke the European Convention on Human Rights to argue their right to a family life would be impinged if they were removed from the UK.Ms Oliver added: \u0027Once you commit these horrific offences your human rights should come second.\u0027It makes me really angry and it\u0027s really upsetting whey you think what they have done that they even have any rights.\u0027Former taxi driver Aziz, a father-of-three, regularly took his young victim to different flats around Rochdale, where she was plied with cannabis and vodka and coerced into sex with men who paid him cash.Referred to as \u0027The Master\u0027 by the gang, he played a \u0027leading role\u0027 in the grooming.Jailed for nine years in May 2012, he was released in December 2015 after serving three years and seven months.Rauf, a father-of-five, trafficked a 15-year-old girl for sex, driving her to secluded areas to have sex with her in his taxi and ferry her to a flat in Rochdale where he and others had sex with her.He was jailed for six years and released in November 2014 after serving two years and six months of his sentence.A neighbour told the Press Association he has a night-time driving job.Khan got a girl, 13, pregnant but denied he was the father then met another girl, 15, and trafficked her to others using violence when she complained.He was sentenced to eight years, released in 2016 and was last known to be living in Manchester.For two years from early 2008, girls as young as 12 were plied with alcohol and drugs and gang-raped in rooms above takeaway shops and ferried to different flats in taxis where cash was paid to use the girls.Police said as many as 47 girls were groomed.Nazir Afzal, the lawyer credited with pursuing the groomers, overturning an earlier decision not to prosecute, said: \u0027I am concerned that despite the efforts that have been made to ensure they are no longer a threat to women and girls in this country, that they remain in this country and the process continues and is prolonged.\u0027Billy Howarth, founder of Parents Against Grooming UK in Rochdale, said: \u0027We demand an explanation as to why they have not been deported.\u0027That was one of the promises, that these men would be removed from the country so they would not have to set eyes on them again.\u0027People are going mad over it, especially the people who live on the same streets with them.\u0027A spokeswoman for current Home Secretary, Rochdale-born Sajid Javid, has been approached for comment.A staff member at the office for Rochdale MP Tony Lloyd said no-one was available for comment."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ccd33e552bc3dd8e9a71f36fe2ed6e74ff69f72d/0_454_4463_2678/master/4463.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=21481d7dad12e70ad523d1b7143fb178","title":"the 20 photographs of the week","story":"The second anniversary of the Grenfell disaster, demonstrations in Hong Kong, the Women’s World Cup 2019 and the Appleby horse fair – the week captured by the world’s best photojournalists "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cfc069302c2b2414fceb112546d0a79e95d18a43/1154_1326_4124_2474/master/4124.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=76611af386ca7a9cd858e26047186ba9","title":"observer new review summer book clinic send us your questions","story":"Heading on holiday but no idea what to read?

When he or she helps someone undeserving of our humanity.In Arizona on 11 June, a jury was unable to reach a verdict on Scott Daniel Warren, a college lecturer accused of conspiracy to transport and harbour migrants after providing them with food and shelter. He faced up to 20 years in jail. He may still do if there’s a retrial.Meanwhile, in Sicily, Pia Klemp, the German captain of the boat Sea-Watch 3, was charged with assisting in illegal immigration after rescuing migrants in distress in the Mediterranean. She, too, faces up to 20 years in prison.Warren and Klemp are the latest victims of a disturbing trend that has gone almost unnoticed: the threat by the authorities on both sides of the Atlantic to put on trial anyone who provides rescue or humanitarian help for migrants.An investigation by the website openDemocracy suggests that over the past five years at least 250 people in 14 European countries have been arrested or charged for providing food, shelter, transport or other support to migrants without legal papers. Cases include Martine Landry, a 73-year-old Frenchwoman who helped two 15-year-old Guinean asylum seekers, taking them to a police station to register. She was charged with “having aided the entry of two foreign minors in an irregular situation”, but was eventually acquitted.Then there’s Dragan Umičević, a retired Croatian army officer and a volunteer with the organisation AYS, which provides help for refugees. In March last year, AYS was contacted by a group of Afghan refugees who had entered Croatia from Serbia. He, in turn, contacted the police and accompanied the refugees to the police station to help them with their asylum claims. Umičević was charged with aiding migrants by helping them across the border. The case fell apart when GPS data showed that he had always been on Croatian territory. Nevertheless, Umičević was found guilty of “unwitting negligence” and fined 60,000 kunas (around £7,000).Lise Ramslog, a 70-year-old Danish woman, was charged with people smuggling after giving a lift to the Swedish border to two young immigrant couples, with a small child and a newborn baby. She was fined 25,000 Danish krone (£3,000).There have been similar cases in America. Warren is a member of the faith-based humanitarian aid group No More Deaths. In January, four members were convicted of “abandoning personal property” in a wildlife refuge after they left water jugs in the desert to help migrants. “If giving water to someone dying of thirst is illegal,” said No More Deaths volunteer Catherine Gaffney, “what humanity is left in the law of this country?”In both Europe and America, the authorities claim that aid for migrants acts as a “pull factor”, increasing the numbers willing to risk a dangerous journey. The idea that someone treks across the Sahara, through war-torn Libya and into a rubber dinghy to brave a sea that has become the graveyard for at least 30,000 others attempting that same journey, on the off-chance that they might meet a rescue ship, or sets off on an arduous march through Central America and faces the perils of a life-sapping desert because they are convinced they will find a jug of water at the end, stretches credulity. Many studies have, indeed, shown that rescue ships on the Mediterranean do not increase numbers of migrants, but abandoning rescue attempts increases the number of deaths.The authorities are deliberately seeking to erase the distinction between people trafficking, human smuggling and acts of solidarity to suggest that providing food and water, or rescuing someone from drowning, is of the same character as coercing people across borders to exploit them as forced labour or sex workers. It’s a perversion of the legal system and a warping of our moral sensibility.It’s an approach that suggests that only certain kinds of people are deserving of humanitarian aid. Had Warren been helping Americans or Klemp rescuing Europeans, they would have been hailed as heroes. Their crime was to help the wrong kind of human beings – those wearing the wrong colour skin, believing in the wrong God, possessing the wrong passport or no passport at all.That’s an obscene moral standard and one that would be unacceptable in any other context. Yet so successful has been the anti-migrant agenda of recent years that there is barely a discussion of such practices. It’s important to resist the criminalisation of solidarity, not just to defend migrants’ rights but also because it is corrosive of civil society and, in the words of the lawyer Frances Webber, helps outlaw “decency itself”."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9969cc38899d37c7bb0c8cd30606fdff46d8bfa4/0_221_4734_2840/master/4734.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=131e847e0c06ec0e142e855d5bd6ac33","title":"last orders for working hours boozing we should drink to that","story":"Has working-hours drinking culture died or is it just slumped in an office lavatory cubicle, sleeping off a liquid lunch?I ask, because the London Metal Exchange has banned staff from drinking during working hours, just as Lloyds of London did in 2017. Which has to be good. (City traders, dealing in millions and billions, probably need to be sober? Discuss). Though maybe it’s yet another sign of the end of an era.The first thing to note is that drinking during working hours is totally different to socialising at night. Compared with daytime inebriation, drinking at night is amateur hour. Nor is this the European form, where nice, elegant people enjoy the subtle bouquet of a glass of merlot. I’m talking about people leaving work for “lunch”, drinking copiously, then returning to work, fully convinced of their competence. A quintessentially British phenomenon that I was surprised to discover wasn’t entirely confined to journalists and politicians. Arguably, what’s interesting isn’t that this culture is ending, rather, that it was ever allowed to begin.The key to understanding the day-drinking personality is to ignore their actual job and realise that inside, where it matters (maaan!), they are bohemians refusing to bow to societal convention. Think: Charles Bukowski meets Hunter S Thompson with a whiff of The Likely Lads – in certain circles, teamed with an exclusionary boys’ club mentality.It’s not only men who are guilty of macho showboating over who can drink the most for the longest. While I never regretted my daytime drinking, other people did on my behalf. That’s the other thing about working-hours drinkers – most of us are royal pains in the arse.However, it’s not all bad news. Without wishing to glorify dysfunctional daytime drinking (which can lead to serious problems with alcohol), the reason it kept happening was because it could be fun, sometimes even strangely creative and productive. One of the problems with any kind of drinking in the day is that there’s no natural break for sleeping, unless you’re resourceful (see previous point about lavatory cubicles), which meant that days often morphed into endless, nightmarish, gonzo road-movies. There’s also the fact that, for some, daylight drinking boosts the impact of alcohol.What stopped my daytime drinking is what stops most people – ageing. I couldn’t hack it any more. However, that flags another key change. Traditionally, there would be a new younger generation of working-hours drinkers, proudly returning pissed to the office on behalf of all those who couldn’t any more. Instead, increasingly, you hear about young people shirking alcohol. Or workplaces banning it.With the odd pocket of resistance, perhaps the culture of working-hours drinking truly is dying out. Time was, life was too serious not to have a drink. Now, it’s too serious to have one.How long do you think it would take to master the intricacies of being royal? I pondered this, as a bizarre video clip emerged of Prince Harry appearing to snap at his wife, Meghan Markle, as they stood on the balcony with the rest of the royal family during the recent trooping the colour. Unless my imagination is running away with me, Harry appears to be, not asking, but ordering (yes, you read right, ordering) his wife to “turn around”. It’s not what’s said, it’s the brusque, cold way it’s done. When Markle turns around, she appears chastened and a little upset.Could a royal aide please help Harry – his mask appears to have slipped. OK, maybe that’s a bit much, but still, this was disquieting. Markle gave birth a matter of weeks ago – she, if anyone, should be the one who’s entitled to snap. Obviously, she needed to turn the right way, especially as the national anthem was about to play. However, you’d have thought she had rocked up in a bikini, smoking a spliff, making peace signs, to warrant such treatment – not committed the great crime of turning to speak to her husband for all of two seconds.Give her credit – she always seems to try her best with royal duties. She’s even submitted to being dressed in weird stiff, dowdy outfits as though she’s trapped permanently in some existential royal racing enclosure sponsored by Fenn Wright Manson. Of course trooping the colour is important, but whatever she (briefly) did “wrong” on the balcony, it was clearly not intentionally disrespectful. It’s the royal attitude that’s at fault here. Harry and other born-and-bred royals should realise they’ve had a lifetime to master deportment and protocol and, even then, they’ve frequently screwed up. Nazi fancy-dress outfits, anyone?Oh, the irony of anybody deriding the former shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna for being some kind of scheming careerist for joining the Liberal Democrats. I mean, seriously? Change UK performed poorly at the European elections, so Umunna decided to join the Lib Dems.In the past, he has criticised them for forming a coalition with the Tories, but then, who didn’t? The party deserved to be criticised then, just as it deserves to be supported now. Situations evolve. Get over it.As for Umunna being labelled a careerist, the truth seems to be quite the opposite. His Labour party career was shredded from the moment he refused to go along with Corbynmania. There were threats of deselection. Then, of course, there is Brexit: far from being unprincipled and conniving, Umunna refused to follow the Labour party line of manipulative fence-sitting, game-playing and taking Remain votes for granted, a stance sure to get Labour ked severely in the next general election.Where’s the careerism in any of this? It seems to me that a true careerist would have kept his mouth shut, his head down and been able to stay in the Labour party. Instead, Umunna had the courage to rebel, leave and take a wholehearted stand for Remain. I, for one, appreciate and applaud him."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2045ae2ab7007a041358734afb15795f7ce66124/111_26_3376_2026/master/3376.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=4a954786adbe104e3ad662c2a2545348","title":"the observer view on the conservative leadership campaign","story":"Those hoping to succeed May are offering nothing but foolish promises and even greater inequalityFor three years now, one imperative above all else has shaped the government’s approach to Brexit. Not the essential task of healing a ided nation, or the critical need to negotiate in the nation’s long-term strategic interest, but Theresa May’s increasingly desperate attempts to keep her party’s hardline Eurosceptics onside.The end of May’s leadership of the Conservative party has not marked the end of this period in which Tory splits, rather than the national interest, have driven the governing party’s approach to the most important question postwar Britain has faced. On the contrary, it has moved into an even more toxic phase. Brexit may be dominating the race to succeed her, but even those leadership candidates who are subjecting themselves to the scrutiny of media interviews and lengthy question-and-answer sessions are not engaged in a conversation with the British public. Despite the fact they are competing to be Britain’s next prime minister, the rules of the leadership selection process mean they are immersed in a far more insular dialogue – with the tiny proportion of the electorate who are members of the Conservative party. Just as May refused to level with the public about the painful tradeoffs involved in Brexit, instead churning out disingenuous platitudes to appease the fanatic Eurosceptics in her party, most of those engaged in the race to succeed her are saying precisely what they think Conservative party members will want to hear.So, as the clock ticks down to 31 October, the political conversation about Brexit is playing out in a bubble wholly removed from reality. Those hoping to succeed May are simply pretending that the constraints she operated under will magically evaporate once they move into Number 10. Despite Jean-Claude Juncker reiterating last week that there is no scope to reopen the withdrawal agreement, five out of the six remaining candidates say their preferred outcome is a renegotiated withdrawal agreement that removes the backstop. Those same five candidates have refused to rule out a catastrophic no-deal outcome, while one, Dominic Raab, has said that if necessary he would prorogue parliament to prevent it blocking Britain from leaving with no deal.What this means is that, come late July, Britain will in all likelihood have a prime minister who has promised colleagues he can in a few short weeks extract major concessions from the EU that May failed to over a period of months and who may very well be willing to crash Britain out of the EU without a deal. This would make the role of parliament absolutely pivotal. But last week, MPs wasted a crucial opportunity to seize control of the parliamentary agenda in order to try to prevent a no-deal scenario. There were enough Conservative rebels who voted for the motion to pass, were it not for eight Labour MPs who voted against their party’s motion. If Britain ends up leaving without a deal, which will be to the greatest detriment of the least affluent areas of the nation, a heavy burden should weigh on their consciences.Beyond Brexit, the leadership candidates have had nothing to say in terms of a positive vision for the country. They have revealed worryingly little detail about their policy platforms, although it is revealing that the key ground over which they have chosen to compete is on tax cuts.Austerity was a political choice spearheaded by David Cameron and George Osborne and later enthusiastically embraced by May. As successive Tory chancellors have delivered tax cuts worth billions of pounds a year to businesses and more affluent households, public services have been starved of cash and tax credits and benefits for low-income families with children have been slashed, leaving some thousands of pounds a year worse off.It is also an utter indictment on the state of the modern Conservative party that Boris Johnson should, after the first round of voting by MPs, be so far in the lead. It is a mark of desperation that so many MPs are rallying around a candidate with such an appalling track record as foreign secretary who fronted false assertions on behalf of the Leave campaign, including the misleading claim that leaving the EU would free up £350m a week to spend on the NHS, and stoking fears that Turkey was about to join the EU, which he has since lied about doing. That Tory MPs should view someone of such feeble character a potential electoral lifeline speaks volumes about the party’s medium-term prospects.There is no hope of Brexit getting resolved through an insular leadership contest in which candidates are making foolish promises to a tiny, unrepresentative slice of the electorate. Labour must unreservedly throw its support behind a referendum on any Brexit deal and forge a path towards it. The country’s future must not be allowed to lie in the hands of 160,000 disproportionately Eurosceptic, affluent and rightwing Conservative members. Only Labour is in a position to ensure that all voters get their right to have a say."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7bb5185db0fdd183cf334588de321062b5cbbb6e/261_60_3110_1865/master/3110.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2eca204110294df846c3916c1cbf5b76","title":"the observer view on the tory vendetta against bbc","story":"Rather than attacking the broadcaster, they should take responsibility for pensioners’ licencesThe Conservative right has become the enemy within, a force bent on destroying not only our relationship with Europe but with much else that this country holds dear. The shredding of collective bargaining and the ambition to excuse our privatised utilities from their public-interest obligations were early objectives. Now there is Brexit. Next is the undermining of the BBC, along with the steady erosion of the NHS and the criminal justice system. The barbarians have stormed the gate in a libertarian assault on Britain’s public institutions.The BBC is a longstanding target for their venom. Then chancellor George Osborne’s decision in 2015, conceived without consultation, to force it to shoulder the £750m annual cost of offering free BBC licence fees to the over-75s – turning an independent BBC into an arm of the Department for Work and Pensions – was a disgrace. It appeared to be part of his campaign to curry favour with the Tory right and show that even if he was a Remainer he was a fellow rightist at heart. The BBC board should have resigned en bloc.But it did not want to raise the stakes so high, preferring to take the path of least resistance, rescuing what it could. Last week, the chickens came home to roost. The corporation announced, after a consultation with 190,000 people, that it could only afford to continue to offer the concession to a third of the age group, the very poorest who receive pension credit. To find the £500m extra to sustain the concession to all over-75s would have implied making swingeing reductions to some of what BBC viewers and listeners regard as most precious: its radio services, its regional infrastructure, BBC2 and 4. Instead, it believes its current efficiency drive can allow it just to square the circle – meet its imposed obligations, if only to a third of the over-75s, and preserve the services to which they and its wider audiences are so attached.The enemy within went into attack mode immediately. No Tory leadership candidate who wants to win the votes of its Tory pensioner activists can back the BBC. The Daily  and Daily Mail went into overdrive. A week after the D-Day anniversary, this anti-British institution, they declared, anxious to protect its overpaid presenters, managers and lush pensions, had obliged hard-pressed over-75s – veterans – to find £154 a year out of their stagnant incomes. This bloated liberal institution, home to Remain Britain, should be forced to pay for the pensioners’ TV licence, cutting the pay of its well–heeled staff to find the funds.Facts did not intrude into this argument: if every BBC presenter and manager earned no more than £150,000, well below the salaries of their tormentors and the £275,000 Boris Johnson gets for his Daily  column, the BBC would save no more than £20m. Unhappily for its critics, because the BBC discloses the pay of its highly paid employees – and its wider workforce – more comprehensively and transparently than any other British organisation, it can prove its point.The greater truth is that it is being asked to find savings that represents a rounding error in Britain’s £700bn a year of public spending for no other reason than the enemy within want to shrink it still further out of ideological conviction. It is already a quarter smaller in real terms than in was in 2010, besieged by behemoths like Netflix, Liberty Global and Fox, none of which cares a fig for British over-75s.Britain’s pensioners deserve and want a BBC worth listening to and watching, that continues to embody the best of British values and culture, anchoring our national creativity, which overseas broadcasters want to milk rather than nurture. If we want to make the societal choice that the over-75s get their licence fee free, then society should pay for it and the settlement should not be behind closed doors as a result of a Tory vendetta. Most importantly, we need politicians with the stature and popular following to take on the conservative enemy within."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/17083978746ea7bd72227d40a36d399ca4cdffdc/3185_930_1769_1062/master/1769.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=da2a4a6abf1f2a45de0a32ccbbc963c7","title":"on my radar yinka ilori designer colour palace","story":"Designer Yinka Ilori was born in east London in 1987 to British-Nigerian parents and studied furniture and product design at London politan University. His work draws inspiration from the Nigerian parables and African fabrics of his childhood. For the second Dulwich Pavilion, Ilori has collaborated with the architecture practice Pricegore to create The Colour Palace, a bright, patterned structure in the grounds of Dulwich Picture Gallery, London SE21, until 22 September.I’ve been a fan of Dave for a while and I’ve been playing his debut album Psychodrama day in, day out since it was released in March – it keeps me gripped from start to finish. Dave is a very intelligent young rapper from south London, just 21, with a gift for storytelling. On the album, he talks about really relevant things like depression and mental and physical abuse. It’s good to see someone with a major platform – Psychodrama went to No 1 in the UK – using his voice in a conscious way. And he can make you dance too, with tracks such as Location, featuring Burna Boy. I just love what he does.I finished this four-part Netflix series a few days ago and it left me in tears. It’s a drama about the Central Park Five, a group of black kids who were falsely accused of raping a white woman in New York in 1989. The police forced them to admit to a crime that they didn’t commit and they ended up spending up to 13 years in prison. In 2002, the real culprit confessed to the rape and their names were eventually cleared. It’s a really sad and emotive series, brilliantly directed by Ava DuVernay, which shows how corrupt and racist the whole system was – and still is. I’d be shocked if anyone watching it doesn’t shed a tear.The Colour Palace, the pavilion I co-designed for the Dulwich Picture Gallery, is very much inspired by my visits to Nigeria – I go over five or six times a year – and in particular markets in Lagos, such as Balogun. Imagine Portobello market, but 10 times the length, in 40C heat, with blazing colours everywhere and huge crowds filling the streets. It sells everything fabric-related – Nigerian lace, Dutch wax prints, aso-oke – and it’s really beautiful. Nigeria is a very expressive country and the way people dress is a big part of that, so clothes and fabrics are important.I’ve been to this modern west African restaurant in central London a few times recently and I really like it. They’re experimenting with traditional Nigerian dishes such as jollof rice and suya and finding new and interesting ways of presenting them. Visually, the dishes are really exciting: for one starter, a fried slice of plantain is dipped in raspberry dust and served on a black plate with a white Scotch bonnet sauce. It’s all very beautifully displayed, but delicious too. The interiors are great as well, and there’s a nice ambience: it all makes sense. If I could afford it, I’d eat there every day.I designed the cover of this book, which is a rallying-cry for dreamers. It’s written as a poem in the form of a letter and it says that no matter how young or old you are, it’s OK to dream, and you should hold on to your dreams and never let them go. Jason Reynolds is an American author who writes mostly for a younger audience, but this book is for people of all ages. It’s very easy to read, and that’s the beauty of it. It gives you energy to be what you want to be and keep going, no matter how big your dream is.A friend of mine invited me to the annual Poetry Slam final at the Roundhouse a couple of weeks ago. I’d been to rap battles before, but this was my first time going to a poetry event and I’m so glad I went. It’s an open-mic affair with 12 poets on stage doing two rounds of poems each. The standard was really high and the guy who won, Kareem Parkins-Brown, really made me laugh – his winning poem was very funny on gentrification, but with a serious point. It was an incredible evening. I’ll be going to a lot more poetry events from now on."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de35b4fb7de02f4129f49c906334a451a85169d6/0_495_7350_4410/master/7350.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1270266831fdac3cf9eb08ebbc925633","title":"the rise of the conscious consumer how to shop responsibly","story":"The way we shop is changing for the better, helped by a new breed of independent brands and carefully curated retail destinations, such as Coal Drops Yard, providing a thoughtful, ethical approach to consumptionWhen it comes to shopping, sustainability has never been more front and centre in our minds – from Adidas committing to using only recycled plastic by 2024 to Elle magazine dedicating last year’s September issue to sustainable fashion, and the ’s associate fashion editor Jess Cartner-Morley stating: “I’m going to change what I wear and what I write about”. Garment production has doubled in the past 15 years, with £140m worth of clothes a year ending up in landfill – and it’s a situation shoppers are very mindful of.And, in these times of digital overload, we’re rediscovering the joy of a bricks-and-mortar experience. Forward-thinking new retail districts are reimagining the traditional high street, putting an emphasis on storytelling and craftsmanship with stores for customers to spend time in. Coal Drops Yard is one such destination. As the name suggests, the warren of Victorian brick viaducts was originally built to house coal. In the 1990s, the warehouses became a new home for the clubbing scene, and now the area has reinvented itself once again as London’s most progressive shopping and restaurant district, home to a new crop of fashion and lifestyle brands encouraging shoppers to practise a more mindful kind of consumption.Tracey Neuls, a cult footwear designer who has been producing handmade shoes for the past 19 years, is just one example of a craftsperson pushing for conscious consumption. Each new design is sculpted by Neuls in clay, then produced by a Portuguese atelier using Italian leather from ethical tanneries. In her Coal Drops Yard boutique, shoes hang from the ceiling on ribbons, to be admired and encircled like mini works of art.“The rise in disposable fashion is having a wonderful knock-on effect of creating a new shopper who is more interested in quality than quantity,” explains Neuls. “Excess and choice are being replaced by emotive purchases that people intend to have around for years. We have customers who have described our shoes that they bought some 10 years ago as if they were talking about their pets – with the same attachment and love.”Neuls’ philosophy is shared by her Coal Drops Yard neighbour, leather goods brand LPOL. Founded by husband and wife team Katy Bell and John Maskell, they put responsible material sourcing and zero waste at the centre of everything they do. “As designers, we’re concerned with three things: fabric, form and function,” they explain. “The sole aim is to combine them effortlessly, sustainably and desirably in the best traditions and progression of our craft.”Meanwhile, clothes that haven’t found such long-term relationships (yet) are welcomed at Boutique by Shelter, where secondhand garments get a new lease of life. Furnished with salvaged materials and stocked with a covetable pick-and-mix of designer, high street and vintage donations, all at a fraction of the original price. But the store’s appeal goes far beyond bargains – it’s a community hub, a volunteering scheme, a source of vital funds to end homelessness and a way to tackle fashion’s waste problem.The new wave of conscious consumption doesn’t only mean caring for the planet it’s about the human impact, too, supporting businesses that strive to do good on both sides of the counter, and this is reflected in Coal Drop Yard’s retailers. Form\u0026ampThread champions fair pay for its factory workers Beija London strives to make more inclusive underwear, designed for women of all sizes with comfort and empowerment at heart and design practice and community space STORE Store addresses social imbalance within art, design and architecture by hosting creative courses for the general public, with a special focus on creating new opportunities for young people from disadvantaged backgrounds.Trying harder is something we could surely all be doing. But while responsible shopping is just that – a responsibility, to do our due diligence and look a little harder at our habits – it’s not to say it shouldn’t be a pleasure, too. Neuls feels that the secret to more conscious shopping is foregoing trends and following your instinct. “If you shop with the view to invest in footwear that doesn’t go out of fashion, that makes you feel confident and makes you smile, then you are on the right track,” she says. And that’s an emotional investment as much as a financial one.In fact, most sustainability champions agree that it’s positivity – not guilt, shame or scary statistics – that drives the best trade. Make people feel bad about themselves, and they seek solace in a high street binge. But make us feel good about ourselves, and we’ll make good choices. The Coal Drops Yard approach might just be the future of shopping – do it slowly, and do it in style.To find out more about Coal Drops Yard’s carefully curated offerings, head to coaldropsyardshop-eat-drink"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c34e225c6f1c137c3e5a6b042f8fe6701555058d/0_56_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=18abbecd3cdfcac60f30ace2eb1a4d65","title":"a level maths paper leaked online before exam","story":"Exam board Edexcel launches investigation after Twitter post offers full paper for £70An investigation has been launched after an A-level maths paper was circulated online before the exam.Images of the test paper by Edexcel appeared on social media on Thursday afternoon. The exam board’s parent company, Pearson, said the images “were circulated in a very limited way” before students sat the exam on Friday.“Having visited a small group of centres within scope of the investigation, we have identified one centre in serious breach of correct practice,” the firm said.“All students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.”Two questions from the paper first appeared on Twitter in a since-deleted post which offered students the whole paper for £70.It is not the first time Pearson has had maths papers leaked. Last year, an A-level maths paper apparently appeared for sale online the night before thousands of students sat the exam.The company was also forced to make last-minute changes to two A-level papers in 2017 after receiving reports that some students had gained access to them in advance.Both leaks were investigated by the police, with evidence passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought.In April, it was revealed that Pearson would pilot a scheme in which exam papers would be microchipped to track the date, time and location of each bundle.An online petition calling for the exam board to take the leak into consideration when it set grade boundaries has been signed by hundreds of students.The petition’s creator, Jenny Li, described the situation as “very unfair” for students who had not seen the paper before the exam.A student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4’s Today programme he was “frustrated” by the leak.“I’m not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper it wasn’t that kind of frustration,” he said.“It’s more the frustration that I’ve spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students through some sort of opportunity could have not learned anything for two years – and just spent £70 and got an A-level.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/93164e80a161c5a9dd31a1ab91d80e75c2dceadb/0_191_5710_3426/master/5710.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6244e24a5343704ccbf8e321d437c962","title":"oxford dean faces secret tribunal martyn percy","story":"A retired high court judge will preside over a hearing into allegations of “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful” conduct by the dean of Christ Church, Oxford, which are believed to relate to a dispute over pay and governance at the ancient college.Sir Andrew Smith will assess claims made against the Very Rev Martyn Percy, suspended from his job since last September. The hearing, to be held in private, is expected to last eight days and is estimated to cost at least £500,000.Although details of the complaints against Percy have not been disclosed, the college told alumni in a letter in January that the row related to pay. Percy, who has not commented on the dispute, is believed to earn about £90,000 a year plus accommodation and generous perks – relatively low compared with other college heads.Percy also heads Christ Church cathedral. He has strong support from within the Church of England and from some Oxford college heads, but a group within Christ Church’s governing body is thought to be firmly opposed to his efforts at modernisation. The Charity Commission, which has oversight of Christ Church and other Oxford colleges, has said it was aware of “issues around the governance and leadership” at the college. Christ Church, founded by Henry VIII in 1546, is the alma mater of 13 British prime ministers, 10 chancellors of the exchequer and 17 archbishops. It is one of Oxford’s richest colleges, with funds of more than £500m. Percy has been dean since 2014.Under the college’s statutes, there are limited circumstances in which the dean can be removed. These include persistent failure or neglect of duties being convicted of an offence that renders the dean unfit for office physical or mental incapacity and behaviour of an “immoral, scandalous or disgraceful nature”.Percy’s supporters are furious such inflammatory wording was allowed to circulate for months before the college clarified it did not relate to personal or sexual impropriety. “Christ Church has allowed this whole dispute to be blown wildly out of proportion,” said the head of another college. “Oxford colleges are an idiosyncratic and odd world, but it’s very stupid to allow Christ Church to be paralysed for almost a year.”The college said in a statement: “An independent tribunal will be conducted to investigate a complaint against the conduct of the dean of Christ Church. As this is an ongoing legal matter, we are not able to offer any further comment.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea9a7948e558384b0cd94fffab1ca0e1daab8ad0/0_24_2400_1440/master/2400.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=c86a7bbe08fd672b1b4696e4539da77d","title":"marni designer francesco risso shows his humanistic side","story":"Short of calling his collection sustainable, the creative director makes clear his view of plastics and wasteIt took four days of Italian menswear shows – between the Pitti Uomo showcase in Florence and the fashion capital Milan – for a household-name brand to use its precious moment on the world stage to engage in the conversation about the ethical context in which fashion exists right now.At the Marni springsummer 2020 show on Saturday afternoon, creative director Francesco Risso had the audience stand shoulder to shoulder, rather than sit, under a suspended ceiling of backlit, disregarded plastic waste. His team at the Italian fashion house have spent months sourcing from industrial sources and the oceans. Imposing and strikingly beautiful, it was to reflect “the weight of this plastic that we’re feeling right now”, he told the press post-show. This being the first of “two acts”, the waste will be recycled into a new collection, in collaboration with the artist Judith Hopf, for a second next season.The collection was anything but a nightmare – on the contrary, it was a celebration. The marriage of Truman Capote and Ernesto ‘Che’ Guevara to be precise, and accordingly everyone had a party hat. Risso collaborated with the artist Shalva Nikvashvili – who used discarded furs, leathers and rubbish to make “the wedding hats” which came stapled together. However, like many designers faced with scrutiny over supply and production chains, he is wary of coining it sustainable.Like Clare Waight Keller’s headlining Givenchy show three days before him in Florence, Risso worked with opposing ideas to create this collection. It was “a study in clashes, and the uneven harmony that ensues by mixing opposite worlds, jumbling it all together”, read the show notes.Plaid patterns and block prints mingled in the artsy, haphazard way that has become Marni’s calling card suiting and trousers were split with contrasting fabric and hybrid waistlines and the classic camo motifs that came on boilersuits, neckerchiefs and lacerated army jackets were jolted by an explosion of colour which Risso said was inspired by the Fauves. In his own words it was “camo versus carnival”.Risso didn’t want the takeaway to be political “it has nothing to do with politics,” he insisted – preferring to frame it in a humanistic context, but it was hard to take away anything but. “It’s more humanistic,” he explained. “We wish politics was more involved with human rights and goodness but it’s not, so it’s us that has to take a stand. Everyone has to do it in their own steps and little by little.”It was better for it. Fashion, and the Milan fashion week schedule particularly, has designers like this to thank for injecting relevance and integrity. This is a brand whose raison d’etre has always been rooted in reality, a sartorial vehicle for offering commentary on pop culture, art and world at large. It’s a brand that attracts people who know the difference between great design and a gimmick and want to walk the walk, rather than just talk the talk.Risso, 36, who has designed womenswear and menswear for the OTB-owned house for three years to critical acclaim, is speaking for everyone who wants fashion to be intelligent and involved, and should be commended for not shying away from the conversation."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6df9df23ad36e40ec07c26550ec996edd56999d0/0_649_3243_1946/master/3243.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=22ba13d5a6c111a668790cf871c25466","title":"full blown florals","story":"This summer’s dress is big, bold and hot blooded.

Hence today’s recipe, which adopts the currants, olive oil, pine nuts and bread of the prototype, but is in every other way different. Still, if we have anything to learn from all this, it is that where there is travel, there is inspiration, and where there is bread, make bread salad.Prep 10 minCook 20 minServes 4 as a starter or side dish150g kale, big ribs removed, roughly chopped3 tbsp black olive tapenade – I like Belazu’s200g focaccia, cut into 15mm x 15mm chunks3 large garlic cloves, peeled and minced1 lemon, quartered into four wedges3 tbsp pine nuts3 tbsp currants6 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to serve3 sticks celerySaltHeat the oven to 200C (180C fan)390Fgas 6. Throw the kale and tapenade into a food processor and pulse to smithereens.

Drizzle over three tablespoons of oil and toss with your hands to coat. Tip out on to a baking tray so it sits in a single layer (keep the bowl to one side) and roast for 10 minutes, until the bread and pine nuts are golden – check after five minutes to make sure they’re not burning.While the bread is roasting, finely slice the celery and put it in the reserved bowl with the kale and tapenade mixture.Once the bread is golden, take the tray out of the oven and add everything except the lemon wedges to the bowl. When they’re cool enough to handle, squeeze the juice from two of the wedges over the salad, drizzle over three more tablespoons of oil and add a half teaspoon of salt, or to taste. Mix, mix, mix with your hands, until the bread soaks up some of the surrounding flavours, then taste again, adding a little more roast lemon juice or salt, if you like.

But who’d be handiest with a Primus stove?The Conservative leadership election, which, even since the 1922 Committee changed the rules, still has about eight gruelling years to run, is mitigated for me (admittedly, only slightly) by the prospect that we may yet get to nosy around a few more political kitchens. As I write, only Dominic “I am not a feminist” Raab has let us into his: an eerily pristine pastel number that brought to mind the set of a low-rent farce in a theatre where the budget is too small for decent props. But if the other candidates behave as politicians tend to do at these moments – from Thatcher on, they’ve never been able to resist the temptation to try and make themselves look “ordinary” (ie non-weird) by being seen to do a vigorous spot of washing up – it’s possible that by the time you read this, we will at last know whether Andrea Leadsom ever did splash out on her very own pizza oven (“Look, Laura, this mozzarella is actually from Hampshire …”).The kitchen on which I most longed to feast my eyes in the run-up to the MPs’ vote was that of Rory Stewart, speaker of shopping-centre Dari and international adventurer extraordinaire. What can it be like, I wonder? I picture the kitchen-parlour at Dove Cottage in Grasmere: gloomy, low-ceilinged and all but dominated by the kind of temperamental range on which Dorothy Wordsworth once baked mutton pies (Stewart is the MP for Penrith and the Border, not far away he’s also known for his fondness for memorising poetry by heart). But perhaps this isn’t hardcore enough. Maybe Rory likes to cook on a Primus stove when he’s up north – or maybe he has dug a fire pit, over which a whole lamb might be spit-roasted. Such a thing could come in handy should the members of the Penrith Conservative Association ever try to deselect him.Or what about – my imagination’s really running wild now – the haybox, an improvised bit of kit that is both green and very gung-ho make-do-and-mend? (In case you’re wondering, preheated food is wrapped in hay, an insulating layer that enables it to continue slowly to cook). Stewart does bring to mind a certain kind of movie star – a little bit Valentino as Lawrence of Arabia a little bit Richard E Grant as Withnail – and now I think about it, I recall that Alec Guinness was keen on hayboxes. His long-suffering wife Merula once revealed to a house guest that, unable to lay her hands on any hay, she’d used a load of Alec’s old underpants instead (the resulting osso bucco, according to the same guest, was somewhat underwhelming).Either way, I don’t imagine there are great cairns of cookbooks round Rory’s place. According to a profile in the New Yorker, his critics regard him as someone who goes in for “flitting” while his enemies have only plans, he has ideas. You can just see him wildly throwing the chilli, sumac and fennel seeds into the pan, only to return to a lump of moderately fragrant charcoal some time later, having been unhelpfully distracted by the TS Eliot he was rereading.Beside such scenes, the possible delights of the Gove household, all “witty” mugs and pointless arguments over the dishwasher, seem so pale and boring. Ditto the McVey kitchen, a realm in which I struggle to imagine much more than kitchen roll, frozen peas and emergency fish fingers, for all that Esther gamely shares her life with the “men’s rights” campaigner Philip Davies. (Davies, the MP for Shipley, has said that feminist “zealots” want women to have their cake and eat it – but how can Esther possibly have time for baking when she’s busy giving so many car-crash interviews?)Basically, I can’t stop thinking about Stewart’s un-abandoned ways with chicken legs, which is why the other week I wrote him a fan letter that I hope he will answer quite soon. Rory, whether you’re still in the race or not when you read it, I will take you for lunch at the Afghan Kitchen in newly Liberal Democrat Islington, where the dal is the colour of sunflowers and the pickles are sharp and sweet. While we eat, you can show me a picture of your oven, and tell me all about your ideas – whether for stew, or world domination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87d976394a280624474c2e2cd63069a4360d73c8/0_1997_4718_2829/master/4718.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f5d29c5e981775826016d70213563131","title":"nigel slater poached chicken with ginger and anise recipe","story":"Poach your bird for multiple meals and ine aromasThe pleasures of poaching a chicken are twofold. First, there’s the stock-enriched, fork-tender meat and then the steamy depths of its hot, bubbling broth. But that is to sell our efforts short. There is also the smell, homely and somehow levelling, that fills the kitchen as the bird edges timidly towards tenderness the scent of bay, black peppercorns, sweet onions and fat carrots that whispers rather than shouts that something good is on the way. There is the fact that an hour’s work will become not one, but several meals. All this in addition to the fine, juicy meat with its promise of salads and sandwiches to come and the golden, fat-bejewelled broth for making soup, risotto and other quietly pleasing dishes.A cold poached chicken in the fridge is pure treasure. Rip the meat from its bones and you have the heart and soul of a classic salad with mayonnaise, cos (rabbit ears) lettuce and ice-cold, green-shouldered tomatoes. Or possibly something more refreshing with iced noodles, chilled papaya and lush green coriander leaves. I had both this week, but instead of poaching the chicken with the usual aromatics I tucked in a couple of thumbs of ginger, sliced lengthways and a few stars of anise –the former for its citrussy heat. The latter for sweetness and its subtle note of aniseed.A ginger and anise-scented stock is a sound base for a noodle soup –the sort of liquor you can bring to the boil then stuff with crisp stems of pak choi, a skein of flat, white noodles and the merest hint of toasted sesame oil. I use it as a base for miso soup, my panacea, just as I use the meat for a late-night sandwich, layering thick slices with cucumber, watercress and enough wasabi or yuzu kosho to make my nose tingle.A light and useful chicken stock. The trick is to not let the liquid boil, but rather to putter gently.Untie the chicken and put it in a deep, heavy-based saucepan. Put the bay leaves and peppercorns into the pan. Cut the ginger into 1cm thick slices and add to the pot, together with the star anise flowers.Cut the onions in half, (there is no need to peel them), then add them to the chicken with the shallots, scrubbed carrots and the ribs of celery.Pour over enough water to cover the chicken then bring briefly to the boil. Skim off any froth that comes to the surface, then lower the heat so the water bubbles gently. The liquid should not boil. Cook, with the occasional glance at its progress, for an hour and a half. If necessary, top up the liquid.Remove the pan from the heat and leave for 20 minutes, then strain carefully. (I like to remove the chicken first. It is safer that way.) Strain the liquid and discard the vegetables and aromatics – they have done their work. Let the broth cool, then refrigerate. Let the chicken cool, then, while still at room temperature, remove the meat from the bones, keeping the pieces as large as possible.If using a large cucumber, you may need to discard the seedy core as it can make the salad “wet”. Smaller cucumbers rarely need their cores removed.For the dressing:lime juice 50ml (2 limes)fish sauce 3 tspcaster sugar 2 tspolive oil 40mlblack sesame seeds 3 tspcucumber 300gspring onions 2chilli 1, large and mildradishes 8mint leaves 12coriander leaves 20chicken stock 500mlnoodles 100g, soba or udonpapaya 375gFirst make the dressing. Halve the limes and squeeze their juice into a bowl. Add the fish sauce, then the sugar and oil and stir until dissolved. With a fork or a small whisk, mix the ingredients together, adding a grind or two of black pepper. Mix in the black sesame seeds.Cut the chicken into thick slices (I like to tear the meat from the carcass in fat, juicy chunks). Add the chicken to the dressing and set aside for 20 minutes.Peel the cucumbers (or not, as you wish) and cut them into 5cm lengths, then finely into large matchsticks. Finely slice the spring onions, discarding the tough, darker leaves, and toss them in a large mixing bowl with the cucumber.Finely shred the chilli then add to the spring onions. Wash and trim the radishes, then halve or thinly slice them (I like the hot crunch of a halved radish, others may prefer more delicate slices.) Tear the larger mint leaves into small pieces, keeping the small ones whole, then add them to the bowl, together with the coriander leaves, and toss gently together.Bring the stock to the boil. Put the noodles in a heat-proof bowl, pour the boiling stock over, then leave for 10 minutes or until they are tender.

Could I ever learn to love housework? Last Christmas, while I was visiting my parents at the house where I grew up, I watched Mum throw away some spice mix. Much of it missed the bin and the seeds, spices and herbs scattered about the kitchen floor. Mum didn’t notice, or didn’t care, so I grabbed a dustpan and brush. As I swept, I found plenty more down there: breadcrumbs, cheese, ham, porridge, dog hair, something sticky. Later, Mum mixed cocktails. I had come prepared, so, before taking a sip, I whipped a baby wipe from my pocket and gave my glass a surreptitious clean. Mum and my stepdad started talking about their plans to become Airbnb hosts, at which point I nearly choked on a cashew nut. They simply can’t see mess, I thought, and then I remembered that, until quite recently, neither could I.When I was growing up, the house was always untidy. There were piles of clothes on the landing, toys all over the living room, black marks on the hall tiles where coal had fallen from the scuttle we lugged in from the shed, dust on the surfaces, apple cores stuffed down the back of the sofa, discarded crisp packets, breakfast bowls on the coffee table, yellow gunge on the kitchen radio, and entire rooms we couldn’t enter because the doors were blocked shut by stacks of furniture, sculpture, paintings. I didn’t care: mess was all I knew, although there were hair-raising moments, such as when I was washing the dishes and saw something orange working its way up through the plughole. It turned out to be two slugs that had somehow got into the overflow. One Christmas, I accused the dog of having nibbled a bar of chocolate under the tree: “It was probably a rat,” said Mum, casually.Nowadays, I share a flat with my wife Lucy, and I’m tidy – perhaps obsessively so. As I scrub the floors and put things away after a meal, or use the vacuum’s special nozzle to suck up far-flung specks of dust on Sunday mornings, I think about how the untidiness I grew up in has affected important areas of my life – my studies, work, relationships. I’m nervous of broaching this subject with Mum, as I don’t want her to think I have complaints about my upbringing (I don’t). When I eventually ask her about it, Mum laughs and quotes my dad’s parting shot from 1988: “It would have been easier to stay if I’d been able to find a clean teaspoon.”Then she recalls a Friday evening when she took my brother Casper and me out for fish and chips: “I left the radio playing, the lights on, front door unlocked. When we got home, two neighbours were coming down the stairs. They said, ‘Thank goodness you’re alive.’ They thought the house had been ransacked and some terrible In Cold Blood-type scenario had happened. But the house was just in its usual state.”Mum also reminds me that, as a child, I liked looking at estate agents’ ads, particularly for new-build bungalows. “You wanted a house like Gary and Kevin’s,” she says of the charismatic twins at my school, who lived in a spotless beige house on a cul-de-sac. It’s true, I envied Gary and Kevin, but I thought that was because they were good at football. I never thought it was about tidiness. And anyway, when Kevin came to do some plastering at our house last year, he told Mum: “I used to love coming here as a kid.”On the other hand, I remember times when I did feel self-conscious about our home. A sleepover had to be abandoned when an asthmatic friend reacted to the dust. Another mate came for tea, refused to eat anything and the next day at school said our house was “scruffy”. We had a fight about that, so I must have been hurt. But we made up and, throughout the summer holidays, went fishing together and came back to my house at lunchtime, traipsing mud and pond water inside, to eat the sandwiches that Mum made for us.A few miles outside St Ives in Cornwall, the house was never squalid and remains full of colour, warmth and books. It’s a nice place to be. During the festive period, guests come over almost every evening for elaborate dinners and sit around the table long into the night, laughing, arguing and drinking mum’s damson gin. The living room walls are papered in Ordnance Survey maps of places of personal significance – north London, where Lucy and I lived Yorkshire, where we both studied Barcelona, where Casper lives, and various sites of my parents’ own formative years. The maps overlap, creating a disorienting family geography, while the flickering fire casts shadows across them. But why exactly has the house always been such a mess?Mum, a 68-year-old painter, sees it simply. “I could always think of something better to do than cleaning up,” she says. “It’s fruitless, completely non-creative. Tidiness is about fear of letting yourself go, but I think letting yourself go is when you can really be yourself. Both my husbands were useless about housework – but while women are judged for being untidy, men never are.”Did she ever feel embarrassed when people came over? “I hated it when they turned up unexpectedly. Certain friends always arrived when I’d just set something on fire.”So how exactly did I learn to be clean and tidy?I ask my university housemate, Will, for his memories of the year we spent living together. “I’m amused to hear you say you’ve become obsessive about cleanliness,” he says. “I’m not sure you even knew what cleaning was. I remember after about three months, I discovered you dragging the bins through to the front of the house, juice dribbling on to the hall carpet. You didn’t know the bins were collected out the back, because until then I had taken them out every single week.”The following year, I moved back into university halls, in part because Will warned a potential flatmate that I was a nightmare to live with. I felt ashamed when I heard about that, but by then I’d started seeing Lucy.The first time Lucy came to my room, I explained that I only had one cup, so we would have to take it in turns to have tea. I had never washed this cup I figured I was the only one to use it, so – why bother? Fifteen years later, I remind Lucy of this and she says, “I didn’t drink the tea because the cup was disgusting. It was calcified brown, like a toilet bowl in a manky pub.”Still, Lucy enjoyed my company enough to see past the mug and we moved in together after graduation. Apparently I hadn’t improved. “It’s true that you didn’t see mess,” she says. “You moved through rooms, only seeing what function things had for you. You’d go in the bathroom, leave the toilet seat up, your towel on the floor.”Is that so bad?“I had to teach you basic things. I couldn’t understand why you were so ill-equipped for life. When I was a kid we took turns washing and drying after dinner. I learned lifelong skills, but also a lot of conversation with my parents and siblings happened around domestic chores.”What did she think the first time she visited my parents’ house? “I loved the jolliness, the friendliness, the colour. But I was taken aback by the dirt. I grew up in suburbia and knew people who kept plastic covers on their sofas. Your mum’s cooking was amazing, but the plates had congealed food stuck to them from the previous time they were used. The wine glasses were greasy.”Like Mum, I could always think of something better than housework to do. In our early years together, I’d tell Lucy to leave it, but she refused and ended up doing it herself. When I mention this to Alison Pike, a psychology professor at Sussex University, and co-author of a study about household chaos, she says: “If you don’t care about housework, you’re just not going to be the one who does it. Caring about stuff is gendered. There’s an argument to say that, instead of bellyaching about how men should do more housework, women should just stop doing it.” This is, in effect, what Mum did – her husbands did no housework and she refused to do much herself. (She did all the cooking once, when she was unwell, my stepdad made her a cheese sandwich which turned out to be a chunk of parmesan between slices of stale bread.)Circumstance forced me to take responsibility about five years ago, when Lucy started a job involving a long commute at the same time as I began working from home. I got quite good at cooking, which meant keeping the kitchen clean. I began to enjoy doing little things like sweeping crumbs or chopped herbs from the floor after dinner, polishing the hob with French lavender spray, wiping the wall behind the cooker, bleaching the sink after washing up and never leaving anything on the worktops lest we get mice. It’s rewarding, the nightly sense of completion involved in making things gleam, and Lucy says it’s a relief to know she no longer has to do everything. Although part of me can’t help but feel like I’m wiping away a connection to my past with every swish of the sponge.Today, my brother Casper is a chef, so he knows all about keeping kitchens immaculate. I’m curious to know what he’s like at home and how he remembers the house we grew up in. He Skypes me from Barcelona, where he lives with his partner Nici and their two small children.“I don’t think our house being untidy upset me,” he says. “I didn’t find it embarrassing when friends came over. My first girlfriend used to say, ‘Oh, I like it – it’s homely.’”Do Casper and Nici argue about housework? “We used to,” he says. “And maybe I was more relaxed about it than Nici. To solve it we hired a cleaner.”When Nici joins the conversation, I sense she feels more strongly. “Little things I don’t understand,” she says to Casper. “You open a chocolate bar and throw the wrapper into the sink. Why? And I don’t like it when you leave the food that falls from the children’s plates under the table.”“It sounds like we still have issues,” he says, before adding: “I guess I’m fairly comfortable in mess at home.”I want to know how far back the legacy of messiness goes, so I ask Mum what her childhood home was like. “My mum was always cleaning,” she says, “but she didn’t pass on her domestic skills. I think she wanted something different for me, but I probably took that on too wholeheartedly. I feel guilty about not passing on any domestic skills, especially now that you have become very domesticated. Your flat is a nest kept perfect. Would you have liked it more if we’d been very tidy when you were growing up?”I’m inclined to say no, but I know my untidiness cost me when I left home, and possibly earlier. At school, teachers said I was bright but disorganised in my written work. I’m a slow learner, which might have something to do with being untidy, and for a long time I felt as though my body was marked with some indelible dirt.It took me decades to learn that my untidiness was taking its toll on me and on others around me. But blaming Mum would be unfair. As Casper says, “She made up for it in other ways.” Mum created a stimulating, loving home and, like the mess in the house, our family relationships are out in the open – imperfect, and I think more beautiful for being so. Still, my dad and stepdad should have done a lot more housework. Later, Casper and I should have helped. Perhaps it’s not too late, although I am alarmed to hear that, if the Airbnb plans get off the ground, my stepdad is planning to make breakfast for the guests. I won’t be reading the reviews.• If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine’s letters page in print, please email weekend@the, including your name and address (not for publication)."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/69d7e02766f7c81d47c5f2337a56719edde43c0e/0_1329_8906_5344/master/8906.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=65ee7391ede0af1366eeb73e30e8e3d1","title":"outside the box room within a room east london flat into family space","story":"An east London apartment has been turned into a family home by reconfiguring its compartmentalised floor planWhen Belgian architect Ewald Van Der Straeten discovered a flat for sale in east London’s Trevelyan House in 2012, he jumped at the chance to view it, and then put in an offer the very next day. “My big dream would have been to live in a Barbican apartment. I love the robust beauty of the concrete and the well-proportioned interiors,” he says. “It was pure luck that I found a flat in this building it has many of the qualities I was seeking, which you just don’t find in the majority of new builds.”Trevelyan House was built in 1958 by Sir Denys Lasdun, the British architect behind the National Theatre’s boldly Brutalist design. Lasdun devised the then radical idea of a butterfly plan, which saw the rear unit on each floor of this block of flats set at right angles to the other two, with a central core containing the stairs and lift. Not only did this improve the aspect of each apartment, it also negated the need for long access corridors and gave residents more privacy while maintaining a neighbourly atmosphere. Its “cluster block” design allowed for 24 new residences to be created on a relatively small Second World War bomb site in Bethnal Green, without disturbing the existing character of the street.While Ewald was instantly enamoured of the thoughtfully configured flat, his fiancée, opera singer Louise Lloyd, took a little longer to adjust to life in the grey and boxy 1950s block. “When we started dating I was living in a modern apartment building in west London, just minutes from Hyde Park, which I loved,” she recalls. “It really was a testament to our relationship that I gave that up to move in here with Ewald. I didn’t have a huge appreciation for the architecture at that point, and I found the block a little unattractive.”They now share their two-bedroom Bethnal Green maisonette with their baby daughter, Maya. With its open-plan living area and split-level layout, the flat works extremely well for the young family, even though Ewald initially designed it for himself and a housemate. This is thanks to a considered remodel, which saw the original series of compartmentalised spaces reworked into a fluid, more functional floor plan.Ewald enlisted fellow architect George Bradley, long-time friend and co-founder of the pair’s studio, Bradley Van Der Straeten Architects, to help with the project. Together, the duo came up with a “room-within-a-room” concept for the lower level, where the kitchen is conceived as a separate cube slotted into the living area. As well as zoning the space, the design is an ingenious response to building regulations, which prevented Ewald from removing the interior walls.The cube itself is built from Plyboo, a sustainable material made from sheets of bamboo – it looks like oak but is stronger and more affordable. The exterior is clad in dark grey MDF (made using a coloured resin rather than from painted MDF), applied as panels to create the impression of a box rather than a partition wall. Shadow gaps also add to this effect – a trick borrowed from the ancient Egyptians – which can be seen where the structure meets the floor and the ceiling.The work was undertaken in two stages: the upper floor was remodelled in just six weeks, and then, a year later, it took two months to complete the lower level. “The design took longer, of course,” adds Ewald. “It’s quite rare as an architect that you get the chance to do your own house up, but we were lucky to have some extra resources at the studio to help, so I took a long time to plan what I wanted to do.”To complement the building’s architectural origins, Ewald originally decorated the interior with pops of primary colour and a mix of midcentury furniture. Louise has since added a few flourishes of her own, which required patience and a little persuasiveness on her part. “Ewald was a bit protective over the flat,” she laughs. “He saw it quite differently to how I did, and it took a couple of years to come to a compromise that suited both of us.”Love won out and now the home is a happy mix of both their tastes, with Ewald’s modernist pieces sitting comfortably alongside Louise’s cheerful tonal colour and tactile fabrics. “Everything we have now has been a joint decision – even the cushions,” says Louise, who has come to appreciate why Ewald was so drawn to the space to begin with. “Living in a maisonette feels almost like a small house, so it’s never claustrophobic, plus there’s always so much light coming in. The way Ewald redesigned the flat is really clever, and I now have a much greater appreciation of the architecture through experiencing it on a daily basis. It just shows that you should never judge a book by its cover.”Ewald is just as content. “There’s not much I’d change, other than adding bi-fold doors to open up the living area to the balcony. That would really make the most of the elevated aspect, and the sunsets and sunrises we get to watch. You feel very connected to the elements up here, and having a long view in London is such a luxury.”For details about Bradley Van Der Straeten, visit b-vds"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/87c9274a1c714308c91b24d2a16e76277234e09f/45_186_2896_1738/master/2896.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b2fb74eb732687824f8eb8ba7c8e3df3","title":"pregnancy social media fantasy and reality hadley freeman","story":"Where once just not vomiting in my hair was enough, now I’m supposed to wonder how cute my bump looks in my lingerie selfiesBy the time you read this I will be days away from having a baby taken out of my body – something that, even as I stare down the barrel of child number three, will never stop seeming extremely weird to me. So this is the last you’ll hear from me for a few months. Who will I rant to every week? Will the baby want to hear my thoughts on politics? If his or her first word is “Trump”, we’ll all know whose fault that is.I’ve been pregnant a bunch of times now: once with twins, now with one baby, plus assorted miscarriages and an abortion along the way. And what I’ve learned from what I think of as my 360-degree experience of pregnancy is that it is a lot like flying economy on a long-haul flight. It is so all-consuming, exhausting and uncomfortable that you can’t actually believe it will ever be over. But then it is you walk away and never think about it again, because the ultimate destination is a lot more interesting than the journey.But some people feel differently. Pregnancy is no longer merely something to be endured, but a statement about aspirational femininity. Where once just making it through the day without vomiting in my hair was enough, now I’m supposed to wonder if the oils I’m rubbing on my stomach are organic, and how cute my bump looks in my lingerie selfies. Because pregnancy has entered the Instagram era.This spring I was – I say this euphemistically – feeling the effects of pregnancy. This means I was – non-euphemistically – constantly nauseous and insane with fatigue. My pallor was more grey than glowing and any healthcare professional who asked how “mama” was doing was greeted with growls neither human nor animal. One day, as I was wondering if I should puke then eat another slice of bread or vice versa, an email arrived. “Deliciously Ella shares all of her pregnancy secrets,” it read. Deliciously Ella, AKA Ella Mills, is the wildly successful so-called “healthy-eating inspirer”, whose nutritional advice includes the theory that “to really thrive” we should cut out dairy, gluten, meat, fish and eggs. I read on, eager to thrive like the pregnant influencer: “Her morning routine includes a 7am yoga practice with breakfast being a berry and spinach smoothie with rice milk, almond butter and hemp seeds,” the email informed me. “Ella is curbing any cravings by enjoying fresh lemon on artichokes and healthy carbohydrates.”OMG! Just like me! As long as you substitute “artichokes with lemon juice” for “sweets with more sweets”. And does eating an entire loaf of sourdough between breakfast (bread) and lunch (more bread) count as “healthy carbohydrates”?It’s entirely possible that I felt so gross precisely because I wasn’t doing pregnancy the Deliciously Ella way. But how was I supposed to fit in yoga around my busy morning schedule of being sick? And I can tell you, making myself a glass of green sludge afterwards would not have helped.Like Mills, model Miranda Kerr has been documenting her photogenic pregnancy on Instagram. All the cliches of pregnancy-by-social-media are ticked off: laughably ascetic meals of toast, tomato and cucumber, exercise videos, “essential” beauty products that she is shilling, gently lit photos of her perfectly compact stomach being held by her adoring husband. Her clothes remain unblemished, even though it is scientifically impossible to eat during pregnancy without spilling at least half on your stomach. My maternity clothes are a homage to Jackson Pollock’s oeuvre, recreated in spaghetti sauce and baked beans, two foods oddly absent from pregnant influencers’ social media accounts.For a while I developed an indefensible fascination with the yoga teacher Hilaria Baldwin, AKA Mrs Alec Baldwin, whose enthusiasm for photographing herself in her lingerie remains undimmed four children down the line. “My purpose here is to normalie the postpartum figure,” she wrote under one such selfie, and if by normalise she means “suggest someone can have the body of a model hours after giving birth” then she succeeded. There is, it seems, a fine line between a woman inspiring other women in a thrillingly modern way, and a woman promoting her brand by perpetuating extremely conventional standards of beauty.Part of me admires anyone who can turn pregnancy into yet another product of our consumerist and patriarchal society, endorsing the idea that being 38-weeks pregnant is no reason not to be photogenic and high-achieving. But a much, much bigger part of me believes the kindest thing you can do for women is tell them the unfiltered truth. Nothing reveals the gap between social-media fantasy and reality more strikingly than pregnancy, so Amy Schumer has been an overdue antidote to all of the above. Throughout her pregnancy and since giving birth to her son last month, the US comic has been posting images of what motherhood actually looks like, in all its laughably undignified glory. “Guys what are we doing tonight?” she wrote beneath a photo in which she wears a customised nursing bra while attached to two breast pumps.I’ll meet you there, Schumer. And I’ll see the rest of you in the autumn.• Comments on this piece are premoderated to ensure the discussion remains on the topics raised by the article.

Currently, one in four UK workers have an account with Nest.Nest says it has not taken this decision lightly, “but we don’t think it makes sense to continue investing in an industry whose business model looks increasingly unsustainable”. It already has a tobacco-free policy on a couple of its funds.Commenting on the announcement, Dean Walker, a scheme member based in Portsmouth, says: “I’m a new dad and I’ll certainly be encouraging my daughter not to smoke when she grows up. Everyone knows it’s not good for you and can cause cancers, which I feel very strongly against.“I think what Nest are doing is a great idea and I hope more companies follow suit.”In 2017 it emerged that Nest was shifting a chunk of its investments into a new climate change fund designed to move people’s money out of fossil fuels and into renewable energy. It said it wanted to protect members from the risks associated with the climate emergency by reducing their exposure to companies with reserves of coal, oil and gas.It is predicted that by the late 2020s, one-third of the UK working population will have a pension pot with Nest. The average income of a member is around £18,000 a year."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/89911e5b23bd39daab9351af2d9ae4df1c062d33/67_347_2152_1290/master/2152.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7129b881067b06bd2c1692b5e64abd36","title":"madonna becomes latest artist to call out instagram","story":"Pop singer says platform enslaves people to their image and gaining approval of othersMadonna has criticised Instagram, which she says enslaves people into trying to win the approval of others.The intervention from the pop singer, who has almost 14 million followers on the photo-sharing platform, comes amid an increasing focus of the harmful effects Instagram can have, particularly on young people.“You get caught up in comparing yourself to other people.

In the hours following his move the Liberal Democrats’ head of membership and engagement reported a surge of 800 new members.In Umunna’s south London constituency this weekend, many of his supporters remain undeterred by his latest political move, including the antiques shop owner Steve Wright, 67, who said: “I think they should just leave him alone. He’s doing a good job for Streatham anyway, so why rock the boat and elect somebody else?”Shortly after the party forms, former Labour MP Angela Smith is heavily criticised for referring to people from minority backgrounds as having a funny tingeAfter renaming itself Change UK, the party gets into a row with petition site Change.org, who release a statement warning it will be seeking guidance over the imitation of its brandTwo election candidates are forced to resign within 24 hours of each other after offensive tweets emerge, including Joseph Russo, the party\u0027s top Scotland candidate, writing \u0027black women scare me\u0027Lead Scottish candidate defects to the Lib Dems a week before European electionsMP Joan Ryan implores the audience at the party\u0027s Bath rally to look at their palms: \u0027It\u0027s there, the future is in your hands\u0027In the week before the European parliamentary elections it emerges that Change UK spent £87,000 on Facebook adverts, becoming the\u0026nbspbiggest single political advertiser on Facebook - including spending at least £1,300 promoting Facebook adverts saying it was campaigning to \u0027remain in the UK\u0027Six of Change UK’s 11 MPs, including its spokesman\u0026nbspChuka Umunna\u0026nbspand interim leader Heidi Allen, abandon the fledgling party.

He’s doing a good thing to follow his heart. I think people should vote for candidates based on who they are and what they do, rather than which political party they follow the whip for.”However, others were incredulous that their MP had been allowed to change political parties twice without resigning.

He has also stood three times, in 1997, 2001 and 2005, to be Tory leader himself during difficult periods for his party. But throughout it all he has never known a political crisis remotely like the present.Now aged 78, he still describes himself as “a natural optimist”. But a combination of Brexit and the Tory leadership contest are testing his positive thinking to its limits.“As someone who has seen a few leadership elections in my time, this one’s quite different,” Clarke said in an interview with the Observer last week, within hours of the announcement that Boris Johnson had stormed into the lead in the first round. “This is a tragic farce of a crisis in which anger and protest are wide sentiments across the public scene. The Conservative party is in turmoil internally and deeply unpopular with the general public.”As a lifelong europhile its hurts Clarke, who as father of the House of Commons is its most senior MP, to think that he will be retiring at the next election with what he calls this “extreme crisis” caused by Brexit overshadowing everything. He describes leaving the EU as a “crazy decision” – one which will leave in ruins much of what he has tried to do over the past five decades.“My entire political career has been based on building up Britain’s political standing and economic prosperity through our membership of the EU and the European project,” he says. “Now it’s all come to an end and the political system and parliament is in such mayhem and incapable of dealing with the crisis that this referendum has provoked.”He is also dismayed by the way the Tory party is going about choosing its new leader and the country’s next prime minister. “There’s an air of fantasy about just about every candidate’s campaign,” he says, with promises being made on Brexit that cannot be met. And the way the eventual decision will be handed over to the Tory membership, he finds simply “extraordinary”. “Most dictatorships have a better way of choosing their leader than this one.”On Boris Johnson, Clarke is withering in a way that borders on contempt. He says he was a “disaster” as foreign secretary, and when asked if he could be equally terrible as prime minister, he answers in an instant. “Yes, he certainly has the potential to be. Unless he suddenly starts taking it seriously. I am not sure he knows what he would do to get us through the crisis.That the Tory party’s most senior MP and highly respected elder statesman, who has been chancellor of the exchequer, home secretary, health secretary, education secretary and lord chancellor, can describe the probable next Conservative prime minister in such a way, and the entire political system as in the grip of a self-inflicted crisis, is remarkable. And it is not just an isolated view from one veteran politician.Many at Westminster share Clarke’s analysis that politics is utterly broken, and that what is currently happening, particularly with the Tory party leadership, could well make things worse. Most MPs, though, are far more discreet about saying so, as their careers lie ahead of them. Clarke, by contrast, no longer has ambitions to fulfil nor does he feel he has to answer to his local party. He says precisely what he thinks. And much of what he says resonates very widely with the public, as shown by the striking polling and focus group work conducted by Britain Thinks that we publish today.The Britain Thinks examination of the nation’s confidence levels and views of its leaders uncovered a deep pessimism and extraordinary distrust of politicians.The polling found people felt more engaged with politics post-Brexit, but that extra engagement seems to have left them more frustrated than ever at their politicians’ failings.“I feel pessimistic about the future simply because of the uncertainty, not knowing what’s to come and the lack of trust I have in all politicians and all parties,” said one focus group participant in Leicester. Increasingly, also, Britain’s inability to cope with its political crisis is being noticed abroad.The latest cover of Time magazine is headlined “How Britain went Bonkers. The Brexit fiasco” with a picture of Theresa May and Tory leadership contenders, including Johnson, on top of a London bus grinning, as the bus sinks.Scott Wightman, Britain’s outgoing senior diplomat in Singapore said in a valedictory note last week that the UK was now seen overseas as a country beset by ision and oblivious to truth. The nation that Singaporeans “admired for stability, common sense, tolerance and realism grounded in fact, they see beset by ision, obsessed with ideology, careless of the truth …” He added: “I fear many around the world share their view.”Today John Kerr, a former UK ambassador to the EU and the author of article 50, says he is dismayed by the false promises being pushed out by the Tory leadership candidates, which will be treated with disdain by the EU if and when they have to try to deliver on them.“What alarms me most about the current Conservative party leadership race is that fiction and fantasy are back, and harsh facts again forgotten,” Kerr says. “The unicorns are back, frolicking in the Tory forest.”He says the claims by Johnson and others that the withdrawal agreement can be renegotiated “ignore the solemn undertakings given by the UK government in March that it will not seek to do so, as well as the EU’s repeated statements saying it will not do so”.All this feeds the impression abroad that UK politicians are not operating in the real world any more. “Margaret Thatcher and John Major knew that bluff and bravado doesn’t work in Brussels. Not paying what we owe, and have promised to pay, wouldn’t change the game in our favour: it would end it. And, as the CBI and TUC rightly warn, leaving with no deal, and hence no transition period, would be catastrophic. “No deal isn’t backed by the country, or the Commons. So it really matters that an auction of promises to ultras doesn’t become determinant of our nation’s future. Facts matter.The central promise of Johnson’s campaign is that he will take the UK out of the EU on 31 October “deal or no deal”, saying that not to do so would be a betrayal. The implication is that parliament will not be allowed to stand in the way of Brexit.His supporters hope that if he wins among Tory members in the country, he could instantly revive morale and win back the many Brexit-supporting voters who have deserted to Nigel Farage’s Brexit party. Some believe he could then call a general election in early autumn, to gain his own mandate from the country to take the UK out of the EU on time.But while Johnson looks on course to win the leadership of the Tory party, that is as much as it would be wise to predict. Honouring his promise to deliver Brexit will be no easy task. “If we get lured into thinking that Boris solves everything, we could be in for a very nasty surprise indeed,” said one former minister last week. “He could actually make this whole crisis much, much worse.”If and when he enters No 10, Labour will almost certainly table a vote of no confidence in a Johnson government that tries to take the country out of the EU without a deal, against the majority will of MPs in parliament. Last Wednesday the Tory MP and former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he would be prepared to vote down any government if it tried to act in defiance of parliament’s will.Clarke told the Observer he, too, would feel bound to do the same and thinks other Conservatives could follow suit, though he does not know how many. Tory MPs bringing down a Tory government? Would that not elevate the political crisis to new levels?“Well, I mean, if there’s no other way ... then you’ve got to bring that government down,” Clarke said. “You can’t have somebody saying ‘I’m going to be a dictatorial president for a month or two and fix everything despite parliamentary disapproval. If ... some idiot was sailing onto a no-deal Brexit, I’d decide politics had finally gone mad and I was not going to support this.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/af11aff05cc404884ffeabe72fa787c945bb9148/0_19_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=548b75c39dcd34253aa65c0489b84309","title":"tory leadership race the triumphs and turkeys","story":"The week that nominations closed, the first candidates left the race and you-know-who stormed into an early lead‘I am personally pining for Big Ben’s bongs’For a candidate who had recently admitting taking cannabis, this was a brave way for Andrea Leadsom to talk about parliament’s refurbishment.‘Could be worse…’Former shadow chancellor Ed Balls has his say over whether “Hancock Out” is an appropriate headline for the end of Matt Hancock’s leadership bid.Kit Malthouse and James Cleverly both backed Boris Johnson. The pair had been so impressed with his skills during their time working with him as London mayor that they both initially ran against him for the leadership.It’s still unclear what had made them nervous about a man who commissioned buses without windows and a cable car that has fewer users than Johnson’s estuary airport, which was never actually built.Before any crucial EU talks, it was surely his negotiating skills that convinced them. Who could deny his credentials, having bought three water cannon from Germany, refurbished them, and sold them for scrap at a £300,000 loss? That should put Angela Merkel on notice.No deal. The Tory leadership race has often resembled a battle to replace the captain of the Titanic halfway through its maiden voyage.Yet this spectacle now has another unlikely twist, with contenders openly cheering on the iceberg. Yes, a willingness to embrace a no-deal Brexit has become an essential part of any candidate’s armoury – in this case, in the form of a gun pointing straight at the country’s temples.Dom Raab and Johnson have their revolvers primed. Jeremy Hunt, Sajid Javid and Michael Gove just want it lying casually on the desk at EU talks. That just leaves Rory Stewart, the only contender sane enough to rule out no deal.

Spontaneity wasn’t a strong suit. At his launch, Harper insisted: “This isn’t going to be that scripted.” Unfortunately, that was one of several lines pre-released to the media. His Twitter game seemed strong, asking social media users to “Ask Me Anything”. Several people used the opportunity to ask an urgent query: “Who are you?”Then there was his launch event, which featured the slogan: “Promising, Delivering, Brexit.” Except, there was a pink line through “promising”. Was it highlighted? Was it crossed out? Was he having the decency to renege on his Brexit pledge immediately, saving us the bother of the inevitable implosion? It still isn’t clear. At the end of all this, Harper’s bid ended in inexplicable failure.Purveyors of canned goods Stock up the larder. Ready the tins of fruit cocktail.

Now the global health expert at the University of California, San Diego, she has, along with her husband, Tom Patterson, who is also a scientist at the institution, written an account of their nine month ordeal – The Perfect Predator: A Scientists’s Race to Save Her Husband from a Deadly Superbug.What is phage therapy and how does it work?Phage therapy is the use of bacteriophages – viruses that attack bacteria – to treat infections. There are trillions and trillions of phages on the planet and they have evolved over millennia to become the prefect predators to bacteria. The phage latches on to and enters the bacterial cell where it takes over its machinery and turns it into a phage manufacturing plant. The newly minted phages then burst out and the bacterial cell dies. To work, phages have to be matched to the bacterial infection. But just how close the match needs to be depends on the bacterial species.Phage therapy has been neglected in the west. Why?Phages were first discovered in 1917 by a French-Canadian, Félix d’Herelle, but he had a hard time getting his work accepted – he wasn’t formally trained and was considered a vagabond scholar. Then, while phage preparations were being manufactured in the west up until the late 1930s, the scientific method hadn’t really been worked out. They were, for example, not being matched to specific bacteria and they were sold without being purified, so some actually could cause harm. After penicillin came to market in the early 1940s, phage therapy fell out of favour and political reasons kept it there. Former Soviet countries – where penicillin wasn’t so consistently available – had taken up phage therapy very vigorously. Western researchers and companies feared being labelled “pinko commie” sympathisers.You got Tom out of Egypt and eventually into intensive care at your institution, UCSD. What turned you on to phage therapy and where did you find Tom’s phages?We were running out of options to save Tom, whose infection had spread throughout his body, so I started exploring unconventional cures. I found a paper that mentioned phage therapy. Although I’d learned of phages in college, this was the first I had heard of using them as a treatment. My colleague Chip Schooley, chief of infectious diseases at the UCSD school of medicine, agreed it was an interesting idea and said if I could find phages that matched Tom’s bacterial infection he would contact the Food and Drug Administration and get approval to use them for compassionate use. I knew what that meant: officially, Tom was dying.I began cold-emailing phage researchers asking for help. A phage researcher at Texas A\u0026ampM University turned his lab into a kind of command centre, looking for phages active against Tom’s specific infection in his centre’s phage library and in sewage and barnyard waste – wherever you find a lot of bacteria is where you find the phages that kill them! He also wrote to researchers all over the world asking them to send any phages they had that might work, which they did. But phages for Acinetobacter baumannii are very picky. Tom’s life depended on finding a match in time. In three weeks, which included a week spent on purification, a cocktail of four phages was ready to give to Tom. The navy – who our FDA contact also put us in touch with – produced a second four-phage cocktail from their phage library.Did it work at once?We began the intravenous phage therapy, but Tom’s bacteria quickly became resistant to all the phages except one in the navy’s cocktail. We didn’t realise that a lot of the phages across both cocktails were very similar to one another and were all trying to enter the bacteria by the same receptor. The bacteria’s successful attempt at evading one phage therefore offered resistance to the rest. Luckily, looking again for more phages that would match, the navy found another in the murky waters of a sewage treatment plant in Maryland. From bog to bedside, so we say! It was powerful because it hit a different receptor. Coincidentally, we found there was synergy with one of the antibiotics Tom was getting. Tom woke up three days after we began the treatment and he fully cleared his infection within three months.How did Tom’s case break new medical ground?He was the first in the US to get intravenous phage therapy for a systemic superbug infection. In the past when phage therapy has been used, it has usually been topically – sprinkled on somebody’s skin – or inhaled with a nebuliser. Going intravenous was really risky. Even in the former Soviet countries, where phage therapy has been used for decades, they don’t often treat intravenously because they don’t have the hi-tech capability to purify their phage of the bacterial debris that accumulates when you prepare them in large quantities, so there’s the risk of septic shock. We think of what Tom received as 21st-century phage therapy.Since Tom’s case, you have assisted other patients to get phage therapy and you now, in addition to your day job, co-direct a new phage therapy centre at UCSD – the Centre for Innovative Phage Applications and Therapeutics – the first in North America. How many people have you helped to date?After Tom’s case was publicised, people contacted me from all over the world wanting phage therapy. Strangers had helped us, and I felt I had an obligation to help them. So far, we’ve treated six other patients here at UCSD, and advised on a couple of dozen cases elsewhere across the US and internationally. We haven’t always been successful, because sometimes we have been contacted too late. But the FDA is now making it easier for people to get phage therapy earlier in the course of their infections. What’s needed now are clinical trials to see if it works on a broader scale.I understand your centre helped in the case reported last month of the British teenager Isabelle Holdaway. She became the first person to be treated successfully with a genetically modified phage for a superbug infection following a double lung transplant.Her mother had heard about Tom’s case and asked her UK doctor whether he could consider phage therapy. He contacted Schooley, the doctor who ended up treated Tom and now co-directs the centre with me. Isabelle’s infection – Mycobacterium abscessus – is in the same genus as tuberculosis and was fully resistant to antibiotics. She was receiving hospice care. The team asked a researcher with a mycobacterium phage library at the University of Pittsburgh to help, but most of the phages he found that matched were not predatory enough. So they tweaked one genetically – clipping out a gene – to ensure it killed the bacteria rather than going dormant. The phage was administered intravenously, like with Tom, and Isabelle left the hospital in a week. I wept for joy. Isabelle is now finishing her A-levels and learning to drive.Even if phage therapy is proven to work, is widespread use ever going to be achievable when it is essentially personalised therapy? How does it scale up?What is needed are readily available phages to match whatever organisms we face in the bacterial world. Instead of having to resort to environmental sources every time – like we did in Tom’s case with the sewage – imagine a large, ever-expanding, open-source phage library that researchers and students contribute to from around the world, which could be accessible globally as a resource. Genetic tweaking is also clearly a way of expanding the range of bacteria that picky phages like Tom’s or Isabelle’s are able to attack.What about the problem of the bacteria becoming phage-resistant?Bacterial resistance to phage can be expected, but how quickly it occurs depends on a number of factors. In Tom’s case, it emerged fast. Isabelle has been treated for about a year and resistance hasn’t emerged yet, since her bacteria is slow-growing. And there are a few ways that issue can be overcome, like using a phage cocktail where different phages “hit” different bacterial receptors. In the future, genetically modified or synthetic phages could be developed that are harder for bacterial resistance to overcome.What’s your advice to people who do find their loved ones hospitalised with superbug infections? Shout for phage therapy?For any serious illness, you need to be an advocate. Get educated about what’s going on and be actively involved in your loved one’s care. In the case of a superbug, understand what options are left in terms of antibiotics and also what kinds of side effects exist, because some last-resort antibiotics, like colistin, can be very hard on the body. Because phage therapy is experimental, you can’t necessarily get it if there are still antibiotic options available. If there are not, phage therapy may be possible.

It leaves some spectators thrilled, some frustrated, many both in varying measures.Glenn Maxwell himself has shown he has the technique and temperament to play orthodox innings in Test and one-day cricket when required but in this World Cup he has been liberated to play his unique version of the game. The only rule: when Maxwell arrives at the batting crease, you have no idea what is going to happen next. That is Maxwellball.Until tackling Sri Lanka Maxwell had had to settle for a steadily building series of vignettes. Against Afghanistan he arrived with two runs needed to win and smoked the spinning prodigy Mujeeb Ur Rahman over cover for four. Strike rate of 400. Next he entered during a West Indies barrage and immediately counterattacked by hooking a bouncer. Caught for a duck second ball.In a run chase against India with his team needing 12 per over, he struck 28 from 14 balls before falling to a blinder of a catch from the substitute Ravindra Jadeja. Then against Pakistan he came in for a nitro-boost after a huge opening stand, making 20 from 10 before losing his stumps.Against Sri Lanka he was on five when a new game of Maxwellball commenced. Dimuth Karunaratne has been doing a hell of a job. In the topsy-turvy world of Sri Lankan cricket, he was unexpectedly made Test captain in March before his team’s greatest away series win over South Africa, then made one-day captain before the World Cup in a format he had not played in four years. The careful Test opener took that in his stride, carrying his bat for an unbeaten fifty in his opening game while his teammates were skittled by New Zealand. He watched Australia’s openers make a big start and an innings swell to alarming proportions. He switched bowlers, directed fields, tried to give a sense of control.For Maxwell in the 45th over he was tossing up where to place his boundary riders. He kept mid-on in, leaving deep midwicket and deep square-leg. Nuwan Pradeep bowled leg-stump and Maxwell got his front foot far enough out of the way to pop it over mid-on. Then he opened his stance wider to flat-bat six in the same direction, then slammed a ball into the non-striker’s stumps.Karunaratne sent long-on back, bringing midwicket in. So Maxwell whipped aerially over midwicket and hit that gap instead. Out went midwicket and deep square-leg came in. Maxwell duly flipped the next ball over him for four more.Karunaratne looked as if he had been duped by a three-card hustler. Pradeep shook his head as well. A reasonable day of 62 off nine overs had become highly unreasonable. Pradeep used the fast bowler’s method and tried a bouncer. Maxwell hooked it over the keeper for four. The over cost 22. Maxwellball. As Sri Lanka’s death bowlers tightened up and wickets fell at the other end, Maxwell still squeezed each yorker for a single, hustling down the wicket, even finding a three off an outside edge to no-man’s land.Against Sri Lanka at the previous World Cup he shook off the burden of having never scored a century for his country, blasting Australia’s fastest one-day hundred from 51 balls at the Sydney Cricket Ground. Four years later time was against him and he had to settle for 46 from 25.The entertainment of it, and the fact it does not always work, drives some people spare. But the very nature of Maxwell is that he cannot do what he does every game. No one can. His is not an easy repeatable approach. You have to accept that if you want to appreciate his best.From the last ball of the innings, everyone in the ground expected him to try for a six. One last ungainly heave. Instead he stepped across to Thisara Perera, got down low and elegantly swept the fast bowler behind square, exactly where the gap was, between the boundary riders. No one was left in any doubt whose game they had just been watching. It has his name in the title."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/13c14e9efae865742caa5c50819471d16def9914/0_72_1070_642/master/1070.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=47a373be582d5e5ff6fbc81a91bac59b","title":"chris froome thanks cycling fans for support after major setback","story":"Chris Froome has admitted he is lucky to be alive after speaking for the first time since his horror cycling accident.The four-time Tour de France winner came off his bike and hit a wall at 37mph on Wednesday while examining a time-trial stage route in the Critérium de Dauphiné. He sustained multiple fractures, including a broken leg, elbow and several ribs, requiring extensive surgery. It has been also been reported that Froome suffered a fractured neck, faces six weeks in hospital and is not expected to compete again this year.“I know how lucky I am to be here today and how much I owe to all the paramedics and medical staff on the race,” said Froome. “Whilst this is a setback and a major one at that, I am focusing on looking forward. There is a long road to recovery ahead, but that recovery starts now and I am fully focused on returning back to my best.”The post was issued with a picture of Froome giving the thumbs up from his bed at the University Hospital of St Etienne, where he has been receiving treatment.“I just want to say a huge thank you to everyone who has sent their best wishes to me since the crash,” added Froome. “This is obviously a tough time but I have taken a lot of strength from the support over the last three days. The outpouring of support has been really humbling and something I would never have expected.Froome took his hand off his handlebars to blow his nose before a gust of wind destabilised his bike. He crashed into a wall and lost consciousness. The Briton was airlifted to hospital where he has since been joined by his wife Michelle.Meanwhile, Wout Poels gave Team Ineos something to celebrate by winning stage seven of the Dauphiné, as Britain’s Adam Yates lost his grip on the overall lead.The Dutchman let out a huge roar as he won on the Montee de Pipay, having bridged across to leading duo Jakob Fuglsang and Emanuel Buchmann in the last kilometre before beating the pair to the finish line.Astana’s Fuglsang did enough to claim the yellow jersey from Yates, who will start Sunday’s final stage with an eight-second disadvantage. Poels’s first stage victory of the year moved him up to fifth, 28 seconds behind Fuglsang.“It’s really nice for the team and it’s a gift for Chris also,” said Poels. “I felt pretty strong all day. The team did an amazing job.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e61984feefb3b96f409de3e4432761ec216d3827/0_1182_5330_3198/master/5330.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=94de6386ae6fbe68432ea0651383b53f","title":"india pakistan mickey arthur players can be heros","story":"The Pakistan coach, Mickey Arthur, has promised his young side they will go down in history if they can “produce the perfect game” and beat India for the first time at a World Cup. Organisers are forecasting that Sunday’s match at Old Trafford will have the biggest TV and digital cricket audience of all time but Arthur swatted away concerns Pakistan might buckle under the pressure of the occasion.Arthur said: “I’m telling our players: ‘You could be a hero. Your careers are going to be defined by a moment in the game. You do something incredible and you’ll be remembered for ever.’ If we put the perfect game together, we can beat everybody, and the dressing room is very, very confident of that fact.”Pakistan have lost all six of their previous World Cup encounters with India but Arthur believes his mercurial squad – the youngest in the tournament despite the wizened presence of Mohammad Hafeez and Shoaib Malik, who are 38 and 37 respectively – are capable of showing a lot more than they have in their four matches, including a brilliant win over England and frustrating defeats to West Indies and Australia.“That unpredictability tag always sort of hangs around the Pakistan team, but that makes us very exciting as well,” Arthur said. “We just haven’t grabbed the moments when they’ve presented themselves, and that’s something we’ve spoken about as a group.“We’ve got 15 incredible cricketers in that dressing room, and we keep stressing to them: ‘How do you want to be remembered? You’re the class of 2019. What are they going to say about you in history? It presents an unbelievable opportunity for these guys to really make a mark. It only takes one moment of magic.”Arthur was far more expansive in his press conference than the India captain, Virat Kohli, who repeatedly dead-batted questions about the importance and the magnitude of the match. “We’re not focusing too much on what the opposition has to do or what they will bring to the table,” he said. “We need to believe in our strengths.”Another tried, probing about the pressure of the occasion, but again Kohli refused to bite. “We understand that any game that you play for your country can be emotional, adrenaline-filled, so no one game is more important or more special for us than the other,” he said. “If we play well, we can beat any side in the world.”The only time Kohli opened up was when talking about playing against Pakistan in the Champions Trophy in 2009. “Yuvraj Singh fractured a finger, and I was literally flown in and in two days’ time I was playing against Pakistan at Centurion,” he said, smiling. “I hadn’t experienced anything like that before and I played a very bad shot, and I couldn’t sleep until six in the morning. I was looking at the ceiling and thinking: ‘That’s it, I’ve flown in, and now I’m finished.’”Assuming there is play – which is not altogether certain given it barely stopped raining at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon and more showers are forecast – then Arthur expects the wicket to be better than many might expect.But, like every one of the 28,000 lucky ticket holders, Arthur will watch the morning skies with interest. “The boys have planned meticulously,” he said. “We’ve done everything that we can control. We can’t control the weather. Unfortunately, we’ve just got to go by what happens.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fcefad3af794b06a11b98b795a3fed8ba205e234/0_76_5191_3116/master/5191.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=96327a3e2777e4750225159f60ab96ae","title":"gary woodland holds onto lead as justin rose edges closer at us open","story":"Presumably Brooks Koepka will spend the build up to the final round of this US Open finding a reason to bear a grudge against Gary Woodland. As things stand, Woodland represents the biggest danger to the making of history by Koepka.Victory at Pebble Beach on Sunday would render Koepka only the second player, and first since 1905, to win this major in three consecutive years. Through 54 holes, Koepka – who makes a point of deriving inspiration from negative forces, real or otherwise – trails Woodland’s 11 under par by four. The scale of Koepka’s potential triumph should not be overstated victory in this US Open would represent a fifth in just nine major starts.“I feel good,” said Koepka after a 68 as moved him to minus seven. “I feel like if I can just make a few putts, I could be right there, right next to Gary. And it’s been very close. I’m pleased at how I’m playing. I’m pleased at how I’m striking the ball.“I feel as confident as ever right now. It’s probably the best ball-striking week I’ve had. Pebble’s greens are so small. I think I only missed one green today, maybe two. To hit as many greens as I have the last two days, the ball-striking is right where I want it.”Woodland must hope his get out of jail cards weren’t used up during day three’s 69. He chipped in to save par at the 12th. Having played the 14th like an 18-handicapper, he holed out from 43ft to prevent a dropped shot. This is unchartered territory for Woodland, whose best major finish is tied sixth, but he will begin the final day with a one-shot shot cushion.Justin Rose is Woodland’s closest challenger. Koepka, on whom all eyes will inevitably fall upon, has Louis Oosthuizen and Chez Reavie for 54-hole company.Rose’s Saturday 68 was wonderfully tenacious. He has delivered a staggering 34 single putts through three rounds. Unlike Woodland, whom he will again have as a partner on Sunday, Rose has also prevailed in this environment before.Rory McIlroy’s 70 moved him to six under. If that means the Northern Irishman still had a chance of a second US Open title, McIlroy looked bruised by a dropped shot at the 17th. There was little at all wrong with McIlroy’s tee to green play on Saturday putts just wouldn’t drop.“I definitely think I can shoot 65 or 66 on this golf course,” said McIlroy. “That’s probably what it is going to take tomorrow. Everything has got to be on. You’ve got to get off to a fast start, you’ve got to play the par fives well and you need to hit it in the fairways all day. It’s difficult. It is possible, but it is difficult.”Matt Kuchar and Chesson Hadley are a shot adrift of McIlroy. The all-European four under quintet comprises Danny Willett, Graeme McDowell, Jon Rahm, Henrik Stenson and Matt Wallace.Tiger Woods appeared for his third round wearing neck tape, demonstrating fitness issues remain a constant for the Masters champion. Woods’s 71 means he is level par on aggregate and, legitimately, aiming for a top-10 finish at best here.“When it’s cold like this everything is achy,” Woods explained. “It’s just part of the deal. The forces have to go somewhere. And if they’re not in the lower back, they’re in the neck, and if not, they’re in the mid-back and if not they go to the knee. You name it.“Let me put it this way, I feel every shot I hit. I think that’s always going to be the place from here going forward.”Image of the day was provided by Stenson, who was pictured lying in the rough, next to a fan he had hit with a “semi shank” on the 16th. This was a typical act of decency from Stenson, who explained the scenario after signing for his 70.“He’s in good spirits because he’s taking selfies of himself while he’s down on the ground,” Stenson said. “I walk up to him. I said, ‘I’m sorry.’ What else can you say? And he says, ‘Can you do me one favour? Can I take a picture with you?’ So next thing I’m down on the ground as well, taking a picture, laying down with him and his girlfriend.“It feels like he’s had maybe one or two refreshments that might have eased the pain. I don’t know if he’s got a concussion but I asked for his details so I can contact him at a later date and check up on him. I might send him a couple of dozen balls or something to try to make up for my poor shot.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2ebc250804e419d804230368fd3776759ebb0e88/0_277_2336_1401/master/2336.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6f23f15b887f7b3dd0846d63024286b8","title":"blithe spirit revival judi dench dark times","story":"In 1941 when Britain was at the mercy of the Blitz, the staging of Noël Coward’s classic play Blithe Spirit, a comedy about death, was considered a risk. But it turned out to be a big hit, with a record run in the West End and then Broadway before being turned into a film four years later starring Rex Harrison.Now the director of a new version of the film and one of its lead actors, Dame Judi Dench, feel that the “dark space” we are currently in provides another fittingly gloomy backdrop for the release of a production that they hope will lift people’s spirits.The Oscar-winning actress plays the eccentric mystic, Madame Arcati, who inadvertently conjures up the ghost of a jealous first wife, who is unaware that she is dead when she returns to haunt her scoundrel husband and his new partner.“When the play opened in the West End in 1941, its subject-matter was, on some levels, quite dark because it was about ghosts, death and losing people,” said Edward Hall, the director of the latest incarnation of Blithe Spirit, which begins filming this week. “But actually Coward wrote this wonderful comedy and it struck a vein. I feel that the time is right to tell that story again to a broad audience because we’re in quite a dark space at the moment.”Dench is one of Britain’s foremost actresses, whose roles have ranged from monarchs to M in the Bond films. Hall said: “She loves the story, the character and Coward. Like us, she feels it is a great moment to cheer people up. I said to her, ‘when you come out of the cinema, you should feel like you’ve drunk a glass of cold champagne a little too quickly’.” The film marks Hall’s directorial debut in films. He has just stepped down as artistic director of the Hampstead theatre, London, where stage hits include Sunny Afternoon, the Kinks musical that was also a huge West End success, winning Olivier awards. His television productions have included William Boyd’s Restless.Working with Dench is “extra special”, he said. His late father, the director Sir Peter Hall, cast Dench in landmark productions such as Antony and Cleopatra and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, as well as another Coward classic, Hay Fever.Blithe Spirit, set in 1937, is one of Coward’s most-loved plays. Hollywood studios competed to adapt it but Coward took the project instead to his friend David Lean. The new film will be released next year, marking the 75th anniversary of the original, which starred Margaret Rutherford alongside Rex Harrison.The shoot will take place at various UK locations, including a private art deco house and Cliveden, the National Trust’s Buckinghamshire estate. Dench’s character, Madame Arcati, is described by Coward as “a striking woman, dressed not too extravagantly but with a decided bias towards the barbaric”. Hall said: “I always felt there was only one person in the world who could ever play her and that was Judi. Fortunately, she felt the same.”Downton Abbey star Dan Stevens, who appeared with Dench in Hay Fever, is cast as bestselling crime novelist Charles who suffers from terrible writer’s block in struggling with his first screenplay. His picture-perfect new wife Ruth dreams of leaving London for Hollywood. Seeking inspiration, he invites Madame Arcati to perform a séance in his home, only to realise that she has inadvertently summoned the spirit of his deceased first wife – the fiery Elvira, who tries to win back his affections, leading to an increasingly complex love triangle.The writer-producers, Nick Moorcroft and Meg Leonard, have adapted Blithe Spirit with Piers Ashworth. Moorcroft said: “It is one of Coward’s most famous comedies and, right now, everybody needs a reason to laugh.” "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cca2aaefeaa32e528c3af25796d8d44fed1af64d/1741_1104_5480_3289/master/5480.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=63508fbf87c4f8b900c8257dc923fbed","title":"me and my dad inspiration indifference and pride","story":"Absurdist, dogged, overtly Scottish ... our fathers come in many flavours. Three creatives explain how their old man has inspired them throughout their livesThere are few experiences more bonding than sharing a drink with your dad. Over a glass, or two, of Tobermory 12 Year Old whisky, a writer, photographer and magazine journalist, give a frank glimpse into their relationships with the men who raised themWhen I first told my dad about the subject of this piece, how his creativity has inspired my writing, he responded with the traditional Druker facial expression (somewhere between a sneer and a shrug).“Pheh,” he said. “It doesn’t even inspire me.”It’s taken us a long while to get to this point, sat across a table from each other, talking like a pair of adults. Mostly over coffee. Occasionally something stronger.My dad has a huge personality, but he’s not a big drinker. Two wine gums and a glass of water and he’s pissed, he says. I used to drink a bit too much. Now we meet somewhere in the middle. We used to be too different, too much the same to do this. We had rows, we didn’t get on. But times change. Times change people. And now we have moments.My dad retired around the time I was stumbling into adulthood. After a life of work and activism, he took up creative pursuits, playing in bands and DJing world music, funk and jump blues, expanding on his lifelong passion for music. As funny as he is, he takes it all very seriously.I notice the ways I’m like him, now. And the ways I want to be like him. He’s probably the funniest person I know. Cutting, absurdist and lightning quick. He’s got a sharp reply before you’ve finished talking. And when chatter falls to quiet, he’ll point strangers out, invent stories about them, tell me who they’ve just had a row with.He’s also a walking encyclopedia for film, music and literature. Pick out an old soul single and he’ll tell you who played bass on the B-side.His morality is like a lodestone to me. My understanding of the world was forged by anti-apartheid fundraisers, picket lines and marches before I could walk, and it’s informed by him to this day.It’s only now, as I pick it all apart, I realise how much of him is in everything I write. Sometimes behind the words on the page or the mouths of characters. Sometimes just kibitzing in my ear, telling me to lighten up and try putting a joke in for once.So now we have fleeting moments of connection I treasure. Something he never got to do with his dad. Something that will always be with me.He can also be a bit of a putz, to be fair.My dad and I haven’t always gotten on, with my stubborn teenage behaviour and his old-fashioned views. But as my mum doesn’t really drink, my dad had someone to share a tipple with when I started drinking. Even now when I go home he jokingly asks when I’m moving back to be his drinking buddy. We found out about one another’s likes, pet peeves and favourite drinks (mine: tequila, his: whisky). I got to know about his fascinating life and him as a person, rather than just my dad. You think you would know these things about your parent, but over a drink, this authority figure fades and a friend emerges.Being someone who studied fashion and has always been obsessed with clothes, we often find ourselves chatting about the topic. You’d never know to look at him in his home-knitted vests, but my 76-year-old dad was quite the fashionista back in the day! He showed me his old Dior suits, bought with his first paychecks, and that ignited my interest in vintage fashion – which was a step outside of all my high-fashion magazines. I make my own clothes as much as possible, and when video-calling my seamstress of a mum for help, my dad is often in the background ready to pipe in with some advice – a longer hem, more fitted, a different button – and I hate to admit it, but a lot of the time he’s spot on.I know every child says this, but my dad is one of the best cooks on this earth (owning a successful takeaway for 20 years might have something to do with it). But one thing that’s certain to come up when we meet up is talk about food. I’m always bugging him about how he made a dish while I ply him with a drink, hoping for him to spill his secrets. As someone who could only boil pasta when I left home, I now make dishes from around the world. My love for cooking and fascination for flavours is down to him.I’m now an entertainment journalist at a leading women’s magazine. He may not know the people I write about in my job, but he’s always been supportive of me and keen to learn more about the industry I’m in. It wasn’t easy to get into, and I know that my perseverance in my career is the same as my dad’s “never quit” work ethic that got him from Hong Kong to the UK in his 20s, and got him his successful business after many less successful ones. And that’s certainly something to say cheers to.My dad, David, inspired my passion for both photography and Scotland – which I’ve had a lifelong love affair with.He’s Scottish, in fact he’s very Scottish – he’d play the bagpipes at my school and my two brothers and I would often wear kilts – but his work as a doctor meant I was born and raised in the East Midlands, which is billiard table flatness.When we would visit my granny in Forres as a kid my brain would be absolutely fried by the beauty of the place, I just always had an affinity and always felt Scottish – although when I moved there when I was 18 I was constantly and very much reminded that I wasn’t!My parents enrolled me at the Findhorn Foundation in Forres, which is a spiritual community, where I did something called the Youth Programme, which enabled me to develop my photography and led to my career, and had me moving back to Scotland as soon as I could.Dad loves my work and is so proud. He was an amateur photographer and had a dark room at our home, and I used his Rolleiflex as my first camera I’ve been lucky to have a dad who is so supportive.My two brothers are very academic, and obviously my dad is too, being a doctor – plus my grandparents were doctors, so I had a lot of pressure to “do something”. I’m dyslexic, and at school I just wasn’t academic, so photography really opened up so much.The Isle of Mull is both one of my and my dad’s favourite places in Scotland, and I love exploring every nook and cranny with my camera. It’s incredible and erse, a bit like a mini Scotland in one. It’s mountainous and moory and it has breathtaking beaches.It’s wild but it’s got towns like Tobermory where there’s theatre, and there’s a real sense of community about it, yet it still has this complete remoteness, which is what I love most about it.And of course, there’s the distillery in Tobermory. The whisky somehow manages to taste like Mull by encapsulating its myriad qualities. It’s beautiful, peaty and completely an island whisky.To learn more about the art of the Hebridean distillers visit tobermorydistillery"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c66fb5e294638a62378e953babfc77028df838ec/0_70_7360_4417/master/7360.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=f4d9ab8a01de8ab38b616718c1b86ac8","title":"tan france queer eye nightmare in the kitchen","story":"The Queer Eye star on the joys of school dinners, potluck suppers – and being a better cook than his mumUntil about two years ago the only thing my husband could make was a very nice chicken dumpling soup. He’d make it every few months, but that’s possibly because I’m a nightmare in the kitchen, always thinking I know a better way. Since my life changed dramatically, making Queer Eye, he’s taken on more responsibility and I return to roasted chicken and vegetables with balsamic honey. He’s on a souffle kick at the moment. He’s made one every day for the last two weeks.The first food I remember is roti, the Pakistani go-to. If Mum had been working late, she’d make roti flatbread in one minute – OK, a minute and a half. Prepared from scratch, with a little butter and sugar. I didn’t eat a lot of non-Pakistani food as a kid, I just found it too bland. I found it funny that Mum always called food “English” when it was derived from Italy or China or any country other than Pakistan.Until I was eight or nine I took packed lunches to school. Friends would say, “Your food smells bad”, but nothing really mean. They would tease me about it but were always curious to taste it, to the extent that I never had enough left for me. Then I started having school lunches. It’s strange how many people moan about them because I loved the desserts. There was a sponge with orangey glaze on top served with pink custard. I thought it was beautiful.As a teenager, I’d spend a few weeks every year in Bury at a factory where my grandfather made denim for Disney. That was probably my favourite place as a kid. I’d hit up a local kebab restaurant a few streets away, which did wonderful samosas and was run by a friend of my grandad. The things I learned in his factory set me up for working at Zara and Selfridges, and everything I’ve done since.Whenever I return to the UK I go to Nando’s with friends, which I love very much. “Going Nando’s” reminds me of being 19. I’d heard about the American restaurant chain Olive Garden on my favourite show, Will \u0026amp Grace. They had a couple of friends who’d always want to go to an Olive Garden but Will and Grace would get really frustrated by the choice. Anyway, early on, my now husband and I were communicating online. He wanted to hang out and I said, “OK, we’ll go to lunch, if we go to an Olive Garden.” He replied “Why on earth? They’re totally uninteresting.” I insisted: “If you want a date, that is where I want to go.” It had bland food and terrible decor, but I thought, “If he can keep me wildly entertained at the most boring restaurant on the planet, maybe he’s a keeper.”What I always say when a meal is perfect and delicious is, “This is fucking wicked”, after a really wide-eyed look to everybody at the table.FoodCake, chocolate preferably. Almost any meal I have is finished off with some cake or other.CoffeeFirst thing in the morning I grind Starbucks’ standard Pike Place Roast. I’ll have two cups. And here’s the thing – I’ll only ever drink half of each cup.RestaurantMy London go-to is Tayyabs, in Whitehall, or is it Whitechapel? I always mix the two up.

We want to write the future and not remember the past.”Carmena congratulated her successor and reminded him of the importance of both feminism and democracy.“We need to look after democracy because we know what it cost to bring democracy to this country,” she said. “It took so much, such an effort and so many lives that we cannot forget it.”The PP has signalled that one of its first acts in office will be rethinking and possibly scrapping Carmena’s urban low emissions zone, known as Madrid Central.Both the PP and Citizens have shifted further to the right over recent months in the hope of stopping their voters drifting towards Vox, whose tough line on Catalan independence, anti-immigration stance and tirades against feminism have attracted some traditional PP supporters.Citizens was subjected to fierce criticism last December after it cut a similar deal with Vox to govern the southern region of Andalucía.Earlier this week, the French government explicitly warned Citizens – which is part of the new liberal group in the European parliament led by Emmanuel Macron – that any further cosying up to the far right would have consequences.On Friday, France’s secretary of state for European affairs, Amélie de Montchalin, expressed “grave concerns” over such deals, adding: “We think that an alliance with the far right, like we have seen in Spain, is not an option.”France’s intervention led Vox to urge Spain’s acting prime minister, Pedro Sánchez, to “defend Spaniards’ independence” in the face of “unacceptable” interference.The former French prime minister Manuel Valls, who staged an unsuccessful bid to become the mayor of Barcelona in last month’s election, has also repeatedly warned his Citizens allies not to collaborate with Vox and called for a cordon sanitaire against the far right.Valls, who campaigned on a staunchly unionist platform, has thrown his weight behind Ada Colau, the leftwing mayor of Barcelona, who secured a second term in the Catalan capital in a vote on Saturday afternoon.The pro-independence Catalan Republican Left party won marginally more votes than Colau’s group, but Colau retained office after reaching an agreement with the Catalan branch of the socialist party and Valls’ councillors.Her election drew an angry response from some Catalan secessionists, who gathered in central Barcelona to protest and to chant, “Colau és un frau!” (“Colau is a fraud!”).The wealthy northeastern region is governed by pro-independence parties. Although Citizens won the most seats and the largest share of the vote in the last regional election in December 2017, it could not assemble a governing coalition.The focus will now be on Sánchez’s efforts to form a national government.While his Spanish Socialist Workers’ party finished first in the general election at the end of April, it fell well short of a majority in the congress of deputies.Sánchez has agreed to cooperate with the anti-austerity Podemos party to work towards building a government, but has ruled out a coalition deal. He has also raised the possibility of holding another general election if his efforts to resume office are thwarted in parliament.Another vote – which would be Spain’s fourth in under four years – would favour the socialists as it would hurt Podemos and see the three rightwing parties in renewed competition for votes.

In November, Guatemalans overtook Mexicans as the largest group detained at the US border, and the regions where most migrants set out from are overwhelmingly indigenous.Cabrera pledges to tackle the inequalities of Guatemalan society with a sweeping constitutional reform to ensure fair representation for the country’s indigenous, Afro-Guatemalan and mestizo peoples.Other priorities include stopping illegal land-grabs, ending immunity for elected officials, nationalisation of electricity, and legal scrutiny of mining, dam and agricultural licences sanctioned without consultation.“I didn’t ask for this role or buy it – I was elected for this mission by the people, and I’m daring to break the silence as a Mam woman,” Cabrera told the Observer.Cabrera, who speaks Spanish as a second language, grew up in El Asintal, an impoverished community on the west coast, where she worked on coffee fincas with her parents and siblings, and was married at 15.“I came from nothing – from under the rubbish. But for many years I’ve worked with communities suffering lack of opportunities, undignified wages, migration and violence as a result of structural problems and corruption,” she said.She was selected by grassroots members of Codeca, the country’s largest campesino organisation to represent its newly formed political party the Movement for the Liberation of Peoples (MLP).Cabrera’s political hopes were given a major boost by a recent online campaign organised by volunteer communication experts who designed the slogan Yo Elijo Dignidad (I choose dignity).As the buzz around Cabrera got louder, the criticism got uglier. She’s been derided as uneducated and uncouth, and condemned as a radical communist who wants to turn Guatemala into the next Venezuela – an accusation she denies.“She’s given a face and voice to the excluded majority with a radical political project to disrupt and transform the oppressive state. She’s unlike anything we’ve seen since the 1940s,” said Andrea Ixchiu, a member of her communications team. “This candidacy is historic.”The election race has been marred by repeated accusations of corruption as a UN-backed commission against impunity (Cicig) prepares to leave the country after President Jimmy Morales unilaterally declared an end of its mandate.The current frontrunner is Sandra Torres, a former first lady accused of money laundering and illicit campaign financing. In second place is Alejandro Giammattei who was director of prisons while a clandestine death squad carried out extrajudicial killings of detainees.In third place is the businessman Roberto Arzú, who faces sanctions in Miami for failing to comply with a court order to pay off multimillion-dollar debts to his political strategist.The odds are stacked against Cabrera, who closed her campaign last Saturday by thanking in Mam her supporters who had travelled overnight from remote villages with homemade signs.But for many at the event, the hopeful atmosphere was reminiscent of the 2015 anti-corruption protests that eventually led to the resignation, arrest and imprisonment of the then president, Otto Pérez Molina.“It’s time the state stopped being racist – and for that we need structural reforms,” said Linda Rabanales, 24, an anthropology student. “That’s why I’m voting for Thelma.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ad5770775dbcdec2c69410bd8a9dbe2119ed9c94/0_308_4928_2959/master/4928.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=d5f3f3477442526905081912c6571d5b","title":"namibia drought auction 1000 wild animals","story":"Southern African nation aiming to limit starvation and generate conservation fundsDrought-hit Namibia has authorised the sale of at least 1,000 wild animals – including elephants and giraffes – to limit loss of life and generate US$1.1 million for conservation, the authorities confirmed Saturday.The authorities declared a national disaster last month, and the meteorological services in the southern African nation estimate that some parts of the country faced the deadliest drought in as many as 90 years.“The grazing condition in most of our parks is extremely poor and if we do not reduce the number of animals, this will lead to loss of an animals due to starvation,” Muyunda said.In April, an agriculture ministry report said 63,700 animals died in 2018 because of deteriorating grazing conditions brought on by dry weather.Namibia’s cabinet announced this week that the government would sell about 1,000 wild animals.They include 600 disease-free buffalos, 150 springbok, 65 oryx, 60 giraffes, 35 eland, 28 elephants, 20 impala and 16 kudus – all from national parks.The aim is to raise $1.1 m that will go towards a state-owned Game Products Trust Fund for wildlife conservation and parks management.The government said there were currently about 960 buffalos in its national parks, 2,000 springbok, 780 oryx and 6,400 elephants.The auction was advertised in local newspapers from Friday.Namibia, a country of 2.4 million people, has previously made calls for aid to assist in the drought emergency that has already affected over 500,000 people.In April the government announced that it would spend about $39,400 on drought relief this year to buy food, provide water tankers and provide subsidies to farmers."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3919980.1560097910!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government vows to help teachers abroad return home","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tWhen asked if the Government would consider more pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area, the Minister replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions. File photograph: GettyMinister for Education Joe McHugh has pledged to tackle barriers preventing emigrant teachers returning home but has warned he does not have “any quick-fix ideas”.Mr McHugh is due to visit the United Arab Emirates this week to host a series of town hall-style meetings with teachers. The initiative is part of a drive to make it easier for them to return to Ireland.School management bodies say a shortage of teachers is causing a “crisis” due to a lack of substitute cover at primary level and qualified teachers in key subjects at second level.Speaking in advance of his visit, Mr McHugh said he wants to identify practical steps that could make it easier for teachers to return home.A key area he says he will examine is providing a mechanism to recognise teachers’ middle-management experience in schools abroad. Many emigrant teachers express frustration that, despite serving as heads of department, this experience is often not recognised here.“We have to look at the progression of teachers, what new skills, what experience they build up in terms of responsibility,” said Mr McHugh. “We have to open up a wider conversation over the roles of responsibility teachers have abroad and how we incorporate that into the system when they return home. I don’t have any quick-fix ideas around it . . . but those teachers bring experience, talent, insight and new perspectives.”Among the obstacles regularly cited by emigrant teachers include difficulties securing full-time posts at home, red-tape involving the Teaching Council as well as the cost of living.Online portalMr McHugh said a representative from the council will join him for the visit to take on board any ideas for streamlining registration or other issues. He said a new online portal, which opened last week, is an example of the kind of practical steps that would assist emigrant teachers.The portal – which operates under the title turasabhaile or “journey home” – will give teachers the opportunity to register their contact details, CVs, preferred employment location and specialist subjects.Mr McHugh, a former teacher who spent a year teaching in the UAE in the mid-1990s, said the visit also aimed to pay tribute to the contribution of Irish teachers abroad. He said teachers were magnificent ambassadors for the State and were boosting the country’s reputation wherever they go.There are an estimated 2,000 Irish-qualified teachers based in the UAE and hundreds have signed up for three meetings with the Minister in Abu Dhabi, El Ain and Dubai.When asked if the Government would consider additional pay for teachers based in the greater Dublin area – which faces some of the most acute shortages – Mr McHugh replied that the cost of living was also an issue for other professions.He is primarily concerned with looking at the kind of practical steps that can be taken in the short to medium term."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Founding member of Provisional IRA was \u0026lsquounrepentant\u0026rsquo, Belfast cathedral toldMajella Moynihan was charged with breaching disciplinary rules in relationship with colleagueJim Price and Aidan Rowsome died when light aircraft went down in field near MooneTaoiseach says he is heeding warning from Irish Fiscal Advisory Council in advance of October\u0026rsquos budgetFrom Alcock and Brown\u0026rsquos transatlantic crossing to global commercial flights, the 20th century saw astonishing developments in aviationEvent marks famous 1919 flight of Alcock and Brown from Canada to ConnemaraVaradkar says insurers have been warned that \u0026lsquoIreland isn\u0026rsquot Treasure Island\u0026rsquoAdrian Murphy (43) was originally from Co Kilkenny but had been living in LondonPlane being used for training flight appears to have broken in two on impact in a fieldPaschal Donohoe may table a budget in which spending is significantly curtailedDistiller makes statement on Facebook after rugby club\u0026rsquos signing of Irish ex-internationalPublication of report on implementing the Sl\u0026aacuteintecare plan has been shelved until autumnEuropediatrics 2019 in Dublin discusses the causes and prevention of childhood obesityMason Hayes \u0026amp Curran brought in to assess legal liability over abuse casesCommission has invested heavily in fitness for its members and staff since private gym opened in 2005Affected property owners expected to receive average compensation payment of \u0026euro25,000Mary Mitchell O\u0026rsquoConnor says proposals are \u0026lsquonot worth sacrificing a community for\u0026rsquoLatest figures show six criminal investigations into false claims opened every monthOPW chairman stresses increases not comparable to children\u0026rsquos hospital overruns"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3927211.1560608284!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"government preparing to take decisions to rein in public spending says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\t Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said the Government is   preparing two separate budgets, based on whether Britain will leave the European Union at the end of October with or without a deal. File photograph: Gareth ChaneyCollins The Government is preparing to take decisions that some will see as “lacking compassion” to rein in public spending, the Taoiseach Leo Varadkar has warned.After the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (Ifac) this week described the Government’s medium-term spending plans as “not credible”, the Taoiseach said he was heeding the advice in advance of October’s budget.Mr Varadkar said it is “okay” for spending to continue to grow - with investment needed in infrastructure, health, education and housing - but he added that it cannot be allowed to increase too fast.“We need to make sure the spending increases are more in the range of 4 or 5 per cent rather than 7 or 8 (per cent),” he said.The exchequer is “doing really well” in terms of corporation tax as “companies who maybe didn’t pay a lot of tax in the past are now paying an awful lot of tax”, the Taoiseach said.But he cautioned that the government “can’t assume that money will always be there”.“This particular budget coming will need to be tighter than the last one in terms of spending,” he said.Mr Varadkar said this will mean having to “say no” to demands for more public funding at times.“That is why we will have to make some of these decisions which people may find lacking compassion,” he said.The Government is currently preparing two separate budgets, based on whether Britain will leave the European Union at the end of October with or without a deal.Mr Varadkar said it will decide in September which budget to go with - to be announced in the first two weeks of October - based on the likely outcome of negotiations between London and Brussels. “The potential is there - a growing risk, in fact - of a no deal Brexit, so this won’t be a normal budget,” he told The Marian Finucane Show, presented by Brendan O’Connor, on RTÉ Radio 1 on Saturday.“We are developing two budgets for two different scenarios, one being a hard Brexit no-deal, in which case we won’t have to worry about the economy overheating. We will be in a totally different environment if that happens, the economy will slow down dramatically.“The other budget is for one where we have a deal and the economy continues to grow and we continue to have these capacity issues around full employment and the risk of inflation and so on.“We will decide at some point in September which of those two budgets we will go for.”"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3926042.1560527692!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"the outsider candidate with a vital message for democrats","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tDemocratic presidential candidate and former Colorado governor John Hickenlooper speaks during the California Democratic Convention in San Francisco, California on June 1st. Photograph: Stephen LamReutersThe next US presidential election may be 17 months away, but the race to become the Democratic nominee is well under way.In echoes of the Republican campaign for 2016, which saw dozens compete to become the party’s nominee, this time it’s Democrats who are jostling in a crowded field. Twenty-four candidates have thrown their hat in the ring, arguing that they are the right person to take on Donald Trump in 2020.Although the entry of Joe Biden into the race in April changed the dynamic of the contest as he rapidly became the frontrunner, it’s early days.One of the presidential hopefuls is John Hickenlooper. This week the former Colorado governor brought his wares to Washington, where he addressed the National Press Club.In such a crowded field it’s tricky to stand out from the crowd. Hickenlooper can’t even depend on being the candidate with the unusual name – he has tough competition in this regard from Pete Buttigieg, the youthful mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who is now widely known as “Mayor Pete” such is the confusion about the pronunciation of his Maltese surname.But while Hickenlooper may not be a household name, he comes to the table with a respectable political record.Walked the walkA former two-term mayor of Denver who was governor of Colorado between 2011 and 2018, Hickenlooper is popular in his home state. He presided over a strong economy and left office having implemented a range of progressive social measures such as the legalisation of marijuana and the expansion of pre-kindergarten education.He has an interesting personal story to boot – having been made redundant as a geologist in the 1980s, he started a brewery business in a neglected area of downtown Denver, before running for mayor.Though the genial 67-year-old is trailing at about 1 per cent in the polls, he made no apologies about his decision at his event in Washington. “I am the only person running who has actually done what everyone else is talking about.”He promptly turned his attention to Bernie Sanders, lambasting the vision of “democratic socialism” outlined by the Vermont senator earlier in the week.“I fundamentally disagree that we should do away with the Democratic regulated capitalism that has guided this country for over 200 years,” he said, criticising his colleagues for not calling Sanders out.“Democrats must say loudly and clearly that we are not socialists. If we do not we will end up helping to re-elect the worst president in American history,” he said, correctly pointing out that Republicans are effectively using the socialist label to attack Democrats in the run-up to the election.Refreshing optimismInstead, Hickenlooper, a self-made millionaire, is firmly positioning himself as a centrist. Pointing to his experience in governing Colorado, he said that “sometimes you have to talk to Republicans”. American capitalism has to be reformed, he said, but this can’t be done by “endlessly expanding government or by demonising the private sector”.His message is that Medicare for all – the idea of a universal, government-paid healthcare programme – and the Green New Deal – a climate-conscious government investment programme – are pie-in-the-sky policies which won’t wash with most Americans.Nonetheless, for all his big ideas, Hickenlooper is unlikely to make the cut when the Democratic field whittles down. Though he just reached the threshold to qualify as one of the 20 Democratic candidates taking part in the first debate later this month in Miami, he faces formidable competition from better-known candidates such as Biden, senators Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren and former Texas congressman Beto O’Rourke.This is not stopping him from trying, however. He has made several trips to early-voting states like Iowa, New Hampshire and North Carolina since announcing his candidacy in March.His sunny brand of optimism is refreshing.

More than 1.2 million people born in the 1950s reported owning an additional property - including buy-to-let and overseas - between 2014 and 2016.The number of British adults who own a second property has grown by 53 per cent since 2001, sitting at 5.5 million people and a total value of £941 billion.The figures come despite the overall decline of home ownership across the UK, which peaked in 2003 at 58 per cent of families but then continued falling until 2016.The rise in multiple property ownership is down to a “rapid growth” in the number of people buying houses in Britain to rent out, the report said, with almost two million people - the majority being older, higher income and southern - owning buy-to-lets.The second home boom has also benefited millennials, with seven per cent of those born in the 1960s and 1980s having additional property wealth by the age of 29,  the Foundation’s Game of Homes report found.The “surprisingly rapid rise” of multiple property ownership among the young generation could mean that those currently in their 30s may be on the way to similar rates of additional property ownership as today’s middle-aged cohorts.“If we were to redraw the chart of additional property ownership by age in thirty years’ time, there is a chance it might not look particularly different from today,” the report said.Buy to letThe  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

They are to be re-laid in more than 110 quieter, less trafficked streets and alleyways in the city centre, in many cases replacing asphalt surfaces.Those streets include the upmarket Via Condotti near the Spanish Steps, which is lined with designer shops such as Gucci and Prada, as well as Via del Corso, another shopping street that runs through the heart of the city from Piazza Venezia to Piazza del Popolo.A puddle surrounded by sanpietrini cobbles reflects the ColosseumThe work – which is likely to bring disruption to a city already notorious for its crazy traffic – is due to start later this year.It will ensure that much of the city centre retains its picturesque character. “They are an essential part of our history,” said Ms Raggi.Roberto Botta, a senior official with Rome city council, said: “For every cobblestone that we remove from one road, we will be re-laying them in another.”The  values your comments but kindly requests all posts are on topic, constructive and respectful.

You silly old Auntie! Despite the BBC’s unapologetically anti-Brexit bias, millions will go to the grave with a soft spot for the Beeb.But the brutal truth is that young adults born this century do not give a damn about the BBC. My -year-old daughter and her generation have no contact with the corporation.These kids think David Attenborough is that nice old man saving the planet on Netflix. They are big on BuzzFeed. They get their ­entertainment from YouTube, Netflix and Instagram.Even Facebook and Twitter seem horribly old hat to these teenagers. The BBC inspires no love at all in the millennial heart. To these st Century sprogs, born with a smart phone in their hand, the idea of paying £. a year to the BBC is absurd.Increasingly, it seems absurd to even those of us who fondly remember Bill And Ben, The ­Flowerpot Men. The licence fee is a telly poll tax from another century.The BBC only gets away with raking in a total of £billion a year in licence fees because of the generations who grew up when the BBC was the only show in town.The BBC was extremely foolish to show older ­viewers such wanton ­disrespect. Because now some painfully dficult questions are being asked of the broadcaster.Why does the BBC need to send hundreds of its staff to groove at Glastonbury every year  Does Gary ­Lineker REALLY deserve an eye-watering £,, per annum And why does ANYONE need to pay the licence fee in a world of Netflix, YouTube, Amazon, Sky, BT and the infinite ersions of the internet Is there ANY place for a compulsory TV tax  Yes — the last century! The BBC has committed an epic act of self-harm. It was also a crass miscalculation by greedy BBC bosses to announce they were cancelling free TV licences for the over-s just one week after the nation honoured the generation who paid for our liberty with their youth, their blood and their lives.Victor Gregg,  years old, is a former prisoner of war who spoke for the nation. “It’s only days agowere patting all these old people on the head and calling them heroes, this generation which has saved the world,” said Victor.“These are the people now who are over . They’ve lived their le. They’re knackered.”Will the BBC prosecute ­Normandy veterans and their elderly widows for non-payment of the licence fee  Not a great look.And what a sickening prospect that any poor or vulnerable person could be prosecuted for not ­stumping up £. a year to finance the bottomless BBC trough.The BBC’s mugging of the over-s is a wake-up call for us all. This bloated, arrogant corporation has been indulged, protected and bankrolled for too long.The fat cats at the BBC need to tighten their bulging belts. Sky-high salaries need to come down. Grotesque waste — like the annual BBC beano to Glastonbury — has to be cut back.The BBC’s expansionist digital empire needs dialling down. Profligate BBC bosses must start to live within their means. £billion a year is plenty. And, yes, we need to start a national debate about the relevance of the licence fee in the modern world.And above all, the BBC needs to start showing some respect to the older citizens of this country. Because this breaking news just in.Nobody  is watching.JOKING about throwing battery acid in someone’s face is exactly like joking about rape. It will never – and can never – be funny, no matter how much you disagree with the views of the person who is being raped or disfigured by acid.Luckily for Jo Brand, she did not recommend throwing battery acid at a Labour MP or a member of an ethnic community. They would never have let her inside Broadcasting House again.But because Jo only joshed about throwing battery acid at right-wing politicians, her paydays at the BBC are safe.And although Brand was investigated by the police, I suspect the BBC now loves her even more.The comic insists she was joking and would never encourage anyone to throw battery acid at a politician for daring to have views that Jo disagrees with, likewe should possibly respect democracy and leave the EU.What a relief. And I will say this in Jo’s defence – I never saw anyone less likely to throw away a calorie-stuffed milkshake than this cruel, unfunny, virtue-signalling fatberg. Just kidding, Jo!And can we please stop referring to the children abused in Haiti as “prostitutes”  What happened with those girls in Haiti, some as young as  , was not prostitution. It was survival sex.If you are starving in a disaster zone, you do not have sex with a middle-aged charity worker for money. You do it to stay alive.AFTER Michael Gove’s cocaine confession, Boris Johnson was mocked for saying that he was not sure that he actually took the drug.But the scary truth is that nobody ever really knows what they are putting up their nose because this stuff is not regulated.It comes with no list of ingredients. There is no quality control. Cocaine is routinely cut with talcum powder, icing sugar and worse.Anyone who takes “cocaine” might believe they are on the real-deal Bolivian marching power, but you simply never know.It could easily be rat poison you are putting up your hooter. That is why I always warn my children that they should never touch cocaine with a barge pole, or indeed a rolled-up fiver.THE Cannes Film Festival was agog at the sight of ­Vietnamese model Ngoc Trinh, who rocked up to the premiere of A Hidden Le, Terrence Malick’s painfully po-faced film about a conscientious objector in World War Two, wearing a mere rumour of a little black dress.Since ing to Vietnam, Ngoc has been heavily criticised by the Vietnamese government, who have launched an enquiry into whether she violated the country’s public decency laws.“I don’t carepeople criticise it because I felt pretty in the dress, which made a good impression on the Cannes red carpet,” said Ngoc.The Vietnamese authorities should give the girl a break. She is a fine ambassador for their wonderful country.

By the time Craig, , recovers, his co-star Rami Malek has other filming commitments.“You can’t have a Bond film where  does not come face to face with the villain so it’s a complete nightmare logistically,” said one insider.Even this torrential rain has buggered things up for the production as Pinewood Studios, Bucks, was trying to pass itself off as sun-drenched Cuba.

And the RSPCA said August was its busiest month, with , dogs handed in.Dominic says: “People get puppies in the summer thinking the holidays are a good time to settle them in.“But they have no idea how much work is involved. Puppies look cute and kids love them but the first  weeks is such an important time.“If you don’t get it right, it can be dangerous. You need to spend three hours a day training and socialising them. If dogs have behavioural problems by ten months, it is usually due to being mollycoddled or not trained at all.”Dominic says owners who cuddle puppies for hours instead of training them to be independent end up with antisocial and unruly dogs.His new book The Perfect Puppy Project outlines  what to do for the first six months.Here are his five top tips for new puppy owners.❶Get outside from day one. Show them the world isn’t scary. They will be calmer and confident.❷Think long-term. It might be cuteyour puppy jumps up to greet you or runs away with something  it stole but fast-forward a few months and it will be a nightmare.❸Use a crate. This will prevent problems with house-training and separation anxiety.❹Use food to bond and build a relationship. Teach them tricks and walking to heel. Use rewards for recall and to keep them entertained.❺Enjoy your puppy. They are hardwired to enjoy playing and you can become their best friend.Jordan  woke his parents Chris, , and Tina, , and then went back for Diesel, now five.

She pants and won’t lie down on the backseat.  Owner, Brenda Muffett, of Peterborough, has tried crates and seat belt attachments without success.Sean says: “It sounds like she’s experiencing either anxiety or excitement.“It’s advisable to get her really used to getting in and out of the car, on gradually longer trips, and rewarding her only when she’s behaving as you want her to. Build up slowly, so she knows what’s expected of her. A vest called a Thundershirt is good for anxious dogs. This puts gentle pressure on your dog and can help them feel calmer and more secure.“Attaching her in the front seat may be helpful, as travelling in the back can sometimes be disconcerting to dogs, with too much sensory overload and things whizzing past windows.”PETER ROSS has a two- year-old boxer called Betty who won’t stop stealing balls from other dogs.  She’s not aggressive to other dogs but it is getting embarrassing for Peter, from Leeds, and she refuses to stop until she wins the ball.Sean says: “Some dogs just get a little neurotic and really love balls.“It’s nothing to worry about, unless it’s causing aggressive encounters with other dogs. You could try substituting ball-chasing for other fun activities – like doing tricks for rewards, obstacle courses or agility.“The fact you’re taking her out with a tennis ball won’t be helping, as she’s  eager to please and focused on when and where you’ll throw it.

Meanwhile, the UK experienced its largest contraction in three years as car plants shut down and production dropped  per cent amid Brexit fears. Canadian T-shirt firm Gildan, whose label is on the Leave.EU T-shirts, has them made at a factory in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. Anti-poverty campaigners say its employees, who live in shanty towns nearby, are paid well below a living wage. A junior machine operator earns around the local minimum wage of £. a month for a -hour a week , far less than the £ campaigners say is needed to live comfortably.    Clothing production in Bangladesh is often criticised by human rights groups. In , , people, mostly garment workers, were killed when the Rana Plaza factory collapsed. Mr Farage campaigned alongside Leave.EU in the run-up to the  EU referendum, when Mr Banks was a major backer. Mr Farage stepped down as UKIP leader later that year, but remained an MEP before launching the Brexit Party in March this year. Leave.EU founder Mr Banks gave Mr Farage £, to cover his living expenses in the year that followed. This was not declared to the EU and this month the European Parliament called a hearing into the donation. Mr Farage refused to attend, saying he did not need to declare it because at the time he was about to leave politics and start a new le in America. He insisted he had not received “any private money for political purposes”. Mr Banks said he had “willingly helped Farage and was honoured to do so”, adding: “This was all designed to help Nigel get out of politics.” Asked about having campaign T-shirts made in Bangladesh, Leave.EU spokesman Andy Wigmore responded: “So what ” He added: We are internation­alists, not little Europeans, and we love to support Commonwealth countries.” Yesterday a Gildan spokesman said that since  the firm had spent nearly £million improving its Dhaka factory, which employs , people.

And she told of a ‘litany of broken promises’ under a mayor who ‘flew by the seat of his pants.’ Ms McCartney said: “The thought of him being in Downing Street is terrying. “At a stage where the world seems to be increasingly uncertain, when our country is ided, to have a chancer in Downing Street is extremely dangerous.    Ms McCartney, who has been a member of the London Assembly since , regularly scrutinised Mr Johnson as part of the Police and Crime Committee as well as at Mayoral Qestions. She said: “I spent eight years questioning him and never got a straight answer. “He was a chancer. “He never read his briefs, had no eye for detail and flew by the seat of his pants. “I used to put serious questions to him - I chaired the London Police and Crime Committee. “I led the investigation into his proposed purpose of water cannons. “It was quite clear from my questioning of him that he was just going to buy them despite all the evidence. “And actually didn’t even read the Assembly report that laid out all the details and problems - not only problems in licensing them but that it would actually be dangerous to use on the streets of London.”    Mr Johnson bought three water cannons from Germany in  as a response to the London riots. There were  faults with the cannons - meaning the total cost including repair was £, including £, to get them repainted and £ to have radios and CD players fitted. But after Theresa May banned their use in , they were eventually sold for scrap, bringing in just £,. Ms McCartney said: “And that’s just typical. “His mayoralty was a litany of broken promises. “He thought he could get away from any scrutiny or questioning by just blustering, by not answering and by relying on his character. “And I can tell you that most people - and this is cross-party - on the London Assembly didn’t buy it for a moment. “Even his own side was regularly frustrated with his responses.” Other failed schemes include the failed Garden Bridge, which cost £ million of public money. Figures also show the Garden Bridge Trust spent £, on a website and £, on a gala event. Mr Johnson also blew £m on Routemaster buses.    In November , an independent review by accountancy firm Moore Stephens, into the decisions made under Mr Johnson’s Mayoralty around the Olympic Stadium, found that the cost of the transformation of the stadium after the Olympics for use by West Ham was £ million higher than anticipated. Ms McCartney believes Mr Johnson’s lack of attention to detail was behind the bungles. She added: “I was once arranged a meeting over a road scheme in my area. “I told people ‘We’ve only got half an hour with him but we need to get it done within ten minutes otherwise his attention will wane. “Sure enough it did.” Other broken promises included closing ten fire stations, getting rid of  engines and  firefighting jobs - despite pledging there would be no reduction in cover. Mr Johnson also pledged no London Underground ticket offices would close. Mr Johnson closed them all, with  jobs going.    Mr Johnson also pledged an end to rough sleeping by the Olympics but the number of doubled numbers of rough sleeping by end of his second term. Ms McCartney said: “He just loses concentration and blusters and fidgets. “When it was a question he didn’t like he was glib. He just blustered.” “He would talk a good game but never followed them up with action at all.” “It’s all about him. He’s a chancer. He doesn’t treat any issues with the seriousness they deserve.” “People have said regularly that his concentration wanders. “And I have experienced that as well. In Assembly meetings, the first  minutes or so he would try and answer things but by the end he was all over the place. “He obviously didn’t read his briefs. “His staff was constantly irritated by it because he couldn’t answer any questions.” "},{"url":null,"title":"obese businessman looks stunning busty","story":"NewsObese businessman looks stunning as busty Danielle after turning le aroundHer le has been totally transformed since Darren became Danielle following £, cosmetic surgery makeoverShareByHattie Lee:,  JUN NewsHow her old le used to be... \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailCurvy Danielle Hallet loves bumping into old schoolfriends – because the chances of them recognising her are zero. And it’s not just down to her losing an astonishing  STONE in two years. It’s because when they knew her she was a BOY called Darren. Now, after spending nearly £, on cosmetic surgery and a gender reassignment op, Darren’s transformation into Danielle is complete – and she couldn’t be happier. “I’ve gone from a st baldy with a beard to a st brunette with boobs. Le is good,” says the -year-old software engineer who runs her own IT business. “I’ve never felt so attractive. The funniest thing is when people I’ve known for years or knew at school just don’t recognise me at all. It confirms to me just how far I’ve come.” Danielle has always known she was in the wrong body. “My earliest memories are of wanting to be a girl,” she says. “I went through school unhappily living a lie and piling on weight. I was st by the time I was .”    After years of comfort-eating, she was  when she began private hormone therapy and started living as a woman in  with the support of her family. Four years later, at st, she had a gastric band op in Birmingham but found she could still binge afterwards. She persevered with her dream by having a £, boob job in . But it was only after a private £, mini-gastric bypass in Belgium in  that Danielle, by then st, began the remarkable transformation for which she had been saving money for  years . “My weight had held back my dreams of properly becoming a woman. But after the Belgium op, still quite unheard of in the UK, it began dropping off me,” she says. “I felt ‘yes, I can do this now’.” So in  she began private op-hopping around the world using the best surgeons she could afford. A face and neck lt and eyebag removal in Belgium was followed by a tummy tuck and bingo wings lts in Estonia. By spring she was back in the UK for a hair intralace op to cover Darren’s old bald patch followed by more work on her face and an upper thigh lt.    Summer buttock implants in Belgium were followed by autumn dermal cheeks lips and forehead fillers in the UK – and a November buttocks lt in Turkey. Her gender reassignment op was in Bangkok in February. She had on average a procedure a month but admits she “wouldn’t recommend it”. Danielle, of Swansea, adds: “The gender reassignment was by far the most painful. But being a woman made it so worth it.” She says she saved to go private as “NHS waiting lists are huge and there’s no choice of surgeon”. Now she’s a size , on a protein-rich diet, and even considering dating. “I’m attracted to both sexes and will keep my eyes peeled,” says Danielle. She’s even started a YouTube channel. “Losing weight and staying motivated can be so tough,” she says. “I want to help others by sharing my story.” "},{"url":null,"title":"panto actress fell love ugly","story":"NewsPanto actress fell in love with ugly sister star, beat cancer then had miracle babyEXCLUSIVE: Laura Davies and Simon had their own fairytale - but there was to be a fight for survival before her happy endingShareCommentsByAndy Crick:,  JUN NewsBeat cancer  Oh yes she did! \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum who was swept off her feet while playing Cinderella in panto found out she had cancer – but it’s behind her now, and she’s given birth to a miracle baby. Laura Davies met future husband Simon when he starred opposite her as one of the Ugly Sisters. But six months after she gave birth to their first child, Laura was diagnosed with stage-three bowel cancer and told that she might have no more than five years to live. Doctors warned her that it might have spread to her oies and ­fallopian tubes, as well as her liver. Laura, , recalled: “They said they needed to do surgery straightaway, and they would more than likely have to take out my oies. “I said, ‘Does that mean I won’t be able to have any more children ’ “And the doctor told me, ‘At the moment we’re just trying to focus on survival to five years’. Then it got a bit real. My le changed overnight.”    When she went under the kne at the Royal Surrey County Hospital, Guildford, in June , doctors removed part of her bowel and half her liver – but found the cancer had not spread to her reproductive organs. However, oncologist Dr Tony Dhillon advised her that the gruelling bouts of chemotherapy she would need to complete her treatment were very likely to leave her infertile. But two and a half years after being told she was in remission, Laura and Simon, , decided to try giving daughter India, now five, the brother or sister she was begging for. And within a month, youth theatre boss Laura, of Godalming, Surrey, found out she was pregnant. She said: “After my treatment, my oncologist said, ‘Look,you want to try for another baby, give it a go – but I’m not promising anything. The chemo is really strong stuff’. “So I kind of knew it wasn’t going to be very likely, but we thought we’d give it a go. I was quite keen for India to have a sibling. “As soon as someone says you’re not going to be able to have any more ­children, then you want it a bit more.”    Baby Georgia, now eight months old, was born a month early, but in good health. Laura added: “India would ask, ‘Why can’t I have a sister ’ “I said, ‘Mummy and Daddy aren’t going to have any more babies. But you’ve got lots of friends and sometimes it’s great not to have siblings because siblings can steal your toys’.” Dr Dhillon – who has been ­introduced to new arrival Georgia – said: “Laura took on the treatment like she was on a mission. “She’s an example to others that this disease can be overcome. Seeing her with her new baby makes me feel proud to be a doctor.” Laura admits she had turned a blind eye to a telltale sign of bowel cancer – blood in her stools – for three years. She added: “If I’d never got pregnant again I wouldn’t have been devastated because I was so grateful I was alive. “But when I found out I just said, ‘Oh my God’ over and over again. Simon won’t go near me now – he doesn’t want any more children… “But now Georgia is here, it feels like she should always have been here.” "},{"url":null,"title":"best goals amazing strike lottery","story":"AdvertorialGirl scores unbelievable goal against boys team - and their reactions are pricelessThe astonishing strike features in a fantastic new video celebrating National Lottery funding to local football and the impact this has on iniduals and communitiesShareByDave Masters:,  JUN Advertorialthis.style.displaynone\"Video LoadingVideo UnavailableClick to playTap to playThe video will start in CancelPlay now,adData:,videoData:,mainEntityOfPage:https:www.mirror news video camelots-emotional-video-winning-against-,customFields:,suggestedData:,,,,,,,,,],gtmContainerId:GTM-MTHP,gtmFbiaContainerId:GTM-PNLXFZS,trackingData:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true,info:,article:,info:],hasLeadVideo:true,interaction:,features:, offlineSupport :, combinedPrompt :true, scope :  news uk-news  , theme : # , title : Mirror UK News , options :,bundledCss:,swipeNavigation.endpoint:https:mab.data.tm-awx pwa-swipe,mvtTests.enable:true,swipeNavigation:true,irisClientToken:,externalBrandCSS:true,irisTvEnabled:true,imaVersion:,displayPrebidEnabled:true,modularCss:true,nativeAppBanner:true,amazonVideoTagEnabled:true,amazonTagEnabled:true,mvtTests:,video.suppressDates:true\"\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWeaposve seen some amazing goals from female footballers over the past week but this one might top the lot - and itaposs from a aposkeeper. The astonishing strike features in a fantastic new video celebrating the £m raised by The National Lottery for grassroots football. It sees a mystery youngster unleash a rocket from just inside her own half, which wrong-foots the boy in the opposition net and flies in. But what caught our eye was the looks of utter shock on the faces of the boys who canapost quite believe what has happened. Football has the power to change lives - but moments like this prove it’s not just the players at the top of the game who are making a dference.  It’s on the local parks and playing fields where le-changing moments are happening everyday, right across the UK.  Since , players of The National Lottery have raised £billion for good causes, with over £ million being used to support grassroots football initiatives. That’s money that has been raised by you. For every ticket sold, a slice of the money received goes to a huge iety of projects, big and small.  From building new football venues, to inspiring future generations to participate, projects like these have helped thousands of people improve their lives, and made Britain’s communities a better place to live and work.  It’s thanks to National Lottery funding that young players like -year-old Charlie Fryhas found a route into football - despite his disability. Charlie was devastated when he was told he was unable to play mainstream football after being diagnosed with Asperger’s Syndrome seven years ago.  Then his mother Rachel and father Lee discovered Team United, a Scottish-based charity which has received National Lottery funding and offers young players with disabilities a route back into the game. As mum Rachel explains, the results have been le-changing. “Charlie was seven when he was diagnosed. “We were told that because of his sensory issues, he’ll wouldn’t be able to play football which was devastating for him.  “But Team United came at just the right time. The coaches there can read his body language, and understand it. They know how to coach children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. “He’s now back playing mainstream football with Bathgate Thistle Whites  and they won West Lothian County Cup final last year, with Charlie being voted the team’s player of the year.” Another youngster to benefit is Sophie Brett , who has been able to turn her le around thanks to National Lottery funding.  The -year-old battled PTSD and turned to self-harming after a dficult childhood saw her taken into foster care. But thanks to Swansea-based charity Street Football Wales, which received £k of National Lottery funding in March, Sophie has started to turn her le around. “I’d always had a passion for football and in  my support worker put me in touch with Street Football Wales, who brought me along to a match day once a month, she explained.  “The staff there have all the time in the world to help anyone and everyone – it’s a safe environment to be in. I’m a much better person and my le is much brighter. “There’s light at the end of the tunnel now.” - An average of  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district - £bn raised for good causes since - Around £m a week to good causes- Over  local football projects supported across the UK   Former army medic and computer engineer Bahman Jamalaldini is another deserving benefactor of lottery funding. His le was turned upside-down when he contracted meningococcal meningitis in  and had to undergo a series of amputations – but National Lottery-funded charity LimbPower soon helped him back on to his new prosthetic feet. “I’ve always loved playing football but I thought my playing days were over,” says Bahman, , from Milton Keynes.  “After weeks in hospital I thought what sort of le is a quadruple amputee like me going to lead  Then I heard about LimbPower which helps amputees and those with physical impairments take part in sports and other activities. “We all bonded with each other playing football, which amazingly I discovered I was still able to do with prosthetic legs. “I’ve discovered, thanks in large part to LimbPower, that I can pretty much do all the sports I did before and live le again to the full.” Hayley Stringfellow, Head of Brand Marketing at Camelot, commented: “Players of National Lottery games raise around £m for good causes every week. We have thousands of stories to tell about the amazing things that are happening thanks to National Lottery funding.  “It’s great to shine a spotlight on the funding of local football projects and the positive impact it has on iniduals and communities.” Over the past  years more than , projects have been funded across the UK - the equivalent of around  National Lottery grants in every UK postcode district.

The kids, recruited by older gangsters to do their dirty work, also carry weapons to fend off rivals and boast of being able to get guns with “a phone call”. The revelations emerged in BBC documentary Home Town, in which investigative journalist Mobeen Azhar s to his birthplace of Huddersfield. And it also claims drugs are so re almost one in  people in Yorkshire and Humber are now addicted to heroin and opiates – the highest level in the land.    One teen in the vile trade says: “Drugs is what causes all the shootings and stabbings. Huddersfield is a small place and anywhere you go, you’re going to see someone you have a problem with, so you walk around with weapons.” Aged , he says he pockets £, a month moving heroin and coke for his dealers. And he chillingly adds: “Guns are easy to get, I can get a gun from a phone call.” One distraught mum talks of her desperation to save her son, who she suspected was peddling drugs after being excluded from school at . She tells of how he started coming home with new iPads, phones and clothes. When she searched his room, she found knives, axes and machetes, and feared he was involved in the county lines drugs trade. “I felt I’d lost him completely,” she said. “I cried, pleaded, nothing I said seemed to matter. “The pull of his friends, the le he was engaged in, was a stronger pull than anything I could do.”    Her son left home at  and, fearing he might end up dead, she grassed him up to police. “I thoughthe ends up in prison, at least he’s alive,” she said. Officers recovered the lad from a house linked with drugs and with the support of ious agencies the mum and son, now , are making progress. But he is one of the rare lucky ones. Mobeen also investigates the death of local Yassar Yakub, , who was shot dead by police during an undercover operation on the M, in January . A firearms officer later claimed in court the marksman believed Yassar had a gun. The death is still being probed. In one nerve-shredding scene, Mobeen enters a “trap house” – where deals for drugs and weapons are done – to speak with gang members.    One tells him guns are a necessity, saying: “If you work in Tesco you walk around with one of them beepy things that scan things, so it’s tools of the job.” Figures in the show claim that while gun crime has mostly come down over the past decade, firearm ­offences have risen almost  per cent in West Yorkshire. One dealer tells the documentary  to  per cent of the heroin allegedly comes from Pakistan and is hidden in cars, nappies and dog food. And another harrowing scene shows an addict turning an asthma inhaler into a crack pipe and shooting heroin in her thigh. The documentary tells how older dealers use youngsters because they know they will not think about the law or understand what they do. “The olders are kind of forcing the ‘young bucks’ to do stuff,” one dealer brags. “Over a certain age and you get caught with a gun, or you shoot somebody, you’re going down for murder, you’re going to get far longer being over  than you are being under. “If you can manipulate a child into doing something, he doesn’t have the sense or knowledge for it to be such a big thing in their mind, never mind to the law.” But Barry Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, yesterday hit out at the programme’s claims. He said: “We have our share of crime but I see the police every month and talk to them weekly. Yes, we have gangs, a drug problem, but I wouldn’t think it’s higher than big ­urban places. “I know the shopkeepers, the locals and what this documentary supposedly describes isn’t recognisable to me at all.”    West Yorkshire Police say they were not invited to participate in the documentary or asked to respond to any of the issues raised. They say in recent months, ­almost  people have been held on drug offences and Class A and B substances were recovered. More than  knives were also seized in an ongoing crackdown on violent crime in Kirklees – which covers Huddersfield and surrounding areas. Chief Superintendent Julie Sykes, Kirklees District Commander, said: “West Yorkshire, like all other areas of the country, has people who addicted to drugs. “We cannot deal with these problems in isolation and as a force we do not hold statistics on drug deaths in West Yorkshire, although we are aware of a rise nationally of such incidents. One death, however, is one too many. “County lines is not a crime restricted to West Yorkshire – it is nationwide. We are aware of it and are carrying out enforcement and prevention work. We know the criminal exploitation of children is increasingly problematic nationally.    We are working hard locally and across the force to safeguard young people from all forms of exploitation.” The Home Office said: “In February, the Home Secretary appointed Prof Dame Carol Black to lead a major review that will look into the ways in which drugs are fuelling violence. “This will build on existing Government strategies to combat drugs, serious violence, and serious and organised crime. “He has also announced a consultation on a public health statutory duty which means that those in health, education, social services, local government and housing services will work together to tackle violent crime. “Our support for the police, together with a greater emphasis on early intervention, will address violent crime and help young people develop the skills and resilience to live happy, productive lives away from violence.” "},{"url":null,"title":"kate middleton left out sorts","story":"NewsKate Middleton left out of sorts at Trooping of the Colour for familiar reasonEXCLUSIVE: She was branded moody but the Sunday Mirror can reveal she was feeling seasick from riding in a horse-drawn carriageShareCommentsByKeith Perry:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe Duchess of Cambridge gets motions sickness from travelling in horse-drawn carriages \"Get the biggest Royal Family stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailShe was branded moody, but today we can reveal why the Duchess of Cambridge looked out of sorts at Trooping the Colour – riding in horse-drawn ­carriages makes her seasick.

And we can reveal the Duchess, who chose to go by car to her  wedding, has an unlikely ally.

Shabir Ahmed, , Qari Abdul Rauf, , Abdul Aziz,  and Adil Khan, , were among nine men convicted in  of a catalogue of serious sex offences against vulnerable victims in Rochdale. Victims have been failed again after it emerged four men are still in the town. As the only groomers to have dual UK-Pakistani citizenship, they were at risk of being deported back to Pakistan - but none of the four appear to have been deported or be facing deportation. Ahmed, known as Daddy in the gang, is still serving a -year jail term for rape but Rauf is back living at his home address in Rochdale. And Aziz - known as aposThe Masterapos has also been seen in the town, locals say. Khanaposs exact whereabouts are not known.  One woman who was abused wet herself and ran into a shop after spotting her attacker in the town centre recently, according to locals, and another victim bumped into her abuser in a nightclub only last week. The Home Office will not say whether a decision has been made to deport any of the four. A spokeswoman said: We do not routinely comment on inidual cases. Maggie Oliver, the detective who resigned from Greater Manchester Police and turned whistle-blower over the botched Rochdale inquiry, said: It doesnapost surprise me they wonapost be straight with their answers after all this time because they donapost want a public backlash.  Ultimately the truth does have a way of coming out. The process most of these girls have been through has led them to expect very, very little from the authorities. They expect nothing and are not disappointed. They have been failed again and again and again. They do see some of these men around Rochdale on a fairly regular basis. It is really distressing for them, thereaposs nothing that the girls can do. Itaposs actually disgraceful.In , then-home secretary Theresa May ruled it would be conducive to the public good to deprive the four of the right to remain in the UK. They then fought, and lost, a long legal battle against deprivation of UK citizenship, losing a final Court of Appeal ruling in July last year. Eight judges, including the Master of the Rolls Lord Justice Sales, have now heard their case and upheld rulings all four should lose UK citizenship rights. It has been heard across a series of hearings spanning three years, for most of which the four were legally aided. At a previous hearing, judges noted the decision to strip an inidual of UK citizenship, called a deprivation order, does not automatically lead to deportation order. They said it was reasonable to assume, however, that a deprivation order is a prelude to a deportation. Lawyers said it is probable the four will invoke the European Convention on Human Rights to argue their right to a family le would be impingedthey were removed from the UK.  Ms Oliver added: Once you commit these horric offences your human rights should come second. It makes me really angry and itaposs really upsetting whey you think what they have done that they even have any rights. Former taxi driver Aziz, a father-of-three, regularly took his young victim to dferent flats around Rochdale, where she was plied with cannabis and vodka and coerced into sex with men who paid him cash. Referred to as The Master by the gang, he played a leading role in the grooming. Jailed for nine years in May , he was released in December  after serving three years and seven months. Rauf, a father-of-five, trafficked a -year-old girl for sex, driving her to secluded areas to have sex with her in his taxi and ferry her to a flat in Rochdale where he and others had sex with her. He was jailed for six years and released in November  after serving two years and six months of his sentence. A neighbour told the Press Association he has a night-time driving job. Khan got a girl, , pregnant but denied he was the father then met another girl, , and trafficked her to others using violence when she complained. He was sentenced to eight years, released in  and was last known to be living in Manchester. For two years from early , girls as young as  were plied with alcohol and drugs and gang-raped in rooms above takeaway shops and ferried to dferent flats in taxis where cash was paid to use the girls. Police said as many as  girls were groomed. Nazir Afzal, the lawyer credited with pursuing the groomers, overturning an earlier decision not to prosecute, said: I am concerned that despite the efforts that have been made to ensure they are no longer a threat to women and girls in this country, that they remain in this country and the process continues and is prolonged. Billy Howarth, founder of Parents Against Grooming UK in Rochdale, said: We demand an explanation as to why they have not been deported. That was one of the promises, that these men would be removed from the country so they would not have to set eyes on them again. People are going mad over it, especially the people who live on the same streets with them. A spokeswoman for current Home Secretary, Rochdale-born Sajid Javid, has been approached for comment. A staff member at the office for Rochdale MP Tony Lloyd said no-one was available for comment.

Over the next couple of days he had to have scans, X-rays and every consultant in… “They have now moved him into a trauma ward and the dference was immense.”    Jansin’s mum said her son knew he was in hospital and had become “more accepting of his surroundings and situation.” On Friday, he shared a kiss and a cuddle with his mum, and was described as being “actually very funny.” Ms Butler said she thought things were “back on track.” “Now the hard work begins and we can get on with his rehab,” she wrote. “Once the tracheotomy is removed and he is able to talk it will be much better. “We are home, and we cannot thank you all enough for the love and support, we have been telling him bit by bit and will continue to do so, and in the future he will be able to read it all for himself and I’m sure he will thank you all too.” "},{"url":null,"title":"woman very near miss flying","story":"NewsWoman has VERY near miss with Flying Scotsman as it speeds past at train stationThe overeager trainspotter sticks her head in the path of the iconic locomotive and is pulled out its way just in timeShareCommentsByJanet HughesNeil Murphy:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsThe woman narrowly avoided being hit by the train\"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA woman had a very near miss as she attempted to take pictures of the Flying Scotsman at a train station in Gloucestershire.

With a live conductor rail switched on at all times bosses say the risks of death when trespassing on the tracks is high.    Chief Inspector John Justice, from the  British Transport Police  said: “So far on the Flying Scotsman tour there has been some disruption, with ious incidents of trespass along the line. “It is incredibly disappointing that despite repeated warnings, people chose to risk their lives and the lives of others by going onto the  railway  tracks to view the Flying Scotsman.” Andy Derbyshire, of Network Rail South East route, said: “It’s great that people want to come and see the Flying Scotsman but it’s important for them to stay safe.  “In the South East, the conductor rail that sits next to the track carries enough electricity to kill people and it is vital that rail fans stay in safe areas and don’t trespass on the line. “I would also ask passengers to refrain from putting their heads out of the windows as the train runs along.” Mr Justice said: “Anyone found trespassing on the railway will be dealt with according to the law - you could be brought before the courts, get a criminal record and a fine of up to £,.” "},{"url":null,"title":"flamingo pose latest trend taking","story":"NewsFlamingo pose is the latest trend taking Instagram by storm - and celebs love itCelebrities and Instagram influencers alike have started posing in a very specic way for their photosShareByCourtney PochinAudience Writer:,  JUN Updated:,  JUN NewsCelebs like Kendall are loving the Flamingo pose \"Get the biggest daily news stories by emailSubscribeSee our privacy noticeMore newslettersThank you for subscribingWe have more newslettersShow meSee our privacy noticeCould not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailWhen it comes to getting that Instagram-worthy shot, you might panic when you have to strike a pose.

A bruised and battered face caused alarm on first viewing which gave way to quite a lot of laughter and bold comment.But what a delightful party, laid on by our warden Sheena Stewart and ladies and saw we all had tea, coffee, and home baking, including shortbread and sconesand presents of wine and malt whiskey. What a lovely morning.To all who sent cards for my th, including the community council, the Wednesday Club, the Inveraray Highland Games , my warmest thanks. And many thanks to those who helped me up after my fall and in particular Stuart Campbell of Brambles who took me to the surgery, whose very kind people cleaned me up and sent me on my way to my party half an hour later.And a mention to Take the Floor too on Radio Scotland on Saturday night. Thank you Inveraray and District Accordion and Fiddle Club and Margaret Mather our secretary for this request.So I won#t forget my th in a hurry, but such kindness and friendliness cannot be forgotten ever.My thanks to you all,Niall Iain MacLean, InveraraySir,I read with great interest the letter in the March  edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser from C Rees, Lochgilphead.In addition to all that was mentioned I wonderyour readers are acquainted with the McCrone Report which was written in the s As I’m sure your readers are aware this was when oil had just started flowing from the North Sea. Mr Gavin McCrone was, at that time, a civil servant instructed to write a report on the possible effects of North Sea Oil on the argument for Scotland’s devolution.This quote comes from a letter written, by Mr McCrone, in April : #The Paper was written over a year ago in the weeks immediately before the February  election. This will be particularly apparent on page  where, of course, the ministerial pronouncements referred to relate to the Conservative Government.#So he was instructed to write this report by a Conservative Government but was reporting to a Labour Government.This quote comes from the end of the letter: #When my paper was written it was classied “secret” and given only a most restricted circulation in the Scottish Office because of the extreme sensitivity of the subject.#The report discussed the possibility of Scottish Independence and came to the conclusion: #What is quite clear is that the balance of payments gain from North Sea oil would easily swamp the existing deficit whatever its size and transform Scotland into a country with a substantial and chronic surplus.#Now, this is a very tiny segment from a document that could have changed our history but that’s in the past and we must now look to the future.What is upsetting is thatthis wealth had been invested in an oil fund or more fairly distributed by the  British Government # either Conservative or Labour # there might not, now, be an upsurge in support for separation from Westminster.Wilma Watts, TarbertSir,With Theresa May’s Brexit deal yet again failing to get through the House of Commons and a delay to the date the UK is due to leave the EU, it is clear that we are simply lurching from crisis to crisis.One wonders what good an extension will actually do given the negotiating position of both the EU and the UK. The UK is deadlocked, in terms of its people, Parliament and Cabinet and the likelihood of any semblance of a deal that command the majority of the House of Commons is unlikely. This is especially true given the deep isions within the Tories, both Remainers and Leavers, as well as opposition from the DUP.Given this situation those like myself have long argued that a UK-wide referendum on the deal, a so-called ‘People’s Vote’, with the option to remain in the EU, is the only credible way to break this deadlock. For those who argue that this would damage our democratic process, I am not sure we can slump any lower than the situation we are currently in.As David Davis, the former Brexit Secretary and an ardent Leaver, pointed out before the EU referendum: #If a democracy cannot change its mind, it ceases to be a democracy.#There are few I know who voted for Brexit in the belief it would make them poorer, and it is up to the public to give its view on whether the deal, and more importantly its implications, are what it wants.For once I agree with Jacob Rees-Mogg who previously supported a vote on the renegotiated settlement. A statement he now curiously seems to have forgotten.The Scottish Parliament has led the way in backing a People’s Vote and now that we know the precise nature of the deal, it is up to the public to have its say.Alex Orr, Edinburgh"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 13","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe could be wrong, but the confusion over Minard war memorial seems to be nothing a sit-down over a cup of tea couldn#t fix.It#s a pity the community missed out on the centenary fund, but there are general UK funds available for war memorials.

An implementation plan was produced in December  to cover the years -. Who in Argyll and Bute is responsible for this plan  How many of the outcomes have been achieved As someone who has been involved with autism personally and professionally for many years, I find it extremely disappointing there seems to be an inability by those in authority to get organised enough to address the issues and provide services for autistic people and their families.There is no need for further drafts and consultations.Someone in the authority needs to take responsibility for the existing strategy and implementation plan and get on with it.Maureen Mackintosh, Ardrishaig.Sir,Scotland’s small building firms had a strong start to , in contrast to the UK construction small and medium sized enterprisesector, according to the Federation of Master BuildersScotland.The FMB State of Trade Survey for the first quarter of , the only quarterly assessment of the UK-wide SME construction sector, showed SME workloads declined for the first time in six years.In Scotland, however, there was a jump of  per cent compared with the previous quarter. Thirty per cent of weighted responses were positive, up from  per cent from the fourth quarter of .It is encouraging the Scottish construction industry is bucking the wider Brexit trend with workloads and enquires in rude health. The UK-wide picture is very dferent, with the construction SME sector overall contracting for the first time in six years.Scotland’s good fortune could be due to fewer EU workers being based north of the border compared with other parts of the country, like in London where one in three construction workers are from the EU.Relying less heavily on migrant workers has meant the Scottish construction industry hasn’t fallen foul of thousands of EU workers ing home during the long march to Brexit due to no longer feeling welcome in the UK or sure of their future here.Scotland’s builders, however, must not be complacent. Looking ahead, the First Minister has indicated thatthe UK does leave the EU later this year, she wants a second independence referendum before the next Scottish Parliament election in . This additional political uncertainty, on top of the continued uncertainty stemming from Brexit, could impact on the construction sector in Scotland.The fear is a looming second referendum could test consumer confidence this year and next. For construction SMEs, this is particularly concerning as their prospects are vulnerable to dips in consumer confidence as so much work comes from the private domestic sector.Gordon Nelson, Director of FMB Scotland.Sir,I was joined by my fellow Conservative councillors in Kilmory recently as we discussed atthe numerous challenges facing Argyll and Bute.Ferry sailings, roads, education and the SNP#s late single farm payments were all mentioned.With the SNP hammering local authority spending and cutting our budgets, challenges in delivering services will become more prevalent.Despite this climate of cuts from the separatists, Conservative councillors are delivering for Argyll. This includes extra funding for the Tarbert and Lochgilphead Regeneration Fund, more funding for infrastructure and an increase in roads winter maintenance resources across Argyll.As ever, my fellow Conservatives and I will continue to fight non stop to make sure our rural constituency is not sidelined by this unceasingly urban and separatism-obsessed over centralising Scottish Government.Councillor Alastair Redman, Kintyre and Islands ward.Sir,I photographed this unusual visitor to Kilduskland Road, Ardrishaig, on April .

This new parliament will be pivotal in determining the nature of our future regulatory environment and we are keen and ready to meet with them.Our industry faces a number of challenges over the coming years, not just in relation to Brexit but on issues such as climate change, environmental policy, plant protection and animal health and welfare. There will also be opportunities for farming and we must ensure that we make the most of these opportunities to build a forward-looking, progressive and resilient sector that benefits farmers and consumers throughout the UK.We would like to invite all UK MEPs on to farms in their local areas to discuss a range of priority issues and to answer any questions that they might have.

Design fleets comprising the Sigma s, Sonatas, Etchells and Hunter s joined the racing at Tarbert.Amid a flurry of rib activity laying and moving marks, it was not long before the CYCA  passage race fleet approached the finish line.The teams later caught up in the bar for the day one prize giving as new event chairman Glenn Porter welcomed everyone to Tarbert.

Similarly, surgeries have proved popular in rural areas where small organisations appreciate us travelling to them.#Lochgilphead charities, though, have either not been informed of the change or claim the service is inadequate.Sandra Johnston, chairperson of four Mid Argyll charitable groups and a committee member of another three, said she had not been informed of the new phone line or website. She added: #The point of the TSI is to support local groups, which isn#t happening.#With them keeping on one member of staff in Lochgilphead # without any phone or office -there are no people to support the groups. The hands-on practical support isn#t there. It#s a very bad situation.##They have told me nothing. Between seven groups, I#ve not heard anything.#Common sense would tell them to send out letters to all the local groups. But they don#t understand who they#re working with. I#m lucky because I have people around me who can use a computer, some people don#t.#Mid Argyll councillor Dougie Philand said: #It is disappointing and concerning that TSI has closed its office in Lochgilphead, particularly when government legislation is becoming ever more dependent on TSI to provide services.#"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rally set to be classic","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSubscribe NowThe Argyll Rally s for the third successive year on June , with fresh challenges for competitors in the KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championship.Backed by Dunoon Presents, the event will see some of the best drivers in Scotland and beyond heading to Cowal for classic Argyll forest stages # and  a new test for .On Friday June , pre-event scrutiny will take place at Dunoon Stadium from pm.Eight stages offering  miles of competitive driving will test crews, with a new Gairletter complex adding to the classic tests such as Bishops Glen, Glenbranter and Coire Ealt.

Hot on their heels, Mid Argyll Community Pool is moving from plastic bottles to refills.Jilly Wilson of the Square Peg said: #I was aware of the number of plastic bottles of water we sold and it seemed such a waste. We have always offered tap water, but this makes it easier for people to come in and refill without feeling guilty.#A new Refill mobile phone app will tell you where you can top-up across the country and it is easy to sign up.#Our staff are already encouraged to use re-useable water bottles,# added Kirsty Young of MACPool. #And it#s easy to get involved by downloading the app.#The idea of refills has taken hold among younger people. Lochgilphead pupils formed a company entitled #Gulp# aimed at promoting reusable bottles to reduce single-use plastic waste # winning an award for their efforts.

The music was provided by Gordon Cosgrove and Katrina Barr.For some, it will have been the youth groups that gave a point of contact with the church. These have existed under ious names – CHAOS with Sam and Jon Philips, Youth Fellowship run by Sian Galbraith and, currently, SKY , led by John Ives and the present pastor, Steve Davies.These have given young people a place to meet together and explore the Christian faith.Steve Davies indicated that the event planned for Saturday evening will aim to blend together three elements: #a historical flavour, a strong musical focus and a thanksgiving celebration#, and he added that there will be a chance to reminisce over refreshments and enjoy a display of photographs showing activities and events of days gone by.A church outing in the s.

The day after the crash, Superintendent Jim Guy of Strathclyde Police said there had been no evidence from the crew of any problems before the tragedy.He said the evidence available suggested an accident rather than terrorist attack. The scene of the crash was sealed off almost immediately and an air exclusion zone was imposed.Although most of the wreckage was left for accident investigators to examine, it is understood Royal Ulster Constabulary Special Branch officers removed boxes and cases containing secret papers on Friday morning.On Saturday,  personnel from RAF Machrihanish were drafted in to help find and catalogue debris from the crash.FIFTY YEARS AGOKintyre could be surfers# MeccaKintyre could become the major centre in Britain for surfingthe enthusiasm of two young men gets the encouragement it deserves.One of them, George Raynes, of Bishopbriggs in Lanarkshire, is secretary of the Scottish Surf Club, and with his treasurer, James Short of Glasgow, has just completed a preliminary survey of several of the Kintyre beaches with a view to exploiting them for the sport of surfing.George has surfed on beaches all over Britain and also in the Channel Isles and in Europe and he thinks that the beaches at Machrihanish and Southend could become the Mecca for British surfers and the venue for the British Championships.He was particularly impressed with the waves at Machrihanish but thinks Southend has great potential as well.He told the Courier: #The possibilities here are tremendous. These beaches are essentially accessible from the central belt of Scotland, in fact from all over Britain when one considers the air service, and the weather records show that there is plenty of sunshine and the water is warm compared to the waters off the east coast of England, for example.#In fact, I#ve been told that Kintyre topped the sunshine league in Britain last year.#The water is so warm, comparatively speaking, that the sport could become an all-year-round activity in this area. In the winter one would have to wear a wetsuit, of course, but the conditions are ideal and the wave forms have great potential # after all, they are coming straight in from the Atlantic over the north of Ireland.#What I#d like to see is a surf club established in Campbeltown. It could become a great asset from a tourist and amenity point of view.#And any Kintyre people who really took up the sport would have a great advantage over other surfers when it comes to competition because they have the benefit of readily available beaches all year round.#If this club gets going, the chances are that the British surf champions in the years to come will be Kintyre people.#ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGOOrr Ewing CupFootballers were favoured with beautul weather last Saturday and the games played on Kinloch Park in the Orr Ewing Cup competition brought together very large gatherings of spectators.The match in the afternoon was brought to a sudden termination by an unfortunate dispute over the award of a goal. The opposing teams were Kintyre and HMS Thames.Kintyre opened strongly and after  minutes# play had scored twice. The dispute arose over the award of the second goal, which Thames claimed to be offside.The referee, Mr Duncan McCallum, an old Hearts player, was of a dferent opinion, and on his allowing Kintyre the goal, the naval team without more do walked off the field.It is understood that the Thames team intimated to the league at the weekly meeting on Monday night their withdrawal from the competition.The teams were: Kintyre # Jas McKinlay: James Black and Archd Sharp: M Muir, A McCrank and T Cameron: R McGeachy and D Brown: Dan McNaughton: N Scally and J Donaldson.HMS Thames # Meese: Jesseman and Love: McCloud, Hirst and Fernie: Dunnell and Weekes: McGeachy: Slynn and Segrott.Referee # Mr D McCallum.In the evening, the opposing teams were Campbeltown and Kilbrannan. A week previously Kilbrannan had inflicted a - win over a naval team: against Campbeltown on Saturday they found the tables turned on themselves, and with the same score repeated they had to suffer the chagrin of a five-goal margin.It was hard game, but high scoring seldom adds to the vim or interest of any match and so it was here.Campbeltown from the kick-off may be fairly said to have had the measure of their opponents, but while they were the better , on play there was nothing like a - goal margin between the teams.Campbeltown owed their comfortable lead mainly to the masterly play of their centre forward, Archd O#May. This young footballer was home on furlough from the Rhine Army, and his display was undoubtedly the feature of the game. He is a fearless player with a rare turn of speed and a most deadly shot.At least three of six goals came from his foot, and were beautully taken, while he was the means of a fourth which he gave the right wing the honour of finishing.Kilbrannan#s solitary goal was well taken by Brown after a clever break through and an inidual run.Kilbrannan has material for the making of a team that should get much better results than they have so far achieved.The players are keen and inidually have a lot of football in them, but an almost entire absence of method both in attack and defence spoils their chances.The teams were: Campbeltown # A McCallum: G Quigley and Chas McKinven: D Kelly, J McDonald and John Martin: Chas Black and Arch Black: Arch O#May: W McKillop and James Martin.Kilbrannan # John McIntyre: D Bannatyne and Wm Gilchrist: J Short, N McKenzie and James Boyce: D Gilchrist and M Brodie: C Kelly: D Mathieson and J Brown.Referee # Mr W Mustarde."},{"url":null,"title":"thought for the week june 7 2019","story":"As I retreat into the comfort of a warm house and an even warmer coffee, I wonder what it must have been like for Columba and his fellow monks as they made their way from the shores of Ireland to the wilds of Argyll.The fragile shell of a coracle was not the most effective shelter against the wildness of our coastline.Yet they came.

Itrsquos in such a beautul part of our county that the journey there was an adventure in itself.The loch is hidden, surrounded by a wood which embraces its secrets. Irsquod never visited it before, but Irsquod been told how magical this place is and that it has a story attached to it.Finding an appropriate place to park was our first challenge. There is no direct access to the loch and no car park with signposts, so care is needed in finding a suitable place. A private farm road that takes you to the entrance gate is not an option, so initially I struggled to find a suitable place, but some kind advice from a friendly farmer helped us out.Itrsquos a perfect time of year for such an adventure. The woods are fully clothed and still echoing with birdsong. I like to explore new places initially without a map or guide. It adds to the adventure, as we had to decide which way to go and initially wonderedwersquod taken the wrong route. But there is a circular walk around the loch, so once the path is discovered there isnrsquot a wrong way.It is a beautul and tranquil place, and as we wandered along the tree-lined loch I thought about the story of the man responsible for its creation.That man was Harry Younger, of the well-known brewing family. His ancestor, William Younger, had been the man who had built up the famous brewing business which produced Youngerrsquos Ale. A huge chunk of the Canongate in Edinburgh was taken over by their Holyrood brewery, including the site where the Scottish Parliament now sits.When William Younger died in , he was a hugely wealthy and successful businessman but also, it seems, exhausted and overworked. The empire he left was continued by the family but eventually in , the Younger enterprise was merged with rivals McEwanrsquos, to form Scottish Brewers Ltd.This merger, the reasons for which are another story, meant the Younger family branched out into other ventures. In the s, Harry Younger, the then head of the family, bought the land at Baro and began transforming it into the haven of nature it now is.Harry led an interesting and privileged le. He was an internationally known curler who regularly competed and won trophies. His intention was to create a new home amid the beauty of this area of East Lothian. He set about building a house, but also developed Bara Loch as it now exists and surrounded it with an embrace of trees.But the dark clouds of the Second World War intervened in his plans to enjoy this paradise. He had attended Sandhurst in his earlier years and seen the last months of the First World War. He remained involved in the Territorial Army and in January  he was sent to France as commander of a mechanised unit.It is recorded that he was killed in action on June  at St Valery-en-Caux. His unit, the Lothian and Border Horse, had been part of the brave and ferocious defence of the Dunkirk beaches. Anyone with knowledge of this action will understand the hell and desperation of that defence, and the supreme courage and sacrice of the defenders.Harry died on the day these brave defenders had to finally surrender, after over , had been evacuated from the beaches. How he died, what horrors he witnessed, we can only guess. He lies buried in the St Valery-en-Caux Franco-British Cemetery.And so this is the story attached to this beautul place. The man who began its creation never got the chance to enjoy it.In our walk, we arrived at a stone seat overlooking the loch. It had a worn inscription on it. We could make out the words lsquoin memoryrsquo or lsquomemorialrsquo and lsquoYoungerrsquo, but the rest was too worn.But I knew this must be a memorial to Harry Younger, which was later confirmed when I found a wonderful blog called Walking East Lothian in which the author explained he had traced the inscription to reveal Harryrsquos name and the date , the year of the lochrsquos creation.I sat on the seat and watched my kids play in the wood. The trees on the north side arch over the waterline to catch the sunlight, creating a canopy which dips into the loch. The serene tranquillity and beauty of the place is no doubt what Harry intended.But that in a sense is part of the magic of this place. As the pioneer Nelson Henderson once said to his son: ldquoThe true meaning of le is to plant trees under whose shade you do not expect to sit.It was these words I was reflecting on as I watched my children play. Harry was of course wealthy but we can all plant trees, either real ones or metaphorical ones, as a legacy for others.The recent death of a fellow storyteller and all-round wonderful woman, Ros Parkyn, was also on my mind. I had spoken about this place to her and of my intention to visit it. She loved nature too and would have gladly come along with me. But I sadly left it too late.Ros encapsulated all that was good and compassionate about humanity and she also planted many trees, some in the ground for she was a nature lover, but even more were planted in the hearts of those who knew her. They all now will grown as part of her wonderful legacy.As we left the wood, butterflies and blue dragonflies accompanied me, along with thoughts of my friend Ros and a man I didnrsquot know but whose trees shaded us.I willin autumn to see the colours and pay quiet homage to those who leave this world having made a positive dference."},{"url":null,"title":"new-primary-school-at-letham-mains-starting-to-take-shape","story":"Work began on Letham Mains Primary School, on Haddingtonrsquos western edge, earlier this year.The

sale of the new homes.They argued that making the site suitable for development would cost pound.million and it was not viable without housing.However, East Lothian Council rejected their plans at a meeting in August when officers insisted the site should be retained for employment use.Councillor John McMillan, economic spokesperson, referenced the Kevin Costner movie Field of Dreams when he told colleagues: ldquoIf we build it, they will come.Developers appealed to the Scottish Government to overturn their decision, insisting the local authority had failed to acknowledge the evidence they had provided which, they said, demonstrated the need for enabling residential development on the land.However, the Scottish Government Reporter appointed to investigate the appeal has now rejected their argument, siding with the council.He said that the Local Development Plan for East Lothian had set aside the land at Kingslaw for economic development and it should be retained as such.And he pointed out that the housing proposed by Barratt,which was described as lsquowindfallrsquo housing ndash which refers to a site which becomes available unexpectedly ndash would ldquosimply supplement an already generous housing land supply.Despite rejecting the appeal, the reporter said that he accepted the views of the developers and the District Valuer that the site was not financially viable as employment land in the current market conditions.He said: ldquoWhile I cannot be certain that there is no prospect of a business or industrial use being realised on the whole site, the information for this appeal indicates that, in the current economic conditions, it would be unlikely.However, he questioned whether the plans to build  houses and provide the local authority with . hectares of ldquoserviced land to build business units on it were possible, with no evidence the units would be created or could operate next to the new residential development.The reporter said: ldquoI find that the housing proposed would not directly enable commercial development to take place.ldquoAlthough not likely to be currently viable, the site would be removed as a strategic long-term employment option.East Lothian Council welcomed the ruling which is the first housing appeal to have been ruled in their favour since their new Local Development Plan was adopted.Councillor Norman Hampshire, planning convenor, said: ldquoWe welcome the outcome of this appeal both in the context of the Scottish Government Reporter upholding a decision that was carefully considered by East Lothianrsquos

This really is an exceptional moment in politics. Everyone says that Boris Johnson is unreliable, untruthful, unfaithful, unruly and unpredictable. Yet, he is almost certainly going to be our next Prime Minister. How did we get here Hes a chat show celebrity, of course. But its not ashes seen in a positive light by the media glitterati. Last week, Ian Hislop, the lead list on BBCs Have I Go News For You, on which Boris famously starred, called for him to be jailed. TV presenters loathe Johnson, which is why his minders have tightly controlled his TV studio exposure. He has been pilloried in the press, rubbished on social media and disowned by Tory cabinet ministers.Ruth Davidson, the Scottish Tory leader, made no secret of her dislike for the former London Mayor and even launched a campaign, ldquoOperation Arse to stop him. The Conservative Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said he ldquowouldnt serve in a Johnson cabinet . But somehow all this bounces off the Teflon Blonde. In last weeks first round of voting, Johnson won more that twice the votes of his nearest rival.The short answer of course is Brexit, but that doesnt explain why Tory MPs are so keen to have this recklessly outspoken politician as their leader. The other candidates are no less Brexity than he is. Yet he is crushing the le out of them.Iain Macwhirter: Brace yourselves, wersquore in for a Trump-Johnson double actHard man Dominic ldquokarate Raab, is a dedicated No Dealer, yet he was left gasping on the canvas after last weeks votes. The Environment Secretary, Michael Gove, is still in the race, despite his cocaine confessions, but only just. Sajid Javid, has ldquoalso ran written all over him, despite winning the support of Ruth Davidson.This just leaves the Foreign Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, as the safety-first candidate. Hell probably win enough votes to come second to Johnson and be one of the two candidates offered to the wider Conservative Party membership. But he is so colourless - a male version of Theresa May - that hes most unlikely to succeed. Tories realise that this isnt the time for safety-first candidates. Theyve been there done that.Media commentators have been talking up the ldquoWhite Walker, Development Secretary, Rory Stewart, who squeaked into the second round. He certainly has a good back story, with his wanderings in Afghanistan, and possesses the effortless self-confidence that only an Eton education can provide. Hes a youthful breath of fresh air, but Tories arent interested in fresh air right now. They prefer the fug of populism.Which leaves us with Boris Johnson as the next Prime Minister. Even as I write that again I can still hardly believe it. Consider this testimonial by one of Johnsons former employers. ldquoHe is a far more ruthless, and frankly nastier figure than the public appreciates...I would not take Boriss word about whether it is Monday or Tuesday.. He is not a man to believe in, to trust or respect, save as a superlative exhibitionist.That was Johnsons former editor, Max Hastings, of the Tory-supporting Daily. In the same article, Hastings said thatJohnson ever became Prime Minister hed be ldquoon the first plane out of Britain. I hope hes booked his tickets.: Scottish Tory MP warns Boris Johnson against trying to \"subvert\" leadership voteEveryone knows that the former London Mayor was sacked as a journalist for lying, and then again as a junior minister for lack of candour. His infidelities are legion. Hersquos barely capable of appearing in public without provoking offence, usually from ethnic minorities. Three years ago he won pound from the Spectator magazine for a limerick that referred to the President of Turkey having sex with a goat.You think Im making that up, dont you  But the next PM really did write this about of President Recip Erdogan: ldquoThere was a young fellow from Ankara. Who was a terric w@nkerer. Till he sowed his wild oats. With the help of a goat. But he didnt even stop to thankera. Dont think hell be reprising that when he meets the Turkish President.The Tories used to be the sober, serious and sensible party. The political wing of the Anglican Church. Its in the name: ldquoConservative. So what are they doing electing this man  Are Tory MPs so addled by Brexit they cant see whats coming  A Prime Minister as chaotic and unpredictable as Donald Trump.In many ways, Boris Johnson seems the polar opposite of Trump. In terms of education, wit, literary ability and social background, he couldnt be more dferent to the belligerent billionaire. But they share one important characteristic: they are charismatic populists. They are rule breakers, who can be guaranteed to defy convention, for good or ill. Theyre not really politicians in the conventional sense, but anti-politicians, repositories of popular discontent.Many voters like Boris because he is the embodiment of political incorrectness. He is guaranteed to provoke outrage from the professional offence-takers and social justice warriors who populate social media. Many middle Americans voted for Donald Trump, not because they expected him to be a model president, but because he would upset self-righteous scolds who tell people what to say and what to think. The woke s of the culture wars, who police the language of ersity, and condemn jokes about gays, women or racial minorities.Boris is also someone who will make trouble, and many voters want to make trouble right now. That is why, paradoxically, the party of the establishment, is embracing someone whose demeanour seems so anti-establishment. Conservatives know that the only thing that matters is getting power and keeping it. Back in the day, this involved electing boring politicians in sensible suits who wouldnt frighten the middle classes and would invite deference from in the lower orders. Politicians behaved like bank managers, headmasters, churchmen.But the middle classes have been plunged into insecurity by the financial crash, working people no longer defer to authority figures, and respect for religion has largely vanished from our secular public realm. In many ways, the passing of deference is a good thing. But we have also become an irritable and fractious society that doesnt know what it wants, but wants it now. Brexit is a touchstone issue here: a political project which no one really understands, because it is about complex trading law, but on which everyone has an emotionally-charged point of view.Boris Johnson, is natural material for these emotive times.

I stumbled on it when my laptop refused to recognise me. Irsquom used to this from people Irsquove known for decades but this was a real shocker. Bear with me, Irsquom getting to the point, although itrsquos slow as Irsquom still suffering from post-digital stress disorder, PDSD.It started when I dug my fingers in the soil, as you do around this time of year getting back to nature, or vainly planting stuff you know is destined to die. My right index finger became badly infected, swelled up like a bursting banana and, to cut the tale of my travails short, I ended up in hospital for a couple of days.Jump cut to the computer episode. Itrsquos activated, like many of those modern devices, with a fingerprint. But it stubbornly wouldnrsquot come on. Which is when I discovered that, as all the skin on my finger had come off , there was now no fingerprint. Which is when I discovered this rare condition.In old movies criminals used to give their fingers acid baths to remove fingerprints, which always seemed both painful and counter-intuitive to me when they could simply nip out to BQ and get a pair of gloves .Anyway, no lasting harm, Irsquom told it will grow back, but in the meantime I obviously wonrsquot be able to visit the States ndash which I had no intention of doing anyway, other than hooded and in chains ndash because they take your fingerprints as you go in and, I learn from my sufferers group, they turn you backyou canrsquot provide a full set.A DIGITAL STORYI donrsquot know what they do about people with missing digits at US Homeland Security. Probably tag the person. Or saw the other ones off. But in Canada they preserve them and put them in your drink ndash and itrsquos not to ensure that other boozers donrsquot nick it.

The latest to do so is British endurance athlete Nick Grfiths who lost three toes last year competing in the Yukon Arctic Race, the worldrsquos coldest ultra-marathon. He had seen an advert which said, ldquoHad frostbite  We want your toes. The big toe is the money shot Irsquom told.Apparently, Downtown now finds it pretty hard to come by toes because bounders keep nicking them from their drinks. I dread to think how they smuggle them out. The hotel now fines anyone who tries to steal one , around pound. They should be paying that to anyone who downs one.ANOTHER ONE BITES THE DUSTSo farewell then Esther McVey. Not many people knew you and you knew very little about almost anything.

He was charming and funny in private as you might have expected, although I find his public views anathema. It was about that time that I had to read for review, speed read, what is his first and I think only novel, Seventy Two Virgins.

But the public, Parliament and campaigners are not allowed to see it.Research by the Scottish Liberal Democrats, in collaboration with anti-sectarianism charity Nil by Mouth, has revealed that this data is in fact being recorded and monitored. It is gathered by the Scottish Professional Football League , and shared with the government and the police. This arrangement, however, is subject to one important caveat ndash government and the police are sworn to secrecy.Establishing this much has been like navigating a maze.Months ago I asked the Justice Secretary about comments made by Kilmarnock manager, and now Scotland boss, Steve Clarke, who was taunted by sectarian slurs while standing on the touchline at a game. Reflecting on the abuse, he rightly branded it the stuff of the \"Dark Ages\". Upsettingly, he also said he was pleased Cha had taken him away from Scotland so his children and grandchildren didnrsquot have to grow up under the same cloud.His assessment was as frank as it was uncomfortable, and a moment of shame for both the game and our country. But we donrsquot know whether the incident that prompted it is contained in the SPFLrsquos secret database. The same goes for every other incident that has occurred up and down the country over the last two seasons, whether it is sectarian chanting, chair throwing, fireworks, assaults or abuse.Is sectarianism on the rise  Has it got worse this season  Is it only a minority of fans acting this way  The answer is we donrsquot know, because up until now the impression was given no one had the numbers.Professor Duncan Morrow is a world-renowned expert on sectarianism, hate crime and community cohesion. He was twice commissioned by the Scottish Government to delve into the problems in Scottish football and society more widely, and he concluded by recommending that incidents should be monitored and regularly published. This would help tackle sectarianism by boosting transparency and laying the groundwork for informed public debate. Nothing there to argue with ndash or so yoursquod imagine.But what resulted was a pathetic compromise. Despite Professor Morrowrsquos original ambition being openness, informed debate is only allowed to happen behind closed doors at SPFL, government and police headquarters. Instead of encouraging debate, they have muted it.This is a problem on a number of levels. The most fundamental is that we need baseline figureswersquore really going to measure progress. Banning this information from every seeing the light of day means football fans are less safe.As DCC Kerr rightly said in that same February meeting, we cannot let this become normal. Hateful chants, violence and sectarianism ruin the game for everyone . It means the vast majority of respectful fans get a bad name and in time could miss out on the chance to watch their teams because others think they can get away with unacceptable behaviour.Itrsquos absolutely scandalous that the Scottish Government are playing the puppet for the football authorities. It appears that they have used their cooperation as leverage. Ministers seem to have signed up to some sort of gagging deal. The Scottish Government now says that releasing the statistics they have been given could cause them to be cut off. It apparently wouldnrsquot be in the public interest to disclose the information. No competent administration could weave themselves into such a mess.Ministers need to step up and explain this to Scottish fans.

But, as ever on social media, there were many who eagerly called them out for an alleged lack of class, for rubbing the Thai players noses in their grim misfortune - a misfortune, moreover, that was being watched by a television audience of countless millions.But others leapt to the Americans defence. Why on earth shouldnt they have the right to celebrate their superior skills  And, some asked, would the same criticism have been levelled at male players The issue was brilliantly addressed by Lindsay Gibbs, who covers sports on the progressive US news site, Think Progress.She wrote: \"The lopsided score launched a litany of conversations ... about sportsmanship, excessive celebrations, sexism, equal pay, and the lack of investment in womenrsquos soccer globally. Itrsquos clear that this USWNT performance mdash which was led by a World Cup record five goals by Alex Morgan mdash has gotten under peoplersquos skin.\"But rather than trying to debate our way around the discomfort, perhaps it would be best to stew in it for a minute. Because the discomfort might just be the point.\"It should make us uncomfortable, she said, that the inequities in womenrsquos soccer \"are so massive, that itrsquos not yet possible to have the field of a -team World Cup be competitive from top to bottom. It should make us queasy that many soccer federations donrsquot even convene training camps for women athletes, let alone arrange official friendly matches against quality opponents to enable those teams to build their ranking and develop their homegrown talent.\"It should \"turn our stomachs\" that Team USA, the most successful womenrsquos soccer team in the world, is still having to fight for equal pay. The players are currently suing U.S. Soccer for gender discrimination.Gibbs also pointed out that the female players decided to take on such a big-time lawsuit right before the biggest tournament of their lives \"because they knew that this is the only time in the next four years that they will receive this much attention. They need every ounce of leverage that they can muster, since U.S. Soccer is so hesitant to endorse equality. The U.S. women believe they must win the tournament to advance this larger cause. Because of that self-imposed burden, every match, every goal at the  Womenrsquos World Cup, takes on a heightened signicance.\"Referring to the celebrations that greeted all of the  goals, Gibbs made this telling observation: \"Theres also something refreshing about seeing womenrsquos emotions in such a pure, unfiltered state, and seeing how much every single goal meant to these women, who have dedicated their lives to this sport, and still have to fight for so much every time they take the field.\"At the end of the game, some US players, including Carli Lloyd, made a point of commiserating with the hapless Thai goalkeeper, Sukanya Chor Charoenying, on what was probably one of the worst nights of her le.And in another touching moment, Alex Morgan sought out, in front of the cameras, the Thailand forward, Miranda Nild, to console her. Nild was born in Northern Calornia and, like Morgan, played soccer while at the University of Calornia, Berkeley.The debate quickly widened. Is there anything that the mens game could learn from the womens game, despite the vast inequality in funding and wages Many pointed to the womens sportsmanship, to their respect for the match referees, for their general lack of prima donna behaviour.ldquoThere are absolutely things that the menrsquos game can learn from the World Cup,\" Vivienne MacLaren, chair of Scottish Womens Football, said on Friday. \"I think the biggest thing is the behaviour of the players on the pitch. Diving, play-acting, etcetera are very uncommon within the girlsrsquo and womenrsquos game. On the whole, most players are very honest and menrsquos football could certainly learn from this.ldquoWhile I appreciate itrsquos not easy in the menrsquos game, the family-friendly atmosphere at womenrsquos gamesrsquo is a huge plus. Most games arenrsquot segregated and you find fans of both teams can sit together and enjoy the match. Itrsquos maybe not something that can be lsquolearnedrsquo but I certainly believe itrsquos something to be aspired to.ldquoFinally, I also think there is an unmatched pride that these women have playing for their country,\" she adds.\"Knowing the Scotland players and the set-up, there isnrsquot one player who wouldnrsquot do anything to pull on that shirt. I think most of the menrsquos squad are the same but not all of them. Maybe that comes from the incredible amount of money players receive from their clubs, which is the complete opposite within the womenrsquos game at the present time.On social media, to no great surprise, the womens World Cup has attracted criticism - much of it well-meaning, but large proportions of it sexist - but many men have voiced their support.\"Dference between men and womens football...women get up when they fall get fouled unless they are genuinely hurt and not roll around, they dont fall to the ground so easy, they complain less to the refs, they get on and play,\" noted one Twitter user. \"Just wished more men had the same attitude as the women, get up and get on with it.\"Im not saying women dont do it,\" he added, \"in general men do it more, women try to play fairly where as the men will try to play dirty and get away with things more than the women do. Womans football doesnt get the credit it deserves, Im only on about the style of play thats it cause I love mens football too. The womens game Ive watched they are always trying to get back up when they can or stay on their feet but the men will go down at any opportunity.\"\"I tell you something. Mens football could learn a thing or two from the womans game,\" tweeted aArsenal fan. \"No rolling around in the floor faking injuries, not surrounding the ref screaming and shouting.\" A female Twitter user responded: \"Yes!! Way too much of those two things in the mens game! Also, refreshing to see some fast-paced football \".\"Do all these blokes ripping into the quality of the Womenrsquos World Cup realise the women playing are miles better than any of them  \" challenged yet another man on Twitter.Another made the point: \"Mensfootball relies on speed and strength to a greater extent than the womens game. If you actually watch the games, youll see a greater use of skillssuch as running off the ball into danger areas, reverse passing, better ball-trapping.\"As Lindsay Gibbs concluded her article on Think Progress: \"These women are not at the World Cup to instill a sense of comfort in those for whom nothing is at stake theyrsquore there to become champions, provoke change, and convince people to care about womenrsquos soccer.

Schools should go the extra mile to ensure that young people from these families do not miss out ndash or that their parents have to go without to keep up with better-off families.Young people who are excluded from the chance to participate in the same activities as their friends and counterparts ndash such as the school prom ndash can have a negative impact on health and wellbeing, she adds.ldquoThe Scottish Government should be asked to look at this issue ndash to research and assess the impact of this exceptional extra cost.ldquoEducation authorities should undertake impact assessments on existing policies and associated practices to assess the impact on low-income families.ldquoSchools should be supported to have guidelines for parents at the start of prom arrangements to make sure the events are as inclusive as possible.In Wales, where childhood poverty is rising, minister of education, Kirsty Williams was last week warned of a ldquocompetition between parents and urged to launch research into the impact lsquoprom feverrsquo can have on poorer families.Certainly, the scale and number of high school proms across the entire UK have erupted.

There are people who have spent up to pound on a prom dress.ldquoBut at the same time, plenty go to TK Maxx and pick up a dress for a fraction of the cost.ldquoTo be honest, thatrsquos almost nicer - therersquos almost a stereotypical prom look, and all the girls can end up looking the same.She has sympathy with parents who, caught in the emotion of seeing children morph into young men and women, can easily find themselves forking out over the odds.And she is braced for what may be ahead with her own daughter, Cameron, , who is currently looking forward to Gfnock Primaryrsquos P end of term ceilidh. ldquoItrsquos not called a prom, she adds. ldquoBecause itrsquos a ceilidh therersquos a feeling that itrsquos not about getting dressed to excess.ldquoShersquoll wear white plimsols and white knee socks and an lsquoAlice in Wonderlandrsquo dress from Monsoon.ldquoIrsquom not saying she wonrsquot be in full prom mode when she leaves high school, but right now shersquos a child.Yet there is evidence that some primary school end of term discos have evolved into red carpet parties, with -year-old girls in off-the-shoulder cocktail frocks, full makeup and tottering on towering heels.It certainly doesnrsquot get more extreme than the incident in , when East Renfrewshire Council rejected a request to land a helicopter in the grounds of Mearns Primary in Newton Mearns.At Exquisite Limousines in Dunfermline, the fleet of four Calornian built stretch limos are currently polished to perfection, tinted windows and mirrored ceiling streak-free, interior disco lights and sound system tested and ready for the next prom run.In the past they would ferry groomed high school leavers to local hotels, these days itrsquos more likely to be giggling gangs of Ps. ldquoTherersquos been a vast reduction in the amount of high school prom bookings, says a spokesman. ldquoNow, itrsquos more primary school kids.

Last week Katie Hamilton, , and friends from Douglas Academy were among the countless Scottish S and S pupils who dressed to the nines and partied away their final school hours.ldquoThere were girls wearing dresses that cost pound to pound, she says. ldquoI tried to find a dress for under pound but there just wasnrsquot anything that I wanted. I spent around pound, but it was the perfect dress.ldquoI did my own nails, make-up and tan - Irsquom not spending pound on my make up when I can just do it myself.The prom at Ingliston Country Club and Hotel cost pound a head. For parents who waved their children off, the evening perfectly captured that fleeting moment between childhood, school stresses and the edge of adulthood.ldquoI canrsquot deny it wasnrsquot emotional, says Jan Mackay, whose son, Ciaran, waited in a huge queue of teenagers at Slaters to pick his suit for the Douglas Academy prom.ldquoThe kids were dead excited and itrsquos at that funny point where theyrsquore no longer schoolkids and on the brink of moving on but not quite there yet.ldquoIt feels like the end of something big and, of course, therersquos a degree of hysteria.But not all prom nights have to be crushingly expensive.

One of my friends spent around pound on drinks alone, so yeah, ridiculous might be an understatement.Prom, she reckons, is a little over-hyped. ldquoThat doesnrsquot mean itrsquos not going to be fun to dress up and see your friends but I donrsquot think people get that itrsquos not all itrsquos chalked up to be, she adds.ldquoProm for me was just a gloried school disco."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-population-is-heading-east-and-away-from-the-countryside","story":"A task force of Scottish Government ministers has been set to prepare policies to manage the countrys changing demographic, which are expected to see families leaving areas such as Inverclyde, Ayrshire, Argyll and the Western Isles for Edinburgh, Fe and the Lothians.It comes against a backdrop of a falling birthrate and an increasingly elderly population, which will see any future population growth driven my migration from overseas and the rest of the UK.The challenge will be to ensure those left behind still have access to decent public services and ing economies while ensuring no skills shortage appears as the labour pool recedes.:The forgotten battle of ScotlandThere will also be a focus on the dispersal of population across Scotland and how the economic benefits of future population growth are spread across all communities.According to official figures, the population of the Western Isles is expected to drop be more than , by , and by more than , in Inverclyde.Argyll and Bute, which covers a large part of the west coast, is predicted to lose , people in the same timeframe, as is North Ayrshire.

Experts are on standby in case the fish are found to be carrying disease.If they arrive it is expected to be later this month or next. Anyone who catches one has been told to kill it and send it to fisheries managers. Anglers are also warned to look out for spawning fish, which could mean populations becoming established.Only a handful of humpback salmon, native to Pacic North America, were found in Scottish waters until . That year  of them were seen, with some spotted laying eggs in the Spey, Ness and Aberdeenshire Dee.The fish have a two-year le-cycle and come back from the sea in odd years, so scientists have been waiting until this year to seethe invasion happens again, andpink salmon have a breeding toehold here.If they get established scientists say they would be dficult to sht, and their nest-building could damage the rare lamprey.They are highly aggressive when defending nests, so could attack native fish, and could also possibly compete for food, and interfere with native salmon migration and the le cycle of very rare freshwater pearl mussels. Pink salmon die after spawning, and another concern is the of effect masses of dead fish on rivers.Chris Conroy, director of the Ness District Salmon Fishery board, filmed pink salmon spawning in  after anglers caught two in the River Ness.He said: ldquoWe have footage of them chasing trout, they are very territorial. They just shouldnrsquot be here.Writing in the Journal of Fish Biology, experts from Scottish Natural Heritage, Marine Scotland and Fisheries Management Scotland described the  invasion and set out concerns over Oncorhynchus gorbuscha ndash the scientic name for the fish.The authors ndash John Armstrong, Colin Bean, and Alan Wells ndash say the fish originate from stocks introduced to western Russia, which got into Norwegian rivers and then crossed the North Sea.They list just  pink salmon detected between  and  in Scotland, with the maximum in any year being five in , and just one in .They say: ldquoAgainst this sporadic appearance, the  reports represent an unusual and explosive invasion of O. gorbuscha to Scotland.ldquoA total of  ... were recorded across a broad range of riversNo explanation has been found for rsquos invasion, but the scientists say: ldquoOf greatest concern is that,progressive change in climate is a root cause, then invasions of O. gorbuscha to Scottish waters will probably continue. At this stage, however, the magnitude and frequency of such occurrence cannot be predicted.They believe a breeding population of pink salmon is unlikely as things stand, as they spawn early here and migrate to sea in the autumn when food is scarce, butthey begin spawning later in the year it might mean spring migration, boosting survival chances and the likelihood of the fish breeding here.Most deliberate introductions of the salmon have proven tricky, but the team says the introduction in western Russia was ldquovery successful: that could mean invaders in Scotland are genetically selected to be good invaders.The scientists say rooting out established pink would be dficult. Digging up nests was deemed ldquotoo resource intensive and risky, and netting them would damage other fish including native salmon.Chris Conroy added: ldquoIf their numbers build up and theyrsquore at the same feeding grounds at sea they could compete with our salmon for food. Itrsquos an unknown ndash theyrsquore not native and any non-native shouldnrsquot be here ... they could potentially be carrying disease. We donrsquot know what the risk is, so I class that as being of concern.Jo Long, senior conservation policy officer from the Scottish Environmental Protection Agency, said: ldquoOne bad year doesnrsquot indicate a trend of any kind, so the real focus is on gathering information and trying to assess whether this is a sign of things to come.ldquoWersquore much more organised this year to gather the information to help answer these questionsldquoWersquove got everyone on the alert in the angling community so we can get much better data and seethis is something we should be worried about.She added: ldquoTo date there have been no diseased fish of those that have been reported.

This could take the form of increased headage payments under the existing beef calf support scheme.The SBA, along with NFU Scotland and other industry stakeholders, have been pressing Mr Ewing on the issue and SBA chairman, Neil McCorkindale, was hoping for an announcement by the Cabinet Secretary at the event.This didn’t materialise but Mr Ewing indicated he was sympathetic to the plea and accepted the argument that headage payments would be a more effective approach than area based support which would simply encourage inertia in the industry.data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Owners Jonny and Ali Aspden\"  Popular Ellon coffee shop extends opening hoursviewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\" data-src\"https:images-e.jpimedia.uk imagefetch w_auto,f_auto,ar_:,q_auto:low,c_fill _h_lte_,c_mfit,h_ https:www.ellontimes webimage ..! image image.jpg\" class\"article-suggested-teaser__image cld-responsive\" alt\"Aby Wilson, Stuart Wood, Elaine Lownds, George Laing, and Director Nicola Alexander of Bethan Customs Consultancy\"  Oldmeldrum start-up doubles team viewBox\"  . .\" enable-background\"new   . .\" xml:space\"preserve\"c,,.-,.-.c-,-.,.-.C.,.,,,,.z\"  Coremetrics  Coremetrics  Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\"Coremetrics.articleTeaserEventCatID  \"ELLO | Article Teaser\""},{"url":null,"title":"explorer scouts raise over 1k at fun dog show event","story":"The Daviot and Oldmeldrum Explorer Scouts kicked off fundraising for their second trip to volunteer at a school in Uganda at the weekend.The group held their annual Fun Dog Show in Oldmeldrum on Sunday, June .The event raised around £,.At the Fun Dog Show there was a choice of ten classes and over  dogs took part.The DOM Explorer Scouts ran a tea and cake tent whilst a number of local pet-related businesses had stalls.The Scratch Club from Inverurie ran Flyball demonstations and also let people try with their own dogs.The DOM Explorer Scouts were supported by a number of local businesses who sponsored the event.They hope to hold the next Fun Dog Show on Sunday, June  .In July  the DOM Explorer Scouts visited Ruhanga in SW Uganda to help finish building a School  Scout Hall that they had funded.

We want the public to understand that our members do not take this action lightly. But, AGS have repeatedly set preconditions to any negotiations by stating they will not reopen the consultation on the pension scheme, which breaks our Acas agreement with them.ldquoUnite members remain strong and resolute, and they are determined to stand united with their fellow members in Glasgow who are facing the same attack on their pay and pension scheme by AGS. For the record, Unite wants to reaffirm that we are always open to meaningful negotiations to seek a remedy to this dispute at any time, any place and under any auspices.

Famed for his pace and strength, you couldn’t find a better poster boy for a stereotypical view of modern masculinity. He’s world class, at the top of his game with  caps for his country, a two-time British and Irish Lion and twice Six Nations Player of the Championship. But there’s also a softer side to this alpha male, and back home in Hawick, as he talks about his children, losing his best friend and his pride in his home town, he’s not afraid to let his emotions show. It’s easy to see why he’s a face of Dove Men+Care, the skincare brand’s global initiative to promote men as non-violent fathers and caregivers, celebrating a definition of strength with care at its core. “Whatever you see on the pitch, everybody’s got a soft heart,” says Hogg. “Andnot, you’re doing something wrong.”Known as a bag-of-tricks player who can create tries and passes from nowhere, Hogg has a magic that saw JK Rowling bestowing wizard status on him in a Tweet. With the skills of a stand-off when required, the -year-old fullback is best in the back three and, with Finn Russell, is one of the talismans of the Scottish side. Hogg has just come to the end of a nine-year stint at Glasgow Warriors and is bound for Exeter Chiefs this summer. In the meantime he’s having a few weeks’ well-earned break at home, swapping hitch-kicks for kickback.With pre-season training, games for his country against France and Georgia and the Rugby World Cup in Japan ahead, he has his hands full on the pitch. And off too, because the fullback is a big family man and this Father’s Day Archie, three and a half, Olivia, two, and six-month-old George will be keeping him on the run. Never mind Leinster in the Guinness PRO final or the auld enemy at Twickenham, the mini Hogg squad have every bit as much bounce as one of their dad’s drop kicks. “The big thing is routine and preparation,” he says.Ah yes, that’s key with children. Oh wait, he’s talking about rugby.“Yeah, as soon as you get that spot-on in terms of training and schedules, you’re half-way to success and the big thing is getting a routine that includes the kids too. They balance off each other really well and it works for both. “The only thing I maybe struggle with is on match days when I’m trying to concentrate on the game ahead and there’s a job with the kids to do. But we’ve been working on that,” he says. “We’re not going to get everything perfect, and things are not always going to run smoothly,” he laughs. “But as long as the kids are happy and I’m performing, that’s all I can ask for.”“We” is Hogg and his we Gillian, also a Hawick native. The pair have been married for three years, and together for seven, after Hogg persuaded the daughter of family friends to date him. “We eventually got together,” he says. “After a few months of chasing her, she eventually caved in, thankfully, and we’ve been together ever since.”Chasing her  She must be fastshe can out-run Hogg He laughs. “It was more just not replying to my messages!”But persistence is another Hogg quality, as is resilience, something he’s shown in coming back after injuries to his shoulder and ankle, not to mention shrugging off concussion in his last match with the Warriors, where he was carried off the pitch with  minutes to go. “That was a bit disappointing when you’re in touching distance of winning, but look, it’s happened now, and I’ve just got to get on with my job.”Getting on with the job means the move to Exeter this summer, and leaving the town where he grew up, steeped in the rugby tradition.“It was time for me to move on and challenge myself outwith Scottish rugby and the timing was spot on for Gill and the kids. As a family we’re excited because we’ve always wanted to experience new things and challenge ourselves in dferent environments. I don’t look too far ahead, but when I come to the end of my career, I want to turn round and say, ‘I’m glad I tried that’ as opposed to, ‘I wish I’d tried that.’Hawick will always be home for us, and it will be dficult to leave, tough moving further afield. In terms of leaving Scottish rugby, I’ll be forever grateful for the opportunity to become a professional and live the le I’m living. And it’s about learning new things to bring back to Scotland and try to improve the national game as well – we’re in a good place now and hopefully we’re going to continue to rise. It’s exciting times for Scotland, and me.”At this stage in his career and with a young family is it time for Hogg to cash in anyway  “No, If we were interested in the financial side of the game we’d be going to France, but that disnae really excite me,” he says.Speaking of exciting times for Scotland, with the Rugby World Cup coming up in Japan in September, as one of the team’s poster boys Hogg appears a shoo-in to be in the squad. But he’s not taking his place on the plane for granted. “There’s a long old pre-season to go through first,” he says, “and a huge amount of competition for places. There’s no bigger tournament in world rugby, so here’s hoping I can get out there and try and achieve something special. We start off with Ireland. We’ve shown we can beat them, so here’s hoping we can perform on the day.”Hogg is big on the cameraderie of the game, on and off the pitch, and emphasises the importance of bonding to how a team plays. “That’s a big part of rugby culture. You work incredibly hard but you enjoy each other’s company after the game – and enjoy a couple of quiet beers,” he says. And certainly, his focus for Japan is all about the training and games, not the down time.So he won’t be hogging the mic in the karaoke bars He laughs. “Thankfully I’m one of the more experienced boys in the team nowadays and you don’t necessarily have to sing all the time. It’s mainly bullying the younger boys into entertaining us,” he jokes. “But,ever asked upon to sing, I have a few so I’ll… butcher a song and get booed.”For Hogg it was always going to be rugby, born into a rugby family and raised in a town famous for rugby – although technically he was born in Melrose at Borders General Hospital – “brought back to Hawick as quick as we possibly could,” he is keen to point out. After a rugby course at Borders College he joined Glasgow and went through their Academy, turning pro at . His dad John played for Hawick, coached and refereed professionally and his brother Graham also played the game.“It was Graham who gave me the ambition to become a rugby player after following him for several years,” he says. His mother Margaret has always worked in property, and when his dad wasn’t on the rugby pitch, he was working at Johnstons of Elgin as a knitwear technician, the details of which have been lost on Hogg. “Knitwear technician  I’ve no idea. I worked there too in my first job in the school holidays, packing boxes – that was an eye-opener,” he says and discreetly neglects to say why, adding “and recently I’ve done a clothing line for them, SWH, which I really enjoyed.”It’s through his father that Hogg is distantly related to George Best, something that makes him laugh when it’s raised. “I can never remember the exact relation, but my “dad knows. He always wanted to find out his fa mily history, so he did and we’ve caught up with the Irish family, who are absolutely brilliant.”Does he ever ponder the Best experience of working as a professional sportsman and coping with le in the spotlight “Everybody’s dferent,” he says. “For me it’s about making sure I stay grounded and provide for my family. Rugby’s a short career and you’ve got to try and make the most of it. It’s about learning other things off the field to make the transition from professional sport because you never know when it’s going to end.I’m really interested in property with my mum, and also the punditry side of the game. I love rugby, I love speaking rugby, and I’d love to still be involved in some way. Hopefully I’ll play until I’m about , , but you never know when it’s going to end.”Another clue to Hogg’s caring side can be seen in his signature scoring celebration of forming a “W” with his hands. It’s a tribute to his friend Richard Wilkinson, who was killed when the car in which they were both teenage passengers crashed. “I’ve said all along I’m gonnae take Richard along the journey that I’m living because he could quite easily be in my position and I’ll continue to take him along my career.”The le-changing experience in  also spurred Hogg to become involved with the Road Safety Scotland campaign to cut the number of deaths on rural roads. “We’re trying to make people aware of what’s on country roads andit gets the message across and saves lives, we’re doing our job.”Wilkinson is also represented among the many tattoos with which Hogg’s body is decorated. “I love them,” he says. “I’ve got one on the arm, the kids’ names down the ribs, my best mate’s initials on my ribs, lots of dferent bits and pieces. I’m trying to make it a story of my le and what’s happened to me, something I’m proud of and I’ll continue doing it. They’re agony,” he says, man enough to admit it, “but I love ‘em,” At the top of his game, Hogg can look forward to more career and le highlights to commemorate in ink, and he’s happy to be a role model for the next generation of players. “I think that’s part of being a rugby player. It’s about inspiring the next generation. “I’ll always remember being a little kid and professional rugby players coming to the club and Kelly Brown and Nikki Walker coming to my school. So when people come and speak to me and want signatures, it could be my th, but it might be that person’s first. And that’s something I remember. If you get too big for your boots, especially in a place like Hawick, you’ll get knocked back down pretty quickly. For me it’s about making sure there are players who want to play for Hawick and Scotland, making sure rugby in the future is in the right place. And I take great pride in doing it because I remember being that kid.” Speaking of kids it’s time for Hogg to get back to his, but not before sharing a final comment that sums up his ability to combine his personal and professional le.“The best thing is after the game when they come on the pitch and you get to share those precious moments with them. Those are my favourite times.”When men care, everyone benefits, andHogg’s right and being a good father makes him a better player, it’s a win-win for his family and Scottish rugby.Happy Father’s Day from Dove Men+Care, and their Scottish Rugby ambassador, Stuart Hogg.

OK, yes it isspeeding.Surely the issue is appropriate speed # like doing  mph when there are pedestrians or next to schools, built up areas, where there is a limit etc Kat is so right to complain about dangerous driving.It has become an unwanted fad amongst young menwho must be so stupid and so bored that they are prepared to risk le and limbto get their kicks. My belief is that the pointless and brainless cavortings of silly,silly moronic types on programmes like Top Gear are partly to blame.In addition , street racing in cities like London take place late at night driving people to distraction.Police keep an eye on proceedings but it still goes on. Not easy for police cars to safely keep up with idiots in illegally souped up cars travelling , as reported, at  mph.I understand people that have the need for speed. But keep in mind, just because you think you#re a confident driver, that you are safe because you can drive. Doesn#t mean you#re safe. Just recently there was a news report about a drunk driver going off the road and hitting another car. If you#re going at a high speed and that thing comes at you, what can you do  Swerve  There#s a good chance you#re dead, in hospital or best case scenario, your car is totalled.Just because you think you#re a competent driver, doesn#t mean everyone  is. Drive safe.Of course, accidents do happen even to competent,confident, safe drivers but there are people who cast aside such standards in favour of dangerous, unlawful behaviour.These are the ones who need to be severely apprehended.Try to be less pedantic when reading comments.Johan, youseemto have missed the point of Kat’s letter.Nobody has said that overtaking is illegal or wrong but It was estimated that the Audi was travelling at around  to  mph. An offence.In addition , about six or more cars were overtaken in one fell swoop.Not advisable by any stretch of the imagination. Suppose there had been a need to suddenly pull in due to an unforeseen hazard.Something would have had to give , possibly causingan accident.My father used to say to me when I was learning to drive “ always drive asother drivers are stupid”.In short, drive defensively NOT offensively.It seems to me that the Audi driver falls into the stupid category.Better to be ten minutes late in this world than fty years too early in the next.Have you seen this stretch of road  It is the only place in Shetland where there is a lane for overtaking # that is two lanes going up a hill.Very often you are overtaking quite a few things even at  mph going up because of slow things and other cars not overtaking.Unless she actually had a speed gun she cannot judge the speed of things. I regularly see traffic pouring down Herrislea hill and I know that although it looks fast, some of them are actually sticking to the  mph limit.I maintain that it’s better to be safe than sorry.Ease off and keep the undertaker waiting !! Or,you feel so inclined, speed up and become a statistic.Your choice.You need a fair few horses to go up some of our hills at  mph. She is right in that respect, it would need to be a #sporty blue audio or similar#.Some people dont get it could argue till the cows come home some people are very self opinionated cant tell them whats right or wrong Fully agree with haydnJohan, I’ve driven on the roads of Shetland and I can’t recall any that could be called steep.Gentle slopes maybe but nothing to compare with the really steep roads of Scotland and Wales. Even England has some pretty steep examples in the Lake District.The sharpest inclines I’ve experienced in Shetlandare on Foula.I doubt that quad bikes would be much use on the hills though I have seenthem being driven on the low level road.What does horses have to do with speedsterIm not defending speeding. Im saying this is the safest bit of road we have for overtaking and saying that youcannot possibly know the speed of the other cars without measuring equipment.Engine power is expressed in horsepower and lots of horsepower enables some to be faster than others going up hills than others.Haydn I have driven small cars which feel like they need a push going up our hills, that is all.It would be interesting to gauge why people bought a certain model of vehicle in proportion to its top speed, and whether or not this was a deciding factor  The power of an engine could be compared as well  How often would the said person go well over the speed limit just to test the engine or impress a passenger in the vehicle with them regardless of any safety  If a vehicle can do  # mph, why would this be allowed  Why would there not be a limiter to say mph installed If the law allows such vehicles to be sold, why would this be the case .."},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

As a result of its strategic importance both sides concentrated some of their best armoured regiments and equipment in this area. The Guards Armoured Brigade comprised of three tank battalions and had been set up and trained in England. The three battalions were the nd Battalion of the Grenadier Guards, the st Battalion of the Coldstream Guards and the nd Battalion of the Irish Guards. The Irish Guards were recruited from Northern Ireland and the nd Battalion contained men from the Province. You can see it in the tank commanders names. We have Agnew, Brennan, Carson, Connolly, Healy, Harbinson, Mahoney, McCorkell, McGuire, McHugh and Robinson amongst others.The nd Battalion Irish Guards was equipped with American Sherman tanks. These were  ton Medium tanks and mainly equipped with a  mm gun, a useful weapon against infantry but not entirely satisfactory against tanks. The battalion was organised into sub units. There were three squadrons in the battalion, each composed of four troops and each troop had four tanks. The Irish Guards named their tanks after towns and the nd Squadron named theirs with B’s. So we have Ballina, Bangor, Bantry, Belfast, Benbane and Ballynahinch. We also have Ballyraggett and BallymenaBallymena was a special Sherman tank. Ballymena did not have the standard  mm gun. The inconvenient truth for the Allied tank crews was that their tanks were not as good as the best of German ones. A German Tiger tank, for example could destroy a Sherman tank at a distance of over a mile. A Sherman on the other hand would be lucky to harm a Tiger at  yards.  The Britsh crews themselves had already concluded that a Sherman tank was not considered as safe a location as many would have been believed. Hence they covered the front with extra metal tracks and the propensity of the Sherman to do a “Ronson”, that is light up, encouraged the crew to get out very quickly.To deal with the stronger German tanks the Allies devised a way of mounting a bigger gun on some of the Shermans. This new gun was so big it meant redesigning the tank and reducing the size of the crew. These Shermans, now armed with a  pounder gun, which referred to the weight of the shell it fired, were nicknamed FireflyThe Irish Guards arrived in Normandy  days after the initial D Day landings. Caen had still not been completely captured so the Irish Guards eere given a mission to help bypass the city of Caen by gaining ground to the east of the city and drive towards the village of Cagny. This was Operation Goodwood, named after the racecourse in England.Undercover of darkness on the night of th July, Ballymena and the other tanks moved over the River Orne on newly constructed bridges and prepared for battle.The smoke, noise and movement of the battlefield created chaos. Units became mixed up and both sides sometimes got lost. This led to one of the most famous incidents of the battle. By the middle of the afternoon of July th the Irish Guard’s assault is under fire, stalled and mud bound outside the village of Cagny. Lt John Gorman of B Squadron th troop commanding a mm armed Sherman called “Ballyraggett” gets slightly ahead of his comrades and spots a German King Tiger at about yrs. Knowing his gun could do little damage to the King Tiger, Lt Gorman chose a dramatic course of action. He had previously briefed his crew Gunner Albert Scholes, Driver James BaronRadio operator Agnew, and told themhe got the chance they would adopt “Navy tactics”. He instructed Baron to drive at full speed ahead and prepare to ram the German tank. Firing a high explosive shell at close range stunned the inexperienced German crew but had little impact on the tank. However, the high speed collision effectively immobilized both tanks. The Sherman and the King Tiger were abandoned and their crews hid in the fields.Lt Gorman realising the King Tiger was still a viable threat ran towards the nearest Sherman Firefly, in the knowledge only a  pounder gun on the Firefly could do any meaningful damage. This was Ballymena. Some of Ballymena’s crew were already either dead or injured but Gorman jumped in and directed fire on the abandoned King Tiger.  The fighting continued for a while but eventually Gorman was able to rescue his own and other crews and get back to safety.For his exploits Gorman - later Sir John - was awarded the Military Cross. Editor’s note: Sir John, who died aged  in May , was a Northern Irish Roman Catholic Unionist with an unflinching sense of service.After the war he joined the Royal Ulster Constabulary before becoming a senior manager with British Overseas Airways Corporation, then head of the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. Finally he was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly as the sole Roman Catholic member of the Ulster Unionist Party, and served as Deputy Speaker until the Assemblys suspension in . He was a frequent visitor to Ballymena during his time with the NIHE and he never failed tomention that he had married a Ballymena woman, Norah Caruth.

At the time it was taken in the iconic Flamingo Ballroom, they were members of local rock’n’blues band, Tailor.The band was formed in the early s by Tucker McIlwee and John Tennant.“Other band members who played with Tailor over the years were Ronnie McAuley, Hubert Dunlop and Ricky Maybin, Henry McQuillan, Dave Moore Trevor Erwin andGerry McNeely. We were transported to and from the gigs by Brian Surgenor, ” says John.“Our first gig was at a place called Betty Staffs in Belfast but we travelled throughout Ireland playing most of the towns on the circuit.“Amazingly, we had never played in Ballymena until Sammy Barr of the Flamingo approached our manager to offer a booking.”It transpired that Tailor were playing on the same bill as Rory Gallagher. As you would expect, the group were excited but, in their own words, ‘not overwhelmed.’John remembers: “We met with Rory and his band during set up,. Rory was a very down to earth guy. We discussed what songs we were going to play as we were going to have a one hour set. The Flamingo was full to the brim, the crowd were electric and Tailor recieved a tremendous welcome.“Following the gig we met with Rory for the photo call. The rest is history. Tailor continued to travel theand breadth of Ireland entertaining the young and not so young ravers until the group members went their seperate ways after six years of traveling on the road.”After years of inaction the group reformed to play two gigs for Cancer research, The Countryman Inn and the Telecom Club were filled to capacity for the night of nostalgia and entertainment. pound was raised for charity.And John ponders: “Will the group do it again  Watch this space!”Rory Gallagherwas an Irish blues and rock multi-instrumentalist,songwriter, and producer.Born in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, and brought up in Cork, Gallagher recorded solo albums throughout the s and s, after forming the band Taste during the late s. His albums have sold over  million copies worldwide.Gallagher received a liver transplant in , but died of complications later that year in London at the age of .He began playing after school with Irish showbands, while still in his early teens. Having completed a musical apprenticeship and influenced by the increasing popularity of beat groups during the early s, Gallagher formed The Taste, which was later renamed simply, Taste, a blues rock and RB power trio, in .Performing extensively in the UK, the group played regularly at the Marquee Club, supporting both Cream at their Royal Albert Hall farewell concert, and the blues supergroup Blind Faith on a tour of North America.After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name. The s were Gallaghers most prolic period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live in Europe and Irish Tour . November  saw the release of the album Deuce. In the same year he was voted Melody Makers International Top Guitarist of the Year, ahead of Eric Clapton. Though he sold over thirty million albums worldwide, it was his marathon live performances that won him greatest acclaim. He is documented in Irish Tour , a film directed by Tony Palmer.During the heightened periods of political unrest in Northern Ireland, as other artists were warned not to tour, Gallagher was resolute about touring Ireland at least once a year during his career, winning him the dedication of thousands of fans, and in the process, becoming a role model for other aspiring young Irish musicians.

However, underlying issues of majority and binary decision-making processes, and the resulting exclusion of certain voices, are ones that have dogged the institutions since the formation of the Northern state. It is this same system of binary voting that has further polarised opinions and furthered tension in the wake of the Brexit vote. Therefore, it is in this broad context that democratic processes advocated by the North Belfast-based de Borda Institute become all the more interesting.Headed up by Ballysillan man Peter Emerson, The de Borda Institute aims to promote the use of inclusive voting procedures on issues of social choice. These procedures are multi-choice and make use of points based voting system popularised by French mathematician Jean-Charles de Borda.Peter began his own professional career in the British Navy, but soon became disillusioned with the role of British Empire, instead viewing colonialism as “part of the problem” in other nations.His ergent path following his naval resignation saw him move to Rwanda, where he worked as a teacher in the s. It was during that time that he began questioning the majority voting systems implemented by Europeans worldwide. When he came to the North of Ireland in , he realised how similar processes had hindered political progress. “Traditional African decision-making is so much better than majority voting,” he explained.“When you look back and realise that Europeans went to Rwanda and applied majority rule. How crazy can you get “I started to question majority rule in Africa. Then I came here in  and realised that it was part of the problem here. My dad was Irish, from Cork, but he was a member of the minority because he was a Protestant. My mum was English, but she was a member of the minority because she was Catholic, so I’m a political b*****d.“We have this stupid thing here where we’re asked whether we’re British or Irish, which I was asked a lot when I arrived here. They have the same in Rwanda – are you Hutu or Tutsi  It’s a closed question. You’re caught because you could be neither, or both, so you can’t answer a question like that.“I realised very early on that the question was part of the Northern Ireland problem. In  there was the Anglo-Irish Agreement and you had Paisley standing outside City Hall protesting. One week later, six of us stood outside the same venue with a banner saying ‘we have got to say yes to something’.“Six months later we brought a number of parties together at a conference to discuss a range of issues. You put down in order of preference what you like and you can see which option has the widest support. We did this in May . We had Sinn Féin, Official Unionists, UDA, Ulster Clubs – you name it – and we had this fantastic meeting. People could suggest anything they like and as long as it didn’t infringe the UN Charter on Human Rights it was allowed.“We finished with  options on the ballot paper and the people came to conclusion that Northern Ireland should have devolution and power sharing within a joint Dublin, London and Belfast tripartite agreement. It was like a mini Good Friday Agreement, but just  years ahead of its time.”The methods – known as the ‘Borda Count’ – employed by The de Borda Institute, are used to determine the highest average vote amongst a number of options, resulting in what should be a more democratic outcome. While western countries pride themselves on being ‘democratic’, Peter said that their use of majority voting calls that self-ascribed description into question.“In Western Europe we often discuss electoral systems, but when it comes to decision-making it has to be a majority vote,” he said.“Sometimes you see complaints about North Korea, and their elections where they have do you want candidate ‘x’, ‘yes’ or ‘no’  Then we go ahead and have Brexit, ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – it’s the same thing. The basic idea of just asking yes or no is too primitive and gives all the power to the person who sets the question. Majority voting has been used by Napoleon, Lenin, Mussolini, Hitler, Pinochet, Duvalier, Saddam Hussein, Gaddafi – you name it – dictators love it. David Cameron wrote the Brexit question. The Electoral Commission says it’s fair – it’s crazy. It’s like asking a vegetarianthey would like beef or lamb.”In the coming months Peter plans to publish a new book entitled ‘Majority Voting as a Catalyst of Populism’, which tells of his overland journey from Belfast to Beijing and back. The book offers an assessment of a number of regions that he visitied that have suffered from majoritarianism, including post-conflict areas such as the Balkans and the North of Ireland. Asked about our own political impasse, Peter said: “Politicians don’t like the idea of giving people a choice. The politician who wants ‘x’ is happy to have it on the ballot paper, and maybe ‘y’, but not ‘z’. If you are a proper democrat and you want the will of the people then you give them the choice to decide. Then whatever they decide you, the Executive, execute. If you totally disagree then you resign.“We go to the polling stations and elect an assembly. If somebody abstains then that’s fine. Those who do want to get on with it can. If the DUP and Sinn Féin don’t want to be there then that’s a pity, but to give them the monopoly or veto is a crazy way of doing things. Part of the trouble is that the Belfast Agreement was designed by people who were part of the problem in the first place. It is a very majoritarian document. They devised this system that gives them control.”He added: “This idea that because one group is bigger or more numerous that they can tell the other where to go is totally primitive.”"},{"url":"http://belfastmediagroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Bubbles.png","title":"siomha wows buble","story":"A -year-old Coláiste Feirste pupil wowed Canadiansinging superstar Michael Bublé with her vocal talent at his sell-out concert inthe city on Monday night.

This is the case up until he witnesses the hatred and bigotry directed towards Irish supporters of the now infamous and most politically -charged match between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland during the  World Cup qualier at Windsor Park.The toxic atmosphere which rained down from the stands was captured in Marie’s prose the match comingjust days after the Shankill bombing and the Greysteel murders.The Fall and Come Home actor Matthew Forsythe fought off  submissions,  self-tapes and “ people in the room which was then whittled down to ,” for the “dream role” of playing Kenneth.“I read it around  and it was and is one of those theatre pieces that I instantly felt a connection with. I saw a lot of me in the part especially growing up in the s and s.”The play on its first initial run was a showcase for actor Dan Gordon who portrayed Kenneth, and later Marty Maguire who toured the production around the States. Matthew explained how when he was trying to get into drama school across the water he contacted Dan for advice and support.“I was holding a charity event to try and raise a bit of money, Dan couldn’t come but he sent me a postcard with a £ cheque in it and the postcard was of Dan in character as Kenneth. I still have it,” he said.Matthew’s further connection to the piece was that he was in the Windsor stands that ‘night in November’having been taken to see the match with his school, Laurelhill High School in Lisburn.In August  Patrick Kielty took on the role of Kenneth, directed by acclaimed actor Ian McElhinney during a run at the Opera House. Fast-forward  years and its Ian and Marie’s son Matthew now in the director’s chair.“The play debuted during a very sensitive, political time,” explained Matthew McElhinney, “the reaction was very funny, very moving and very engaging. There was some controversy over the content, it was seen as being not painting the side of the community my mother came from in the best light, essentially it was a critique of her own community, her own people. Mum was writing about what she saw at the time. Such was its reaction the Lyric had to put on extra security.”Asked about the signicance of the play  years on Matthew spoke of how the play “paints the two sides of football”.“I remember there was talk of bringing the play back to the stage during the Euro’s but mum said it wasn’t the right time.  years is a big anniversary and I kept thinking ‘how am I going to stage this ’ To frame it within the context of that was then, this is now. There has been astounding progress from the ‘Billy Boys’ to being awarded the Grand Vermeil in  during the Euros, for the Northern Ireland fans along with the Republic. It’s a chance to say look at what we have achieved, and the tagline of the play is ‘is it possible to change ’“The play has ups, downs, laughs and emotion. It’s been  years and we are about to have a whole new generation come to see it.”A Night in November runs at the Lyric Theatre from June -.

He now says he favours a renegotiation of the agreement and wants the backstop to be surrounded by an unambiguous \"exit mechanism\". Has also said that a rebooted Executive Assembly would help to resolve matters and indicated that he would even lead the talks process. Described Karen Bradley as a \"brilliant\" Secretary of State.Success Rating:  Matt HancockA slightly woollier version of Goves position. He wants a time limit on the backstop, although doesnt indicate how long short the limit would be. He has also suggested that a new political negotiations body of some sort - involving Northern Irelands parties - could be established to create North South consensus on a way forward.Success Rating:  Read MoreWho are the contenders in the Tory leadership race Boris Johnson is ‘yesterday’s news’, says Tory rival Sajid JavidMark HarperA former chief whip with a reasonably good nose for what the parliamentary party might gather around, he supported the Malthouse Compromise. This emerged in January and involves the backstop being redrafted as a \"free trade agreement-lite\" with a commitment on all sides there should be no hard border on the island of Ireland. Would want to breathe new le into it. The DUP supports the compromise.Success Rating:  Please log in or register with belfasttelegraph for free access to this article.Sign InNew to Belfasttelegraph  window.gigyaIntegration  window.gigyaIntegration  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand  gigyaIntegrationmand.push gigyaIntegrationLoginScreenSet gigyaIntegrationRegisterScreenSetJeremy HuntAlong with Johnson and Gove, considered one of the three most likely to win . He is of the view that the European Unions negotiating team has accepted that the backstop, or something very similar to the backstop, will not get through Parliament. But he hasnt set out an alternative to the backstop. Hard to knowhe hasnt actually got an alternative at this point, orhe is just keeping his powder dry until he gets to the final two.Success Rating:  Sajid Javid\"I will focus on the one Brexit deal that has already got through Parliament - that was the withdrawal agreement - with a change to the backstop. What I would do is make a grand gesture to Ireland that we would cover all their costs - the upfront costs, the running costs - of a new digitised border. I think it could be done in a couple of years.\" There is no evidence that he has even had below-the-radar discussions with either Ireland or the EU about his proposals.Success Rating:  Boris JohnsonNobody knows what Johnson will do. He excoriated the withdrawal agreement and the backstop at the DUPs conference last November and then voted for it a few weeks later. Has yet to explain how he will replace the backstop, let alone discuss avoiding the potential damage to UK Irish and North South relationshipshe fails to renegotiate the present agreement and the UK exits without a deal.Success Rating:  Andrea LeadsomHer parliamentary reputation has grown over the last two years, particularly while she was Leader of the House. More flexible than she is often given credit for, she speaks of a \"managed exit\" as opposed to a full-scale renegotiation and believes the backstop problem could be resolved with a \"sensible\" trade deal and \"technological oversight\" re the border.Success Rating:  Esther McVeyProbably the most hardline Brexiteer candidate and the one most likely to prioritise a no-deal over a renegotiation. Thats because she doesnt think the EU will reopen full-scale negotiations. The DUP wouldnt admit it, but itd rather she didnt win. The party talks tough on a no-deal outcome, but is well aware of the huge damage a no-deal could do to political institutional dynamics in Northern Ireland. Luckily for it, she has no chance.Success Rating:  Dominic RaabThe former Cabinet minister with \"responsibility for exiting the EU\" lasted only four months in the job: and didnt distinguish himself by his admission that he hadnt quite understood the full extent of how much UK trade relies on the Dover-Calais route. He also supported the Malthouse Compromise.Success Rating:  Rory StewartThe only genuine wildcard in the leadership race. His brutal, quirky honesty allows him to say things like \"stop pretending the EU will be willing to renegotiate the current backstop arrangement\". Would probably try and push the withdrawal agreement through after a new round of talks with the other parties. Would not be comfortable with a renewed parliamentary arrangement with the DUP.Success Rating:  "},{"url":"https://cdn-03.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/incoming/article38188701.ece/ALTERNATES/h342/sponi_48.jpg","title":"nolan only two politicians have been to fantasy island home","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

There is a story in that in itself.“I am saying ‘absolutely not, I am meeting you in public’ [To Mr Bell]. And him saying ‘the story I am about to give you here will be the biggest story you will ever had’.”Nolan did not expand on why McGuinness was at his home.Mr Bell was suspended by the DUP in December  after giving an interview to Nolan about the scheme. He made explosive claims that DUP special advisers were reluctant to introduce cost control tarfs to the scheme.The Renewable Heat Incentive scheme was an green energy initiative set up to encourage businesses in Northern Ireland to switch from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy.The so-called “cash-for-ash” scandal exposed the taxpayer to a huge overspend by paying out more in subsidies than the fuel was worth.As a result of the scandal a public inquiry, chaired by Sir Patrick Coghlin, was launched to investigate. The report is expected to be published later this year.The scandal led to McGuinness resigning as deputy first minister and the power-sharing executive has not been restored since."},{"url":null,"title":"northern ireland traffic alerts latest delays and diversions","story":" Hi degC | Lo degC  | WEATHER AthloneBrayCorkDroghedaDundalkGalwayKilkennyLimerickNavanWaterfordHomeBrexitCourtsNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsRHI ScandalLocal Elections EU Elections BrexitHealthSunday LeEducationGraduationsCourtsSportFootballPremier LeagueIrish LeagueScottishInternationalFA and League CupsBilly on the boxRugbyUlster RugbyUlster Rugby Round Up podcastsPROSix NationsEuropean Champions CupClub RugbySchools CupGAAAntrimArmaghCavanDerryDonegalDownFermanaghMonaghanTyroneGolfThe OpenMotor SportMotorcyclingOther SportsBelfast GiantsHorse RacingBoxingCricketTennisHockeyCyclingRunningDeclan BogueBusinessNorthern IrelandCommercial PropertyFood, Drink and HospitalityUK  WorldBrexitJobsAgriBalmoral ShowTechAnalysisHelp and AdviceBusiness BulletinTop Business AwardsEntertainmentNewsMusic and GigsFilm and TVTheatre and ArtsBelfast FestivalHoroscopesLeFashion  beautyHealthHouse and HomeHomes  InteriorsProperty AwardsRestaurant ReviewsFood  DrinkRecipesFeaturesBooksFamily LeFamily LeCarsOpinionNews AnalysisEditors ViewpointColumnistsAlban MaginnessAlf McCrearyFionola MeredithGail WalkerLindy McDowellMary KennyNelson McCauslandRuth Dudley EdwardsSuzanne BreenArchivePeopleEventsPlacesTitanicUlster CovenantTravelHoliday WorldHoliday Guide Your Hotel  Tour GuideVideoEventsProperty AwardsPrint SupplementSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

However, he dropped his religious studies in favour of a career in journalism.However, prior to this he had gained a doctorate from Edinburgh University for his contribution to charting the history of the church. It was during this particular course of study that he submitted some articles to the Belfast News Letter that led to an invitation to become a member of its staff.He accepted this position and by  he was the paper’s editor.In , after a political dispute with the News Letter’s owner he resigned and briefly became editor of the Londonderry Standard.Then, between - McKnight was appointed editor of the Banner of Ulster and it was in this period, as a result of the tenant grievances that he witnessed, he became fearful that another rebellion in the mould of the  United Irishmen would erupt.When he ed as editor of the Londonderry Standard he further developed the campaign for tenant rights. Also upon histo the Standard he married the owner of the paper’s sister-Miss Catherine McPherson of Balloughry.At this time the majority of small farmers in Ulster relied on weaving to bolster their income as well as working the land.The coming campaign of agitation was a daunting one and its success depended upon defeating Tory landlords who held all the Parliamentary representation in the country.In effect, farmers were serfs who were obliged to pay rents regulated solely by landowners who also firmly held the reins of political power. As a result, tenant farmers lived in almost perpetual fear of increased tarfs and evictionthey failed to pay them.As Repeal of the Union agitation gathered strength in the south of Ireland, James McKnight simultaneously championed the cause of Presbyterian farmers in the north. The fight centred on the three F’s-fixity of tenure, fair rents and free sale.An example of Dr James McKnight’s famed oratory was captured in a speech he delivered whilst on the tenant rights campaign trail in Newtonards in this era.“I have no language sufficiently strong to convey my contempt for policies which, under the hypocrisy of religion, degrade Christianity to an engine of State intrigue,” he said.The journalist’s abilities seemed to be sufficiently feared by the English political hierarchy to the extent that after he had led a deputation to meet Prime Minister Robert Peel on the issues at hand, he was offered a Parliamentary seat in County Wexford in an obvious attempt to bring him ‘from the cold.’ James McKnight declined the offer.The Tenant Right League was established in August of  and was formed chiefly by Charles Gavan Duffy and Frederick Lucas.The movement was remarkable in that for a time it united Protestant and Catholic tenants. In fact, Duffy named his movement The League of North and South.The political battle was framed against the backdrop of the Encumbered Estates Act of . Essentially, this legislation enabled the sale after the Great Famine, of Irish estates whose owners could not meet their financial obligations.In the north of Ireland, Anglican and Presbyterian ministers feared these new landlords would destroy the established Ulster custom of compensating tenants who made improvements to the land.At the same time in the south, politically conscious Catholic priests wanted to adopt the compensation custom in the north as a measure of reform in their part of the island.The League was a conglomeration of the Tenant Protection Societies and the Ulster Tenant Rights Association led by William Sharman Crawford. Unity between the organisations was unfortunately short lived because of objections to the involvement of Catholic clergy in the south.Larger tenant farmers were primarily interested in securing Fixity of Tenure while the smaller farmers prioritised fair rents. To strengthen the campaign the leaders of the League sought the support of Irish MPs to oppose any government that would not back the ‘Ulster Custom.’In this respect, the Tenant Rights League achieved success through the efforts of its national organiser John Martin. It garnered the support of the surviving Repealers of the Union in the House of Commons as well as a number of radical English radical MPs.googletag.cmd.push .addSize.addSize.buildslot  googletag.defineSlot.defineSizeMapping.setTargeting.setTargeting.setTargeting.addServicegoogletag.displaygoogletag.pubads.refreshAnd, all of these supportive elements agreed that a Land Act incorporating the three F’s would be the overall objective of the political campaign.Then, at the  General Election some fty Tenant Rights candidates including Gavan Duffy, Frederick Lucas and John Sadlier all won seats at Westminster where they sat as the Independent Irish Party.The League’s success however proved short lived when it was first weakened and then ultimately destroyed by the resurfacing of old sectarian isions.Firstly, a number of prominent members broke away and formed the Catholic Defence Association-referred to as the ‘Pope’s Brass band’ by some in the organisation. Supporters of the League were also subjected to a campaign of intimidation by the landlords.However, the most serious blow came when Frederick Lucas came into conflict with the Archbishop of Dublin, Dr Paul Cullen. The high-ranking cleric had forbidden his priests from involvement in political issues causing Lucas took his complaint about Dr Cullen to Rome. This succeeded only in alienating the Catholic church in Ireland from the fight.Then, Frederick Lucas died in October  shortly after the failure of his plea to the Papacy. A month later, Gavan Duffy emigrated to Australia.The League finally fell apart in  with the Independent Irish Party following it into oblivion the following year.It was not however the end of the tenants rights campaign. The baton that had been dropped by the League and the Independent Irish Party was picked up again by Bishop Thomas Nulty of Meath. It was then spearheaded by the Land League in  and the three F’s became anchored in legislation under the Land LawAct in .In general, the cause of tenants rights was more successful in the south of Ireland. In the north, landlords were more firmly entrenched and the issue of the Repeal of the Union had caused many northern delegates in the League to walk away and fight the cause as unionists or Liberal Tenant Righters.However, almost  years before the Land LawAct enshrined the F’s in law, in the north Mr SM Greer had gained the County Derry seat against the power of landlordism.Thirteen years later in  when Gladstone introduced a Land Bill that embodied the principles of tenant rights, it was Dr James McKnight that the government of the day consulted. That same parliamentary term also saw the introduction of the Ballot Act which ended intimidation.This shows that the journalist had at the outset been for a period a lone voice advocating social reform in Ireland.Without doubt, Dr McKnight had been regarded as the leader and champion of the rights of the Presbyeterian farmers and for his efforts was presented with a testimonial and £ by them. He died on June ,  aged  at his house on East Wall in his adopted homeplace of Derry.A glimpse of the le of James McKnight and his we outside of the newspaper business and political campaigning came around  years after his passing when his former paper, the Derry Standard marked the death of his spouse Catherine on February , .The Standard said: “We greatly regret to record the death of Mrs McKnight, formerly of this city, which took place at College Square East, Belfast, on Monday after a somewhat protracted illness during which she was tenderly nursed by her sister, Miss Rebecca McPherson.“The deceased was the we of the former editor of this paper, James McKnight L.L.D and was well known in this city thirty years ago, when Dr McKnight’s house on the East Wall and subsequently at Warrenhill, was the rendezvous of a circle of congenial spirits, who often met to enjoy the refined society of Dr McKnight and his accomplished we.“Among the welcome guests were generally to be found the late Rev William McClure, Reverend Professor Wallace and Reverend Richard, afterwards Professor Smyth MP.“At an earlier period in their domestic history they had the honour of entertaining the late Thomas Carlyle, who met at their house all the leading Derry celebrities of the time and in the book which he afterwards published made some remarks on his fellow guests that were more plain than pleasant but he said all that was kind and complimentary of the host and his gentle helpmate and commended the quality of the doctors tobacco.“After the death of Dr McKnight, Mrs McKnight visited the principle cities on the Continent, and spent some time in Italy enjoying the beauty and art of that classic land, which she was so well able to appreciate.“Although highly cultivated, and possessing good literary abilities, she was not successful as a writer, and her only work, ‘The Friend of the Poor’, was not read beyond her personal circle of friends.“For some years past Mrs McKnight has lived in Belfast, and there she passed away on Monday morning last, after a lingering illness, which she bore with patient and cheerful resignation.“The interment will take place in the Cemtery at Derry today, the funeral leaving the terminus of the Northern Counties railway at ten o’clock.”Dr James and Mrs Catherine McKnight had no children.CAPTION: Dr James McKnight."},{"url":null,"title":"derry woman appointed managing director global strategy consultancy firm","story":"A Derry woman has been appointed to the role of Managing Director at a leading firm specialising in leadership strategy.Tessa Breslinassumed the role in recent weeks and will now head up YSC’s Americas Division spanning the United States, Brazil, Canada and Mexico.YSC Consulting uses their expertise in behavioural science to help organisations across the globe connect the dots between business strategy and leadership.

The Down defence was performing exceptionally well at this stage, but they had a nightmare finish to the first half.Despite defending in numbers, Down lost their shape and points from Josh Casey, Liam McGrath and Conor Sweeney sent Tipperary into the break with a - to - lead.Down now had the wind behind them in the second half and Havern reduced the arrears in the th minute with a point from play. This was quickly cancelled out with a free from McGrath before a Harrison point left two points between the sides.Havern and Sweeney exchanged scores before the mighty Quinn got involved.His influence on the game was immediate and an early point settled him into the pace of the game, his score leaving a point in it with  minutes remaining.Down fired a couple of wides before Burns produced his game-changing save. OrsquoHare seized the moment and he drilled the ball to the back of the net in the th minute after a bit of ping-pong in the Tipperary square.Down now had a - to - lead, but Liam Casey left the minimum in it yet again when he spilt the posts with a great score.Quinn and Quinlavin swapped scores before Quinn and Paul Devlin gave Down a - to - lead with only two minutes remaining.Conor Sweeney threw Tipperary a leline with a converted free, but with five additional minutes to be played, Down patiently held on to the ball and Barry OrsquoHagan completed the scoring when he restored his sidersquos three point lead in added time.Down: Rory Burns , Brendan McArdle, Darren OrsquoHagan , Gerard Collins, Ryan McAleenan, Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness, Johnny Flynn, Conor Poland, Conor Francis, Pat Havern , James Guinness, Jerome Johnston , Donal OrsquoHare , Connaire Harrison .

It is important we all work to strive for the very highest of standards across all our facilities..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Castlewellan bioblitz to locate identity of wildlife in forest park  ","story":"CASTLEWELLAN Forest Park is the venue for a special race against the clock this weekend.Scientists, naturalists and members of the public will be taking part in a lsquobioblitzrsquo to find identy as many species as a possible over a period of  hours.The countdown begins on Friday at pm with a bat talk and nocturnal walk with the Northern Ireland Bat Group.On Saturday morning local moth expert Andy Crory will set out to discover what moths have been caught overnight.

An email sent to staff claimed the issue of period poverty was a lsquosilentrsquo issue that needed to be dealt with in a lsquodiscreetrsquo way by staff.Mrs Trainor said it was ldquoentirely unacceptable that women and girls were made to feel that their ldquotime of the month was inconvenient or shameful. Indeed, she said women and men have shied away from talking about periods openly for far too long.She added: ldquoUnite believes that, by changing perceptions, we can tackle some of the wider issues around periods. We want access to sanitary products in the workplace and schools to be as normal as having access to things such as toilet roll. Management of Newry, Mourne and Down Council need to change course and treat their female workforce with dignity.A council spokeswoman said the organisation was carrying out the lsquoPink Presentrsquo pilot scheme as a response to the increasingly recognised issue of lsquoperiod povertyrsquo within the wider community.ldquoWe are facilitating donations so that products are available to anybody who needs them, she said.ldquoThis project is being carried out in partnership with the Southern Health Trust and Southern Regional College and is an initiative which has previously been run in other parts of Northern Ireland, the spokeswoman continued.ldquoThere is currently limited data and statistical evidence on what the local need is for a period poverty project and this is what this pilot is trying to establish. We are very happy with how the scheme has been supported to date and will evaluate the scheme after the pilot has ended.The spokeswoman said the local authority was ldquocommitted to working with all its partners to deal with any health inequalities that are prevalent within the district and would continue to explore ways of helping those people in most need..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Crossgar girl Lauren’s charity sky dive  ","story":"CROSSGAR girl Lauren Houston is celebrating her th birthday next month with a thrilling sky e to raise money for Barnardorsquos.The charity is close to the teenrsquos heart as she knows from first hand experience what a helping hand can mean to a young person in care.Lauren was adopted at the age of four after being in the foster care system.The  year-old has already raised pound but hopes to raise more than her pound, target.A GCSE student at Saintfield High School, Lauren is also taking part in this weekendrsquos Aughlisnafin GAC Mud Run, near Castlewellan.Then a week after she turns , she will be doing a tandem skye on July .ldquoAs soon as Irsquom , I plan to do a sky e on my own, Lauren told the Down Recorder.ldquoI had to wait until I turned  before being allowed to do it due to age restrictions.

I think there was a bit more hunger from the Down team, especially in turning balls over and tackling. They showed a greater desire to win the game.Slowly, but surely Downrsquos players are starting to buy into Tallyrsquos revolution.Goalkeeper Rory Burns is a natural between the posts. He exudes confidence with his handling and his kick-outs are rarely wasted.The full back line of Darren OrsquoHagan, who negated the threat of former All Star Michael Quinlivan, the recalled Benny McArdle and Downpatrickrsquos Gerard Collins were immense.Kevin McKernan, Daniel Guinness and Ryan McAleenan threw a brick wall up in front of the back three and made scores extremely hard to come by for Tipperary.A fit again Jonny Flynn was a colossus in the middle of the park and more than held his own against the highly-rated Steven OrsquoBrien.Conor Polandrsquos physicality was much-needed in the engine room and Conor Francisrsquo non-stop running frustrated the le out of Tipperary.The Down forwards all kept going when forced to live off crumbs, but it was the introduction of Mayobridgersquos Cory Quinn that really caught the imagination.The  year-old forward has been the scourge of every defender on the county club scene since the start of the season and he is now starting to show that sort of form for Tally.The pocket rocket has pace, power and an eye for scores. Quinn has yet start to start a game for Down and throwing him in the deep end against a side like Mayo may not be fair on him, but Tally knows that he can spring him from the bench when required.The suspended Caolan Mooney will also be back for the Mayo game and he will relish the prospect of locking horns with Aiden OrsquoShea OrsquoShea, Keith Higgins, Matthew Ruane and Lee Keegan..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Environment campaigner Isabel receives recognition  ","story":"A LOCAL environmental campaigner who has received a British Empire Medal in the Queenrsquos Birthday Honours says the award is ldquototally unexpected.Isabel Hood, who has been recognised for her services to environmental conservation, is vice-chairwoman of the Strangford Lough and Lecale Partnership and a trustee of the Mourne Heritage Trust.A keen sailor, she is a past commodore of Quoile Yacht Club and current chairperson of Portaferry Leboat Station.

The former police base is now in the ownership of the Department of Communities which is working alongside the local council to help bring new investment to the town.Details of the project have already attracted reported interest from leading retailers, with Marks and Spencer and Home Bargains understood to be keen to invest in Downpatrick. The proposed investment initiative also kills off plans for a new road through the former police base linking Irish Street and St Patrickrsquos Avenue.Councillors were told this week that in addition to securing the necessary land in irish Street, officials also hope to make signicant progress on a development brief designed to encourage developers to come forward and redevelop the sprawling Irish Street site to provide a signicant economic boost for the town and existing traders through increased footfall.Securing world renowned UNESCO geopark status for an area taking in the Mournes, Ring of Gullion and the Strangford and Lecale Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty is also a priority for the local authority. The formal bud will be lodged this November.The focus on the so-called Two Oceans geopark status is primarily about environmental sustainability and trying to increase economic revenue in a part of the world already revered for its stunning beauty.For over one year the local authority has been engaging with local communities as it firms up its application bid and is working alongside the the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland.Geoparks are based around signicant areas of geology and are set up to support sustainable economic development of an area, primarily through geological and eco-tourism. But they are not just about geology and include sites that are of interest for their history, archaeology, bioersity, folklore, cultural and local heritage.Securing the prestigious designation for the local area is one of the key planks of Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos tourism strategy, with councillors confident that it has the potential to deliver high quality tourism in the area, increasing the number of international visitors.The thorny issue of car parking charges across the district is another key issue for the local authority which aims to rationalise the bye-laws controlling them.A detailed survey ordered in the wake of the controversial decision to hike car parking charges across the district last year has been completed.Charges at a number of car parks in Downpatrick and Ballynahinch were increased by % in April last year, rising to  pence per hour and increasing the cost of a weekly parking ticket to almost pound.But there is anger in the business community in both towns that while parking charges in their respective locations have been increased, it remains free to park at local authority-owned car parks in Newcastle, Saintfield and Castlewellan.Planning has been a particularly vexatious issue for the local council since it was handed responsibility for it, with many councillors particularly happy with its current delivery.Under the draft development plan, the local authority aims, by the end of March next year, to process % of local planning applications with  weeks. A turnaround target of processing % of major application within  weeks has been set.Dealing with a backlog of enforcement issues has also been a problem for local planners with the council aiming to conclude % of enforcement cases within  weeks..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Karen is a golden girl  ","story":"A KILLYLEAGH grandmother has just ed home from the World Classic Powerlting Championships in Sweden with a haul of medals.The  year-old legal secretary won gold in the deadlt where she raised kg.

highly ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in the resort.The ious proposals are at the heart of the Mournes Gateway investment initiative which is one of a series of projects included in Newry, Mourne and Down Councilrsquos bid for a share of poundbn investment package under the Belfast City Regional Deal.City deals are packages of funding and decision making powers which allow councils to boost the economy through the development of large projects in their respective areas.The deals are designed to allow councils to take charge and responsibility of decisions that affect their area, do what they think is best to help businesses grow, create economic growth and decide how public money should be spent.Newry, Mourne and Down Council is one of five councils paired with Belfast City Council, universities and the private sector who have committed poundm to help deliver a raft of schemes, with the remainder of the cash coming from the Treasury and Northern Ireland Executive.Earlier this year, a so-called heads of agreement mdash paving the way for work to start on the business cases and financial plans for ious components of the city deal mdash was signed.On Monday, members of the local councilrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee were provided with a progress report, with other key issues the council keen to see delivered as part of the city deal initiative including the southern relief road linking Newry by-pass with the Warrenpoint Road and the multi-million pound regeneration of Newry town centre.Local authority officials are expected to work with Tourism NI to help deliver the ambitious proposals aimed at shaping future tourist provision in Newcastle which include a gondola ride into the heart of the Mournes.The proposal is one of a series of exciting, world class attraction proposals, including an ultra-modern visitor centre at the site of the old quarry at Thomasrsquo Mountain.It is being suggested that work on the business case, alongside detailed financial plans, could take around one year to complete, with the ious proposals delivered with the help of a range of funding partners to signicantly increase the number of visitors to the resort.While the main focus is on the major aspects of the tourism initiative mdash which also include an Alpine coaster ride enabling people to hurtle down the side of the mountain on a single track in a buggy and an indoor activity centre in Donard Park mdash there are many other components.The local council hopes to secure poundm from the Northern Ireland Executive and is committing poundm of ratepayersrsquo money to fund the proposed gondola ride and visitor centre.In addition, local authority officials are working alongside Tourism NI to secure financial backing for other aspects of the gateway project and to move its ious components through a series of key stages, including the preparation of business cases and planning approval.The Mournes Gateway project also includes an elevated tree top walk in Tollymore Forest Park, new visitor centre and bird hide at the Murlough Nature Reserve and a new bridge constructed under the main Kilkeel Road at the Bloody Bridge on the outskirts of the town.Various aspects of the Newcastle tourism plan have already been discussed with the National Trust, Forest Service and Environment Agency, with the overarching vision of the project to provide game-changing, world-class, international tourist attractions..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/photo_gallery.jpg","title":"Pop up beach plan aims to boost tourism  ","story":"NEWRY, Mourne and Down Council has unveiled details of a three-pronged initiative designed to enhance Newcastlersquos tourist reputation and satisfy the needs of residents and visitors left disappointed and frustrated at the absence of sand along its beach.The local authority is planning to work alongside the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs as part of the initiative with politicians told on Monday that plans are being drawn up to hold a meeting involving councillors, council officials and government representatives.The government department needs to grant a marine licence to carry out work at the beach, with the forthcoming talks also due to discuss the potential for transporting sand by road from Ballykinlar to the beach at Newcastle promenade.However, many believe that such a costly operation would simply not be feasible as the sand would be washed out to sea in a very short period of time and that such a scheme may not be approved by government officials.Details of the new Newcastle initiative were outlined at Mondayrsquos meeting of the local authorityrsquos Enterprise, Regeneration and Tourism Committee when councillors agreed to start work on an economic appraisal to help improve the beach.It will examine in detail the cost and merits of a radical suggestion to add an articial pop-up beach at the resortrsquos promenade to provide the town with a certain je ne sais quoi between July and August.The idea to bring a little European flair to the resortrsquos sea front via a pop-up-beach mdash similar to those along the banks of the Seine in Paris and other parts of Europe mdashwas first suggested last year.While the idea was initially rejected by a council committee, the recommendation was subsequently overturned by the full council, with officers asked to look at the issue of how to address Newcastlersquos shting sands to make the resort more appealing.The problem is exacerbated by the design of the promenade which deflects waves back out to sea, taking what little sand there is on sections of the beach with it.Politicians insist that they are keen to make the resort even more attractive to visitors, often left disappointed there is no sand where the Mountains of Mourne sweep down to the sea.They say they recognise that the absence of a sandy beach is the resortrsquos Achilles heel and is an issue they are keen to address to make Newcastle even more attractive to holidaymakers in particular.Politicians also want more focus on an enhanced beach management plan which will result in a more robust cleansing programme alongside the provision of additional litter bins.Pop-up beaches along the banks of the Seine and in other parts of Europe are hugely popular and a final decision on whether they could feature in Newcastle next summer with deck chairs and parasols the order of the day along a section of the picturesque promenade is expected to be taken within the next weeks.While local politicians are united on the need to address Newcastlersquos tourism needs, they are split on the merits of a pop-up beach, with a number for and opposed to such a move, arguing there is no appetite for such a facility in the resort.In addition, some council officials believe that while Newcastle promenade is not suitable for pop-up beaches, two areas adjacent to the Downs Road car park would be and that the cost over a nine-week summer period would be in the region of pound,.Some councillors have also suggested that consideration needs to be given to placing groins along sections of beach to protect what little sand there is on it..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/17689406.corbyn-told-big-changes-needed-to-reopen-deal/resources/images/9926183.jpg","title":"dragons den pitch for swcs business

Unfortunately the swing bridge has been out of commission since June .I have met with residents and local Labour councillors, who have been working closely with residents to discuss their concerns and plans to make the bridge once more available to the public.The bridge is owned by the Vale of Glamorgan Council and leased to Penarth Quays MarinaLTD. It was built to ensure that both residents and boat owners had equal access to land and water.I understand that there are no mechanical reasons why the bridge should not be used.The Vale Council and PQM have agreed that safety upgrades need to be carried out for the bridge to reopen. In October  PQM submitted a planning application for modications to the swing bridge. I have been told that PQM were contacted by the Vale council to mody the current application to include lower intensity flashing lights and lsquosilent alarmsrsquo. Unfortunately PQM felt that the changes would not meet the safety standards they felt necessary and choose to withdraw the application. I understand that the Vale Council is currently awaiting the outcome of a noise report which will feature in future discussions between the Vale and PQM over the future of the swing bridge.The swing bridge has been an integral part of marina le for many years and is enjoyed by both residents and the thousands of tourists to the area. Connecting the two sides of the marina the bridge acts as a short cut for residents, particularly useful for those with walking dficulties. Having spoken to local businesses about the potential for the reopening the consensus seems to be generally positive. Reopening of the swing bridge, customers could use the car park on Llwyn Passat and use the bridge to access Portway businesses.I hope that the Vale council and PQM are able to work together to find a solution. I think we can all agree that the way forward is to ensure safe operation of the bridge while minimising disruption to adjacent properties.Before the Easter recess I met with residents to listen to their concerns over plans to remove Victorian lampposts from across Penarth. The cast iron lampposts, which have been an integral part of Penarthrsquos street scene for a century are being replaced by the Vale council with modern LED lighting. I am disappointed that several lampposts along Cwrt-Y-Vil road have been removed without notying residents.Residents have set up a petition, of which over a thousand people so far have signed asking for the old posts to be left in place with new ones installed beside them.

And under my leadership, a Conservative administration will proudly put the people of the Vale of Glamorgan first.ldquoNaturally, we are open to working with other councillors who share those ideals.ldquoOthers - including those who resigned from the Conservative party - will have to explain to voters where they stand on these issues - and I would urge them to back us, rather than propping up a Labour administration that was rejected by the Vale at the last election.Cllr Bailey said he had a six-point plan for the Vale.He pledged to deliver the Dinas Powys bypass stop inflation-busting council tax rises scrap proposed parking charges review the local development planto curb inappropriate development protect rural schools and oppose the Barry Biomass plant.Cllr Bailey said that he was also keen to improve engagement with the public, after a series of hugely unpopular decisions taken by the existing cabinet.He said: ldquoDuring the elections in , we promised to build a stronger relationship with local residents by consulting them on key decisions.ldquoUnfortunately, too many people feel that their views are simply being ignored and that Vale consultations are just tick box exercises. Take the proposals around car parking charges, or the closure of Llancarfan School. I donrsquot think anyone outside of the Civic Offices believes that those decisions werenrsquot already done deals, and thatrsquos simply unacceptable.ldquoAnother good example is the councilrsquos failure to listen to the public over Penarthrsquos original Victorian lamp posts.ldquoIrsquove been criticised for wanting to listen to the people who elected me, and I make no apologies for that. Under my leadership, thatrsquos exactly what would happen and whilst I do accept that there are dficult decisions to be taken, we have to take the public with us - not ignore their legitimate concerns. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

Although a relative newcomer to the site, having previously taught in Newport, it is clear he is immensely proud of the students and staff.ldquoVisitors to the school often comment on the warm, friendly and purposeful environment that exists at Stanwell and, despite its size, they see how the school cares about the inidual child and their progress, he said.ldquoThe schoolrsquos Mission Statement is summarised as lsquoLearning to Excelrsquo and this is the vision for every child, whatever their starting points, interests or talents. The school thrives because we have a fantastic team of teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, parents and governors who help make this vision a reality.ldquoThis is what makes the school so successful because everybody gives so much.Wandering through a theatre the school uses to put on assemblies and biannual productions, Mrs Kynaston pointed out a section of floor that moved away to create an orchestral pit. The production value afforded to every department ndash theatre, maths, sports, English ndash was astounding.ldquoWe try to give our pupils the very best, said Mrs Kynaston. ldquoWe want them to truly reach their potential. To excel.Mr Brown agreed. ldquoOur amazing staff believe in every young personrsquos potential to succeed and really do go the lsquoextra milersquo for pupils, he said. ldquoOur pupils flourish academically but also as well rounded, confident young people ready to contribute to society.The extra-curricular provision at the school is broad and this really helps to develop our students confidence and skills beyond the classroom setting.That extra-curricular provision is a key focus for the school.Lessons finish at .pm, earlier in the day than most other schools, but that affords pupils plenty of time to take on other pursuits.The school offers a huge number of activities, ranging from the expected - rugby, football, hockey, theatre and orchestra - to the esoteric, like German Film Club or Cipher Club.School trips in recent years have taken students to such exotic destinations as Costa Rica, Iceland, Borneo, Morocco, Spain, Germany, France, and Italy, allowing students to soak in culture both at home and abroad.Clearly, a huge pupil base allows for a huge number of options.The schoolrsquos ability to bring such a population to the table, and keep them focussed, has produced excellent results.In the last fty years alone, it has produced Olympians, rugby internationals, Members of Parliament and television presenters.It has ties to Nasa, and men who walked on the moon have visited the school for talks.Its most curious claim to fame comes in the form of a mascot painted on a wall.Emma Davies, a former pupil of the school, had a design chosen as the official Welsh Wenlock ndash the Olympic mascot for the London  games.But Stanwell flourishes academically, as well.In its  GCSE results,  per cent of Stanwell pupils achieved at least their expected grades, compared to  per cent of the rest of Wales. The same story went for maths, with  per cent again hitting their expected target or better, against  per cent of Wales.       ,params: .pushAt A level,  per cent of all grades were A* or A, with  per cent of the year group achieving A* to C overall.A level results put Stanwell students amongst the top performers in Wales, with many iniduals securing exceptional grades.  of themachieved the equivalent of three A grades or better.Three of its pupils went to Oxford University last year, while another earned a place at Cambridge University.Mr Brown said: ldquoWe place a large emphasis on listening to our learners and and our pupils make a dference as leaders in the school, whether itrsquos through well established groups such as our school council, eco-committee or charity committee, or in aspects of teaching and learning where we have subject prefects and learner voice groups.ldquoThey help us evaluate our work as a school and plan for the future.ldquoWhat always comes through is how proud they are of their school.Rightly so. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log        ,params: .push-- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

The renaming of our on-air studio to ldquoThe John Wilce Studio was a popular choice to recognise his outstanding dedication.ldquoJune  wouldrsquove been Johnrsquos th birthday, so this we felt really was a fitting tribute and a lovely memorial to all those who knew him, as a constant reminder of his contribution to Radio Glamorgan.Mr Wilce regularly presented on Sunday evenings, often dedicating features to listeners.

He has also cast doubt on the future of the proposed Dinas Powys bypass, and say he believes the Barry Incinerator will be required to draw up an environmental impact assessment ndash which campaigners have been calling for.Cllr Moore and the councilrsquos new deputy leader Lis Burnett gained control of the authority in May.Their priorities include balancing the councilrsquos budget and preserving vital services for the most vulnerable in the face of a need to make pound million of savings over the next two years, as well as regeneration and building more homes, and improving school buildings.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWersquore going to be open and transparent and be prepared to work with people. If there are issues we will try to work through those issues.ldquoSometimes we will have to make decisions that not everyone is going to be happy with.ldquoWe have to be honest with people. We have to say these are the facts and whether we like it or not we will have to do some things dferently or not at all.Cllr Burnett added. ldquoBut we have to be honest about the levels of pressure on local government.ldquoOur priority has to be services to the most vulnerable.The Labour-led coalition includes members of the former Conservative cabinet, which quit the party when former leader John Thomas was deposed as leader of the Vale Tories. The coalition also includes Llantwit First Independents.This is where the new leadership stands on the key issues facing the Vale:Parking chargesCllr Moore said new parking charges proposed by the previous administration, which included town centre car parks, coastal resorts and country parks, will be reviewed.He said new parking charges are likely in the Vale, but they will be ldquorealistic.Cllr Moore said: ldquoWe have to be sensible. Some of the things put forward previously were off the wall, they went too far.ldquoIt will be a full revamp of everything. Whatever we do wersquore not going to fleece the residents of the Vale.ldquoWe may have to make some changes. It does cost money to provide car parking. There are things we will have to start charging for. It will be realistic and fair for everybody.School improvementsThe new cabinet says delivering on major new school buildings is a priority for the new administration.Developments in the pipeline include new builds forPencoedtre and Whitmore High Schools, and expansion and refurbishment of Ysgol Gymraeg Bro MorgannwgAgeing schools in the Vale are set to get a pound. million cash boost for repairs.Llancarfan Primary SchoolLlancarfan Primary School was set to be lsquoclosedrsquoand moved to a new pound million facility in Rhoose.The previous cabinet had approved the plans despite protests from parents and campaigners.Cllr Moore said Llancarfan School move was ldquopremature - but did not commit to scrapping the plan entirely.ldquoIf itrsquos justiable itrsquos justiable, he said. ldquoIf itrsquos not, we will look at alternatives.ldquoItrsquos not an easy decision to take.

It shouldnrsquot be there.ldquoBut now it is there it has to operate within legal parameters.ldquoIf it does, therersquos nothing anyone can do about it.The council refused the original planning permission for the facility, but a planning inspector allowed it in  following an appeal. article_url   content_id   site_id  _rpzlatijbsrjaehzoqlqce url  \"survey.g.doubleclick.net survey site\"+site_id+\"url\"+article_url+\"cid\"+content_id+\"random\"+.getTime+try  __Show catch console.log -- s.eventsevents.linkTrackVarseVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eVar,eventss.linkTrackEventsevents.tl\"commentSorry, an error occurred.Sign in or register leave a comment or rate a comment -- []sw.documents.asynctruestext javascripts.src+static++.plista async++.jsg  --Most readCommented\"Loading...Read more Get involved with the news in your communitySend your stories and photos now--       ByThis website and associated newspapers adhere to the Independent Press Standards Organisations Editors Code of Practice.

It is surely shocking that that should be necessary, however.Where I might wish to deviate from the teachersrsquo critique is a reference to school unorms being worn out of school hours, perhaps at weekends or during school holidays.So what There were no unorms at my primary school, in Penarth, but at my secondaryschool, in Cardf, there were. Some of us would wear our school unorms out of school hours, and did not at all see this as a badge of poverty. But the problem of lack of food, where it is identied, is a serious one.As an undergraduate in the s, most of us wore blazers, badges, ties and college scarves, and they would often be worn outside teaching hours, unlike our academic gowns, worn for lectures, especially in the low faculty .Michael, OrsquoNeillRailway TerracePenarthSociety in rude healthAn article in a recent edition of the Penarth Timessomehow managed to give a completely  impression that the Penarth Civic Society was in dficulties and was lsquofighting to preserve its existencersquo.In fact, the reverse is true.The society is going from strength to strength and the request by our committee member, Anne Evans, for people with secretarial and or legal skills to join us is to support the expanding range of activities the society is engaged in.We always welcome applications from new members, whether to assist with the work of the committee or to just support the work we do and enjoy the other benefits of membership.But the society is not, as the article suggested, fighting to avoid an early demise and we remain in the best of health.Chris WyattHonorary TreasurerPenarth Civic SocietyHeroes of the skyPeople have heard of Barnes WallisAnd Guy Gibson, who traversed the streets of Penarth,But this poem is a tribute to Gordon YeoWho grew up in old Barry town.He flew with the famous Dambusters,Shot down when only twenty,Such a tragedy that he was killedWith so many of his dreams unfulfilledIn Lancasters they must have felt like gods,Mortal gods with flimsy flesh.Three dams were attacked with bouncing ballsAnd the Moehne and Eder were breached,Water gushing into the valley belowBut claiming civilians and forced labourers tooFor war is brutal causing fear and pain,Eight bombers never came home again.I picture empty seats the next dayAnd surviving airmen eating breakfastWith sad thoughts about fallen comrades.There is a portrait of the Welsh Dambuster,I canrsquot imagine the terror he feltAs deadly flak raced towards his planeSo herersquos to you, hero of the sky,A man of courage, far too young to die.Guy FletcherDan-y-GraigPantmawrCardfCuts to youth servicesJust when you thought that the Vale Council couldnrsquot sink any further they just keep on surprising us.The Vale Council are now looking to cut Vale Youth Services by more than half, this includes cutting front line staff from  to a massive nine,and also cutting council funded staff from  to  for the ages  to .This could also affect youth clubs and holiday schemes. Unison has hit out at this as a wrong headed decision.How on earth can just nine staff carry on giving a service to these young people, some of whom are special needs.What I find quite astonishing is the comments from Cllr Bob Penrose who states that the plans would enhance support for young people,and it will provide a sustainable service in the future.All this to save a miserly pound,. It has to be said that this Vale council havenrsquot got one clue what theyrsquore doing.Cllr Penrose should resign now, the way this has been handled is a shocking example of incompetence.One other point, these councillors should now look at themselves. The time has come now for you councillors to trim the cloth, and reduce your numbers by at least half.I despair for the people of the Valethis Tory administration runs for the full term.The politicians of this country from Westminster right down to the Vale are elected to serve and protect the people not the other way around.DJ RadfordBarryEvolution explainedTHE letter of Dr John F Harveydiscusses what he calls the lsquomyth of the theory of evolutionrsquo. I read his previous letterand managed to ignore its nonsense, this letter is so full of  premise I cannot do this again.The paragraph covering DNA is so wrong in so many respects, so blatantly  that it is dficult in a short letter to properly cover the writerrsquos non-scientic interpretation of just what DNA is all about.His two statements, lsquoit is genetically impossible for one kind to change ndash even over billions of years ndash into a completely dferent kind of creaturersquo, and the next paragraph telling us that the lsquoself-editingrsquo mechanism of DNA does lsquonot allow new information to be added that could supposedly, facilitate some kind of ldquoevolutionary process ndash even by genetic mutationrsquo is so far from the true science of DNA that I must conclude that the doctorate held by John Harvey cannot be medical ndash or indeed any of those in the fields of lsquonaturalrsquo science.His further sneer on the lsquomusings of the amateur naturalist Charles Darwin, in the  book, On the Origin of Speciesrsquo, is again meant to mislead any reader.In the world of creationists one of the most abused words in the English language is lsquotheoryrsquo.The word lsquotheoryrsquo, in the context of science, does not imply uncertainty.Itrsquos dictionary meaning used in science is, ldquoa coherent group of general propositions used as principles of explanation for a class of phenomena.In the case of the theory of evolution, the following are some of the phenomena involved.All are facts: Le appeared on earth more than two billion years ago Le forms have changed and ersied over lersquos history Species are related via common descent from one or a few common ancestors Natural selection is a signicant factor affecting how species change. Many other facts are explained by the theory of evolution as well.The theory of evolution has proved itself in practice. Besides the theory, there is the fact of evolution, the observation that le has changed greatly over time. The fact of evolution was recognized even before Darwinrsquos theory. The theory of evolution explains the fact.Even the theory of gravity still receives serious challenges. Yet the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is still a fact. Creationism is neither theory nor fact it is, at best, only an opinion, a belief. Since it explains nothing, it is useless.Harveyrsquos totally untrue depiction of what Darwin stated about fossils in his book is typical of this type of creationist argument, Darwin did not lsquoadmitrsquo that his theory depended on future fossil discoveries, he discussed the possibility of future findings answering the many questions then remaining.Summarising someonersquos work, rather than quoting it, shows whether you understand it. Many creationists are limited to quoting because they have no idea what the author really means.In fact, most creationists probably repeat quotes without even having read the original authorrsquos work.

The young kits born in the school enclosures will then be released by NIEA into specially selected sites across Northern Ireland to bolster existing colonies.At the allotmentThe passion of Mr Coleman has inspired the children to such an extent that they have received letters of support and enthusiasm from Sir David Attenborough.The allotments, half of which are for the pupils to grow produce, are also rented by members of the community at a small surcharge and with the proviso that they come and help clean up around the school.Video: Timeline and CCTV of suspected IRA unit on way to attempt to

Renewed weakness was evident within services, retail and construction. All three of these sectors signalled a signicant decline in activity in April.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/mannnn.jpg","title":"manufacturing is ni bucking the global slowdown","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Global manufacturing and industry stalwarts such as Germany are feeling the slowdown. So, why are Northern Ireland’s makers and engineers bucking the trend  John Mulgrew takes a look at our top performers and what may be skewing the figures If there’s been an industry yet to be tainted by the ill-effects of the run-up to Brexit that I, or other journalists haven’t written about, I’d be very surprised.The latest economic metrics and predictors have been tarred by the three years of uncertainty and political instability. But, according to the latest purchasing managers’ indexfrom Ulster Bank, manufacturing here has seen an uplt – unlike the other sectors.Globally, however, the growth of the manufacturing sector has slowed closer to stagnation, sitting at . in Januaryaccording to the JP Morgan Global Manufacturing PMI.“At the moment, exports are falling in German manufacturing,” Richard Ramsey, Ulster Bank chief economist said. “Northern Ireland and the UK compare favourably to the German powerhouse, and countries such as France and Italy.”He says that nine out of the  nations which are recorded by PMIs show manufacturing is falling.For Northern Ireland and the UK as a whole, Brexit-related stock-piling is certainly a factor. Let’s say you’re a cross-border business and you could be burdened by World Trade Organizationtarfs on your exports to the Republic in the event of a hard exit. What do you do  You produce more, and warehouse in your export market.Graeme MacLaughlin, relationship director, Barclays in Northern Ireland, said the “underlying state of health of UK manufacturing continues to be obscured by stockpiling, albeit down from the last survey’s record high, as Brexit uncertainty still thwarts investment intentions”.Ulster Business has revealed in this magazine that one major manufacturer, which has its base here, had stockpiled more than £m in food stock for its market in the Republic amid border concerns – and is now left with huge levels of product in a warehouse, with the exit from the EU now not likely until Halloween.“Continuing increases in inventories of both inputs and finished goods have exacerbated the slowdown in growth of new orders and given the loss of momentum in exporting activity, with growing signs that overseas markets are looking to alternative suppliers, the sector needs some degree of clarity on the future relationship with the EU sooner rather than later,” Graeme MacLaughlin said.Looking at what organic factors and positive stories which are fuelling the increase in manufacturing, Richard Ramsey says the success stories and expansion of firms such as CDE Global and Terex could be among those contributing.“They seem to be in expansion mode. But they are firms which are more exposed to the US, which is growing strongly. I would imagine those focused on eurozone are maybe experiencing that fall in demand.”Stephen Kelly, chief executive of Manufacturing NI, told Ulster Business that “in the past year, our firms have been busy”.“The economic conditions have been right. A purple patch indeed. Admittedly Brexit stockpiling has driven demand for many and as that begins to wash through the system in the coming monthsand with slowing of international and domestic demand, then now is the time to ensure we have the right conditions to ensure that this success is sustained.“By value, our engineering sector remains our most important. The extraordinary growth of the export focused sector in Mid Ulster, South Derry and West Tyrone contributes huge levels or employment and wages but as labour and skills have become more dficult to secure, firms have begun to spread out. CDE’s investment in Monkstown and Terex’s announcement for the North West demonstrate their commitment to creating more jobs here instead of overseas.“There has been much speculation about the demise of our manufacturing over recent years but the sector continues to confound its detractors. Employment levels, despite high profile closures, are back to  levels with exports at record levels and orders at home remaining strong. Our sector is larger and more important than manufacturing in the rest of the UK. Through direct and supported jobs, one in four local families rely on a manufacturing wage with our rural economy and community depending on manufacturers to bring both wealth and work.“Our award-winning food firms feed families at home and abroad with a greater number securing supply contracts with the UKs and Ireland’s largest buyers. Indeed news that Dale Farm had secured a supply contract with Greggs is further evidence that there is more growth possible for this critical sub-sector of manufacturing.“Often overlooked is our strength in building products. From Specialist Joinery and Carella fitting out the best of corporate offices to Smyth Steel and Macrete making the bulk of the new Tottenham Hotspur stadium, regarded as the best in Europe, in factories here before shipping on barges to London.“We’re also leading the move in construction from site build to factory built homes, schools, hospitals and offices at the McAvoy Group and Fasthouse. We have even seen a beautul table made by Terry Design from Portadown in  Downing Street.“Whether it is a critical spring on the Mars rover, or a defibrillator in the Oval office or indeed the fact that one in  people on the planet this year benefiting from a Randox test, products made in Northern Ireland are making a dference and making a huge economic contribution.“It is therefore critical that we cherish and celebrate our great firms who are making great products with great people in every postcode area. We must create the conditions that allow them to be free to make a success of their business and their community.As for the current and future “disruptor”, Richard Ramsey says while Brexit is the largest, the impact of Trump on the global economy, could have an impact on business here. “The thing is, it’s to what extentthere is when there is a trade war. Trump is increasing tarfs on China, then he focuses on the EU – how does the EU retaliate ”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"},{"url":"http://www.ulsterbusiness.com/thumbnail/510/var/files/August-news/kpm_1.jpg","title":"ni bosses searching new markets to boost exports","story":"Posted on Tuesday June  by John Mulgrew Around % of Northern Ireland bosses are exploring emerging markets in order grow their exports, according to the latest survey from KPMG.

John Hansen, partner in charge of KPMG Northern Ireland, said: “Successful CEOs know they need their companies to be as innovative as possible and it’s clear that the right environment is being created in Northern Ireland to do just that. “Our leaders aren’t afraid to give their teams the scope to try new ideas which may have a risk of failure and that opens up a world of potential.

Ulster Business speaks to director Clare Kelly about a burgeoning firm which is leading the way in more than just business, but connectivity, co-working and wellness for its members Eighteen years ago and in its early stages of infancy, Glandore began its le in one building at Fitzwilliam Square in Dublin – capable of hosting just  members.Fast forward to the present day and it’s an all-island business with an -strong workforce across nine locations in Belfast, Dublin and Cork – playing host to as many as , people. And it’s very much a family-owned and run business, led by founder Michael Kelly with daughters Clare, Fiona and Rebecca each as directors within the company.Glandore’s high-end flexible working spaces have been up-and-running in Belfast for  years – with capacity for  members across its two locations here. However, the family’s connection to the city dates back to , when Michael first bought - Arthur Street, now Arthur Place.It’s been at the forefront of attracting some of the leading international foreign direct investmentto Belfast, working closely alongside Invest NI to bring in cyber-security and technology firms from the US and beyond – first setting up here in . Glandore offers its members a wide iety of flexible office space, co-working and hot-desking – designed so companies can grow organically. But it’s also focused on bringing its members together, connecting indigenous and international firms, while also considering wellness in the workplace, and improving its green credentials. Clare Kelly is a director of the family business – a qualied occupational therapist and Trinity College graduate, who joined Glandore in .She’s now tasked with focusing on the key marketing and business development elements of the burgeoning company – attracting and retaining members, and ensuring there remains a strong pipeline of clients.“We offer our members a erse range of services,” Clare tells Ulster Business. That includes short-term hot-desking for small businesses with just a handful of employees, to providing flexible high-end office space for companies with dozens, or hundreds of workers.”And while the flexibility allows firms to scale from small numbers to a larger workforce – taking short-term space for as little as just three months – Clare says many of the companies stay for several years, orto Glandore further down the line in their own business journey.“We also host a range of events, and can bring everyone together through the network of our members. That has allowed us to cater from very early start-ups, right through to the largest multi-national company, or scaling FDI business,” Clare says.“The dference with Glandore is the flexibility. A company may wish to bring in one or two people, and then concentrate on recruitment – but they can then scale with their growth, from say  to  people. “That flexibility and scale is key. In terms of Glandore, we are offering high quality space, but also offering a range of business services to our members.”Across its two Belfast city centre flexible workspace buildings, Glandore’s expanding network means it can now host around  members – with locations at Arthur House and the nearby Arthur Place.It has six locations in Dublin, including the Silicon Docks and Central Business District, and has boasted a long list of foreign direct investment firms, including Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox and Smartbox, and has also opened its newest office space building in Cork city.Glandore has forged strong relationships with Invest NI – helping provide high-end working environments for rapidly expanding FDI businesses – along with Belfast City Council, the Belfast Chamber and Northern Ireland Chamber of Commerce and Industry.Some of its high profile international current, or former members, include cyber-security experts Rapid , digital marketing firm Bazaarvoice and global payments giant Cayan – a company which has now expanded into its Belfast headquarters at City Quays.The quality and bespoke nature of the offices are part of what helps Glandore stand out from the crowd. Clare says firms are able to specy exactly what they want, with a top-end design and fit-out team on hand to develop a specic working environment for each business.“When Glandore was set up by Michael in , he always focused on a high quality working environment,” Clare says. “We take premium office space in premium locations, and there is no expense spared in fit-out.“We provide a bespoke set up – whether they need a co-working space or a virtual office, for example. We can tailor that for each business. It’s not a cookie-cutter approach.”And while she says design and the aesthetics are important, behind the decor is the IT and security infrastructure to ensure that guests have the very best available to them.“We have always invested heavily in our network, and have our own on-site IT. We have an IT director, manager and team – so there is support even before day one. All of these things are important to firms of all sizes.”For Glandore, it’s not simply about putting guests on seats – there’s much more to the offering. “We have such a erse mixture of companies in the network and community, and we are able to mix the indigenous firms with the international companies, and actively, facilitate connections between our members.”That includes an alumni programme, which sees members past and present ing to celebrate their successful partnerships.“We bring back customers from the last  years, and representatives from Invest NI and Belfast City Council. It’s about making the connections between the current scaling members and those which have come before,” Clare says.“That support is invaluable. It can be very isolating in the those days when you are setting up, so it’s great to have someone you can bounce ideas off.”Glandore goes further still, with the introduction of both the Glandore Wellness Programme and Glandore Green Initiative – the latter focused on creating a greener and more sustainable office space.“We have been working with these companies for several years, and we get a bird’s-eye view,” Clare says. “One thing we have been very mindful of is the need for us to support from a wellness perspective.“We offer a complimentary wellness programme, which started in , long before it became a buzzword. It offers a way for our members to connect with each other, and help in retaining talent.”And while almost every business has experienced some Brexit-related impact, Clare says Glandore has reached its highest occupancy rate in its history – rising to % in Belfast.“It has been a very uncertain time and that has impacted businesses across Northern Ireland. There have been some delays in regards to FDI, but our hats go off to Invest NI which still attracting businesses into Northern Ireland.”And while there’s also scope for further growth in Belfast, there’s potential for that demand to move outside Belfast, with a potential to grow into the North West.“The hope is to continue our expansion as an all-island business, having operated on both sides of the border for  years, with capacity to grow the businesses in Belfast.“With the likes of Derry, that would be something on the agenda for Invest NI as part of its remit to win investment for outside Belfast. We will take the lead from the councils and from Invest NI, and we will look to see where we can add. If there isn’t space for a business to land, people will go where.”View all articlesSearch ulsterbusiness -- --SearchSearch -- --Follow us -- -- copy  Ulster Business Designed  Built by Laposa, Powered by Onxshop"}]
