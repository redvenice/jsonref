We step inside the yurt-inspired hub that’s fixing their culture shockVisit Ulaanbaatar on Google Earth – the only way most of us are likely to get there for some time – and you will find that the Mongolian capital looks like no other city. Scattered around the Soviet-era urban centre are hundreds of thousands of tiny white dots. It is as if someone has emptied an enormous bag of confetti across the landscape, the white specks clustering in the folds of the valleys, extending outwards for miles in long, snaking tendrils.These dots – separated in their own plot and sometimes accompanied by the orange rectangle of a tin-roofed shack, visible when you zoom in close – are yurts (or gers in Mongolian). For thousands of years, these transportable tents, made of wooden latticework wrapped with insulating felt and canvas, have been the house type of choice for the Mongolian herders on the plains. But the nomadic tent-based mindset is not something easily given up when herders move to the city – with problematic results.“Mongolia is the least densely populated country in the world,” says Badruun Gardi, who grew up in Ulaanbaatar and in 2016 founded GerHub, a nonprofit social enterprise that helps people adjust to the challenges of urban life. “When you’re a herder, you can go for miles and miles without reaching another family. You don’t have to think about what living in a confined space with hundreds or thousands of people means. It’s the biggest challenge we face as a country.”The idea of a fixed capital has always been a strange concept for this nation of nomadic herders. The 13th-century conqueror Genghis Khan ruled his vast empire from a nine-metre-wide yurt, while Ulaanbaatar itself used to be a nomadic settlement, formed by thousands of tents gathering around a movable monastery, following wherever the herds of livestock decided to travel. The Soviets attempted to formalise the capital in the 1920s, changing its name from Urga (Ulaanbaatar means “Red Hero”), building concrete blocks of flats and setting out an urban grid, which was consolidated in the postwar era. But, as thousands have flocked to the city in recent years, driven by the loss of livestock and promises of better education, healthcare and job prospects, the capital has expanded outwards in all directions as a sprawling ger-opolis. The adjustment from life on the open steppe to the hustle of the big city clearly takes some getting used to.For starters, the world outside the ger is no longer rolling grassland, but a small private plot, encircled by a two-metre-high fence. City residents must pay for water and fuel, rely on transportation and manage their waste. Their inidual actions have an impact on others, sometimes for the first time in their lives they encounter common problems that become the responsibility of a collective body of people. These social challenges are exacerbated by a host of practical issues: there is no running water in the ger districts, nor is there mains electricity, sewerage or central heating. In winter, when temperatures can plummet to -40C, each household burns around three to five tonnes of coal, making Ulaanbaatar one of the most polluted cities in the world. And the scale of the challenge is only increasing.Gardi founded GerHub to help bring a sense of pride back to the ger districts. After a few years of working in whatever spaces it could find, the organisation’s educational and social outreach programme has a new home, in the form of a contemporary take on the traditional ger, designed by the Hong Kong architecture studio Rural Urban Framework (RUF).Standing as a faceted polycarbonate pavilion in the midst of a muddled ger neighbourhood in the Songino Khairkhan district, the Ger Innovation Hub is a striking arrival. Its shimmering plastic walls envelop a slender wooden framework, which itself wraps around an inner space defined by mud-brick walls. In summer, the entire thing can open up, the wall panels lifting to let activities spill out into the surrounding landscape, while in the harsh winter, the layered structure creates a sheltered buffer.“We were inspired by the structure of the ger itself,” says Joshua Bolchover, cofounder of RUF, a research-led practice based in the University of Hong Kong, whose students helped to build the project. “We thought, what if we peel the layers of timber, insulation and waterproofing apart to create a room within a room, like a Russian doll?” The resulting structure (judging from the photographs) creates a loosely defined series of spaces that can be adapted to all kinds of activities, from preschool playtime to innovation workshops for teenagers, training sessions for local businesses and drop-in meet-ups for the elderly.The layered design means that, if it’s -40C outside, it would be about 0C (32F) in the buffer zone (“Fine for kids to run around with their coats on,” says Bolchover), thanks to solar gain trapped by the polycarbonate cladding, while the central space would only need to be heated to 15C, the warmth radiating from the thermal mass of the mud walls. A circular amphitheatre at the centre of the space has been sized so that a ger can be erected over it too, creating an even more insulated central core for more intimate gatherings.“We want it to be as lively a place as possible,” says Gardi. “In winter it can be particularly arduous being stuck indoors for months on end, so we hope this will be a place for social life to happen and new community ties to be formed.”Unfortunately, the building only had the chance to host an opening workshop before the coronavirus lockdown halted all activities in the city – Mongolia took particularly prudent early action, with few cases of Covid-19 and no deaths so far. Hopefully when the centre does reopen it will become a vital social hub to help this fledgling community form neighbourhood bonds and reap the benefits of their newly urban life."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/49ec8bcb46385bafd10008b8623b81b0c0804887/0_0_1654_2339/master/1654.jpg?width=700\u0026amp;quality=45\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;dpr=2\u0026amp;s=4f11ace32d29c3182f98dd949b51c1b4 1400w","title":"how england found itself at the foot of the covid 19 league table","story":"Excess deaths, the stats that really count, show that England is paying the price for poor governmentAs the data rolls in from the Covid-19 pandemic it is a bit like watching the football scores, but only for the teams at the wrong end of the table.The results for every country are poor: it’s simply that some appear to be doing worse than others. France saw bigger falls in output than Germany, Spain or Italy in the first three months of 2020: the US has seen the sharpest increase in unemployment.In truth, it is too early to make international comparisons. The UK took a smaller hit to activity than France in the first three months of the year but it went into lockdown later. There may be nothing more to it than that.Similarly, the jobless rate in the US is higher than in the UK for two reasons: the Americans get their unemployment figures out quicker and don’t have a furloughing scheme to soften the blow to the labour market.Making assumptions now about which country has fared least badly from the pandemic is no different from making rash predictions about which team will be relegated three games into the season. If the history of the last recession is any guide, the US will bounce back faster than the UK or the eurozone.Governments are sensitive to international economic comparisons, but they are even more prickly when it comes to mortality league tables. You don’t need to be a genius to understand why Boris Johnson has ceased to publish details of how well Britain is doing compared to the rest of the Europe. As Keir Starmer helpfully pointed out last week, you need to look no further than the fact that the UK has had more deaths than any other country.Ministers and health officials say that comparing the headline figures for deaths is misleading, and in one sense they are right. France has a lower death toll than Britain but that might be expected given that it has roughly the same number of people living in a country that is twice as big. Population density is clearly a factor when it comes to the spread of Covid-19.There is, though, a way to refine the data so that more meaningful international comparisons can be made. This is done by comparing a country’s excess deaths: the difference between the mortality rate this year with what happened in the past.This is what two Oxford University economists, Janine Aron and John Muellbauer, have done in a new paper. It shows England’s peak in excess deaths was not just higher than that in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland but the highest of 24 European countries.England also had the highest excess death rate for the over-65s and – perhaps even more worryingly – had far and away the worst record for excess deaths for those age between 15 and 64 as well. At its peak it was 2.8 times worse than the weekly peak in the next worst country, Spain, around four times worse than France and Belgium, and more than five times worse than in Italy.These are sobering findings, particularly in the light of England coming out of lockdown faster than Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.As Aron and Muellbauer note, there are plenty of reasons why England’s excess death rate is so high. The first is the role of London as a major global hub, with a high population density and a transport system that makes social distancing difficult. London had the highest number of cases of Covid-19 in the early stages of the pandemic and it is not hard to see why.A second factor is that it took time for the government to decide a lockdown was necessary. By that time, the virus had taken hold and was being transmitted in London. By the time it reached less densely populated parts of the UK the lockdown had been enforced.Thirdly, the UK was in no fit state to deal with the crisis. The paper notes: “Generally, there was a collective failure in preparedness across the public health system, especially for testing capability and adequate supplies and distribution logistics of personal protection equipment for health workers.”The findings for the 15-64 age group need to be looked at alongside the government’s own data, which shows much higher Covid-19 related death rates in areas of economic deprivation. Underlying health tends to be worse in the poorer parts of the country, and they contain more low-paid employees who work in face-to-face sectors: care workers, bus drivers, supermarket cashiers.The Office for National Statistics has helpfully broken down deaths for England and Wales from Covid-19 by occupational group. Among men, security guards and care workers fare worst. Among women care workers have around 2.4 times the death rates of the average for working age women, suggesting they have been particularly let down by a lack of protective gear and by the failure to test, trace and isolate. The comparative ratio for nurses is 1.3 times the average for working age women.Ministers don’t like to be reminded of it, but Germany has done far, far better than the UK, and England in particular. Its decentralised model for testing was streets ahead of Britain’s top-down centralised approach. It had more hospital beds, more intensive care units and more ventilators per head of population. It started testing more quickly, which facilitated effective tracing. Investment in PPE occurred earlier and Germany did better than other countries to keep the virus out of care homes.One of the favourite sayings of football managers is that the table never lies. This one doesn’t either. The government’s handling of Covid-19 has been poor from the start and it is about time it was held to account for it."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/43800817f91e69f62abb389cced090538617d402/0_87_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2ddbaa517ffe11186053c8ae2edb89bc","title":"why the uk fell behind european peers on emergency funding","story":"Teething problems and lack of experience held up state-backed business loan schemesAcross Europe, government-backed business loan schemes in Germany, France and Switzerland have been quicker to distribute emergency funding during the coronavirus outbreak than those in the UK, where teething problems put the British programme weeks behind mainland rivals.The UK’s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which was initially fraught with controversy over demands for personal guarantees, took a month to distribute 18,595 loans worth £3.1bn.But the pace of approvals jumped following the introduction of two additional programmes, including the bounce-back loan scheme that handed £2bn to 69,000 Britain’s smallest businesses within the first 24 hours of its launch on 4 May. Seven weeks in, the UK is finally catching up, having handed almost £15bn to more than 304,000 firmsBut why did the UK struggle to keep up with its European peers in the first place? Experts say the answer may be linked to borrowing trends, the nature of Britain’s financial system, and the UK’s relationship with government spending.The schemes at a glanceAfter a boom in UK bank takeovers in the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, regulators have tried to boost competition and even encouraged businesses to shift accounts to smaller lenders.Neil Shearing, chief economist at Capital Economics, says this fragmented system may be partly the reason for the UK scheme’s teething problems. For example, the UK’s CBILS programme was launched with 40 banks on board.“In countries where the system is quite concentrated – with one, two or three big banks – in a sense it’s easier to get these schemes off the ground. It just requires one Zoom call where you can thrash issues out and it makes the implementation phase much easier,” he said.He pointed to Switzerland where Credit Suisse has played a “huge role” in developing and implementing the scheme. “That’s not the case if a system is much more fragmented … there’s advantages in terms of competition but not when you need something done quickly.” While the new bounce-back scheme was put together with just seven British lenders to start, most are only offering loans to their own customers. That has raised fears that small businesses that have been encouraged to open accounts with challenger banks in recent years could end up being locked out of the scheme, or waiting weeks until their own lenders are accredited.The UK is more used to monetary than fiscal stimulusThe UK’s £330bn coronavirus business support programme is the largest in the country’s history, but European peers are far more experienced when it comes to distributing state-backed cash and may have been able to get money flowing much quicker as a result.Countries such as France and Germany “derive some benefit from experience”, said Florian Hense, an economist at Berenberg. “They have the facilities in place and businesses have the attitude and proclivity to ask the government, in times like these, for help.” The UK has instead relied heavily on monetary policy for economic stimulus, which tends to be faster and does not require tax hikes or an increase in government borrowing.The state-owned British Business Bank, meanwhile, is not used to managing programmes the size of CBILS and bounce-back loans. It has had to increase staffing and is still building new digital programmes to handle demand.Electronic filter maker in Durham, UKAnj Hampton, 45, is a director at Rasmi Electronics in Durham. The firm makes electronic filters that ensure radio frequencies from one machine do not disrupt another.She approached NatWest five weeks ago but was wrongly told that exporters were not eligible for CBILS. Anj said she put together evidence from the British Business Bank showing that she was still entitled to access the scheme but has not yet been granted a loan. The BBB’s website has since been changed to clarify that exporters do qualify, but she’s still waiting for funding.Property engineering firm in Paris, FranceEric Malenfer, 55 is the CEO of Gexpertise Conseil, which helps design, survey and model buildings in both France and Tunisia.He had to cut his 220 staff down to part-time work after France went into lockdown last month and was looking for €2.5m in emergency loans to stay afloat.He approached both Credit du Nord and HSBC in France for a total of €2.5m. The application process took about two weeks, which he said was “particularly short”, and he received the cash a week later.“The state reacted very quickly and the banking arrangements were implemented within deadlines that we did not imagine possible,” Malenfer said.Cinema and events space in Frankfurt, GermanyAndreas Lucas, 56, is the managing partner of Orfeo’s Erben, a restaurant, bar, cinema and events space in Frankfurt, Germany.The site had to close on 18 March as the pandemic started to spread, and he had to put his staff on part-time furlough.He secured a €30,000 grant and a separate €35,000 micro-loan through the Wirtschaftsbank Hessen state development bank to help cover rent, staff benefits, and maintenance during the outbreak. He said it took less than 10 days between starting the application and receiving the cash.Lucas said it was “one of the least bureaucratic” experiences he has had in the past 30 years.

In France, it was decided to curtail championships and award trophies on the basis of matches already played. In the Netherlands, the season was simply voided. The unfortunate players and supporters of SC Cambuur, who were 11 points clear at the top of the second ision, are understandably miffed.The English Premier League is fretfully keeping its fingers crossed, hoping that Germany’s experiment in “bio-secure” football works. The richest football league in the world hopes to relaunch its own competition sometime in June. Whether that is desirable or feasible has been the subject of fierce debate. If Project Restart is given the go-ahead this week, players are expected to begin non-contact training together, but the planning process has been fraught with difficulty. Some players have voiced deep reservations over safety. Protocols have yet to be finalised for a second phase, when full training will recommence. There is also concern that, after a long and unusual layoff, players have no hope of reaching proper match fitness before June. A glut of summer injuries might therefore accompany the 92 fixtures scheduled for empty stadiums, during a hectic seven-week period.The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, has suggested that the completion of the Premier League season would “lift the spirits of the nation”. It is true that the mass exposure of the national game in pubs and on TV has woven it into the fabric of many lives. But this rush back to the pitch is being dictated by financial imperatives rather than a desire to boost collective morale. Clubs stand to lose at least £300m in broadcast money from around the world, if they fail to complete the season. Many rely on these contracts to pay huge wages that have grown exponentially since the Premier League launched in 1992. Multimillion-pound sponsors will also demand rebates if they feel they have been short-changed.Money talks, but it should not be allowed to bully. If players are to return so soon to a sport in which unpredictable physical contact is an obligation, there must be maximum confidence in testing procedures and in the efficacy of the “protective bubble” around pitch and stadium. And teams should be match-ready. Should Project Restart prove unworkable in the short summer timeframe, so be it.If the league does resume, the matches are likely to be eerie, stilted affairs. Football without fans is not so much a new normal as a different event altogether. Liverpool would at least get the chance to deservedly win the Premier League in the traditional fashion. But safety, not the prospect of glory or the need to sustain turnover, must call the shots in the weeks to come."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/67dc7b7edb8270f1ab2709c9a2bb6220ffdcd3c9/0_60_3265_1959/master/3265.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=bfbb54581f147c27e24c115709480d46","title":"the guardian view on uk covid 19 coordination work together save lives","story":"The four-nations approach works better than countries taking different paths. It is time to rebuild a collective approach to fighting the virusA week ago, 27 million viewers watched as Boris Johnson signalled the first steps out of the Covid-19 lockdown. The aim of providing a route out of lockdown was a reasonable one. But the strategy and execution were badly mishandled and confused. The botched broadcast fractured a valuable existing consensus. At a stroke, a unified UK-wide approach was cast aside. A week ago, Mr Johnson became in effect the leader not of the United Kingdom but of England alone.Mr Johnson’s announcements were not followed by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish administrations. Instead they chose to stick to the lockdown. This ision among the partner nations was avoidable. It is also unhelpful to their citizens as a whole. The error was Mr Johnson’s. He needs to focus urgently on restoring a common approach across the four nations that avoids what the Greater Manchester mayor, Andy Burnham, has called a London-centric approach. There are, of course, underlying political tensions in the four-nation relationship, and within each nation too, but they had not disrupted the fight against the virus until last week.The Welsh government’s handling points to a better way forward. On Friday, the first minister, Mark Drakeford, did what Mr Johnson should have done. He made his own statement at the same time as launching a detailed and realistic document on unlocking, with an easily understood “traffic light” approach to eventual easing in different contexts. Where Mr Johnson was bullish, blustering and baffling, Mr Drakeford was careful, calibrated and clear. Unlike Mr Johnson, with his anachronistic idea of gung-ho leadership, Mr Drakeford made clear that he is trying to lead a continuing and reasoned conversation. This is a much more modern and devolution-aware approach, which Keir Starmer correctly underscored at the weekend, as well as far better suited to the complexities and risks of the pandemic. Similar approaches have been taken in Scotland and Northern Ireland.The four-nations approach to the emergency is a valuable asset for the UK. It has the virtues of clarity and coordination. Above all, it was and is the right public health approach. Health policy has long been a devolved responsibility in the UK. It was devolved even before political devolution in the late 1990s. But the virus – like science – knows no borders, either of nations or of what used to be called health authorities. Faced with an enemy like Covid-19, it is irresponsible, as well as dangerously ineffective, for different parts of a nation state like Britain to adopt sweepingly different approaches. For that reason alone, joint decision-making remains essential.There will be an increasing case, when the pandemic fades, for different approaches in different communities on a local level. There are signs of that already. But the key point is that these differences should be determined by science and by local public health needs, not by the UK’s internal borders. Despite last week’s unilateral English lurch by Mr Johnson, many of the differences of approach remain reconcilable. It is therefore time to compromise for the common good. Last week, Mr Johnson’s previously enviable ratings slumped. He doesn’t do contrition, but the more sensitive tone he adopted in a weekend press article shows that he knows there is a problem.There are many reasons why a collective approach should be re-established for the remainder of the pandemic. The protection of public health is overwhelmingly the main one. But politics is important too. Each part of the UK is governed by a different party. Partisan issues will never be entirely separable from a shared process of this kind. But they must not dominate it. If you need a warning about what the partisan politicisation of Covid-19 can do, look no further than the unfolding catastrophe in the United States and to what Barack Obama said at the weekend. The life and death issues involved in the fight against the pandemic are much too important for the UK to go down that disastrous road."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/00025c4e0b7925b363bedf3a49c0531928b6a44a/0_0_2529_1516/master/2529.jpg?width=940\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=24dfea466eb0a9744baf7f3dac7569c7 940w","title":"your pictures share your photos on the theme of treasure","story":"Wherever you are in the world, this week we’d like to see your pictures on the theme ‘treasure’The next theme for our weekly photography assignment, published in print in the Observer New Review is ‘treasure’.Share your photos of what treasure means to you – and tell us about your image in the description box.The closing date is Wednesday 20 May at 10am.

Robert Lewandowski collected his customary goal with a penalty and the defender Benjamin Pavard later headed home a Joshua Kimmich corner for the second.Bayern will need to find extra gears against Dortmund, highly impressive in beating Schalke 4-0 on Saturday. Win that and an eighth successive title will be within reach. “We didn’t show our best side in terms of play,” admitted the goalkeeper Manuel Neuer afterwards. “But we dominated the game and deservedly take the three points home with us.”Union, safely in mid-table, have performed creditably since last season’s promotion but were facing the Bundesliga’s ultimate test, and doing so without home fans among the most fervent in Germany. Berlin police had warned supporters to stay away but later reported that a few dozen had gathered outside the stadium.Also absent was the Union coach, Urs Fischer, after he broke quarantine to return home to Switzerland following a family bereavement. The plan he had passed on to his players was clear, though: sit back, soak up pressure and see what else might arise.Anthony Ujah, their Nigeria forward, fired wide in the early stages but Bayern soon settled into dominance of the limited opposition. They had the ball in the net in the 18th minute, only for Thomas Müller to be ruled offside after he took a final – and unnecessary – touch of a goalbound header from Serge Gnabry. The VAR decision was greeted by a throaty roar from the small home contingent permitted to be inside the tight stadium set in a forest on the fringes of Germany’s capital.The first half-hour saw Union offer stiff resistance, reducing Lewandowski to penalty-area scraps amid some frustration for Bayern. Alphonso Davies’s high tackle on Grischa Prömel brought the Canada full-back a yellow card. Then came Neven Subotic’s flailing foul on Leon Goretzka, who had blindsided the Serb, and a chance from the spot that Lewandowski was never going to pass up.The Polish striker scored his 40th of the season, making it the fifth season in succession he has reached that tally, with a feint, a jump and a firm shot beyond his compatriot Rafa Gikiewicz.Bayern’s attempts on goal piled up but they struggled to reproduce the slick football and threat they had exerted in pre-lockdown performances such as their late-February 3-0 Champions League win at Chelsea.Kingsley Coman, on as a second-half substitute, howled in anguish when his driven cross failed to find any takers but Pavard’s neck muscles eventually made sure of the win 10 minutes from time.A controlled performance with few scares suffered made it 15 wins from Bayern’s past 16 matches. The Dortmund encounter will, though, be far more indicative of whether the Bundesliga title is likely to return to its perennial destination."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/500e9fb692b831bbb5f9de85e5655d3d0e8d6307/1490_956_5552_3331/master/5552.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2018b602b77c60c9237ef881438d4c","title":"beans three ways a trio of recipes for your store cupboard staple","story":"As a nation it’s safe to say we are baked bean lovers, and for years families have been passing on their unique bean recipes. Anna Masing serves up three fresh dinner ideas and gets the family stories behind the recipesYou can’t beat mopping up that delicious sauce with a piece of bread after a fry-up. But beans have moved on from the cooked breakfast. People proudly boast about their personalised recipes and each generation adds a new twist to a family favourite. Whether it’s breakfast, lunch or dinner, there’s always room for beans on our plate.With increasing health concerns about the reduction of sugar in our diet, Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz lets this comfort food become a convenient staple for health-conscious people. Here are three recipes built from love and tradition for you to try.Recipe developer and food editor Nadine Brown makes this dish for her family – her partner, her eight-year-old daughter and two-year-old niece: “It’s perfect for a hungry family with little patience,” she says.The dish is based on a recipe Brown developed a few years ago, but with tweaks made specifically for her family. Beans have always been a favourite in their house: “They taste great on their own or in a dish like this,” Brown explains. “The basil goes deliciously with the tomatoes and beans,” she says, talking about working with flavours, and adding more vegetables helps to get the kids their five a day. The no added sugar version is also something that Brown is pleased about: “It helps me keep an eye on the amount of sugar we consume in the house.”This dish is also about ease – it’s a “bung it all in one” dinner. Cooked in one dish, it can be simply brought to the table, and makes cleaning up a breeze. This is a dish that features on the weekends in Brown’s household, when they don’t have to think about work or school and can enjoy spending time together eating a meal in a relaxed way.Ingredients8 pork sausages4 garlic cloves, skin on, lightly bashed1 tbsp olive oil2 red onions, cut into wedges1 red pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks1 green pepper, seeds removed and cut into chunks2 x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz30g basil leaves, roughly torn300g cherry tomatoes on the vineFreshly cracked black pepperCrusty bread to serveMethodPreheat your oven to 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6.Add the sausages and garlic to a large, deep oven tray and drizzle with the oil.

Roz explains: “My mother made us minestrone regularly and this is an evolution of her recipe parmesan rind was suggested by an Italian friend. And baked beans was my addition.” For Zoe’s recipe, it has been about making tiny tweaks. “Mum has the recipe nailed so it’s hard to beat, but I add fried bacon, as the flavour melts into the whole dish, giving it a little extra depth and texture. Also, I add a pinch of smoked paprika to suit my Portuguese husband’s palate.”This dish is woven with personal memories. Roz tells how she grew up in the Middle East and had mainly American friends, so Heinz was a familiar brand and is reminiscent of that time. For Zoe, baked beans, and this recipe, are memories of childhood and comfort: “A rainy Sunday afternoon? Soup time. Off school sick? Definitely time to bring out the big guns of Mum’s minestrone. The smell of it cooking is beyond delicious, filling the house.“When discussing this recipe with Mum,” Zoe says, “she revealed its greatest quality – using what you have.” Utilising leftovers was a key part of the family home when growing up, and an ethos Zoe has continued. This recipe is easy to adapt and uses many basic store cupboard standards – especially the beans. And, after the extravagance of Christmas, this recipe offers a nourishing and healthier alternative thanks to the no added sugar beans.A store cupboard classic this is a British take on the famed Italian recipe. Without the optional bacon, it works as a main dish for vegetarians, and without the wine and chilli, it’s a great supper for kids.Preparation: 10 minutesCooking time: 20 minutesTotal time: 30 minutesServes: 4 as a light meal or 6 as a starterIngredients1 large red onion, chopped3 garlic cloves, crushed2 medium carrots, dicedHalf a red pepper, diced1 400g tin chopped tomatoes1 415g tin of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz1 handful of orzo or similar small pastaSaltfreshly ground pepperParmesan cheese (including rind)1 tsp Heinz tomato ketchup1 tbsp light olive oilA pinch of dried mixed herbs1 bay leaf1 small red chilli or a small pinch of chilli flakes (optional)125ml wine (red or white) or 2 dsp dry vermouth (optional)4 rashers of streaky bacon (optional)MethodSweat the onion, carrot and pepper gently in the oil for about 5 minutes.

This is a dish that has developed from family tradition and his rich cultural heritage. Rehncy speaks about how his love of cooking started young: “My parents are Indian but born in east Africa. Growing up in Tanzania I would spend time at my dad’s Indian restaurant with the chefs in the kitchen.”This has stood him in good stead – on a lads’ getaway he cooked this dish for 20 friends as the only one able to cook, he was responsible for making sure they were fed for the trip.Rehncy’s mother died when he was young and all hands were on deck in the house a memory he has is his father’s Saturday tradition of a fry-up, with baked beans being a staple. One Saturday his father added a twist – onions, spices and chillies – the beginnings of this recipe. Thadka loosely means to add spice. “When you create any Indian dish you need a base to start. Our base is the beans, and any spices added are the thadka,” says Rehncy. “I chose these spices because they’re simple, easy and most importantly, are in every Indian household – classics.”He says the masala beans go well with toast, eggs, or, as his wife loves them, straight out of the bowl!Rehncy adds that the no added sugar variant is great because most of the adults in his family are diabetic and this allows them to eat baked beans more often than not.Ingredients (per 2x 415g tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz)2 tbsp rapeseed oil1 white onion (finely diced)4 cloves garlic (finely chopped)4cm piece of ginger (grated or finely chopped)2 green chilli (finely chopped)1 tsp turmeric1 tsp cumin powder1 tsp mustard seeds1 tsp coriander powder1 tsp garam masala powderSmall bunch of fresh corianderMethodAdd the oil to a saucepan on a medium heat (enough for the tin of Heinz beans) with the oil and the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds begin to pop (you’ll hear little popping sounds), add the onion.Once the onion has started to soften, add in the ginger, garlic and chilli, cook down until the onion starts to brown slightly.Add in the cumin seeds and gently cook for another 2 minutes.Add the spices – turmeric, cumin powder, coriander powder and garam masala. Cook these down on a medium to low heat for a couple of minutes just to take the harshness out. Once you see the oil separating from the “masala mix” you can now add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz.Fold in the beans with the mixture until it is thoroughly mixed through and coated. Bring to a simmer, add a couple knobs of butter and mix well.Coarsely chop the coriander, move the Heinz beans to a bowl and garnish.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e06b51429a66ca514214df0e2f8504b7310635a/0_0_8525_5115/master/8525.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea6c1abce408cf069503c50ec1a7f413","title":"no posh bread no fancy cheese and certainly no mayo the seven unwritten rules of eating baked beans","story":"From that initial cold forkful to just the right amount of cheese, we’ve settled it – this is how you should be enjoying your beansForget whether the dress was blue or white, or if there was room for Jack on that floating debris – the most heated debates of our generation revolve around food. Does the jam or cream go on a scone first (and how do you pronounce scone)? Does pineapple belong on a pizza? And should your Heinz ketchup be kept in the fridge? (For the record: jam then cream rhyme it with “gone” certainly not and yes, definitely. Glad we cleared that up.)But few foods have triggered so many lengthy debates as the satisfyingly saucy baked bean. A British icon, the fierce loyalty these delicious legumes stir up is unparalleled. Which is the best bread to put them on? Is it OK to eat them cold? And should they really be touching other food on the plate? We’re here to solve these saucy conundrums once and for all. (Please note: the editor’s decision is final.)1 Beans should be enjoyed cold as wellWhile it’s traditional to heat up your Heinz Beanz, there are purists who swear by eating them cold, usually straight out of the tin. While we suspect their argument is partially based on sheer laziness, this is an easy one: either way of eating them is fine, but the best path to take is both. The true baked bean connoisseur snaffles a few tasty forkfuls after opening the tin, before heating the rest up.3 Acceptable toppingsThe beauty of baked beans is their versatility, which in turn can lead to tough decisions about which toppings, if any, are the best. We’ve heard cases for cooked chorizo, crispy bacon, hot sauce, chopped parsley, dried herbs and (of course) enough cheese to fell a horse. The short answer is that all these toppings, including none at all, are acceptable (except for non-cheddar cheeses, more of which later). Although, if you stir ketchup, brown sauce or, God forbid, mayonnaise into your beans, somebody needs to stage an intervention.4 The cheese rulesDespite their workmanlike appearance, cheesy beans are a thing of great beauty and delicate balance, and must be properly executed. The rules are as follows: cheddar is the only acceptable cheese. None of your gruyere or feta nonsense here, please. At a push, you might crumble in some Wensleydale, but cheddar offers the correct tanginess to offset the beans’ sweetness, and can be finely grated so the cheese drifts on to the beans like a soft, tasty blanket. Thickly grated cheddar is also delicious, but tends to stubbornly sit there, refusing to melt. Finally, while cheese stirred into beans is undoubtedly delicious, it’s simply not the correct way – the light dusting of cheese must melt into the beans on its own.5 No napkins, embrace the sauceDo you want to be that person with the napkin tucked under their chin in the work canteen? Do you? No, you do not. Beans, by their nature, love to throw themselves off your fork and bounce their saucy way down your clean shirt, like a stone skimmed by a champ. Wear your day-glo stains as a badge of honour. Your lunch was better than anyone else’s.6 Set the beans freeOf all the baked bean debates, the one about whether it’s OK for them to touch other foodstuffs in a full English breakfast is the most controversial. While there’s no question beans are an integral part of the meal, some people prefer theirs on the side, to avoid the sauce infiltrating any of the more absorbent items (eg bread, hash browns). Let’s be clear, though: serving your baked beans in a rubbish little ramekin is entirely unacceptable. If you really must separate them, the correct protocol is to create an edible holding pen fashioned out of sausages and bacon.7 The right type of breadThere are more ways to eat baked beans than there are beans in a tin (on average, 465 in total)! But although baked potatoes, crumpets, waffles or a bowl straight from the microwave are all acceptable vehicles for getting baked beans inside you, the classic accompaniment is toasted, buttered bread. When you pour your beans on to the toast, a corner must be left bean-free, to be saved for juice-mopping duties. And the correct bread choice is white or wholemeal and pre-sliced: no arguing. If you want to go really fancy, we’ll allow an uncut bloomer. But this isn’t the time for posh breads: none of your rye, pumpernickel or sourdough should be getting involved.

My mum used to bake bread. I can still remember waking up to the smell of her amazing little crusty rolls. We’d have them with crispy bacon, eggs and baked beans and that was just a little plate of joy to start the day. I can still taste it when I think about it.Mum’s from Antigua and beans are also a big part of Caribbean cooking. Rice and peas, which is really rice and beans, is one of my favourite things. It’s so comforting, it’s like the Caribbean version of mashed potatoes. Then you put curried goat or chicken or fried fish on it – or just more beans. If you’re tired or lonely, sad or happy – whatever it is – rice and peas will generally sort it out.These days I’ve become more aware of sugar in dishes. A honey glaze here, something else there and, before you know it, you’ve pushed the sugar levels way up. For me it’s all about balance now. And low-sugar products are great for that.You can also bring out sweetness using existing foods on your plate, for example when you’re cooking your onions or leeks, let them go for longer because they create their own sweetness as they caramelise. It takes a while to adjust to that different kind of sweetness but it really works. Or add some cumin and a little salt to carrots and roast them to enhance their sweetness.It’s no surprise to me that beans are such a mainstay of so many cultures. Brazil has feijoada – black beans and pork stew. Families come together and add farofa, a toasted cornmeal, to it. And think of pasta e fagioli in Italy. There’s a familiar heartiness that beans evoke for me and historically they’re a food that people without much money could afford.We see them as humble but forget how versatile they are. They’re a brilliant carrier of flavour and add real depth and ballast to a plate. They’re a kind of security food. When I became a mother, I’d send my kids to school on beans on toast because I knew it was going to last and fill them the right way. My daughter Miquita was also a big fan of my cheesy baked beans. It was a kind of Welsh rarebit with a bit of Worcester sauce, all bubbling under the grill with silky beans and crusty bread underneath.The most exciting thing in cooking is when you take something people think of as humble and transform it into something really delicious and surprising. People forget the ways they can use the tin of beans in the cupboard – they’re haricots in tomato sauce, which is the basis of so many dishes. That’s why I came up with this recipe, which combines pork and beans – an age-old combination. Watch any cowboy film and that’s what they’re eating.In this dish, I use tins of Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz to pair with the pork the creaminess of the beans and the salty, spiciness of the pork just makes me really happy. Then you get amazing sweetness from the leek and garlic running through it all.A hearty recipe that’s bound to satisfy – if you’re making it for kids you can go easy on the chilli.

Take the pork belly, slip it into an ovenproof dish, rub in all the spices, then pour in the stock. Cover with tinfoil, and place in the oven for at least 90 minutes, and up to 120 minutes – the meat needs to be very tender so that when you test with a skewer or small knife it is soft. Remove from the oven and carefully transfer to a board or rack to cool it down. Reserve the cooking juices left in the pan as well. Take the meat and pull it apart or roughly chop it up. As with the juices, leave to one side.Take a good heavy-bottomed pan, melt the butter, add the oil, then all of the other ingredients except the beans. Soften the ingredients very gently over a low heat for about 40 minutes, until they are very soft and caramelised. Add the Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, pour in the cooking juices from the pork belly. Warm the whole dish through to gently bubbling over a low heat, season with salt and pepper to taste.

Crisp and crunchy fish and chips, juicy burgers on the barbecue and decadent chocolate brownies are simply too much of a temptation, no matter that you’ve promised to be good this week. But you don’t have to choose between health and hankering after a little indulgence: we’ve rewritten the cookbook to give five comfort foods a healthier summer makeover.Using simple swaps we’ve reduced the salt, sugar and fat content of some of our favourite family meals, as well as increasing the vitamin and mineral content with a few extra portions of veg. What’s more – there’s no compromise on flavour.Here’s how to have your cake and eat it (and your chips, and your fry-up …).Healthier burger and chips Adding grated carrot or courgette to your favourite burger recipe is a savvy way to cut the fat content and increase your daily veg intake – and it keeps burgers moist on the barbecue too.Grate the vegetables finely, squeeze out as much liquid as you can, and stir in to lean mince, adding a dash of Worcestershire sauce and an egg to hold it all together. Cook the burgers on the barbecue, a griddle or in a frying pan, depending on the weather, and pile them up with plenty of tomatoes, crunchy lettuce and pickles.For healthier chips, cut large potatoes into thick fingers, boil them for four minutes and then roast in a hot oven with a drizzle of olive oil for 30 minutes or until golden. Less grease, less guilt – and lots of grinning faces around the table.Start by roasting sausages with sliced red onion, small cubes of sweet potato and a drizzle of oil in a hot oven. After about 20 minutes, or when the potatoes soften and the sausages are almost cooked through, add baby tomatoes on the vine, a handful of sliced flat-cap mushrooms and a few thyme sprigs, and bake for another 10 minutes. Make eight small gaps in the tray crack eggs into four of the holes and spoon Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz into the others, then bake for four minutes until the egg whites are set and the beans are warmed through. Serve with toast and a pot of tea.Feelgood fish and chipsReplace your normal fish-batter recipe with this healthier egg-based version – it’s salt free and cooks well in the oven. Not only are you increasing the protein content of this family favourite but by avoiding the deep-fat fryer you’ll cut down the fat content considerably.Whisk one egg white until stiff peaks form, then fold it into the broken yolk, adding lemon zest and finely chopped parsley. Dip two cod fillets into the egg-white batter and bake at 200Cfan 180Cgas mark 6 for 15 minutes until the batter is crisp and the fish is cooked through. Serve with healthier oven-cooked chips, see recipe above, and minty crushed peas or with a big green salad.Guilt-free chocolate browniesIt’s a universal fact that the ultimate chocolate brownie should be dense and fudgy on the inside, with a slightly crisp top for complete satisfaction. The big secret is that this can be achieved without a lot of butter and sugar!Tinned black beans or sweet potato work wonderfully in chocolate brownies, as they have a natural sweetness and a fudgy texture that stands up to the dark chocolate. For black bean brownies, replace the butter with a tin of beans and a little oil. And replace the sugar with maple syrup. For the sweet potato option, use two large sweet potatoes cooked and mashed and 14 dates to replace the butter and sugar respectively.A more unusual substitution is mayonnaise. Swap out butter for your favourite low cal mayo and you’ll get the same rich, gooey brownie but with less fat and fewer calories.Alternative beans on toastYes, beans on toast covered in melted cheese can solve most of your problems, but there are healthier ways to get the same hit. This baked-bean quesadilla is a fun, Mexican twist on a teatime treat and has all the beany-cheesy goodness but less sugar, salt and fat. Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz count as one of your five a day, and they’re naturally low in fat, with no added sugars, artificial colours, flavours or preservatives, which makes them a healthier alternative for all the family.Heat up a portion of the beans and then microwave two wholewheat flour tortillas for 15 seconds, or until warm. Spoon the hot beans over one tortilla using a slotted spoon so you don’t get too much sauce (no one wants soggy tortillas), and mash the beans lightly with a fork. Sprinkle with low-fat feta cheese, fresh coriander and a squeeze of lime, then put the other tortilla on top. Cut into four and serve with a big green salad, and a slightly smug feeling on the side.While you might not be able to stop the cravings, you can transform your food with a few healthy swaps – like using Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz, sneaking in some extra vegetables, or getting creative with your cooking.Find out more about Heinz No Added Sugar Beanz here"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5f0c7bea1433f837bcacc5cf7ba7a0216d6dac85/0_0_5333_3200/master/5333.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=fff387016cfba52a15b2a69c1dda02dc","title":"picking up the pieces the great jigsaw revival","story":"With time on our hands, jigsaws are having their moment. But what’s the appeal? And why are they so hypnotic? Richard Godwin speaks to puzzlers, creators and scientists to see the bigger pictureThe darkness was all-consuming as we reached the midpoint of our journey, blackness and confusion all around. It had already taken us two days to make it to the forest. At a certain point, we looked up and realised our child was no longer with us, lost amid the shimmering foliage. “Teddy, where are you?” my wife called. “Forget him, he was only slowing us down,” I murmured, perceiving the dim shape of a branch through the leaves.But there is always a way through – if not the colour, then the shape will guide you. Backs aching, eyes narrowing, language stripped to pure function, we began to piece together the blackest sections of the puzzle. “This is a waste of life,” my wife eventually concluded and returned to her novel. The glory would be mine alone. By midnight on the eighth day, the 500-piece Super-3D holographic jigsaw of the Hogwarts Express was complete.Yes, this was technically a sixth birthday present for our Harry Potter-mad son. Yes, we did most of it while he watched Netflix. Yes, I’m aware 500 pieces is not that many. Yes, this was a decadent amount of time to work on something so pointless. But sometimes, pointlessness is precisely the point.John Lewis is almost puzzled dry. Among its best sellers are The World of Frida Kahlo by Laurence King and Rainbow Hand by Galison. The satirical montage artist Cold War Steve has one, too, inspired by The Festival of Brexit – but this too has sold out. Wentworth, the Wiltshire-based company whose wooden fine art puzzles are highly prized by collectors, has nothing over 250 pieces.But puzzle junkies no longer care where they score their hit. “I don’t think I’d buy one of those super-twee ones of a country cottage or anything,” says Liz Vater, director of the Stoke Newington Literary Festival, who has completed four puzzles since lockdown, including a David Bowie-themed moon scene. “But if someone gave me one like that, I don’t think it would matter.” The experience is common. Jigsaws are a gateway drug to twee. You start out on a nice New Yorker cover. Soon, it’s Teddy Bears \u0026amp Tricycles.“You don’t want masses of sky or sand,” says my Granny Rose, 90, and a lifelong puzzler. “You want it to be interesting.” She grew up on jigsaws – her father only let her and her sister look at the picture once – and usually has one on the go. She likes doing them with friends or family, but in lockdown, she is on her own, working on an image of Blackpool beach that a friend dropped round. “It’s ghastly!” she laughs. “But my other jigsaws are in a high cupboard and I don’t want to risk climbing up on a chair.”It’s not too hard to see why we’re reaching for jigsaws. Margaret Drabble wrote a memoir inspired by puzzles, The Pattern in the Carpet: A Personal History With Jigsaws. “They provide hours of painless social intercourse or moments of peaceful, solitary retreat,” she wrote. “They give you an illusion of order and progress when all around is chaos.” There is such a thing as competitive puzzling, but this is not the point, Drabble argued. Here is a “harmonious, constructive, co-operative activity, free of the rivalry that makes so many games contentious and so many children so cross.” And if you want to do it on your own, while listening to a podcast or the birds singing, that’s fine, too.There have been studies into the cognitive effects of jigsaws. One concluded that the activity “recruits multiple visuospatial cognitive abilities and is a protective factor for visuospatial cognitive aging”. But it’s possible to overthink this. Dr Abigael San of the British Psychological Society sees it as a classic mindful activity. “Focusing on detail, taking the time to relax, having an aim without pressure – all of those things are beneficial and a counter to the wider anxiety that people are feeling at the moment. It gives you a sense of control in a chaotic situation. The world is unpredictable, whereas a jigsaw puzzle is certain.” As long as no one has lost a piece.The jigsaw is thought to have been invented in 1766 by John Spilsbury, an engraver and mapmaker whose “dissected maps” were used to teach. Jane Austen included a jigsaw in Mansfield Park (1814). The Bertram children laugh at poor cousin Fanny as she is not familiar with these fashionable toys. Adult puzzles emerged in the 20th century. At first all the pieces had straight edges. My granny remembers the “two spinsters” who lived next door to her had one like this – finally completed by the evacuee who came to stay during the war. She also remembers dedicated jigsaw libraries – of which I can find only one in England, based in a Baptist church in Exeter. Social distancing has forced it to close during lockdown. “Our clientele is usually quite elderly – people with time on their hands,” says its chairperson, Susan Hazemore. “It’s good for their eye-hand co-ordination. We have a few people who suffer from dementia and also insomnia, too. I don’t think we’ll be open until at least September now, but I am hoping that when I can go out and about a bit, I can do some delivering to people who are on our books.”For many, lockdown has been a foretaste of retirement. “Life doesn’t usually warrant a 1,000-piece jigsaw,” says Liz Vater – who realised she would have to cancel her literary festival early on and so found herself with time on her hands. “At the beginning, I had so many plans,” she says. “I was going to read all the books I have around the house. And I just wasn’t able to read. It was horrible. I always have a book on the go. But then I started a jigsaw. It does a similar thing. I was focusing in. It was quite meditative. I was processing as I was going. I’ve loved the endless hours just focusing on one task, searching for pieces defined by colour, perspective or shape.”One thing we have learned is that global catastrophes don’t introduce brand new ideas, what they do is accelerate ones that were already floating around the ether: universal basic income modern monetary theory jigsaw puzzles. When I interviewed Sir Patrick Stewart in Los Angeles three years ago, he was adamant that jigsaws were about to become the new “adult colouring books”. We were supposed to be talking about some superhero movie he was in, but he was more interested in telling me about the Picasso chair he was piecing together. “At first I was a little embarrassed about it, as it was something I’d done as a kid,” he told me. “But when I would occasionally mention it, people would whisper: ‘Oh, you do jigsaw puzzles, too? What kind? How many pieces?’ It’s like a secret society.”Goodburn of Gibsons says that jigsaws have been on a steady uptick since she joined the firm five years ago. There is a jigsaw emoji. Jigsaws were also added to the Consumer Price Index used to measure inflation in 2017 (alongside gin and almond milk). “It pre-dates coronavirus,” she says. “It’s part of the trend of looking after yourself, being more mindful, taking a digital detox.” Nostalgia is popular across age groups – one of their bestsellers is called 1980s Sweet Memories, a montage of Marathons, Opal Fruits and Jelly Tots – but they have also commissioned a new range of design-led jigsaws with a hipper audience in mind. “We have one called Avocado Park. It’s just a load of cartoon avocados having a great time in a park.”You can tell a lot about a nation by its jigsaw designs. Cats are popular. So are Spitfires. And the manically detailed, Union Jack-filled designs that Gibsons commissions often veer close to the sort of art you can imagine coming out of a Faragist dictatorship. Populist Realist Art? I ask the Observer’s art critic Laura Cumming for her verdict on The Airshow, which shows gleeful picnickers beneath a sky heavy with warplanes. She professes herself a little baffled. “The vintage planes would scalp the day-trippers, the photo-real detail seems bizarrely mismatched with the graphic kitsch and it is very strange that the hardest part of a jigsaw – long stretches of barely differentiated colour, such as sand, sea or sky – are eliminated as if the artist wanted the experience to be quick and easy. Is the idea to get through them as fast as possible and buy the next?” She reckons Pieter Bruegel the Elder is a good jigsaw artist as “you enter so intimately into his mind, piece by piece but I think Seurat is the most beautiful to do, half a dot, a whole dot, etc, as you get a deep sense of his colour alchemies. The worst I’ve ever had to do, in company with my aunt, was Renoir’s Bal du Moulin de la Galette, where every stroke melted into another.”I turn to Steve Crisp, one of the UK’s most in-demand jigsaw illustrators. “I’ll sort of do half a painting before moving on to computer, where it’s easier to move things around,” he explains. “The brief is basically, make every area of the puzzle interesting. Make sure there’s no area with too much foliage or blue sky. At the very least, there’ll be birds everywhere. I kind of pack it in.”At the moment, he’s working on a 1950s toy shop, a pop festival and a summer camp for an American company. It’s varied, but it’s always escapist. “A lot of people say when I do an image: ‘I’d like to live there,’” he says. “That’s the aim – to get that feeling for people. Hoping everything’s fine and lovely. I mean, we all like that, don’t we?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b561a735cfa867c676913557d5ebcd46832a8c4b/0_477_6666_4003/master/6666.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=aa463d0bcdccfb0cdfa32ce0172cfaaa","title":"tree of the week every autumn fruit thumps on to the lawn from our apple tree i make chutney","story":"In this weekly series, readers tell us about their favourite trees. This week: an apple tree that has been the focus of family life for decadesWe have an apple tree in our garden. It was grown from a seedling that was given as a school prize more than 80 years ago to the brother of the woman we bought our house from.We’ve been living here for 40 years. The tree is a constant in our lives – we see it from our windows and pass it when we arrive and leave the house. It makes me feel at home. All our family – sons, daughters, grandchildren – and friends have climbed it.Every autumn, large apples thump on to the lawn and flower beds. I use them to make chutney from a recipe in Elizabeth Craig’s cookery book, to give as presents and store in the cupboard well into summer.During this strange time in lockdown, we’ve been spending more time watching how the tree comes to life.

Many employers are recruiting and history tells us that we still see unfilled vacancies in a downturn. Switching off is the worst thing students can do. It will only hinder their prospects further when the upturn comes and the jobs market recovers.”Health and pharmaceuticals was found to be the only sector set to increase entry-level recruitment this year while the built environment, finance, professional services, energy and engineering were making the biggest cuts.Some of the UK’s biggest employers have already cancelled or delayed recruitment schemes and internships. Lloyds Banking Group, HSBC and the accountants PwC and BDO are among the large companies that have been forced to make changes to their recruitment plans because of the crisis."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/945d95aae27d4bbd28f803e2d0046d70a75b07e5/0_491_3120_1870/master/3120.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=87d0688e402b3c512e52baf447c02694","title":"nationwide savings internet banking coronavirus","story":"Internet banking doesn’t work for one reader during the coronavirus crisisI have a Nationwide Loyalty Saver account which contains my savings and which I normally operate with a passbook via my local branch.

Now they’re back – so why is he doing cookery classes on Instagram? ‘The fire got a bit out of control,” says Blixa Bargeld, recalling a gig his band played in 1986. As Einstürzende Neubauten, which means Collapsing New Buildings, wrapped up their set of cacophonous industrial noise, Bargeld took a tray of lighter fluid and threw a match on it before squirting on more and watching the flames erupt. “Oh, it was gigantic,” he says with a wry smile. Panic and chaos ensued.Today, thankfully, the only thing being toasted is a tablespoon of peppercorns Bargeld has instructed me to put in a pan as pasta bubbles away furiously. We are preparing spaghetti cacio e pepe. “My pasta is from Mancini,” he announces over Zoom, while opening a bottle of white wine. “He’s the only pasta-maker who grows his own wheat and has a doctorate.” Mine is from Co-op.Bargeld has been regularly hosting these cooking sessions with fans via Patreon and Instagram. He picks a recipe, curates a playlist, drinks wine, dances, and people cook along. Wearing formal dinner attire rather than a chef’s outfit, Bargeld talks me through this simple yet punchy dish. “People think you just put cheese over the pasta but that won’t do,” he says. “You have to make a juice out of the peppercorns. Like a tea.”Such activity is an extension of the community he has built among the German band’s fans. As an early adopter of crowdfunding, the group has been self-sufficient and patronage-funded since 2002. “It’s not an option for a band like us,” Bargeld says of the traditional record label model. “The money I currently get for making the album cover would be the amount I’d get for the whole record if I were to sign a record contract now.”For 40 years, Bargeld has fronted Einstürzende Neubauten, an inimitable and pioneering outfit known for their blueprint influence on industrial music and their proclivity for utilising building tools and scrap metal, as well as inventing contraptions to be used as instruments.Henry Rollins loves them so much he has the band’s logo as a tattoo. Trent Reznor cites them as a huge influence on Nine Inch Nails and later signed them to his label in the US. When Nick Cave stumbled across them, he fell in love and later wrote of Bargeld: “He stood in a black leotard, black rubber pants, black rubber boots. Around his neck hung a thoroughly fucked guitar. His skin cleared to his bones, his skull was an utter disaster, scabbed and hacked. Blixa Bargeld. He was the most beautiful man in the world.” Cave soon invited Bargeld to be the guitarist in Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, where he remained for 20 years until 2003.However, just as Bargeld’s aptitude for playing genial host belies his reputation as a man known to scream so intensely it can make dogs miles away howl, there’s also more to Neubauten than ear-terrorising industrial noise mania. This is displayed clearly on their latest album, Alles in Allem, their first studio record in 13 years.“The attitude towards the music has relaxed,” says Bargeld. “Twenty years ago, I would have needed to fill spaces, thinking something was too boring or lacking. That’s youth. It’s a different attitude now. I don’t have that urge to fill every space or think there needs to be another scream.”In tone, the result is still quintessentially Neubauten, a band that intuitively understands the equal power of restraint and exertion, albeit with noir pop, ambient soundscapes, sweeping strings and poignant melody overshadowing the cold, brittle rattle of industrial clatter. And why the long wait? “Art doesn’t come from when you can do something,” says Bargeld. “It comes from when you have to do something.”Having formed in 1980, the band’s early output was a combination of avant-punk, noise, industrial and experimental. They rehearsed in a giant air-conditioning shaft situated underneath – technically inside – an autobahn overpass. The intensity of the sound ricocheted around the space whose steel walls doubled as drums, and set the band on a unique path.Having something of an epiphany while listening to traditional Ethiopian music, Bargeld asked: “What is the authenticity of my life?” The answer lay around him in the debris of post-war Berlin coupled with its fertile and anything-goes outlook. “A lot has been said of West Berlin in the 1980s and all of it is true. It was like ground zero. The band is connected to this very special environment.” They sold their drum kit to pay rent and soon started to assemble their own instruments and creations, foraging in scrapyards or elsewhere. The message: “Be clever, steal from a construction site” was written across their first self-made drum set.Fuelled by booze and speed, the band found their reputation would precede them. “The fire thing was moving faster than we were,” Bargeld says. “We’d turn up to gigs and they’d already be standing there with fire extinguishers. That was something we had to stop, as it became showbusiness. Just showing the audience a petrol canister filled with water became enough to terrify them.”One gig – Concerto for Voice and Machinery at London’s ICA in 1984 – became so legendary it was later restaged as an artwork in 2007. But its myth has outgrown reality, Bargeld says. The story goes the band planned to drill through the floor into a rumoured secret passage that led to Buckingham Palace. Years later band member Alexander Hacke described the sound they made as “a cross between a building site and war”.His role was to throw milk bottles into a cement mixer. As glass flew out into the crowd, smoke from the petrol chainsaws began to suffocate them, too. The power supply was pulled and a riot followed. “I didn’t want to take part in that show,” recalls Bargeld. The gig also featured members of Throbbing Gristle and Fad Gadget. “The damage was started by the audience, not the band. It was not planned.”You don’t have to look too far for stories where myth and reality intertwine, however. The band did attempt to drill through a wall at the Berlin venue S036, and ex-member FM Einheit did have a penchant for throwing molotov cocktails into the audience, often causing riots. One night in Copenhagen, says Bargeld, “we were playing in a squat and we climbed up on the PA and began to chisel off parts of the ceiling. They viewed it as an attack on their house, so they slashed the tyres of our tour van, smashed the windows and stole equipment including our Kango drill.” They lasted just one night as tour support for U2 before being thrown off. The outraged and hostile audience threw bottles of urine. The band responded by throwing iron bars back at them.This led many to think of the band as provocateurs but Bargeld disagrees. “I didn’t start out to destroy the stages of the world,” he says. “It was just a sign of being alive more than a provocation.” While still ferociously intense, shows are less wild these days. Sparks still fly, metal still scrapes and power tools still grind, as Bargeld glides between rich baritone croon and vocal cord-shredding scream, but there’s also melancholic beauty and tenderness. “We’re very serious about representing the material the best we can,” says Bargeld. “It’s not really about chaos – although I did fall off stage and break my leg not that long ago.”One constant is the band’s innovative approach to equipment and recording. “There’s a strategy,” says Bargeld. “I want to undermine routine and sabotage logic. We’ve been doing that for 40 years with unusual instrumentation. It’s important to undermine functionality and knowledge – to disturb the obvious.”For Bargeld, the sound of Tupperware filled with nails and coins being shaken recalls the sound of the ocean, while a microphone swiped across a shopping trolley mirrors the lush plucks of a harp. Nick Cave once wrote vividly about watching the band mic up a dog to root around in pig guts. “What I want when working with unusual materials is for them to open up and give something of their character away,” Bargeld says. “I don’t really care about sound. I think it’s highly overvalued. I care about context and metaphor.”Watching Bargeld slurp up some pepper-coated spaghetti reminds me they have a percussive instrument called the noodle. However, foraging is getting harder these days apparently. “We went to a scrapyard,” says Bargeld. “But due to security reasons, they don’t let you in any more. They only let you look through the trash, and there’s not much treasure to be found in there.” Still, the band is still finding beautiful sounds in unexpected places. “Polystyrene,” says Bargeld, taking another mouthful, “gives you incredible sounds.”• Alles in Allem is out now on Potomak."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7554203b031a78748e9f552d8a650971c5d5858b/53_0_3308_1985/master/3308.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026enable=upscale\u0026s=3948b1e66af45ca9f1a6c034d1f56a89","title":"blind date takeover looking for love in lockdown podcast part 2","story":"In the concluding part of our Blind Date takeover, two more couples meet remotely for a socially distanced evening of drinks and dinnerIn part 1 of our Blind Date takeover last week, three couples met up via Zoom and let us listen in to what a first date sounds like in the age of lockdowns.

Unfortunately earlier today the roles were put on hold. This is due to a delay in the launch of the ‘Track and Trace’ app itself while the government considers an alternative app,” the emails said.A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said the email was “wrong and could cause confusion”, and recruitment for both the online and phone-based contact-tracing service was continuing “at pace”.The shadow health secretary, Jon Ashworth, said: “Test, trace and isolate is fundamental to managing and controlling this virus and safely easing lockdown – yet the government’s approach has been increasingly chaotic, with misstep after misstep.”The government is battling to maintain public trust for the difficult second phase of managing the crisis after replacing the blunt “stay at home, save lives” message with the more nebulous “stay alert”.Boris Johnson acknowledged on Sunday he could understand the public’s frustration. He wrote in the Mail on Sunday: “I recognise what we are now asking is more complex than simply staying at home – but this is a complex problem and we need to trust in the good sense of the British people.”The NHS’s digital arm, NHSX, has developed its own coronavirus tracking app, which will hold data centrally, instead of opting for an alternative from Google and Apple that operates in a decentralised way.If a user becomes unwell with symptoms of Covid-19, they can choose to let the app inform the NHS. They will be offered testing, and an anonymous alert will inform other app users with whom they spent time over the previous few days.Thousands of contact tracers, many of them working from home, will work alongside the app, speaking to Covid-19 sufferers about whom they may have been in contact with, and giving advice – for example, urging them to self-isolate.Ministers want to be able to use the data gathered to analyse the spread of the virus. They hope this will allow them to reimpose lockdown conditions in local areas where a new outbreak is detected – a process Johnson has described as “whack-a-mole”.But the app is working against constraints in modern smartphones that only Google and Apple can work around, as well as arriving burdened with privacy concerns that could deter some members of the public from using it.People who had applied for contact-tracing jobs through the government’s gov.uk website were told this weekend: “As and when the app (or an alternative) goes live, we will reconsider those applications already received, however please be aware that we have received an unprecedented number of applications for this role and therefore not all suitable candidates will be able to be put forward.”The DHSC spokesperson said: “The NHS contact-tracing app is not on hold and it would be completely wrong to suggest otherwise. There is no alternative app and the NHS continues to work constructively with many other organisations that are helping to develop and test the NHS Covid-19 app.” revealed last week that the app’s advisory board was split over whether it had the authority to tell the government to ditch its version and switch to the Apple and Google version.After a meeting on Thursday, it emerged that members argued their role on the board was limited to providing guidance on ethical questions, and not to branch out into a broader discussion of whether the app is the right tool for the job.Some government officials believe the NHSX app may not survive in its current form after trials on the Isle of Wight. Software for a decentralised version by Apple and Google is expected to be released on Tuesday.The government gave up trying to track every UK case of Covid-19 in March, when the virus began circulating in the community. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jenny Harries, said at the time: “There comes a point in a pandemic where that is not an appropriate intervention.”But Ashworth and the health secretary Matt Hancock’s immediate predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, have repeatedly called for community tracing.If the track and trace system is ready to roll out by the end of month, it would be in time to provide reassurance to parents and teachers that inidual cases in English schools could be identified and isolated if they reopen to more pupils from 1 June, as the government is demanding.The Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, suggested last week that just 1,500 contact tracers of the 18,000 promised by Hancock had been hired, but government sources now say that number was out of date.Appearing on Sophy Ridge on Sunday on SkyNews, Gove heaped praise on Hancock, amid reports of a testy relationship between the health secretary and No 10. “We’re on course to meet that target. It’s more evidence that we have, in Matt, an energetic and determined health secretary who is throwing everything into the fight against this virus,” Gove said."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/7f3f49ee596cbb8a2cab7cffe566852ddf5ea524/0_246_6720_4032/master/6720.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3ef38b4094cf60850ad52f52d248e213","title":"uk to publish draft treaty in effort to reboot brexit process","story":"British negotiators fear Michel Barnier has been unable to get EU leaders to focus on Brexit trade and security talks as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, as Downing Street prepares to publish a draft treaty this week in an effort to reboot the process.David Frost, the UK’s chief negotiator, believes his EU counterpart recognises the need to budge on key issues, including fisheries, over which France, the Netherlands and Spain have imposed a tough line.Barnier said on Friday that he expected both sides to shift from their “maximalist” stance on access to British waters by June. It is hoped in Whitehall that laying out legal text will prompt EU states to become more engaged with discussions over all aspects of the future relationship.The UK document in treaty form will lay bare the stark differences between the two sides on key areas after what both agreed had been another disappointing round of talks last week.Downing Street believes the British position has so far been mischaracterised, and a UK source close to the negotiations described the EU’s attitude to date as bewildering.Senior government figures are convinced that part of the problem lies in European governments being distracted by the pandemic.On Friday, Barnier accused the British negotiators of again seeking to cherrypick membership of the bloc by seeking minimal obligations on standards in the trade in goods and maximum rights.“We have been clear that we are not looking for that,” said one UK source close to the negotiation. “Anyone who thinks this government has got nostalgia for 2018 or Chequers has an imperfect understanding of UK political developments in the last couple of years.“The only explanation I can find is that their arguments on the merits are not working and they are reaching for some of the old script. But it doesn’t fit the actual situation we are now trying to negotiate.”Boris Johnson resigned from his post as foreign secretary in Theresa May’s government in July 2018 following publication of a vision of a trade deal agreed by the cabinet at the prime minister’s Chequers retreat. It outlined a close trading relationship based on alignment between EU and UK laws.UK sources said the requests Barnier cited as evidence for his claims, including freedom of movement for short visits and recognition of professional qualifications to enable British lawyers, accountants and auditors to work in the EU, were all included in previous free trade deals.With British negotiators determined to energise the talks, the forthcoming legal text will highlight a series of areas where there are mutual interests, including the maintenance of the British car industry and its supply chains.Barnier’s team has also rejected the UK’s proposals to reduce the administrative burden of sanitary and phytosanitary checks at borders to protect human, animal and plant life, it is claimed. The UK is seeking equivalence between EU and British rules and the legal text is expected to detail how that might work.EU sources have said that on fisheries they were encouraged by the provision last week of a framework agreement on how the UK intends to open its waters to European fleets. “I think the UK has moved since the beginning,” one EU official said. “Originally they said they didn’t want an agreement on this, but since then they’ve expressed a wish to discuss fisheries and get an agreement.”British sources said it remained the case that the UK would not allow the continuation of the common fisheries policy in which historical patterns of catches determine today’s hauls. The UK’s proposal is expected to be part of the documents made public.The pressure is on both sides to find common ground as the point by which any extension to the transition period would have to be agreed looms.Under the withdrawal agreement, an extension of “up to one or two years” must be agreed by 1 July. The two teams will restart talks in the first week of June.A UK spokesman said: “We intend to make public all the UK draft legal texts during next week so that the EU’s member states and interested observers can see our approach in detail.”One UK source close to the negotiation said Barnier was “doing a good job with the hand he has been given” but added that the mandate handed to him by the EU capitals was “unnegotiable” in key areas."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8a4f2647fde2602339e8ff58fab13a5af11a93a8/120_0_1800_1080/master/1800.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=8c190d6c17e9f35adcaf1e400c80ddc4","title":"michael jordans first ever air jordan sneakers sell for 560000 at auction","story":"US basketball legend wore the Nike trainers in his rookie season in the NBA and are featured in hit documentary The Last DanceA pair of sneakers worn by basketball legend Michael Jordan in his rookie season in the NBA have fetched a record $560,000 in an online auction, Sotheby’s said.The autographed Air Jordan 1s, designed for Jordan in 1985 and the first-ever signature sneakers, were expected to fetch between $100,000 to $150,000 in the auction that closed on Sunday.

In his new book, Sackcloth and Ashes, there is a companion picture to this one, which shows the same wedding party parading along a street in Fakulteta, the Roma ghetto in the capital, Sofia. In that picture, the bride picks her way through mud and rubbish, leading a raggedy line of revellers that includes a clarinettist and an accordion player. Here the instruments have been hung up on the shack behind, in a pause in the festivities.Fakulteta is the kind of place Krassowski has been documenting for 30 years. Its 25,000 residents remain cut off from the Bulgarian capital, long denied water and sanitation, and with only off-grid electricity. Many residents are effectively forced to work recycling the industrial waste that is dumped in the area. Krassowski, who first took photographs of his native Poland at the time of the collapse of the Soviet Union, has subsequently travelled in places as distinct as Tanzania, Peru and Mongolia, but his photographs have a remarkable collective poignancy. He has often been drawn to the universal exclamation marks in human lives – births, marriages and deaths and, as here, to little moments of reflection and hope in lives characterised by hardship and struggle.Speaking of his book, 120 black-and-white silver halide film prints selected from half a lifetime’s work, Krassowski notes how many of his subjects may now be dead and the purpose of the commissions that drove his projects long forgotten. “In the book, however, I hope to keep alive a little longer what unites them: my personal approach, a sense of deep unity beyond cultures. It is important to me that the impact of political events can be understood from the point of view of ordinary people in their ordinary lives.”• Sackcloth and Ashes by Witold Krassowski (GOST Books, £40).

Soldiers and police officers were deployed at the market to take the temperature of all traders and clients.“Markets were probably the biggest vector of infection which is why Peru’s quarantine did not work as it should have,” said Eduardo Zegarra, the principal investigator for Grade, a development thinktank in Lima.“These figures are a bombshell,” he said, calling on the government to shut down the markets and declare a sanitary emergency.Authorities in Lima have left most of the city’s 1,200-plus markets open, carrying out spot tests and sending infected vendors – most of whom were asymptomatic – to self-isolate at home or at government facilities.But Zegarra worried Lima’s huge wholesale markets were already “enormous hubs of infection”, particularly Santa Anita, Lima’s largest, where some 30,000 merchants, porters and suppliers distribute and sell around 8,000 tonnes of food per day.Dozens of infections and at least one death have been reported among the market’s porters and fears were growing that the virus could already have spread not only to thousands of retailers and customers but also to lorry drivers traveling between the city and the country.“I fear that could trigger a second wave of the pandemic,” said Zegarra, a former deputy mayor of Lima. “The contagion among merchants is terribly high and we don’t know how long they’ve had it or how many people they’ve passed it on to.”Coronavirus cases in Peru rose to more than 88,000 on Saturday, with a death toll of 2,572, according to official figures. Only Brazil has a higher infection rate in Latin America, surging to fourth place in the world with 233,511 confirmed cases and sixth place for coronavirus deaths with 15,662, according to Johns Hopkins University.São Paulo’s CEAGESP wholesale market – one of the largest on the continent – has already seen “innumerable” cases and around 30 deaths from Covid-19, according to the president of the market suppliers’ union.“We are very sad about the deaths of these people – but if you consider 40,000 people who come here every day, it is quite low,” said Cláudio Furquim.Media reports have shown crowds of shoppers and workers at Brazilian markets, most them without masks. In a report by TV Record, Diego Hipólito said his uncle, a driver, went to the market daily and kept working when he fell sick with coronavirus symptoms before eventually dying. “I think he could have passed it on,” Hipólito said.Markets still occupy an important place in Latin American culture and economies – even as retail giants such as Walmart expand into the region. But that has also tied them closely to the spread of the disease.Colombia’s largest wholesale market, Corabastos, sits in the hardscrabble Kennedy neighbourhood of the capital Bogotá – currently centre of the country’s outbreak.The city’s health minister, Alejandro Gómez, admitted that local government could have done better but also stressed the importance of food supplies. “We cannot allow Corabastos to become a risk to the health of Bogotá, but neither can we allow food shortages,” he said.Jorge Colmenares, an opposition city councilman, tweeted: “Thanks to Bogota’s carelessness, the coronavirus has hit the food supply of millions of citizens.”At Mexico City’s mammoth Central de Abasto, which receives merchandise from around the country and in turn supplies markets throughout the capital, at least 25 cases of Covid-19 and two deaths have been reported, although local media suggested the true figure was much higher.After a brief lockdown, Mexico has already announced plans to re-open its economy, but while Cornejo was sympathetic with the urge to get back to work, he feared that the worst was still to come from the coronavirus.“Economically, it’s time to restart. But on the health side, I’m worried – I don’t think we’ve hit bottom,” he said.“I’ve lived through the H1N1 outbreak and earthquakes, but I’ve never experienced anything like this.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/bd3c85059852c298d1c17f8777a5d0ff80b77aca/0_83_2500_1500/master/2500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6487fec7c2246f2adbc7abe86d2c93e0","title":"egyptian editor held in covid 19 reporting crackdown","story":"Lina Attalah, founder of Mada Masr, arrested while talking to jailed activist’s motherEgyptian security forces briefly arrested the founder of the country’s last independent media outlet in a growing crackdown on freedom of expression linked to Covid-19.Lina Attalah, the editor-in-chief of the website Mada Masr, was arrested outside Tora prison in the south of Cairo while interviewing the mother of a jailed activist attempting to bring medication and hand sanitiser to her son.The activist, Abd El Fattah, has been on hunger strike since mid-April in protest at deteriorating prison conditions, including the risk of the spread of coronavirus as well as the suspension of visits and trial hearings due to the pandemic.Atallah was taken to a police station and held for undisclosed charges, before she was questioned by a prosecutor. She was later ordered to be released on bail of 2,000 Egyptian pounds (£105).Mada Masr reported that Attalah’s mobile phone was seized and the media outlet’s lawyer was prevented from seeing Atallah while in detention.The journalist was recognised by Time magazine as a “new-generation leader,” in 2017, when she was branded the “muckraker of the Arab world”. Mada Masr is internationally recognised as the last bastion of press freedom in Egypt, a lone award-winning independent outlet in a repressive media environment where the majority of newspapers are state-controlled.Plainclothes security officials raided Mada Masr’s offices last November and Attalah was detained. She was released following international pressure. The website of Mada Masr has been blocked in Egypt since May 2017, one of at least 500 sites blocked in the country.Attalah’s arrest is part of a pattern of repression connected to Covid-19. Egyptian security forces detained another journalist, Hassan Mahgoub, at his home in early May after he reported a series of stories about the virus. Atef Hasballah, an editor, was bundled into the back of a police van and accused of joining a terrorist group in April after questioning the government’s official statistics about Covid-19 on his Facebook page.Egypt is considered one of the world’s leading jailers of journalists, ranked 166 out of 180 countries on the World Press Freedom Index by Reporters Without Borders.Diaa Rashwan, the head of Egypt’s State Information Service and the head of the journalists’ syndicate, did not respond when contacted for comment.Timothy Kaldas, of the Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy and a longtime friend of Attalah, said: “Lina’s arrest is yet another example of Egypt’s persistent assault on journalists. It’s worrisome that the latest round of crackdowns coincides with the Covid pandemic. Egyptian authorities may presume this leaves foreign capitals distracted and unprepared to emphasise concerns about political freedoms. A free press that the public can trust for information is all the more vital during a health crisis.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/03e7609e0a02bf659e7748861f5345436ea5f531/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=7be5b144def086e15f03e54e23b4bffc","title":"europe plans a summer staycation after coronavirus lockdowns","story":"While Italy, France and Spain remain cautious and look for domestic tourists, Greece hopes to capitalise on its handling of the crisis by opening its doors in JulyAs the most popular country in the world for tourists, France has been hit harder than most by a drop in holidaymakers. Around 90 million people, the majority from Britain and Germany, visited last year. Almost half of them visited Paris, and 15 million headed to Disneyland – the most popular tourist attraction in Europe.Last week, France’s prime minister Edouard Philippe, announced an €18bn (£16bn) rescue package for the country’s tourism sector to combat the collapse in visitor numbers. “What is good for the tourism industry, is often good for the whole of France,” he said.Italy’s prime minister, Giuseppe Conte, has said several times that Italians will be going on holiday this summer. Yesterday , the government approved a decree which will allow travel to and from abroad from June 3. Free travel within the country’s borders will also be permitted from the same day.Some regions had pushed for a swifter rollback, but Conte has insisted on a gradual return to normal to prevent a second wave of infections.Shops are due to open tomorrow and all movement within inidual regions will be allowed, meaning people can visit friends.The government is hoping to salvage the holiday season, when Italians traditionally escape the cities for their annual summer breaks. Shops and restaurants across the country are preparing to reopen under strict social distancing and hygiene rules. National health authorities will monitor the situation to make sure infections are kept in check, the decree said.Angela GiuffridaSpain’s foreign minister, Arancha González Laya, warned at the end of April that the country would re-open to tourists only “when it’s in a position to guarantee tourists’ safety”.Everyone arriving in Spain from abroad since 15 May must undertake a two-week quarantine, with new arrivals allowed out only to buy food or medicine, seek medical attention, or on emergency grounds. The quarantine will remain in force while the state of emergency, declared on 14 March, endures – possibly until the end of June.The regions are emerging from lockdown at different rates . Hotels in some areas have been given permission to re-open – barring communal areas – but few have resumed business for lack of customers. Beaches could re-open in mid-June, but it remains to be seen how social distancing will be enforced.

A report in the official news agency Xinhua on Sunday said “the US and other countries” were “determined to discuss Taiwan-related proposals for only one purpose: to politicise health issues and achieve their own interests at the expense of kidnapping the the World Health Assembly and hurting global cooperation”.An article in the official People’s Daily on Monday said: “Any attempt to use the WHO as a tool for geopolitical games is tantamount to a challenge to humankind’s right to health.” An editorial in the Global Times said: “A politicised appeal won’t be supported at the assembly … The US has messed up its Covid-19 fight but intends to shift the responsibility onto China. Such a plan is bound to backfire.”The Covid-19 pandemic, which first emerged in Wuhan last December, has placed China under more scrutiny as critics call for an investigation into how the virus was able to spread across the world. It has now infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000.Beijing, which has repeatedly said that researchers have not yet determined the source of the virus and raised the possibility that it may have originated elsewhere, has described such calls as an effort by countries to deflect from their own failures. Chinese authorities appear to be putting more controls on research into the origins of the virus as well as blocking international observers from fully participating in efforts.“China’s reluctance to allow the international community to investigate and its enthusiasm in creating all sorts of conspiracy theories pointing to non-China origins of the virus only make the world more eager to know the answer,” said Ho-Fung Hung, a professor in political economy at Johns Hopkins University, with a focus on China.Allies of China like Indonesia and Russia are among the countries demanding independent investigation, Hung noted. “Beijing will find it difficult to resist without risking further damage of its international image,” he said.As criticism over China has increased over the last few months, support of Taiwan, seen as having successfully managed the outbreak, has grown. Previous bids by Taiwan, which had observer status as a nonvoting observer at the WHO for seven years until 2016, have not gained as much traction. Taiwan will need a simple majority of the 194 member states to support its attendance.“Beijing has failed to shape the narrative on COVID-19, pressed too hard diplomatically against countries critical of its response, and come off as prioritising its image and its own interests, including on Taiwan, over global health,” said Jessica Drun, a non-resident fellow at Project 2049, a think tank focusing on security in the Asia Pacific region.“In the past, Taiwan’s bids have not gained as much traction as it is currently, and I think that’s largely due to the example Taiwan is setting to the world on not only how to effectively combat the disease on the home front, but also in sharing best practices through informal channels with the international community,” Drun said.“Taiwan has successfully demonstrated how it can contribute substantively to the global health efforts and why it deserves a seat at the table,” she said.Additional reporting by Lillian Yang"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/929dbc8ba8e3812479e7012eb7efe84b20d8c18f/0_336_5111_3067/master/5111.jpg?width=620\u0026amp;quality=85\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b77ea31c3a6fd87fb01c706317bcaa4b","title":"cleaner and greener covid 19 prompts worlds cities to free public space of cars","story":"Campaigners call for schemes for cyclists and pedestrians across the globe to be made long-termThe mayor of Athens has said he will “liberate” public space from cars. His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight.Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects.Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby.The Greek capital is embarking on one of the most ambitious rejuvenation schemes, which has been hastened by the pandemic, according to its mayor, Kostas Bakoyannis. He announced plans last week to allocate 50,000 square metres of public space for cyclists and pedestrians.At the heart of the scheme will be a four-mile “grand walkway” uniting archaeological sites in the historic centre. Pavements will be widened, boulevards pedestrianised, squares enlarged and traffic banned from areas beneath the Acropolis. Bakoyannis, who became Athens’ youngest mayor last year, openly admits that the pandemic played a role in accelerating infrastructure works that might have taken years to accomplish.“We have this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and are fast-forwarding all our public works,” he said. “The goal is to liberate public space from cars and give it to people who want to walk and enjoy the city … Athens will be cleaner, greener and better lit.”In Budapest, 12 miles of temporary bike lanes have been introduced on some of the city’s busiest roads over the past month.The city’s mayor, Gergely Karácsony, who was elected last year on a largely green platform, had little trouble introducing the lanes after many people expressed their discomfort at the prospect of depending on the city’s excellent but usually packed public transport system during the pandemic. The mayor’s office said it was monitoring traffic levels and that some of the temporary lanes may remain once life gets back to normal. It is planning a public consultation over where and how to introduce more bike lanes in the future.Around 20 miles of temporary bike lanes have been set up across Paris, much to the disgruntlement of car lobbyists who have protested to city hall that their rights are being squeezed. Main roads such as the Rue de Rivoli and Rue Saint Antoine, a major east-west route, are gradually being sealed off to private vehicles and there are proposals for a further 30 miles of bike lanes in the city.Many Parisians are being offered €50 toward getting old bikes repaired as part of the French capital’s €20m (£18m) planvélo to encourage the use of bicycles.Those supporting the new push for bike travel point to recent studies, one of which showed the average journey by vehicle in Paris to is 2.5 miles – a comfortable distance by bike for most – and another indicating that the lack of exhaust fumes during lockdown has dramatically improved air quality in the city.The city’s mayor, Anne Hidalgo, had made persuading people to abandon private cars in favour of bikes one of the pillars of her political programme even before she was elected mayor in 2014. Despite the car lobby’s hopes that motorised vehicles can reclaim the city once the virus is under control, Hidalgo has said it is out of the question for the city to return to the pre-coronavirus traffic jams and vehicle pollution.Dublin city council has set aside swathes of Ireland’s capital for pedestrians and cyclists to facilitate physical distancing in a “temporary mobility plan” that may become permanent. Authorities singled out College Green, which abuts Trinity College, and other parts of the city centre for what promises to be a bold transformation. The idea is to give pedestrians and cyclists more space to navigate the city when shops and other businesses reopen in a 12 to 18-month respite from traffic-choked streets. Rome’s council has approved the construction of 93 miles of temporary and permanent cycle routes as a way to be more sustainable while allowing people to adhere to physical distancing rules. As part of the government’s economic decree, people in towns and cities with populations of 50,000 or more will also be able to claim up to €500 toward the cost of a new bike. The payment also applies to scooters, electric bikes and Segways.Last year’s Tour de France victory by the Colombian Egan Bernal precipitated a cycling boom in Bogotá. Hundreds of miles of public highways are closed to cars on Sundays, allowing cyclists to take to the roads free of exhaust fumes and the blare of car horns.Announcing that 7,000 people were using the bike paths in the working-class south of the city, Bogota’s transport secretary, Nicolás Estupiñan, tweeted: “Every day more Bogotanos are getting on, and staying on, their bikes!”Similar developments are taking place from Brussels to Sydney, while transport officials in many US cities report an “explosion in cycling”. From “slow streets” programmes in California to the progressive closure of many streets in New York, some cities have said they plan to make the changes permanent.The ADAC, Germany’s automobile association, has been highly critical of what it has called officials’ “exploitation of an emergency”, which has been taking place in cities across the country.“The temporary reduction in car traffic, and incidentally bike usage as well, cannot be used to enforce the permanent reallocation of traffic space,” Volker Krane, of the ADAC, told German media. He said the bike lanes did little to ensure the safety of bike riders. Even in some cities that have not introduced specific measures to encourage bikes, cyclists are making their presence felt. In the Jordanian capital, Amman, they spoke of the joy of seizing empty roads from the aggressive driving culture that normally dominates them, after cars were banned for about six weeks.Reporting team: Helena Smith in Athens, Shaun Walker in Budapest, Kim Willsher in Paris, Rory Carroll in Dublin, Angela Giuffrida in Rome, Joe Parkin Daniels in Bogotá and Michael Safi in Amman"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8799bfe3e0773c21480e58da0b82fbbe8bf97556/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=1200\u0026height=630\u0026quality=85\u0026auto=format\u0026fit=crop\u0026overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft\u0026overlay-width=100p\u0026overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc\u0026s=21dd02ce7585284abbfdc7634d518d78","title":"monday briefing missteps dog plans for track and trace scheme","story":"Emails emerge saying that plan is on hold while alternative app is considered … Work begins on vaccine despite lack of trials … Chelsea blooms onlineMorning everyone. I’m Martin Farrer and these are the stories you need to start the week.Ministers have been accused of “misstep after misstep” over the rolling out of a viable contact tracing scheme to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Michael Gove said yesterday that the government’s app-based plan would be ready to launch by the end of the month and that “just over 17,000” contact tracers had been hired to help. But emails sent this weekend by one of the companies handling the recruitment process said hiring had been paused while the government considered an alternative app. Attempts to get teachers back to work are also beset with problems but a study by the Institute for Fiscal Studies today says that keeping schools closed will widen inequalities during lockdown.

If the vaccine is successful, AstraZeneca will work to make 30m shots available by September, with a further 70m earmarked for the US and the rest of the world.The virus has now infected 4.7 million people around the world and caused the death of 315,000.

Follow the latest updatesAfter more than 50 years fighting for civil rights, the Rev Jesse Jackson is now watching coronavirus ravage African American communities. But he has a warning for the rich and powerful.Our military cannot defeat this germ. Having the biggest banks, having the biggest military has no meaning in this kind of germ warfare. The frontline is not soldiers the frontline is doctors and nurses. The planes are grounded, the bombs are irrelevant. It turns out that pride precedes a fall. Sometimes people have to learn that we don’t control everything. Despite lockdown and Parkinson’s disease, Jackson is still working with gusto at the Rainbow Push Coalition, a progressive organisation he founded in 1996. It has convened thousands of black doctors and lawyers and released a manifesto suggesting that high-risk groups, including African Americans, be prioritised for coronavirus testing.Jackson has twice written to Donald Trump urging testing for the 2.2 million people currently in prison. At a time when most Americans are looking inward, he has also called for massive intervention in Africa, a particularly vulnerable continent that is close to his heart.Japan’s beloved Mount Fuji will be closed during this year’s summer climbing season to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, officials have said.Shizuoka prefecture, home to the country’s tallest mountain, announced they were closing three of the four major routes to the mountain’s peak. “The routes open in summer but this year we will keep them closed from July 10 to September 10,” the only climbing season for Mount Fuji, a Shizuoka prefecture official told AFP. “We’re taking this measure so as not to spread the coronavirus,” the official said. It will be the first time the trails of the 3,776-metre (12,388 ft) volcanic mountain are closed since at least 1960 when the prefecture began managing the routes, he added. The decision comes after nearby Yamanashi prefecture said it will close the Yoshida trail, the most popular hiking path among the four. The mountain huts along the four routes will remain closed as well. The mountain, a UNESCO world cultural heritage site, welcomed about 236,000 climbers last year, according to the Mount Fuji official website.Thanks Helen, this is Jessica Murray taking charge of the ship (blog) for the next few hours.As always, I’d love to hear your suggestions and experiences, so please do get in touch if you would like to:I’ll try to respond to as many as I can, and I’ll certainly read them all.

Here are the latest developments from the last few hours: Across Europe, government-backed business loan schemes in Germany, France and Switzerland have been quicker to distribute emergency funding during the coronavirus outbreak than those in the UK, where teething problems put the British programme weeks behind mainland rivals.The UK’s coronavirus business interruption loan scheme (CBILS), which was initially fraught with controversy over demands for personal guarantees, took a month to distribute 18,595 loans worth £3.1bn.But the pace of approvals jumped following the introduction of two additional programmes, including the bounce-back loan scheme that handed £2bn to 69,000 Britain’s smallest businesses within the first 24 hours of its launch on 4 May. Seven weeks in, the UK is finally catching up, having handed almost £15bn to more than 304,000 firmsBut why did the UK struggle to keep up with its European peers in the first place? Experts say the answer may be linked to borrowing trends, the nature of Britain’s financial system, and the UK’s relationship with government spending.In a sober assessment of the economic impact of coronavirus in the US, the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, estimated GDP contraction in the June quarter could be “easily be in the twenties or thirties”, as fallout from the global outbreak worsened.“So the data we’ll see for this quarter, which ends in June, will be very, very bad,” he said.Some analysts predicted more grim news ahead, with the full impact of the pandemic still to be measured.A professional football team in South Korea has apologised after “mannequins” it used as substitute fans during a match at the weekend turned out to be sex dolls.The K-League club FC Seoul said the dolls, which had been dotted around stands currently off-limits to supporters due to the coronavirus outbreak, had been ordered inadvertently after a “misunderstanding” with the supplier.Earlier this month the K-League became the first major football league to hold matches since the start of the pandemic, with the season’s opening game watched by a worldwide audience of fans starved of live football.But FC Seoul’s attempt to bring a touch of realism to Sunday’s match against Gwangju FC backfired after social media users noticed that the mannequins looked more like sex dolls.Beijing is expected to face new levels of pressure at the World Health Assembly this week as dozens of nations push for an independent investigation into the coronavirus outbreak and the United States mounts a campaign over Taiwan’s status.More than 120 countries have backed a call for an investigation into the origins of Covid-19 while a US-led coalition has been aggressively lobbying countries to support Taiwan’s bid to attend as an observer.China has blocked Taiwan, which Beijing claims is part of China, from attending the meeting since 2016 as relations between Beijing and Taipei worsened following the election of Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan’s Democratic Progressive Party.The mayor of Athens has said he will “liberate” public space from cars. His counterpart in Paris says it is out of the question for the city to return to pre-coronavirus traffic and pollution levels. In Berlin, 14 miles (22 km) of new bike lanes have appeared almost overnight.Around the world, from Dublin to Sydney, cities are being radically reshaped in favour of cyclists and pedestrians as empty streets give authorities the opportunity to implement and accelerate large-scale projects.Cycling advocates and environmental activists are urging governments to ensure the revival is long-term and lasts beyond the pandemic, for fear of a pushback by the car lobby.The World Health Assembly is the key decision-making body of the World Health Organization, attended by representatives of the United Nation’s 194 member states.The two-day 2020 assembly will be held virtually – it usually happens in Geneva – because of the ongoing Covid-19 crisis around the world.This year’s assembly, the 73rd WHA, will be dedicated almost entirely to strengthening global coordination against the Covid-19 pandemic, which has infected more than 4.7 million people and killed 315,000.This will be a critical assembly: the annual meeting comes at a time when the WHO has attracted unprecedented global attention for its coordination and advisory role during the pandemic.Influential states, most notably the US, have criticised the WHO for being slow to react, and alleged it has been biased towards China. The US has withheld funding from the WHO in response to its perceived Covid-19 failings."},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255695.1589735495!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"are schools ready for predicted grades some have used them for years","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStudents at SEK Dublin International School near Greystones, Co Wicklow, where teachers calculate predicted grades for students as part of the International Baccalaureate.Teachers and schools across the State are getting ready to grapple with a new concept of assigning predicted grades for this year’s Leaving Cert students.However, hundreds of schools have quietly been using “big data” over recent years to calculate their students’ likely results.Athena Analytics, a Kerry-based education technology firm founded in 2017, says its statistical modelling has accurately predicted students’ results within a single grade in 96 per cent of cases. It says it is providing the service to about 300 secondary schools.Emily Brick, the firm’s founder, says its predictions are based on students’ previous in-house results in fifth- and sixth-year exams, combined with national data on Leaving Cert results trends.The fact that, nationally, results in each subject fall into a bell curve in line with previous years makes predicting results a challenge suited to predictive analytics.“We tested this model including all other past results but found that using results any earlier than that, including aptitude tests done on entrance to school, did not improve the accuracy of the predictions,” she said.Even with subjects where there are no previous results – which is often the case with students studying minority languages like Polish, Russian, Romanian – it is possible to predict results accurately by examining their other subject results. The main limitation, she says, is that a statistical solution will only take into account past results and cannot allow for students whose potential is not reflected in their exam results to date. “The other limitation, which is of course not a concern, is that a statistical solution will not take into account students who do not meet their potential on the day of the exam, for whatever reason,” she says.Mock exams and past papersSchools in Ireland which offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) – an internationally recognised equivalent to the Leaving Cert – also say predicted grades are a long-standing feature of their exam process.Chis Charleson, director of SEK Dublin International School near Greystones, Co Wicklow, says there is about 60 per cent accuracy in use of predicted grades versus final grades.“Our teachers use mock exams and past papers to give students a predicted grade in advance of the written exams, which are marked externally,” he says.“It can flag an error in the marking process if a child is, for example, two grades out from their predicted grade. If that’s the case, there is an automatic check of the grade.”The cancellation of the written exams for the IB this year means students are being awarded grades based on their completed coursework, which is being marked externally.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255697.1589736196!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"gifts for teachers to be treated as serious attempt to undermine leaving cert grades","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tMinister for Education Joe McHugh has defended the process and says schools will award students’ grades and not the Department of Education. Photograph: Crispin RodwellAny attempt to offer teachers gifts or inducements in relation to students’ Leaving Cert results will be treated as a “serious attempt”to interfere with an entire school’s grades, under new Department of Education rules.Department officials are finalising official guidance for teachers and schools over the use of calculated grades for students and it is likely to issue to teachers’ representatives in the middle of this week.Unions have been pushing for a protocol to be included in the guidance which states that any inappropriate contact with teachers or schools will be formally recorded and forwarded to the department.The draft guidance document is understood to state that parents or students must not under any circumstances contact, directly or indirectly, a teacher or other staff member to discuss estimated marks or class rankings.“Such contact would be regarded as totally inappropriate and a serious attempt to interfere with the fairness and objectivity required of teachers and schools in the assigning of estimated marks and ranking for the inidual student concerned and for the students in the school as a whole,” according to new department guidance.It also states that any attempt by teachers to allow discussion of estimated grades before the process is complete would interfere with the process being carried out properly and fairly. InfluencingIt says that if teachers discuss the marks with some students but not others, or if some teachers did this and others did not, these discussions might actually influence or be construed as influencing the mark the teacher submits to the subject alignment group.Teachers’ Union of Ireland president Séamus Lahart said while calculated grades was not the preference of its members, teachers will work to implement them to the best of their ability.“We’re working with other stakeholders to produce guidelines to enable teachers to do this as best as possible,” he said.“We hope it will issue to teachers very soon. Our advice in the meantime is to wait until guidelines are issued before engaging in the process. When this happens, teachers will assign appropriate grades to students.”The Labour Party, meanwhile, has written to the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission urging it to investigate whether the use of “school profiling” in the use of calculated grades will penalise disadvantaged students.This is a reference to the standardisation process that will occur when schools submit their calculated grades for students.Under its official guidance, the department says estimated marks from each school will be adjusted to bring them into line with the “expected distribution” based on previous years.Labour’s education spokesman Aodhán O Riordan said the use of this approach was “fundamentally unfair” and will impact on the capacity of some students to achieve their potential.“This issue cannot be relegated to a mere political charge. It is appropriate that the commission assess the potential impact of this measure and make a statement accordingly.”Recognise achievementMinister for Education Joe McHugh has defended the process and said schools will award students’ grades and not the department.He also said the calculated grades process will recognise achievement by students or classes in disadvantaged schools – such as an honours maths class in the school that was not there a year ago.Mr McHugh said a standardisation process was needed to ensure there is fairness across the system.In an interview with Bere Island Community Radio on Sunday, he said independent experts will also be appointed to ensure the department’s standardisation process is fair to all students.He confirmed that guidelines for teachers are due to issue later this week and hoped Leaving Cert students will have their results in mid-August, or as “close to the traditional date as possible”.Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":null,"title":"confronting","story":"A news podcast from The  that covers Ireland\u0027s response to the Coronavirus outbreak.

Photograph: Getty ImagesOpticians will be unable to carry out full eye tests during a single appointment when they reopen on Monday, forcing patients to pay higher fees for routine care. The Association of Optometrists Ireland (AOI) is also worried about an increase in common conditions which can cause blindness because people are afraid to visit opticians even as the coronavirus lockdown restrictions are eased. Mark Daly, a former president of the association who runs practices in Dublin’s Drumcondra and Sandymount, said health guidance for their reopening is “very restrictive”. “We’re going to find a lot of the regular examinations we do, we can’t do within the 15 minutes we’re allowed to stay within close proximity to the patient,” he said. “We are going to have to bring them back to do a second appointment to finish certain things off. There are a number of examinations we could do within the 15 minutes, but in most cases we probably won’t be able to.”The AOI confirmed this would mean extra fees, although it suggested these would be at a “reduced rate”. Medical card holders will be spared the additional costs. Before the pandemic, full eye tests would typically take between 40 and 45 minutes. Because of social distancing and extra hygiene precautions, opticians expect they will now take about an hour. Under the new regime, it is expected eye patients will will be interviewed for about 15 minutes by telephone before making a timed appointment to visit the optician in person. More triage – socially distanced – will be carried out in the practice before basic tests can begin. Crucial devicesMeasures to stem the spread of the coronavirus also effectively bar opticians from using some crucial devices for tests. Many who used non-contact tonometers – which measure the internal pressure of the eye – will no longer be able to do so, because the pump of air from the machine causes particles to “fly all over the place”, said Mr Daly. “If we can’t use that, we can’t check the pressure in the eye and pressure in the eye is very important for picking up things like glaucoma,” he said. Glaucoma can lead to blindness if not diagnosed and treated early. Opticians have also been ordered not to carry out ophthalmoscopy procedures, a routine part of eye examination involving the use of a special torch to look inside the eye. One alternative will be the use of digital photography to forensically examine the eye. Furthermore, Mr Daly said he was concerned about late diagnosis of conditions – “which could get beyond control by the time they do come to us” – as he expects some people will stay away from eye tests over fears of contracting Covid-19. BlindnessMacular degeneration ( a degeneration of the back of the eye), glaucoma and cataracts can all can cause blindness if not detected and treated in time. “I would be worried there will be an increase in the number of these people,” Mr Daly said. “I’d be afraid of people who will have sight-threatening conditions, that we could sort for them, that they wouldn’t come in.” Sean McGrave, chief executive of the IOA, said he expects the “vast majority” of Ireland’s more than 350 opticians to reopen on Monday, but that some may stay shut over health concerns, lack of childcare or where part-time staff are better off on the emergency pandemic welfare payments. Opticians “have been hurting” for the past eight weeks as they had “no income whatsoever” and were forced to pay out substantial sums for personal protective equipment, perspex screens, signage and other safety measures. On the increased fees for patients forced to attend a second appointment, he said: “There will be some cases where we will have to get patients back in to complete tests. It wouldn’t be a full fee – it will be a reduced rate.”Everything you need to know about the Covid-19 outbreak"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4256074.1589781380!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"survey finds quarter of adults drinking more during pandemic","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tOne in four Irish adults are drinking more since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced, a survey from alcohol industry-funded charity Drinkaware has found. Photograph: Jamie GrilliStockOne in four Irish adults are drinking more since Covid-19 restrictions were introduced, a survey from alcohol industry-funded charity Drinkaware has found.The survey of more than 1,000 adults, which focused on the 30-day period since April 24th, found 52 per cent of adults are now drinking alcohol on a weekly basis compared to 44 per cent of adults surveyed last year.The frequency of consumption among those who drink has also increased. The study found 14 per cent of adults reported drinking four or more times each week in the past 30 days, with a further 24 per cent consuming alcohol between two and three times a week. While a quarter of adults reported drinking more, an equal share of respondents reported a decline in alcohol consumption since the introduction of Covid-19 restrictions. Almost one-third said they had made “positive changes” to cut down or cut out alcohol over the past month.ReasonThe most cited reason for drinking during this time was “to help relax and unwind”, cited by 88 per cent of respondents. Almost half (47 per cent) said tensions in their household had increased in the past 30 days. While one in five said they had noticed an increase in consumption among other adults in their household. Drinkaware chief executive Sheena Horgan said the survey, conducted by Behaviour \u0026amp Attitudes, showed how the “new norm” is changing Irish drinking habits. “ For some it’s a time to reflect and to change their alcohol consumption. For others alcohol is a coping and stress relief at a difficult time. The use of alcohol to relax or unwind is not new but it is concerning, and at 88 per cent almost universal,” she said.“As we enter the first phase of easing restrictions, we need to renew our efforts to explore alternative and healthier coping strategies that don’t involve consistent and potentially harmful drinking.”The Drinkaware website had almost 90,000 visits in April."},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"More than half now drink on a weekly basis saying it helps them to \u0026lsquorelax and unwind\u0026rsquoVaradkar had objected to Martin over TDs\u0027 attacks over election contingency plansMinister also dismisses idea of non-jury courts for ordinary crimes during pandemicEfforts to make dog walkers obey rules to safeguard birds in nature reserve \u0026lsquofutile\u0026rsquoOfficial guidance for schools over use of calculated grades to issue this weekAs certain categories of shop reopen on Monday, retailers focus on safety measuresHarris urges \u0026lsquocollective cop-on\u0026rsquo so that easing of restrictions does not reverse progressFears independent investigation could jeopardise pending criminal cases\u0026lsquoI know it\u0026rsquos an awful situation worldwide but treatment can\u0026rsquot stop or be withheld\u0026rsquoReopening restrictions on Monday could result in extra fees, but will be at a reduced rateConsultants will also face \u0026lsquooperational costs\u0026rsquo bill for seeing private patients at the hospitalGarda appeal for witnesses to incident which took place at 7. 15pm on the M1 northboundThe total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the State now stands at 24,112Section of the route has been closed to vehicles to aid social distancing amid Covid-19Nurseries, growers, centre owners count the cost of lockdown restrictions as easing beginsNurseries, growers, centre owners count the cost of lockdown restrictions as easing beginsThirteen garda\u0026iacute died by suicide in last three years 16,116 days lost due to mental illnessDepartment of Social Protection has withheld the \u0026euro350 payment to 46,000 peopleStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255785.1589746425!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"fg accuses ff of damaging government formation talks","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tFianna Fáil leader Micheál Martin and Taoiseach Leo  Varadkar:  the pair  were in contact on Saturday nightSenior Fine Gael figures are now suggesting that Mr Martin should publicly disassociate himself from comments made by party TDs Barry Cowen and Thomas Byrne over government election contingency plansrevealed in The  on Saturday.Mr Varadkar and Mr Martin were in contact on Saturday night, and some in Fine Gael suggested that Mr Martin had time to take action prior to the Fine Gael statement being released on Sunday. Talks are continuing between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Greens on government formation, and the three party leaders will meet today (Monday). Mr Martin requested the meeting to discuss the slow pace of talks and leaks to the media.The Government says the election contingency plan being drawn up – including spreading voting over a number of days, giving “cocooners” a postal vote, and allowing polling in nursing homes – will also apply to potential referendums and byelections. Fianna Fáil was unaware of the plans, and party sources insisted it should have been told.Mr Cowen claimed Fine Gael was acting in “bad faith”, and suggested it was “putting party before country”. Mr Byrne, the Fianna Fáil education spokesman, claimed it was “utterly sick” to link nursing homes to suggestions of an election. A senior Fine Gael source said: “If we are in government in a few weeks’ time and Barry Cowen accuses FG of being unpatriotic, either he’ll be resigning or all FG ministers will be. “And if Thomas Byrne is a junior minister and attacks a Fine Gael colleague as being ‘sick’, a withdrawal and apology will be expected.”A Fianna Fáil source said confidence and supply was over, and that Mr Martin’s party was now in opposition. “We have to hold them to account,” the source said. It was also suggested by numerous Fianna Fáil sources that Mr Byrne was being targeted because he had highlighted difficulties with the Leaving Cert in recent weeks. Doing their job After Simon Coveney and Dara Calleary, the two deputy leaders of the parties, attempted to calm the issue, Fine Gael released a statement on Sunday, claiming officials were only doing their job, and that the attacks by Mr Cowen and Mr Byrne were “unwarranted” and “damaged” the talks process. The statement also singled out Mr Cowen on comments he made recently suggesting a referendum on land prices would be held by a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael government, suggesting he “had recently claimed falsely that both parties had agreed to hold a referendum within weeks of forming a government, presumably during a pandemic”.There was concern on Sunday night across Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael about the lack of trust between the two traditional rivals.The best news and analysis from the campaign trailStay on top of the latest news with our daily newsletters each morning, lunchtime and evening"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.4255638.1589748347!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"nerves and excitement ahead of first wave of shop reopenings","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tStaff at Woodies in Carrickmines demonstrate some of the measures being prepared for the shop’s reopening on Monday. Photograph: Laura HuttonNever have so many waited so long for so few shops to open. While the green light for handpicked retailers to resume trading this morning will be met with relief by many and viewed as a tangible sign that the end of the beginning phase of the coronavirus crisis is within sight, there will be anxiety too.A hardware shop or optician or bicycle shop opening on a Monday morning would not normally be greeted with excitement or require barriers, but it is a measure of how much our world has changed that tentative steps towards reopening Ireland have been met with palpable enthusiasm.David Fitzsimons, chief executive of Retail Excellence, says today marks “the first steps on the road to recovery” and said retailers were “ingenious and resourceful” and had “invested great effort in planning for today to ensure they open safely for their customers and colleagues”.He also stresses “the importance of our local independent stores” and encouraged consumers to use them “as we don’t want to lose them”.One such retailer is Rachel Doyle, of the Arboretum Garden Heaven in Carlow and Kilquade, Co Wicklow. She says the company has “put a huge effort in to be ready” and bemoans a lost season of planting.Many retailers have put in similar efforts, and the manner in which most have announced their return has been striking. Gone are the bold and brash promises of sales and special offers that would normally follow even the briefest of breaks from business-as-usual instead retailers allowed to reopen have been boasting about the measures they will take to ensure customers can keep their distance from one another and stay safe.Declan Ronayne, chief executive of Woodies, was not talking deals and discounts when he spoke on radio late last week, stressing that his company’s “primary focus when we reopen ... will be managing queues of people ... We have a steely determination to keep everyone as safe as we can.”Ronayne said he was both nervous and excited to reopen after the seven-week closure, the longest Woodies has experienced since it opened its doors in the 1990s.Barriers have been installed outside many of the larger DIY shops across the country to facilitate safer queuing, and staff will be policing the lines.Child banEven before Woodies restarted trading it was making headlines after announcing on Twitter that under-16s would not be allowed into the shops due to social-distancing concerns.It later reversed the decision and said under-16s were welcome if accompanied by an adult.“However, where possible, we would still encourage customers to shop on their own. We value all of our customers and do not want anyone to feel excluded and look forward to a day when family groups can again shop together.”The move initially dismayed many solo parents of young children who risked being left behind as they could scarcely leave their children at home or with friends and family as they shop.The lead-up to the tentative beginning of the end of the lockdown has seen missteps and there has been a degree of confusion and disappointment for some retailers left behind in the first wave.Ikea announced last week it would be back in business today. Then, at the last minute, homeware shops were struck off the opening list, leaving the flatpack kings – and other shops that had been dusting off their soft furnishings – deflated.Minister for Health Simon Harris was unapologetic, saying “now is not the time to decide I’m going to dicky up the house”.The lifting of restrictions has been carefully managed and tweaked over fears that people will “descend on hardware stores and garden centres in large numbers”, which could result in a rise in rates of infection.Harris has warned consumers they are facing the “biggest national test so far” and pointed out that “we have to find a way to live with this virus. There is no vaccine, there is no effective treatment.

We\u0027ll have some churches doing things differently.”In Northern Ireland, ministers are due to discuss allowing “drive through” services as part of a gradual relaxing of restrictions.The proposals, which have yet to receive final approval, were published by the Northern Ireland Executive last week.Church officials have welcomed the plans with arrangements under way on how to transform facilities.Billy Jones, pastor of the Dunseverick Baptist Church, told The : “Hopefully from next Sunday, I will be leading the sermon from a lorry which has a platform attached with a sound system. People can tune in to a specific radio frequency from their vehicles too if they want.”“It will mean the local community can come together with a desire to encounter god and can enjoy the fellowship by expressing faith - even if it is from their cars.”Churches in England have said they are monitoring the situation and will consider adopting similar “drive through” services if the measures prove successful.Kevin Felix-Hollington, pastor at Halling Baptist Church, in Kent, said:  “We could convert our car park, block the entrance and space chairs out at a two metre distance so worshippers would be able to follow the rules and listen to a sermon. I think this could happen in the near future.”“We have even considered the possibility of having open air meetings, where people could come in clusters and sit down on the grass at the local park to listen to a pastor pray and sign.”“At the moment we are doing our services on Zoom, which involves bible reading and sing-a-longs, with a discussion at the end to follow up on the message.”The Church of England said it was unable to comment, while the Church of Scotland ruled out allowing “drive through” services in its churches.Other churches have adopted imaginative measures to spread their message to worshippers at home.St John the Baptist Church, in Leicester, has turned to Minecraft to teach youngsters about Christianity during the lockdown.The church has been digitally recreated on a server so that the youth club can play Bible themed games online with each other every Wednesday.On Minecraft, instead of a field and houses surrounding the church as they do in real life, there is a sea with the whale from the story of Jonah to explore, for example.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"felicien kabuga captured africas wanted mastermind behind rwandan","story":"French police seized the man regarded as the intellectual and financial mastermind behind the Rwandan genocide on Saturday, ending a transcontinental 26-year manhunt for “the Eichmann of Africa”.Félicien Kabuga, Africa’s most wanted fugitive, was arrested in the northern outskirts of Paris after a dawn raid on his flat in the commune of Asnières-sur-Seine. Officers said the 84 year-old had been living there under an assumed identity.French authorities released few details about the operation, beyond hailing the capture of “one of the world’s most wanted fugitives”. It is believed that a series of simultaneous raids were carried out on addresses across France, some linked to Kabuga’s children, to ensure that he did not escape.Those familiar with the investigation suggested that the operation, at least in terms of the painstaking intelligence work involved, had echoes of the Mossad mission to seize the Nazi war criminal Adolph Eichmann from Buenos Aires in 1960.The British security services played an “essential” role in the operation that led to Kabuga’s capture, according to United Nations prosecutors. So, too, did investigators in the United States, which has long had a $5 million (£4.1m) bounty on his head, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria, Luxembourg and Switzerland.Kabuga will not be sedated and spirited away to Rwanda in the way Eichmann was smuggled into Israel, where he was tried and hanged for his role as a primary architect of the Final Solution.Instead he will eventually be handed over to a United Nations tribunal to answer longstanding charges of crimes against humanity.Even so there will be considerable relief in Rwanda, where 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus were butchered over a 100-day period in 1994 — a massacre carried out by a cabal of Hutu extremists with Kabuga, one of the country’s richest men, allegedly at its core.Without the fortune he acquired through his tea and coffee estates, the genocide might never happened have happened. In 1992, Kabuga ploughed money into Radio Television Libres Milles Collines (RTLM), a radio station that steadily dripped hatred towards the country’s Tutsi minority.The following year, he allegedly began to import into the country hundreds of thousands of machetes, which were doled out to the Interahamwe, an extremist Hutu militia accused of overseeing much of the slaughter.As the genocide began, Interahamwe militiamen, wearing uniforms reportedly provided by Kabuga, were transported from killing site to killing site in his organisation’s vehicles, investigators say.Meanwhile, Radio Milles Collines provided the soundtrack of the genocide, urging Hutus to hunt down and kill the Tutsi “inyenzi”, or cockroaches. “The graves are only half full,” the station’s presenters would warn. “We must complete the task.”After the genocide, which ended when Tutsi rebels led by Paul Kagame, now Rwanda’s president, swept into the capital Kigali, Kabuga vanished.After a quarter of a century of leads that grew ever colder, many had given up hope of bringing him to justice.The International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, which tried 76 key genocide suspects, ceased operations on New Year’s Eve 2015 without ever laying its hands on the suspect many prosecutors most wanted to put in the dock.Instead, Kabuga will now be tried by the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals, an obscure body created to mop up the unfinished business left behind by the war crimes tribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.For the body’s chief prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, the capture of Kabuga is a triumph as unalloyed as it is unexpected.“The arrest of Félicien Kabuga today is a reminder that those responsible for genocide can be brought to account, even twenty-six years after their crimes,” he said. “This arrest demonstrates the impressive results that can be achieved through international law enforcement and judicial cooperation.” But amid the relief in Rwanda there will also be anger that it has taken so long to hunt Kabuga down. According to UN officials, he had lived in Switzerland, Germany, Belgium, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya during his years on the run. His move to France is thought to have happened in the last three years.How one of the world’s most wanted men managed to cross international borders with such ease remains an unanswered question. But money and connections almost certainly had something to do with it.The bulk of Kabuga’s years as a fugitive are thought to have been spent in Kenya. Here he is said to have enjoyed the protection of officials close to Daniel arap Moi, the former Kenyan president, who died in February.Moi was a close friend of Juvenal Habyarimana, the Hutu president whose killing on 6th April 1994 triggered the long-planned genocide. Two of Kabuga’s daughters married President Habyarimana’s sons, giving the tycoon close access to the Kenyan leader.According to a Kenyan government source, the FBI came close to arresting Kabuga shortly after Moi retired in 2002 when a local journalist, William Gichuki, walked into the US embassy in Nairobi and said he knew where the Rwandan was hiding.But before the FBI could act, Gichuki was murdered. Whether Kenyan intelligence had tipped Kabuga off is unclear. The US embassy never acknowledged its connection to Gichuki but it did release a pointed statement after Kenyan police showed reluctance to investigate his murder.Kenya’s apparent refusal to hand over Kabuga strained relations with the United States. In 2009, Barack Obama sent Stephen Rapp, his adviser on war crimes, to Kenya to deliver a public and pointed message to Moi’s successor, Mwai Kibaki. The US, Mr Rapp said, “had credible information on the fugitive’s location and the powerful people protecting him.”But the Kenyan government would not budge. In late 2017, a prominent human rights activist, Ken Wafula, told The Daily  that Kabuga had been tracked down to the Kenyan town of Eldoret by two men, the editor of a local newspaper and a whistleblower who had previously worked as an agent for the International Criminal Court.Both men were murdered. Wafula said he had approached the US embassy to share the fugitive’s whereabouts but was told that nothing could be done “because they didn’t trust the Kenyans”.“They were afraid I would be killed.”There is no way of corroborating Wafula’s account. Four months after speaking to The , he died from a short illness. Although there is no suggestion of foul play, it was common knowledge in Kenya not to look too closely into Kabuga’s whereabouts.“Anyone who looked too closely, anyone who got a tip and tried to act on it tended not to live too long,” a Kenyan senator said. “He had powerful connections and deep pockets.”More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"no one immune economic storm come1","story":"I blame this blasted weather. It lulls us into thinking that we are passing through a sunlit dreamtime, a holiday from reality after which things will get back to normal. But things won’t get back to normal. Our problems are only just starting.Even if, either because we find a cure or many more of us turn out to be immune than was realised, we are able to lift the restrictions speedily, the damage has been done.Our economy is in collapse. We have taken on debt at a rate not seen since 1945. A new generation is about to learn what mass unemployment feels like. How, in the circumstances, can we be so relaxed about extending the closures? When every day in lockdown adds billions to our debt, and months, even years, to the eventual recovery, how can so many of us think it reasonable to leave things as they are “until we can be absolutely sure”?Why, when other European countries are firing up their economies, do we remain the most timorous of all the electorates polled?The answer, I think, can be found in a YouGov survey last week which asked people whether the lockdown was having a positive or a negative effect on various aspects of their lives.Most of the results were unsurprising: people thought that the impact on their family relationships was positive, the impact on their social lives negative, the impact on their diet and exercise neutral. But there was one especially telling response.Asked about their personal income, only 26 per cent of respondents felt the lockdown had made them worse off (with 21 per cent saying the effect was positive and 50 per cent saying it was neutral).Think about those figures for a moment. Closing down most economic activity is bound to make almost everyone poorer. That should be an obvious, indeed indisputable, statement.Look around you. Businesses are already going under, two million more people have been driven on to benefits, and the sums we are borrowing, hour by hour, will condemn us to decades of tax rises, inflation or both – which will in turn hit our productivity.No one is immune. If you’re a pensioner, your pension will lose its value. If you’re a public sector worker, you’ll find that, as its tax take evaporates, the Government can’t afford to pay you.If you have savings, they will be inflated away. If you’re a student, you’ll be working off these debts for the rest of your life.​Britain, as a whole, is perhaps 25 per cent poorer. Yet, so far, few of us are feeling it. That 26 per cent figure is a reminder that our economy is an inverted pyramid resting on a relatively small number of profitable enterprises. The rest of the population – whether state employees on full pay or furloughed workers who, without travel or childcare costs, are no worse off – naturally find it easier to call for caution.“We need to put lives before the economy,” say the majority – as though the economy were some abstraction removed from human endeavour.Perhaps we can’t help thinking this way. We are flesh-and-blood creatures. We can picture getting sick much more easily than we can picture a fall in GDP.Only when that fall hits us directly, leaving us unable to afford the things we used to buy, will we understand that “the economy” is what we call the transactions people make to improve their lives.And, even then, we may struggle to link our misfortune to the closures we have spent the past two months demanding.Weather conditions along the lines of King Lear act three, scene two would be more appropriate. They might just give us a premonition of what is heading our way.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"royal navy investigating leak aboard 3bn aircraft carrier hms","story":"The Royal Navy has launched an investigation following a leak aboard HMS Prince of Wales, its £3 billion aircraft carrier, while it was docked at a naval base.Video published on Facebook showed water pouring through the ceiling into an accommodation area of the 65,000-tonne warship. The leak is understood to have taken place on Friday while the £3bn warship was at Portsmouth Naval Base.A Royal Navy spokesman said: Following a minor issue with an internal system on HMS Prince of Wales, the ship\u0027s company were required to remove a small volume of water from the ship.An investigation into the cause is now under way but this will not affect the ship\u0027s programme.It is understood that the pipe was isolated quickly and the water was mopped up by the crew.The leak comes after sister ship HMS Queen Elizabeth had to cut short sea trials last July after a seal burst causing a large quantity of water to pour from a pipe and to flood through several decks.Following the incident, the ship\u0027s then commanding officer Captain Steve Moorhouse said it was safe and that in his experience leaks were a weekly problem for warships.HMS Prince of Wales has recently been testing its safety systems including the deployment of life rafts and emergency chutes while the Queen Elizabeth set sail from anchor off Gosport, Hampshire, on Friday to carry out sea trials off the south coast.The older of the two carriers had to delay its departure from Portsmouth last month to enable its 700-strong crew to be tested for Covid-19 of which two tested positive and were removed from the ship.The rest of the ship underwent a period of quarantine at sea prior to commencing the training exercises.Last month it was reported how residents had complained how noise and pollution from HMS Prince of Wales had kept them awake at night. Neighbours in Gosport, Hants, claimed the hum of the generators from warship was disturbing the neighbourhood.Resident Neil Sutton, 59, told the Portsmouth News: No resident in this long stretch of waterfront can escape the sound of this ship, particularly at night time.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"r rate reliable might reopening schools impact","story":"The Government is basing its lockdown release strategy on the reproduction, or ‘R’ rate, and has warned that if it goes above one, restrictions will remain in place.But how is it calculated? Is it reliable? And will schools reopening have a significant impact?The reproduction, or ‘R’ rate, is the number of people that a single infected person will go on to infect.Anything above one, means that each person will be passing the virus on to more than one person allowing the epidemic to grow exponentially. For example an ‘R’ rate of 1.5 would mean every 10 people who became infected, would infect 15 more people. Those 15, would, in turn, infect 22.5 people who would then pass the disease on to 33.7. The opposite is true if the ‘R’ rate is below one. The Government announced last week that it is somewhere between 0.7 and 1. Scientists cannot be completely accurate because different models are used to come up with the figures and they do not often agree.If it is at the lower end of the estimate — 0.7 — then every 10 people will infect seven others. Those seven will infect 3.5, and those 3.5 will infect 1.75. If the ‘R’ rate is at the higher end of one, then the disease has plateaued, so 10 people would infect 10 others, and the epidemic would neither increase nor decline.The ‘R’ rate is calculated by The Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Modelling (SPI-M), a sub-group of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).However it is only an estimation and it is usually out of date because it relies on testing, admissions and death data. So there will always be a 14 to 21 day lag because people are infected weeks before they enter hospital, or die. Contact pattern surveys are also used to calculate how much people move around but these also tend to have a lag of around a week and are open to bias because they rely on self-reported behaviour. Household longitudinal surveys — which sample the same people repeatedly — allow a direct estimate of the infection rates, but these have only recently started by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and no long-term data is currently available.Therefore the current ‘R’ rate reflects the situation in Britain at the end of April. It is also crucial to look at the ‘R’ value alongside the actual number of people infected. For example, although the countrywide ‘R’ rate is between 0.7 and 1, Public Health England (PHE) modelling suggests that in London it could be as low as 0.4, with daily infections down to fewer than 24 a day, and critically, halving every 3.5 days.In London’s case, the virus could potentially stop spreading within the capital by the end of May.In contrast, the same study estimated that thousands of people are still being infected in the North East each day, where the ‘R’ rate could be at 0.8, and halving at a far slower rate, meaning that it will take longer to eliminate the disease in that area.The other problem is that the ‘R’ rate can vary not just regionally, but also by subsections of the population. Government scientists now believe that the epidemic is largely confined to care homes and hospitals and there is very little community transmission at all.“Nobody catches it by passing someone on the street,” said one Government expert. “That isn’t how you get it. This is now epidemic of care homes and hospitals.” There are fears that reopening schools will have a big impact on transmissions, potentially sending the ‘R’ rate above one again, but there is little evidence to show that will happen.Research published in April, by University College London (UCL), suggested that schools only play a small role in transmission, perhaps accounting for two to four per cent of deaths and 10 per cent of the ‘R’-rate. Those estimates were based on the entire school population without extra measures, such as social distancing, so the impact is likely to be even smaller with class sizes restricted to 15 and communal tables replaced by traditional single desks.There is also no evidence that those schools which stayed open for the children of key workers have seen extra infections in their communities.The Chief Scientist of the World Health Organisation (WHO) Dr Soumya Swaminathan also said she did not think reopening schools would pose a threat of increased infections.Speaking on the BBC’s Andrew Marr Show Dr Swaminathan, who specialises in paediatrics, said: “Children don’t seem to be getting seriously ill from this infection.“We do know that children are capable of getting the infection, but there’s less data on how effectively they are able to spread it to others. What we have seen in countries where schools have remained open is that there have not been big outbreaks in schools.“Where there have been it has been associated with events where a lot of people gather, not in regular classrooms and it’s often been associated with an adult, who has the infection and who has spread it. The risks to children are extremely low.”Schools were closed in Britain on March 20 and a report published by Imperial College on March 30 suggested that might have taken the ‘R’ rate down from three to just above two.However only nursery, Year 1 and Year 6 are going back to begin with which means the impact is likely to be far less.Prof Matt Keeling, Professor of Populations and Disease, at the University of Warwick, said: “Any form of additional mixing will inevitably lead to an increase in ‘R’, and hence more cases — however, all the current evidence suggests that children are not suffering substantially from this pandemic.  “This could be because they are less susceptible or because they show fewer symptoms when infected, there is no firm scientific data to determine which of these is true.  This means that opening some school classes is unlikely to push ‘R’ above one a conclusion supported by our mathematical modelling studies.“The idea of only half the children being in school should mean that classes can be half the size, which will help with social distancing, further preventing a substantial rise in ‘R’.”Some experts believe the ‘R’ rate should not be used at all to determine policy.Prof Mark Woolhouse, Professor of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, University of Edinburgh, who also sits on Sage, said: “The ‘R’ rate shouldn’t be a policy objective. It’s not the direct measure of the public health burden, it’s not a direct measure of capacity. It restricts your options very substantially.“The R being below one for the whole country is meaningless when in fact when it can be different in different portions of the population,“Particularly now we have a situation where it’s almost certainly below 1 for the whole country, but is around 1 or higher in care homes. Now if you think about it that’s the wrong way round.“The public health implications of ‘R’ greater than one are very different in hospitals than in the general population and the elderly and specific regions and having this single number directs policies.”Prof Woolhouse said that the regional lifting of lockdown had been discussed by those advising the Government.“It’s a discussion point, he said. “As I understand they prefer to move forward in the UK as one but the devolved administrations are doing things independently so there is an argument.“There may be epidemiological circumstances where it would be justified to relax the region of the UK if the R value was lower.”A Government source said: “We have always been clear that loosening depends on ‘R’ being below 1. “Without that, we risk seeing the kind of exponential growth we faced at the height of the pandemic. R must be below 1 for further opening up of society.”Prof Saul Faust, Professor of Paediatric Immunology \u0026amp Infectious Diseases, University of Southampton, said: “Society has to reopen, children need to return to school as there are negatives for many of having to stay at home and we need to be able study transmission dynamics in all ages to help us learn how to manage this virus.” More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"king selfies matteo salvini finds sidelined italys coronavirus","story":"His dominance of the Italian Right once seemed unassailable, but Matteo Salvini’s man-of-the-people reputation is now missing one key element – the people.Since life in Italy was brought to a shuddering halt by the coronavirus pandemic, the leader of the hard-Right League party, who was deputy prime minister and interior minister until last summer, has taken a hammering in the polls.In January, before the health emergency exploded, his approval rating was 42 per cent but it has now slumped to 31 per cent.The proportion of Italians who say they would vote for the League has declined from 35 per cent last summer to 25 per cent now, according to an Ipsos poll.Mr Salvini thrived on personal contact – staging rallies in piazzas across the country, shaking hands with ordinary Italians and going on walkabouts around city railway stations, where he would rail against crime and illegal immigrants.After rallies he would tirelessly pose with supporters for selfies, with the photo parade often lasting much longer than the speech itself.Each selfie would then be shared on social media with up to 20 other people, according to League strategists. Mr Salvini excelled at the common touch but with Italy under lockdown since early March, all that has dried up.“Every time someone took a selfie with Salvini, it was shared repeatedly,” said Erik Jones, professor of European Studies at Johns Hopkins University in Bologna.“Since he’s not doing that anymore, he’s become more remote from people. He is not really central in the conversation.”There are other factors that explain the loss of traction.His adoring fans may nickname him Il Capitano, but Mr Salvini hardly projected a commanding presence when the health crisis struck, one day calling for the whole country to be shut down, the next for it to be reopened.“He didn’t handle it well – he contradicted himself. As interior minister he had been coherent, determined, but he compromised that tough guy image,” said Roberto D’Alimonte, a professor of politics from Luiss University in Rome.Instead, he has been eclipsed by League politicians who govern some of Italy’s 20 regions – above all by Luca Zaia, the governor of the Veneto, which includes Venice.Dubbed \u0027The Doge\u0027, in tribute to the ermine-clad elite who ruled Venice as an independent republic for 1,000 years, Mr Zaia has won praise for his sober handling of the crisis.Early on in the emergency, he instituted a testing and tracing programme that helped reduce the severity of the outbreak.Veneto has had 1,700 deaths - far fewer deaths than neighbouring Lombardy, which now accounts for around half of Italy’s 31,000 coronavirus fatalities.Mr Zaia’s star has risen so dramatically that there has been speculation in the Italian press that he could one day try to unseat Mr Salvini as leader of the League, putting himself in pole position to one day become prime minister.Guido Dussin, a former League MP, is the mayor of San Vendemiano, the town where Mr Zaia lives.He gives credit to Mr Salvini for building up the League and winning votes in the south for a party that was traditionally associated with the north. “But at this point there’s the need for a more moderate face,” he said.Massimo Cacciari, a former mayor of Venice and a philosopher, said he could envisage Mr Zaia playing a prominent role in an eventual government of national unity.That might be formed in the autumn, “when there will be at least 1.5 million unemployed and millions of newly poor people,” as a result of the crisis, he said.But other allies of \u0027Il Doge\u0027 deny there is a plan to usurp Mr Salvini. They say Mr Zaia, who served as agriculture minister in a Silvio Berlusconi government a decade ago, is focused on winning another term as governor of Veneto, with elections to be held later this year.“Zaia has no intention of being the head of the League. He will be re-elected in Veneto and that is the only thing that interests him,” said Roberto Maroni, a League heavyweight and a former minister.Mr Salvini has also lost ground because the coronavirus emergency has sucked the oxygen out of one of his main issues – migration.“Covid has replaced it as the salient issue in Italy,” said Prof D’Alimonte. “It was his baby. He used it very, very effectively.”There is another key Salvini issue that no longer resonates as much as it did – bashing the EU.After Brussels was slow to come to Italy’s aid when the crisis hit in late February, the view of many Italians soured, not just those who support the League.“There is some jaw-dropping polling about how disappointed Italians are in Europe,” said Prof Jones in Bologna. “Being anti-Europe has become mainstream in Italy. It is no longer a distinguishing characteristic for Salvini. He needs to find another card to play.”Mr Salvini has brushed off suggestions that the governor of Veneto has his sights set on becoming prime minister. “Let’s let the Italians decide. Sooner or later they will be able to return to the polls, given that the current government argues all day long,” he said last week.But with ‘The Doge’ soaring in popularity, Mr Salvini must be casting nervous glances over his shoulder.“People who know Zaia tell me they don’t see him challenging Salvini for the party leadership anytime soon,” said Prof D’Alimonte.More from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"pictures day 18th may 2020","story":"A couple take no chances, with a plastic wind breaker surrounding their seating area, as they enjoy the freedom of going out to Avon Beach at Mudeford in Southwest England for the first weekend since lockdown conditions were changedJeff Gilbert for the Coronavirus latest news: Britain could have a vaccine for  30 million by autumnWhat are the five levels of Covid-19 alert?Comment: Lockdown has given Britons a taste for Fifties home blissRisk of coronavirus spreading in schools is \u0026#39extremely low\u0026#39 study finds Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warns China over interference with US journalists in Hong KongKing of selfies Matteo Salvini finds himself sidelined by Italy\u0026#39s coronavirus crisisFears of dirty recovery as China air pollution shoots upComment: Identity politics still rages in the age of CovidArmy of transport police to be deployed amid fears of commuter \u0026#39chaos\u0026#39Murder probe after woman dies in suspected shooting in BlackburnExclusive: Second more deadly wave of coronavirus \u0026#39to hit Europe this winter\u0026#39Donald Trump’s firing of State Department inspector general could be \u0026#39unlawful\u0026#39, says Nancy PelosiHottest day of the year so far forecast for UKOne person dead after Canadian acrobatic jet crashes and sets house on fire £84m of funding to accelerate UK vaccine trials revealed as Britain reports lowest daily deaths since MarchOne in six doctors unable to access PPE within last fortnight, survey revealsWealthy children will be seven days ahead from home schooling by June, report warnsHundreds of churches across the UK est from fossil fuelsBack to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":null,"title":"second wave winter coronavirus europe uk","story":"European countries should brace themselves for a deadly second wave of coronavirus infections because the pandemic is not over, the World Health Organisation’s top official in Europe has said. In an exclusive interview with The , Dr Hans Kluge, director for the WHO European region, delivered a stark warning to countries beginning to ease their lockdown restrictions, saying that now is the time for preparation, not celebration.Dr Kluge stressed that, as the number of cases of Covid-19 in countries such as the UK, France and Italy was beginning to fall, it did not mean the pandemic was coming to an end. The epicentre of the European outbreak is now in the east, with the number of cases rising in Russia, Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan, he warned. Countries should use this time wisely and start to strengthen public health systems as well as building capacity in hospitals, primary care and intensive care units, he said. Singapore and Japan understood early on that this is not a time for celebration, it\u0027s a time for preparation. That\u0027s what Scandinavian countries are doing – they don\u0027t exclude a second wave, but they hope it will be localised and they can jump on it quickly,” said Dr Kluge.He also warned that a second wave could coincide with an outbreak of other infectious diseases.“I’m very concerned about a double wave – in the fall, we could have a second wave of Covid and another one of seasonal flu or measles. Two years ago we had 500,000 children who didn\u0027t have their first shot of the measles vaccine, he said. Many experts, including England\u0027s chief medical officer, Professor Chris Whitty, have warned that a second wave of the pandemic could be even deadlier than the first, pointing to the 1918-20 Spanish flu pandemic as evidence. When the Spanish flu first emerged in March 1918, it had the hallmarks of the typical seasonal illness – but it then came back in an even more virulent and deadly form in the autumn, eventually killing an estimated 50 million people.Troop movements at the end of the First World War are thought to have accelerated the spread of the disease, which also had a third and fourth wave although these were not as devastating.We know from history that in pandemics the countries that have not been hit early on can be hit in a second wave, said Dr Kluge. What are we going to see in Africa and Eastern Europe? They\u0027re behind the curve – some countries are saying: \u0027We\u0027re not like Italy\u0027 and then, two weeks later, boom! They can unfortunately get hit by a second wave, so we have to be very very careful.In the last couple of weeks, many European countries have started unlocking their shuttered economies and allowing some resumption of normal life.Earlier this month, the Spanish population was allowed to exercise outside for the first time in seven weeks, and restaurants in some areas of Germany have reopened. In France, people will no longer need travel permits to explain why they have left home.But in the absence of an effective treatment for the virus, or a vaccine, Dr Kluge said any lockdown had to be accompanied by rigorous public health measures including comprehensive contact tracing and testing. A pilot NHS contact tracing app was launched on the Isle of Wight last week, with the Government saying it would be rolled out to the rest of the country by the end of the month if it proves successful.The number of tests being carried out has been growing slowly but is still not at the 100,000-a day-level promised by Matt Hancock, the Health Secretary. Analysis by the  shows that around 80,000 tests a day are being carried out. Dr Kluge said the lack of a treatment or vaccine meant any easing of lockdown restrictions had to be done gradually and carefully, adding: People think lockdown is finished. Nothing has changed. The full disease control package has to be in place. That\u0027s the key message. He said that he hoped the pandemic had shown that health should now be at the top of the political agenda.We always thought that health was the driver of economic prosperity, but it\u0027s worse – where there\u0027s no health, there’s no economy, he added. This is a lesson that cannot be forgotten. Public health deserves its place at the top of the agenda. And sometimes when a leader has suffered personally, it helps, he added.  Protect yourself and your family by learning more about Global Health SecurityMore from NewsMore from The Back to topSyndication and CommissioningTerms and ConditionsWe urge you to turn off your ad blocker for The  website so that you can continue to access our quality content in the future.Visit our adblocking instructions"},{"url":"url :  https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/06/03/16/gettyimages-691594048.jpg","title":"music industry royalties small bands income lockdown coronavirus weddings streaming revenues","story":"Subscribe nowLog in using your social network accountLog in directly with The IndependentKeep me logged inForgotten your password?Want an ad-free experience?Subscribe to Independent Premium.The legendary Captain Ska made just £20k from its top 10 hit ‘Liar Liar’.

Compared with children in the poorest fifth of families, those in the richest fifth are spending more than 75 minutes longer every day on work assigned by their school. “Even for those pupils returning to school on 1 June, over the 34 school days that closures will have been in place, this will translate to a week and a half of full-time school. Children in better-off families are also more than twice as likely to receive private tutoring, with around 12 per cent of these students being tutored for an hour or more each day.

Government has little evidence children less likely to spread virusWhile the government has offered to help bridge the access gap for some of the most disadvantaged by supplying laptops and internet access, concerns have been raised that the measure does not go far enough to ensure all children have access to education.Liberal Democrat education spokesperson Layla Moran – who has previously called for an army of former educators to be brought in to identify at risk and disadvantaged children for further support – said: “Too many children still do not have access to the internet and their own devices, and there is huge variation in practice. “To halt an ever growing disadvantage gap, the government should also provide all disadvantaged students with the tools they need and set a minimum requirement for online school provision.“We all want schools to reopen to more pupils, but it has to be safe for them first. We need to see the full scientific advice that the Government has based its strategy on, and to have a grown-up conversation in this country about the risks and rewards. “It must be safety first, and our primary goal has to be making sure the most disadvantaged kids are safe and able to learn.”Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

The comments came after a CNBC report that said multiple anonymous AI researchers said they saw Musk’s views on the technology as inappropriate.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesAn AI executive speaking to CNBC, who asked to remain anonymous because their company may work for one of Musk’s businesses, said that “A large proportion of the community think he’s a negative distraction.”He is sensationalist, he veers wildly between openly worrying about the downside risk of the technology and then hyping the AGI (artificial general intelligence) agenda. Whilst his very real accomplishments are acknowledged, his loose remarks lead to the general public having an unrealistic understanding of the state of AI maturity.”It’s time to draw the curtain on celebrity businessmen like Musk“AGI” stands for “artificial general intelligence,” which is the hypothetical benchmark whereby a machine can learn anything that a human being could. This is distinct from \u0027standard\u0027 artificial intelligence, which is when a machine is capable of carrying out a task like a human could, such as voice recognition in Siri or Alexa.Another specialised focused on speech recognition said that Musk is “not always looked upon favourably,” while an AI researcher at a UK university said that they “instinctively fall on dislike, because he makes up such nonsense.”“But then he delivers such extraordinary things. It always leaves me wondering, does he know what he’s doing? Is all the visionary stuff just a trick to get an innovative thing to market?” they continued.On Twitter, Pesenti said that many people in the AI community would be happy to criticise Musk publicly, stating that Musk “has no idea what he is talking about when he talks about AI. There is no such thing as AGI and we are nowhere near matching human intelligence.”While Facebook team declined to give an official comment, Pesenti said that it was his “personal opinion” but that others at the company – including Yann LeCun, a professor at New York University and a Chief AI Scientist at Facebook and Edward Grefenstette, a Facebook AI Research Scientist – agreed.LeCun quote-tweeted Musk’s disparaging comment, saying that Tesla’s engineers still needed access to Facebook’s PyTorch to develop their products. PyTorch is a free, open source machine learning library primarily developed by Facebok’s AI Research lab.The researchers, Tesla, and SpaceX were contacted by The Independent for comment.

It is my opinion that this is a feasible scenario.”Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesHis hopeful comments come days after a new study in the International Journal of Clinical Practice, using local authority “R” transmission rate data, estimated some 19 million people are “likely” to have already contracted the virus in the UK.Epidemiologists’ efforts to surmise and monitor the true spread of the virus have been hindered by the government’s decision to abandon widespread testing and contact-tracing in mid-March.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?While hopes for a return to what ministers have dubbed a “new normal” are pinned to the development of extensive testing and contact-tracing programmes, many have suggested that a full return to pre-outbreak freedoms will only be truly possible with the advent of a vaccine.Boris Johnson last weekend stressed that the “only feasible long-term solution lies with a vaccine or drug-based treatment”, which he said may be more than a year away, admitting: “In a worst-case scenario, we may never find a vaccine.”Recent polling by Opinium suggests the public are similarly pinning their hopes on a vaccine. Researchers found more than a quarter of UK respondents said they would not feel comfortable taking public transport until a vaccine is found. Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has previously said that the government is “throwing everything” at finding a vaccine, and two leading development projects at the University of Oxford and Imperial College London have received at least £42.5m to support their vaccine trials.Oxford’s Professor Sir John Bell, a member of the government’s coronavirus taskforce, revealed this week that the initial results could be ready by June. The team hope to produce one million doses of the resulting vaccine by September, if successful.Writing on Twitter, Prof Sikora – who is currently chief medical officer at Rutherford Health – caveated his hopeful comments with the statement: “Nobody is claiming to know what will happen for sure – I believe in an unknown situation this is a possibility.“We need to continue to keep our distance and hope the numbers continue to improve.”University of Oxford\u0026nbsp|\u0026nbspNo hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The accords are named in keeping with the Artemis programme, which is the plan to send the first woman and next man to the moon by 2024.They would include a commitment to be transparent in their work, to only explore space for “peaceful purposes”, and to guarantee they would work together to save any astronauts that came into danger during a mission.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesNasa was explicit that the agreements would be made in keeping with the Outer Space Treaty of 1967, which currently sets the legal framework for space exploration. That requires a set of commitments from countries which are intended to ensure that space missions are as safe and transparent as possible.But the new Artemis Accords go further than those commitments, requiring more detailed principles from the countries prepared to work with the US to head to the moon and beyond.Nasa reveals Tesla car that will drive astronauts to new launch“While Nasa is leading the Artemis programme, international partnerships will play a key role in achieving a sustainable and robust presence on the moon while preparing to conduct a historic human mission to Mars,” the agency said on its website.“With numerous countries and private sector players conducting missions and operations in cislunar space, it’s critical to establish a common set of principles to govern the civil exploration and use of outer space.”In full, the principles are that any mission should be conducted with peaceful purposes should be transparent and use technology that is interoperable and conforms to open, international standards that everyone can use. International partners also have to agree to provide emergency assistance to astronauts in trouble publicly register any space objects release the scientific data they gather protect the heritage of historic space artefacts gather resources according to international agreements not harmfully interfere with other missions and dispose of any debris or spacecraft responsibly.When drafts of the accords were leaked earlier this month, they attracted ire from Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russia’s space agency Roscosmos. He suggested on Twitter that the US was planning to invade the moon like it had Iraq and Afghanistan, and that the accords would be a way of building a coalition of other countries that would allow for it to take over the lunar surface.Created with Sketch.Nasa\u0027s groundbreaking decade of space exploration: In pictures Show all 10Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Mystic Mountain, a pillar of gas and dust standing at three-light-years tall, bursting with jets of gas flom fledgling stars buried within, was captured by Nasa\u0027s Hubble Space Telelscope in February 2010The first ever selfie taken on an alien planet, captured by Nasa\u0027s Curiosity Rover in the early days of its mission to explore Mars in 2012Death of a star: This image from Nasa\u0027s Chandra X-ray telescope shows the supernova of Tycho, a star in our Milky Way galaxyArrokoth, the most distant object ever explored, pictured here on 1 January 2019 by a camera on Nasa\u0027s New Horizons spaceraft at a distance of 4.1 billion miles from EarthAn image of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy seen in infrared light by the Herschel Space Observatory in January 2012.

Representatives also indicated that they hope for Russia to sign a version of the accords.As well as drawing criticism from Russia, the accords appear to be something of a rebuke to the Chinese space programme, which has traditionally been less transparent than the US. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine explicitly referenced the problems around its recent rocket launch as an example of where the accords could help.“The empty core stage of the Long March 5B, weighing nearly 20 tons, was in an uncontrolled free fall along a path that carried it over Los Angeles and other densely populated areas,” Mr Bridenstine told Ars Technica.“I can think of no better example of why we need the Artemis Accords. It’s vital for the US to lead and establish norms of behaviour against such irresponsible activities. Space exploration should inspire hope and wonder, not fear and danger.”Be inspired with the latest lifestyle trendsEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

It’s just horrible to think of it in this day and age. I’ve had help from some brilliant volunteers too. I’ve got three young girls at home and I hope they’re learning something about giving back to the community from all this.“I think The Felix Project is doing fantastic work right now. Stopping food going to waste is such a brilliant thing.”Tim Young decided last month to start volunteering with Bread n Butter: a social enterprise in Barnet getting up to 600 cooked meals and food parcels out each day, thanks to around 80 crates of produce supplied weekly by The Felix Project.The 55-year-old – who is still recovering from a heart operation he had earlier this year – has been cooking up to 150 meals a week from his own kitchen.“I’m relatively lucky, I’ve got quite a big kitchen and lots of pots and pans – so I wanted to do what I could. It’s hard to see how much people are struggling at the moment, because the level of need seems to be going up and up. But it’s a pretty good feeling being able to help others out.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I’m so glad it isn’t going to waste. It’s going to the people who need it most.”The Felix Project has quadrupled its deliveries since the beginning of the lockdown to 40 tons a day, and supplies more than 100 charities, school groups, hostels and community hubs across London.The Independent is encouraging readers to help groups across the UK that are trying to feed the hungry during the crisis – find out how you can help here.

This trend, combined with people\u0027s own changing attitudes toward social events and large gatherings, resulted in travel dropping by more than 50 per cent before the lockdown began, according to requests made on Apple Maps for car and public transport directions.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesRequests on Apple Maps for car directions began to fall on 11 March, while requests for public transport directions began to fall even earlier on 9 March.Many activities and behaviours that were considered normal before coronavirus also remain taboo regardless of the government\u0027s guidelines.The recently relaxed rules mean that cleaners and nannies are now permitted to visit people\u0027s homes, but a recent survey found that the majority of people found this very unacceptable.The poll by Ipsos MORI, which was carried out between 8 and 11 May, also found that having non co-habiting friends, family members or loved ones visit was also considered socially unacceptable.​Public opinion about exercise and driving is more greatly ided, ​though the poll demonstrated that government rules may not be a defining influence on people\u0027s behaviours.Companies\u0027 decisions to keep work from home policies in place show that lockdown measures are not necessarily enforced by government policy decision.The figures also suggest that the impact of coronavirus on travel habits, socialising and other pre-lockdown habits could continue long after lockdown officially ends.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

There was an 81 per cent increase in emergency food parcels given out during the last two weeks of March compared to the same period in 2019.Warning that the enormous level of need was likely to continue, she said: “If would be false of me to say we can continue to meet indefinitely an unspecified level of increased demand.”How to support our campaignThe Independent’s Help The Hungry campaign is seeking to raise £10m for the food surplus charity The Felix Project so it can provide food for NHS staff, the poor and elderly who are unable to afford supplies or remain stuck at home for health reasons.The Trussell Trust chief said food aid charities had done “incredible work” since the beginning of the outbreak, and said more than 50 per cent of food banks had adapted to the lockdown by doing home deliveries.However, Ms Revie argued that unless the government strengthened the financial safety net, the UK would continue to see “the kind of destitution that drives people to food banks”.She added: “The problem is people falling into financial hardship. The answer to financial hardship is not food. We are treating one symptom of an underlying problem … The issue we must be focusing on reducing the flow of people into foodbanks.”Advocating a “cash-first approach”, Ms Revie said: “If we’re identifying families in financial hardship ⁠– the most straightforward and dignified response is to provide them with the cash.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

I was having a Zoom drink with a friend and it got to a stage where I was so exhausted. I thought maybe I was just a bit hungover or was in a weird mood but then it continued and I felt exhausted the next night on another Zoom call.”How to support our campaignHer condition deteriorated rapidly. “I was having to consciously remember to breathe,” she added. “My lungs hurt. It was really scary. I was an alien for a while, I could barely speak. I wasn’t sure if I would make it.”Ms Khan rang 111, who told her to wait it out at home and see if she got worse. But within days, she said she couldn’t even walk. “I felt weak and dizzy. I couldn’t move at all, I was just on the sofa, trying to remember to breathe. I thought I might be having a heart attack or a stroke. My left side felt numb.”A friend called 999 on her behalf and medics came to her home. Ms Khan said: “They checked my vitals and they were happy enough with me. My oxygen levels were OK\u0026nbspand they said it might be that I was fatigued.“They said sometimes people get another blow when they are almost over the virus and that is what probably happened to me. It felt like an exorcism.” At the peak of her illness, Ms Khan went online to seek help. The artist, whose mother is in her seventies and is isolating so could not provide support, found out about Help The Hungry via Facebook, where she was connected with Made In Hackney.For the past three weeks, the musician\u0026nbsphas been receiving daily meals via the organisation.

We couldn’t be prouder to donate and help them to get food to people in the most difficult situations.”Another supplier to go the extra mile is Reach Food Service, a provider of premium ingredients to London’s gourmet restaurants, which has donated £10,000.In addition it has pledged £1 for every home delivery during 2020 of its newly launched Reach My Kitchen initiative – dispensing meat, seafood and poultry ingredients normally reserved for London’s top chefs directly to households – and which it estimates will raise its total donation to £50,000.Other food-linked organisations that have already supported our appeal include The Daylesford Foundation, which donated £100,000, and Hello Fresh with £25,000.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Richard Smith, supply manager of The Felix Project, said they had “really stepped up to the plate”.How to support our campaign“Some companies have hugely increased their supplies to us,” he said. “Innocent normally give us five pallets a week but this week we took 24 pallets off them. Same with Müller – their contribution has quadrupled.”Evgeny Lebedev, a shareholder in The Independent, said: “Our Food for London Now campaign has raised £4m in just seven weeks. With more than 1,500 reader donations, and the support of London companies, we have reached heights few expected.“We have told the stories of the people who are suffering during this pandemic. The homeless, the unemployed, the isolated. And we have saluted the innovative people who have applied their skills to helping them in this crisis.“The capital has heard our call, but the hunger crisis has not peaked – just look at the grim economic news from this week. We have committed to raising £10m to ensure the food security of Londoners for three years. So well done, but the hard part comes now. ”Here, 11 of Felix’s most prolific suppliers (in addition to Ocado) explain why they have chosen to partner with Felix, London’s biggest food surplus distributor.Felix suppliers and their generous food donations in April:The firm which produces online recipe boxes has donated 39 tons. Laurent Guillemain, its CEO, said: “We are proud to partner with Felix during the most extraordinary of times. Helping to care for our communities and the vulnerable is more important than ever and we will continue to support this incredible initiative that helps redistribute surplus food however we can.”A dairy products company which contributed 17 tons. The managing director of Müller Yogurt and Desserts, Bergen Merey, said: “Over three years ago I committed to this genuine cause, having read the story of young Felix. With a 14-year-old son of my own, I felt inspired by this wonderful initiative in his memory.”The restaurant and hotel supplier gave 12 tons. Murtaza Lakhani, its owner, said: “The twin issues of food waste and hunger are having major impacts on London. We are proud to make a commitment to Felix as well as to supply high quality food stocks and fresh ingredients so that vulnerable families, elderly people and our amazing NHS workers know there is a nutritious meal waiting for them at the end of the day.”The company which produces smoothies has donated 11 tons. Its head of refreshment marketing, Suraj Gangani, said: “We’re proud to have supported Felix in getting our healthy drinks to those who’ve needed them through this tough time.”The craft organic bakery gave 10 tons. Its spokesperson said: “We decided to change the way we approached food waste and engage with just one organisation, The Felix Project. They are an inspiration. We appreciate that the work of Felix will become more critical and widespread now and for the foreseeable future.”A meat supply company that gave 9 tons. Tim Woodward, CEO, said: “We are delighted to work closely with Felix. Since we started working with them we have delivered over 32,000 meals and 6,200kg of meat for cooking.”The company behind restaurants including The Ivy, Le Caprice, Scott’s and Sexy Fish contributed 8 tons. Richard Caring, its founder, said: “During these difficult times we must come together. The fantastic volunteers from Caprice Holdings restaurants and The Ivy Collections have been cooking 20,000 meals a week to supply, in partnership with Felix, some of London’s vulnerable communities. Together we can make a difference.”An online fruit and veg box company which gave 7 tons.

There’s always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus.Seven charts that show the true scale of the UK coronavirus outbreak‘They can blame it for everything’: What coronavirus means for BrexitThe Americans who think that coronavirus is a hoaxDo you need a face mask and where can you buy one?UK lockdown: Can I see my family and friends under new rules?“The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak and if, for any reason, there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.”He added: “We can’t have a situation where we keep our economy, our schools and our public services continually closed down, because the health consequences of doing so would be malign as well.Labour is pressing the government to publish the scientific evidence underpinning the proposal to reopen schools, and to keep talking to unions, teachers and councils to ensure parents can be confident their children will be safe if they return.Rachel Reeves, shadow Cabinet Office minister, told Sky News’s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: “The government have got a lot more work to do to give that confidence that it will be safe to send children back in two weeks’ time.“The government have got two weeks to get this right. They haven’t approached this in the right way so far.”The latest news on Brexit, politics and beyond direct to your inboxEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists. Log in to update your newsletter preferencesRegister with your social account or click\u0026nbsphere to log inI would like to receive updates on politics every morning by emailTeachers’ unions have called for more answers from the government after meetings with scientific advisers and ministers on Friday. And they have received backing for their cautious approach from the British Medical Association, while local authorities including Liverpool and Hartlepool have said they will not reopen schools on 1 June unless they are absolutely confident it is safe to do so.Asked for his advice to those opposing a return to classrooms next month, Mr Gove said: “I respectfully ask them to think again, to broaden the range of the scientific advice that they look at.“I know the BMA has the best interests of its members at heart, but actually the clear scientific and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen accompanied by social distancing.”The former education secretary added: “Children only have one chance at education. Over the past decade we have made significant strides in closing the gap between the richest and poorest in our schools. This lockdown has put that backwards.“If you really care about children, you will want them to be in school, you will want them to be learning, you will want them to have opportunities. Look to your responsibilities.”Ms Reeves said that parents and teachers’ anxieties would be “a lot less” if the government had got in place a programme for widespread coronavirus testing, followed by tracing of contacts of those infected and isolation of those who test positive.Mr Gove announced today that more than 17,000 of the government’s planned army of 18,000 contact tracers have now been recruited and said the authorities were “on course” to begin the programme by the end of this month.Ms Reeves said: “Government need to put in place some of the measures to improve confidence and that includes the test, trace and isolate strategy. The government abandoned that back in the middle of March. That was a mistake.”She added: “We want to see our children in the classroom, but to do that in a safe way two things need to happen. First of all, the government needs to work with parents, teachers and their unions to make sure that the new plans have the confidence of everybody so that parents feel confident to send their children to school.“But also we need more transparency from government.  The prime minister said last Sunday that all the decisions that are going to be made about easing lockdown will be based on the science and here we are, a week later, and those details have not been published and that is a cause for concern and adds to the anxiety amongst teachers and teaching staff and parents about the safety.”Kevin Courtney, joint general secretary of the National Education Union, said: “We welcome the fact that Michael Gove ... acknowledged unions have proper concerns for the health and safety of school staff, children and their families.“We stand ready to engage this week, with the publication of Sage’s advice and underlying modelling and data and with some understanding of how the government intends to assess the progress on its five tests.The mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, suggested the timetable for schools reopening should vary according to the R value – recording the average number of people infected by each coronavirus patient – in different regions of England.The former Labour MP warned that the prime minister could fracture national unity unless he listens to concerns that the lifting of lockdown measures is coming too quickly for the north.Speaking to BBC Breakfast he said: “People do not have the R information at the moment. They can get it, but it’s not formally published by the government.“There’s a very different picture in the north, particularly in the northeast, where the R is the highest, so I can understand concerns.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

They seem to react much better to Caravaggio than Monet. And these are Peruvian penguins, so we were speaking a bit in Spanish, and they really appreciated art history.”No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Some 28 patients are still in hospital, 95 have been discharged and nearly 1,000 close contacts are under observation.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn a bid to prevent the virus from spreading further, the majority of transport to 1,205 villages and their surrounding areas has also been halted, NBC News reported officials as saying, in a likely reference to measures imposed last weekend.Shulan’s mayor, Jin Hua, told a press conference on Saturday that fresh measures had been “strictly implemented in accordance with the central government’s decision-making and the requirements of provinces and cities”.

China’s state-run press agency Xinhua reported 40,000 tests have been carried out so far.More than 500 medical staff also rushed to neighbouring Jilin City to offer their assistance on Sunday as the alert level was raised from medium to high, state-affiliated media reported.Cluster infections in the city have seen some 8,000 people quarantined, according to the Global Times, after a partial lockdown was reimposed on the city on Wednesday, with long-distance public transport stopped, mass gatherings banned and indoor public venues closed.China’s vice premier Sun Chunlan – who became the face of efforts to manage Wuhan’s Covid-19 response – visited the province this weekend, demanding local authorities step up their efforts to tackle the new outbreak.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

Domestic flights have also resumed to 60 per cent of pre-crisis levels, according to the country’s civil aviation regulator, with numerous tourist sites reopening, such as Beijing’s Forbidden City and Shanghai’s Disneyland resort.Meanwhile, Reuters reports that China and South Korea have both consulted Japan about loosening border controls on some travellers to help revive business activities between the three nations.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Afghans have proven that they are committed to their national interests with common thinking, Mr Ghani said during the signing ceremony.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesIn the coming days, we hope that with unity and cooperation, we will be able to provide the ground for a ceasefire and lasting peace, he added.Discussions over the final sticking points including the allocation of some key posts had been underway throughout the day, three sources said.Thanks to the Taliban and Covid-19 – Afghanistan is facing a dark timeAbdullah had wanted to control a major portfolio such as finance or foreign affairs, and while Mr Ghani has not agreed to this, he could offer control of the interior ministry, sources said shortly before the deal was signed.It was not immediately clear which ministries each camp controlled after the agreement was struck.Washington has been frustrated by the growing impasse between the two men, even after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo travelled to Kabul in March to mediate. It had announced a plan to cut $1 billion (£830 million) in aid because the men could not agree.Mr Pompeo welcomed the agreement but chided Mr Ghani and Mr Abdullah for taking so long. He said the United States looked forward to prompt intra-Afghan talks and a political settlement.Secretary Pompeo noted that he regretted the time lost during the political impasse, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.It was not clear whether Sunday\u0027s agreement would result in the aid commitment being reinstated.

An attack on a Kabul maternity ward this week prompted Mr Ghani to switch the military to an offensive stance against insurgent groups.The Taliban has denied involvement in the attack, but the government has remained sceptical and angry at ongoing Taliban attacks against the Afghan military, fraying the momentum for peace talks, which were due to start in March.US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad said on Friday that a new date for intra-Afghan peace talks was under discussion, and that he would soon travel to the region and try to encourage a reduction in violence.Share your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

With an expected 36 ministers and 16 deputies, it will be the most bloated front bench in Israeli political history.The pair decided in April to set aside their differences to steer the country through the coronavirus crisis and resulting economic chaos, agreeing a power-sharing deal that will see Mr Netanyahu govern for the first 18 months and Mr Gantz take over for the second.Sharing the full story, not just the headlinesBut opponents fear the newly created “alternate prime minister” position could allow Israel’s longest-standing leader to remain in office after the swap and throughout his looming corruption trial, which starts next week.There are also deep suspicions about whether Mr Netanyahu will maintain his side of the bargain and ultimately cede control to Mr Gantz.Created with Sketch.World news in pictures Show all 50Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Created with Sketch.Healthcare workers, nurses and doctors, unified under the movement called Take Care of Care wearing face masks protest against the Belgian authorities\u0027 management of the coronavirus crisis, at the MontLegia CHC HospitalA girl watches over goats on the banks of the Dal Lake during rainfall in SrinagarLife-size cardboard figures with photos of football fans are positioned on the stands of Borussia Moenchengladbach\u0027s football stadium for their next game, which will be played without spectators, due to the coronavirus outbreak in GermanyNurses wearing face masks take part in an event held to mark International Nurses Day, at Wuhan Tongji Hospital in ChinaIraqi protesters gather on the Al-Jumhuriyah bridge in the capital Baghdad during an anti-government demonstration.

On 13 March, Poland closed its borders due to the ongoing pandemic of the Covid-19 and has extended the measure until at least 11 AprilThe agreement also paves the way for Mr Netanyahu to push forward with plans to extend Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the occupied West Bank – territory captured by Israel in 1967 which Palestinians want for their own independent state.“These regions are where the Jewish nation was born and rose,” he told the Knesset on Sunday. “It is time to apply Israeli law on them and write another great chapter in the annals of Zionism.”His nationalist base is eager to push for annexation ahead of planned US elections in November, at which point Donald Trump – whom he has dubbed “the greatest friend Israel has ever had in the White House” – could be replaced by another who opposes unilateral annexation.Palestinians have urged international sanctions against Israel in response to such a move, with the Palestinian foreign ministry saying: “These colonial and expansionist positions confirm once again his ideological enmity towards peace.” Mr Netanyahu plans to begin cabinet discussions on the issue on 1 July, by which point criminal trials over his conduct in office will be well underway.No hype, just the advice and analysis you needEnter your email addressFill out this fieldEmail already exists.

The complete contempt for the crisis facing the Israeli public.”Mr Lapid and Mr Gantz had previously been allies, but their partnership collapsed after Mr Gantz abandoned his central pledge not to serve under Mr Netanyahu due to the looming criminal trial.Rowing back on this pledge and splitting his own centrist Blue and White party in the process, Mr Gantz had argued that teaming up with Mr Netanyahu offered the country its only way out of stalemate at a time of crisis.In his speech to parliament, Mr Netanyahu also acknowledged that compromises had been made, but said a fourth election would have been far more devastating alternative, after more than 500 days of political upheaval.“The public wants a unity government and this is what the public is getting today,” he said. “We chose to serve the country together.”Additional reporting by agenciesShare your thoughts and debate the big issuesJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateOnly letters and numbers acceptedFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateJoin the discussionPlease be respectful when making a comment and adhere to our CommunityYou may not agree with our views, or other users’, but please respond to them respectfullySwearing, personal abuse, racism, sexism, homophobia and other discriminatory or incitefulDo not impersonate other users or reveal private information about third partiesWe reserve the right to delete inappropriate posts and ban offending users without notificationYou can find our Community Guidelines in full here.Create a commenting name to join the debateFollow replies to this article --Follow replies to my comment --There are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsThere are no Independent Premium comments yet - be the first to add your thoughtsCreate a commenting name to join the debateCreate a commenting name to join the debateEnter your email to follow new comments on this article.Are you sure you want to submit this vote?Are you sure you want to mark this comment as inappropriate?Want to discuss real-world problems, be involved in the most engaging discussions and hear from the journalists?

Others say the sheer size of the operation is bound to lead to errors. px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridLOADEDcustomwww.thesuncustom%Fwp-admin%Fpost.phpcustomlinkangoodt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridBEFORE_OPTOUT_REQt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridFINISHEDcustomwww.thesunt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\"  px,px, px\" data-img\"https:linkangood metric  midwidsidtidridOPTOUT_RESPONSE_OKt\" data-srcSet\"https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w, https:linkangood metric  w w\" src\"data:image svg+xml,%Csvg xmlnshttp:www.w.org  svg viewBox   %E%C svg%E\" Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

So over time, probably over the next six months, we will have a three-week review.She also added that its plausible restrictions could be in place for longer than that.This is the first time the UK and Europe has had to deal with a pandemic on this scale since the outbreak of Spanish Flu in  that killed around  million people and infected  per cent of the world population.Weve had a few close calls with illnesses like swine flu in -, but it wasnt on the same scale as coronavirus.However, the reason we are in lockdown now is that we have a better understanding of how the pathogens work and what we need to do to stop them.China implemented what was then the largest quarantine in human history to try to contain the coronavirus, locking down at least  cities at the end of January.The lockdown on the eight-million-strong city of Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus, ended on April .Wuhan was completely barricaded, with people literally being welded into their homes.Six European countries in Europe - Spain, Italy, Denmark, Austria, Poland, and the Czech Republic - who have previously imposed restrictions are beginning to lt lockdown measures.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

And I’ll admit, I didn’t correct the ­lawyer .But there’s a darker side to it. A generation of young city dwellers who know nothing about Britain were always bound to underestimate our four great nations.And so they did in the  referendum.The overlap between London and the Remain campaign has been well documented —  per cent of the capital voted in favour of remaining in the EU.Among London’s student population, the depth of ­support for the EU was overwhelming.And with some ultra-liberal friends, there were moments when it would have seemed easier to come out as a ­paedophile than a Brexiteer.Of course, ardent young Remainers convinced themselves that their love of the European Union was borne out of a sophisticated appreciation of all things global.But it seems more likely to me that they saw the EU as the ­saviour to a backwards, grisly country they imagined in their ignorance to be Britain.This summer, that ignorance could finally be shattered.Thanks to Covid-, the nation’s young people won’t have the option of scurrying to ­Heathrow the second their uni exams are over.Instead —they want holidays at all — they’ll be minibreaking in Manchester or camping in the English countryside.Yes, they might turn their noses up at rolling hills, stunning architecture and incredible free museums.But I have a sneaking suspicion they’ll be surprised and impressed with what they find beyond the confines of the M.And, reconnected to their roots at last, they might just begin to feel the first stirrings of patriotism running through their British veins.When the Government published its new guidelines for lockdown in England, I – like the rest of Twitter – found myself getting very worked up about whether or not I’m allowed to play tennis with someone outside of my household.The problem, as my mum gently reminded me, is that in my case it’s a bit of a moot point: I’ve never played tennis before and I’m not entirely sure how to hold a racket.I doubt either my housemate or my friends will be begging for a game any time soon.IT’S not often I find myself welling up at the radio. But LBC caller Liz, from Witham, Essex, got me in the gut this week.Through uncontrollable tears, she explained thatcoronavirus didn’t kill her, being forbidden from touching her grand-children surely would.She’s not alone. After nearly two gruelling months of lockdown, millions of us are experiencing real, gut-wrenching loneliness.They don’t like to complain – they know their suffering is dwarfed by that of frontline health and care staffers. But starved of the company of those they love, they are withering like plants out of sunshine.You’d expect a Conservative government instinctively to get this. For generations, Tory MPs have told us that family is crucially important to the ing of the UK.They’ve thrown their weight behind policies designed to strengthen families and made many moving speeches about how a family unit is more than the sum of its parts.But it seems all that was just for show. For in their admirable haste to propel Brits back to work, this Government seems to have forgotten about families altogether.Boris Johnson’s Sunday night speech – stuffed full of specic advice for workers – didn’t have a single word of hope for single adult relatives craving each other’s company.And the millions of young adults longing to know when they can next hug Mum will have been bitterly disappointed.Of course, the PM is right to say we need to get the economy going again.Forecasts from the Treasury on the upcoming recession could hardly be more alarming – and despite the best efforts of Chancellor Rishi Sunak and his bailouts, millions of businesses will go bustthey can’t get up and running again soon.Butwe’re expected to get up close with colleagues for the sake of the economy, surely we should get to see those we love best for the sake of our mental health The people of Britain are humans, not cash cows. Andthey are to get through this long, draining war in one piece, they need the support of the people they love.LISTENING to BBC News anchor Fiona Bruce casually describe carers as “low-skilled workers” really set my teeth on edge.To the shame of this nation, care home staff are indeed low paid.But low skilled  I reckon plenty of them would be more than capable of reading the news from an autocue for £, a year.And I’d like to see cofed Fiona feed, clean and comfort a newly widowed dementia sufferer without losing her cool.FOR the best part of the past decade, bespectacled “experts” gravely predicted that online dating would kill romance.Apps – they told us – would transform the dating scene into an endless virtual marketplace where singles could shop for each other , or  would turn dating into a minimal-effort pursuit of on-demand hook ups .How wrong they were.Rather than bonking their way round new digital acquaintances, millennial Brits in the st Century spend their downtime uploading photos and biographies to their smartphones and earnestly looking for love.And my, do they succeed.Last year a whopping  per cent of newly married couples met online, and Hinge – the dating app geared towards lelong relationships – is gaining users faster than any of its competitors.Granted, these apps aren’t perfect.We all like a good romance story, and Dad messaging Mum with a winky face because he liked her bikini selfie is hardly the stuff of Hollywood.But now that flirting in the pub is a thing of the past, let’s thank our lucky stars that the country’s poor singles have a shot at love at all.Rather than sitting on the sofa twiddling their thumbs, furloughed folk have been busy sculpting, chiselling and painting – and selling the fruits of their labours online.These plucky, small-time entrepreneurs are the very best of Britain.And with them around, I have no doubt this country will be back on its feet in no time.I’M absolutely loving Normal People on BBC.The chemistry between Marianneand Connellis really quite something.And as an ode to young love, the whole thing is pitch-perfect.In fact, my only quibble is why on earth are all the characters so darn sophisticated They’re , for goodness sake.Let’s see fewer candle-lit, red wine-soaked dinner parties and more tins of warm Foster’s. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

He has stuck to his promise and shown up every day, despite having to have surgery on his wrist and being in evident pain at times.Not only that, but he is donating the revenue from advertising on the show to the NHS. He embodies the perfect combination of qualities required to be a good business person: Do all you can, give something back and be ethical.In the past six weeks he has made more than £.million as new fans snapped up his -Day Plan well-being programme from his Body Coach site.But I really don’t think this was about making more money or becoming more famous.Bear in mind that Joe, who is only , has already made millions following the success of his cookbook and his online fitness classes.He really didn’t need to make more money or be more famous.I honestly believe he just wants children everywhere to experience the joy of fitness.There is a lot to like about Joe. But one thing I love about him is that one of his first le goals was to buy his mum, Raquela, a house. Having grown up on a council estate in Surrey, with Raquela and brothers Nikki and George, Joe always dreamed of being able to spend his earnings on his mum after she supported him in the earliest days of his career.“My mum’s always lived in a council house. We’ve never had mortgages. It wasn’t on the radar for us.“So when I could take that money I earned from that book and say ‘Mum, I’m buying your house. It’s yours’, that was an amazing moment for me.”Joe didn’t have an easy childhood. He has spoken about his father Gary still struggling with heroin addiction. But rather than repeating history, he actively decided to take a dferent path.He found exercise as a coping method. “I used exercise probably as a way to manage my feelings,” he has said.He said: “Because of my dad’s addiction, and the damage I saw it cause, me and Nikki steered clear of it. We weren’t smoking weed. We were training, exercising and playing sport. Along the line, I decided that wasn’t going to be my destiny.”Things in le either crush you or make you the person you were always meant to be. The strength of character it takes to turn your back on the path chosen by your first and most important role model — your dad — is immense.It would be so easy for him to have chosen the same path as his father or use his father’s addiction as an excuse for not making the most of his le.Joe has said he tries not to dwell on his past nor judge his dad. All that matters to him now is being happy and looking forward.The moral of this story is: Put the graft in, keep pushing yourself and never give up.But one of the many likeable things about Joe is how readily he credits Raquela for her role in his success, saying she taught them “right and wrong”, while his dad was “in and out of rehab”.She must be a hell of a woman to have brought up three boys so well. Joe and Nikki work together now, which is testament to the strength of their family ties.Knowing all this about Joe makes it all the more amazing he found his happy ever after when he married his model we Rosie in , and the pair now have two adorable children — Indie who’s  months and four-month-old Marley.It would be easy to resent his success. But how could anyone wish Joe anything other than happiness, given what he has overcome and also his approach to le I’m as keen as the next person for the lockdown to end and for normal le to resume – at least as much as it possibly can.But when I read about the fliers advertising mass gatherings, promising picnics and live music in cities across the UK this weekend, I couldn’t believe my eyes.At least eight events were being organised by anti-vaxxing group UK Freedom Movement, which claims the lockdown is illegal.Its posters headlined “UK Mass Gathering” said: “We say no to the coronavirus bill, no to mandatory vaccines, no to the new normal and no to the unlawful lockdown.”It is also urged people to gather in a major park in the eight locations, including London, Sheffield and Edinburgh, to “bring a picnic, some music and let’s have some fun and say yes to le”.Yes, lockdown measures are extreme and yes, we all want them to relax and for normality to .But what the organisers of this are failing to realise is that you can’t protest or demonstrate against a virus.And while there is so much still left for us to understand about how this particular virus works, to attend a mass gathering in protest seems like a fool’s errand.This event is clearly organised by idiots, for idiots.If only we’d all been quick-witted enough to self-isolate with someone who knows how to do our hair, like Kate Moss, who has been hunkering down with A-lister stylist James Brown.That said, Kate is an absolute beauty and clearly a supermodel, whether she is having a good hair day or a bad one.As luck would have it I am currently living with my mum.She has done a grand job dyeing my roots so far, but I think a blow-dry may be beyond her remit.Luckily, with a pandemic going on, and staff to worry about, I have more important things to think about than my hair.Twitter has been among the first companies to announce that it will not be bringing employees back into the workplacethey would prefer to work from home.And for more and more people, home is likely to be the new workplace – with meetings taking place on screens.The past few weeks have shown us that as long as people have a laptop and wi-fi, many can work from home.For lots of us, being allowed to do so means we save loads of money on travel and hundreds of hours of commuting time, while massively reducing our carbon footprint.And we’ll never have to buy a stale sandwich again.Meanwhile, companies will save a fortune on rent.All in all, this new way of working, for those who can do it, makes sense.Over the past few weeks we have all become much more aware of people’s proximity to us.And yes, with streets that have fewer cars than ever before, no doubt some of us are stepping into the road to avoid another pedestrian who could come within two metres of us.But police have felt the need to issue warnings to pedestrians not to walk into the road to dodge fellow pedestrians because it is dangerous .Seriously, is such a warning really necessary I know we have all been in lockdown for a while but surely we haven’t taken leave of our common sense and will remember to look left and right when we cross the road . . . won’t we It’s now been eight weeks since our Thursday night Clap For Carers began. And looking at this photo of Boris Johnson outside No from Thursday, it’s a good reminder that things are changing all the time.When you compare it to the picture taken of him just days before he was admitted to hospital it really shows the big dference a few weeks make.He looks more or less back to his old self. Also, it’s really cheering to see new mum Carrie looking so well and so happy.We seem to be seeing lots of people in their swim-wear at the moment, with not a. pool in sight!Normally I try to give thanks for my strong and able body rather than worrying too much about what it looks like.But it’s hard not to feel a tad wistful looking at photos of Kimberley Garner, who looks so fit and gorgeous she’d no doubt be awarded swimwear body of the week,such an award existed. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

The key issues are how swt that recovery is and whether the economy is permanently scarred at the end of it.”The economist added: Were certainly going to see - temporarily - a higher amount of Government borrowing.The fact that the level of debt goes up on its own doesnt necessarily mean you have to have the sort of austerity that followed the financial crisis.”The economist revealed that he thought people’s behaviour would be critical factors to the nations recovery as well as how quickly lockdown restrictions are lted and said: If you allow people back into the workplace, back into shops, back into restaurants, will they actually go  Will they feel too nervous He added: Then also there will be political choices coming out of this. Do we want to spend a higher proportion of national income than we went in for example on health and social care All of these things together will shape the fiscal challenge for the Government coming out of this. A post financial crisis-style extended period of austerity is not a done deal.Separately, Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the Confederation of British Industry , told Sky News that businesses were thinking about protecting furloughed jobs for the future, adding it required a cautious, careful restart.She said: This week, I think from the business perspective, has been a week of glimmers of light at the end of the tunnel.We had the encouragement at the beginning of the week for businesses to get back to work, they are following that putting safety first... but what we are concerned about is the policies need to be coordinated across transport, across schools, across the devolved nations.If we do not have consensus that will undermine confidence amongst workers, consumers and people in general.” Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It might feel strange at first, but we’ll get used to it.Militant unions telling teachers they should refuse to go back to work must also urgently rethink their stance.Reopening schools is obviously essentialwe are to prevent the poorest and most vulnerable children falling behind — new research reveals that better-off children are spending a whopping  per cent more time each day on education than those from poorer homes.But as parents can only go back to work once their kids are in class, it’s also the only way to kickstart the economy.Of course, there will always be an element of risk to getting society up and running again. Even before coronavirus, it would have been impossible for anyone to guarantee the safety of every worker every day.But the Government has stressed it’s “extremely unlikely” a school could be the source of a Covid- outbreak.And given the risks frontliners take every single day, that assurance should be good enough for teaching unions.WE welcome the news that the Government plans to push ahead with legislation to end free movement and replace it with a points-based immigration system before the end of this year.The new system is exactly what Brexit-voting Sun readers wanted: it will let us welcome the brightest and best — including doctors, nurses and carers — to the UK based on what they have to offer, not where they come from.And it’s logical to get it introduced quickly so businesses have time to prepare before the transition period ends.Let’s hope MPs have the sense to back the bill.WE can all sleep a little more soundly in our beds now the Government looks set to hit its target of recruiting , contact-tracers by the end of next week.It’s been obvious for a long time that widespread testing and tracing is the best way to contain the virus: all the countries that have fared best have been doing it from the start.But thanks to dodgy advice from Public Health England, Boris and his ministers gave up on it back in March.What a relief they’ve finally seen the light.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

Alok Sharma said freight is being looked at as one of the exemptions to a quarantine system that is due to launch in the next two weeks. He told the daily No press conference: I recognise that the quarantining measures will put restrictions on businesspeople being able to travel. We will be setting out shortly the exemptions. One of the exemptions we have talked about is people who are bringing freight in, so freight drivers. It comes as the UK government prepares to force all arrivals at all ports and airports to go into self-isolation for  days, starting in a few weeks. People will be ordered to give the address they are quarantining at, andthey do not, could be forced into a government-run quarantine facility. Itaposs understood officials are looking at exemptions for some people who arrive to the UK, especially from France through the Channel Tunnel or Eurostar. But government sources have said those exceptions will be tightly drawn, to include freight drivers or scientists working on the pandemic. That means holidaymakers - including any Brits ing home - are unlikely to be exempt from quarantinethey go on a trip to France.  The UK lockdown is still largely in place and the Foreign Office advises against all non-essential travel, anywhere in the world. Exemptions to the quarantine policy, which Mr Sharma said would be limited, will be published in the coming days. And he stopped well short of saying there would be an exemption for all people coming from France. He said: There have been discussions between the Prime Minister and President Macron, when details become available we will set them out.

The alert comes in the first report from the John Mills Institute for Prosperity, launched by the multimillionaire shopping channel tycoon and ex-Labour donor. His think tank aims to spark a revival in “left-behind” parts of the country, such as industrial heartlands and coastal towns.They include constituencies which formed the “Red Wall” – Labour strongholds seized by the Conservatives at last Decemberaposs election. Manufacturing makes up less than % of the UK economy, but the study calls for that to rise to %. Boosting output would help less well-off regions sell more goods to the rest of world, the Institute says. Otherwise, it fears living standards may be “signicantly lower in  than in  – leaving today’s generations the worst off”. Blasting “decades of deindustrialisation”, Mr Mills told the Mirror: “Never before have we faced an economic challenge of this magnitude, but our prospects for recovery have been made more bleak by a decade of low growth and a deeply unbalanced economy.  “When we have defeated this virus, the UK government must begin to create a more competitive and favourable environment for British manufacturers. “Increased private sector investment in mechanisation, technology and power will produce a largerof GDP growth than other sectors.” He said the “manufacturing industry has been depleted and left unable to compete globally”. Backing the report, former Labour minister Caroline Flint who said: “Facing the greatest period of uncertainty in our letimes, in a Britain that doesn’t train enough, invest enough or make enough, there is no certainty of a fair or sure recovery.

He told the BBC’s Andrew Marr: “It is absolutely safe,” then said the only way to be sure was to “stay at home” as there is “always, always... a risk”. Teaching unions fear it is unsafe for pupils and staff to go back to school on June . And Labour wants the test and trace system to be put in place before schools .Teachers demanded clarity on the safety of going back to school after Michael Gove plunged the Government’s lockdown exit strategy into further confusion.The Cabinet Office Minister initially promised teachers would be safe from Covid- as a phasedfor primary school kids starts on June . But seconds later he backtracked – admitting the only way to completely avoid infection was to stay at home. The standoff between the Government and teaching unions intensied as Hartlepool council in Co Durham joined Liverpool in saying its schools will remain shut as cases locally continue to increase. Labour and teaching unions insist a testing and tracking system should be a precondition for schools reopening, so that inidual outbreaks can be controlled. But testing again fell below the , daily target, with , tests carried out or dispatched in the  hours to am on Sunday. It came as sunseekers flocked to beaches over the weekend after a partial loosening of lockdown restrictions, despite the UK death toll rising by  to , on Sunday. Beaches including Southend in Essex were packed, cars crammed into a car park at Durdle Door, Dorset, and hundreds of bikers were among visitors to Matlock Bath, Derbys. The rush came despite pleas not to flock to hotspots after the “stay local” rule was lted in England. Asked about teachers’ safety, Mr Gove told BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show: “Yes, teachers will be safe in schools... “Some of the best leaders in current education have said that it is absolutely safe for children to , absolutely safe for teachers and other staff toas well.”  But askedhe could guarantee no teacher would be infected as a result of ing to the classroom, he said: “The only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely.There is always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk, but... it’s extremely unlikely any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak, andfor any reason there are risks we can take steps to mitigate them.” Teachers’ unions have said they will provide health and safety guidance for their members so they can saythey feel it is too dangerous to work. But Mr Gove said: “The clear scientic and clinical advice is that it is safe to have schools reopen accompanied with social distancing. Children only have one chance at education. Over the last decade we have made signicant strides in closing the gap between the richest and poorest in our schools.

Hartlepool leaders said: “Given that coronavirus cases locally continue to rise, Hartlepool borough council has been working with schools and we have agreed they will not reopen on Monday st June. Whilst we recognise the importance of schools reopening, we will be taking a measured and cautious approach.” Liverpool has confirmed that its schools will only be open to vulnerable pupils and the children of key workers on June . Sunderland City Council leader Graeme Miller described the lockdown changes as “nonsense”. Manchester mayor Andy Burnham warned: “”Nervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing.” "},{"url":null,"title":"pubs could start selling food","story":"NewsPubs could start selling food and drink from street stalls within weeksThe government is looking at making clear pubs, cafes or restaurants can set up market stalls - but theres no sign beer gardens will reopenShareCommentsByDan BloomOnline Political Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsPunters queuing outside a Liverpool pub which has already started selling takeaway lockdown pints \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - The Coronavirus BriefingSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Sources confirmed ministers are looking at letting firms set up aposmarket-styleapos stalls for takeaways within weeks. There is a big condition, though - these firms must have a licence for tables and chairs at the front of their premises. The plan, which is still being considered, could let some pubs creak slowly back into le before they can actually open their doors. Existing plans say pubs, cafes and restaurants could start to reopen from July, but only limited open-air dining areas would be included in this first wave. Sources have made clear pubs have next to no chance of reopening fully in July, and may not even open in July at all. So according to the Sunday , Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick will issue guidance to give pubs a tiny bit more freedom.The guidance will reportedly say shops, restaurants and pubs can set up stalls out front - but only in areas where they already have a licence to place tables and chairs. A Whitehall source said it could lead to a more vibrant style of continental town centres in the summer. Pubs, cafes and restaurants are already able to run as takeaways during the pandemic. And separately, outdoor market stalls that sell food are already allowed to carry on running. However, these two dferent rules have not been formally combined until now. But those hoping for aof beer gardens will be left disappointed.  There is still no sign that any seating areas of any kind, even outdoors, will reopen at all before July. Instead, people might be expected to take their food or drink and move away to a public open space like a park, where they are allowed to sit down. People must still stay two metres apart and gatherings of more than two are banned unless youaposre from the same household. If two people from dferent households meet, they must sit two metres apart.It seems likely any guidance would only apply to England, because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have all set out their own lockdown easing plans. It comes despite pubs and trade bodies calling on the Government to go further and let them open beer gardens, as long as tables are spread out. Peter Borg-Neal, founder of Oakman Inns, told the Mirror last week: “We could use free standing screens to separate tables, or use a natural gap of two metres, have staggered bookings, contactless payments and handwash stations. “Simple common sense, carefully applied with trained staff should work.” Pub, cafe and restaurants will only begin after England enters step three of easing the lockdown. Step one happened in the last week, and involved being able to exercise unlimited times per day and sit still in an open space.

Labour peer Lord George Foulkes, who was a minister when the benefit was introduced in November , urged the Tories to honour a pledge to protect free licences.He said: “This year we will mark the th anniversary of the introduction of the concessionary TV licence for over-s. “We should be celebrating how this progressive Labour policy has helped reduce pensioner poverty and combat loneliness. “It should not be the year we mark its end.”  The Conservatives pledged at the  election to protect free licences for the rest of that Parliament, which was due to run until .

He says: “If they have any compassion at all, they should now honour their manesto promise and keep the concession indefinitely – not just because it makes sense but, as the Conservatives put it themselves, to promise our over-s aposthe security and dignity they deserveapos.” He will tackle the Government over free licences in the House of Lords on June . Age UK charity director Caroline Abrahams said: “To start charging the over-s now on the th anniversary of free TV licences would be an insult to all those older people who are already struggling with the loneliness and isolation that this lockdown is creating and will continue to do for months to come, as well as having to dig deep to find the finances to pay for it.”  Bectu broadcasting union chief Philippa Childs said: “The -year anniversary of free licence fees for the over-s is a landmark that we should, as a nation, be celebrating. “Instead the Conservative Government has forced the BBC to take on this cost, abdicating its responsibility for what is essentially a welfare benefit. “The Government must take back responsibility for funding free licences for all over-s.” The Silver Voices campaign group highlighted tributes offered to war veterans last weekend as the Government marked the th anniversary of VE Day. Pointing out over-s were alive at the end of the war, director Dennis Reed said: “For  years they have had the right to free TV licences in recognition of their long contributions to society and the low level of the state pension. “The VE Day generation need the threat of losing their free licence on August  like a kick in the teeth.

Business Secretary Alok Sharma told the public that the country is moving toward level three on the five-tier Covid alert system - which would see some of the strictest measures reduced. Since the lockdown was put in place on March , it has been in level four - meaning the threat is classed as severe. Level three means it is classed as substantial. But Mr Sharma warned that bringing the country back to normal must be done in careful steps in order to avoid a second peak of cases. He said at todayaposs daily Downing Street briefing - in which he confirmed that the Covid- death toll has risen by a further  - that progress was being made. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Describing five threat levels - with five being the most severe and one being the least - he stated: “Throughout the period of lockdown we have been at level four. “Thanks to you, people across the country, we have collectively helped to bring the R level down. “We are now in a position to begin moving to level , in careful steps.” And he continued: “‘We have set out the first of three steps we will take to carefully mody the measures, gradually ease the restrictions and begin to allow people toto their usual way of le while avoiding a disastrous second peak that overwhelms the NHS.”  The Business Secretary said the UK would move to level three “when it is safe to do so”. The five tier aposCovid Alert Systemapos will be used to determine when it is safe for measures to be relaxed, and for le to gradually get back to normal.

The artwork that once adorned the walls will have been torn down, their desks spaced two metres apart and toys, Lego blocks and even old fashioned counting beads will have disappeared. Lunchtimes will be spent at desks, outside play equipment cordoned off, toilet times will be scheduled and contact with teachers so limited that they won’t even be able to put a plaster on a child who falls over. This will be the sterile reality of le in the UK’s , primaries when they open in June. And teachers fear it will have a huge emotional impact on kids.  One East Yorkshire teacher said: “We are worried how this will affect children’s mental health and also educational outcomes. “I’m concerned that parents are not being made aware of what education will look like and that their child’s experience will be far from normal. “Children have already undergone a lot of disruption and, at a time when we wish we couldto our normal routines in order to reassure them, I fear this will only unsettle them further.” Health Secretary Gavin Williamson has left it to inidual schools to have “flexibility” to follow Government guidelines, which mirror the approach of schools in Denmark which started a phasedin April. Head teachers now face the headache of making their schools safe for reception and Year One and Six primary classes and in just two weeks. The guidelines suggest schools introduce one-way systems for kids, ide corridors to keep them apart and stagger breaks as well as arrival and home times so parents don’t congregate. It’s also advised youngsters are placed into small gangs of friends who will not be allowed to mix with other sets or dferent years. Constant hand-washing will be in place when kids arrive, come in from play and before and after eating. The guidelines state: “Consider how to encourage young children to learn and practice these habits through games, songs and repetition.” One head teacher this week took the unusual move of spelling out the changes to parents on her school website, writing: “Some of the parents who want their child tohave stated this is for their mental health and well-being. “This worries me more as I do feel some of the measures I will have to take will completely work against this.”  In a list of changes, headed ‘The Truths’, headteacher Marianne Allan, of Cambois Primary School in Blyth, Northumberland, told parents that all unnecessary furniture and equipment will be removed, teachers will not be allowed to sit beside pupils who need help and lunches will be eaten in classrooms. Ms Allan said children who fall over or have a toilet accident will be encouraged to change themselves or clean their scrape or cut. Otherwise parents will have to collect them. In a poignant message she wrote: “Today I looked at a memory on my phone. It was from a year ago today when some girls in year  and  made me the most beautul table for my lunch, it was covered in lip gloss to smell nice and full of sparkle and jewels. “This is the school I miss. These are the activities we hope to resume. “This will NOT be possible in June. This is the school we want to see back, where children run up and hug their teachers and friends. The school children can walk safely around a building without measures or go to the toilet without supervision and for them to be cleaned afterwards.”  The Government has prioritised reception and Year one learners because they are learning “basic essentials” and Year Six so they can prepare for the move to High School. In Secondaries, Year  and  will get some “face-to-face” time with teachers. But one primary teacher in Bridlington said: “The classrooms will be striped bare of any joy. “Art work will be banned from the wall, resources like counting bricks and beads will be banned to stop the spread of the virus. “Our school has made the decision not to mark exercise books for  hours just to be safe. “it’s so sad because there will be no toys for the little ones in reception and we won’t even be able to help them take bottle lids off their juicethey struggle. “I don’t say this to make parents feel guilty because I know some have no choice but to send their children, but they have a right to know what the reality will be.” "},{"url":null,"title":"anne diamond disgruntled meghan make","story":"NewsopinionAnne Diamond: Disgruntled Meghan will make a mint from her diary on royal leMeghan Markle kept a personal diary all the time she lived in Britain documenting her engagement to Prince Harry, the wedding and beyond which will be published as a bombshell memoirShareCommentsByAnne Diamond:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsopinionMeghan Markle and husband Harry are already releasing a book on royal le \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

She also apparently believes “readers will finally understand the monumental anguish and turmoil she had to endure with a stf upper lip” and “see her ­vulnerable side, something the book does in great detail”.  We may be curious, even scornful, but she’ll be laughing all the way to the bank.

It got scared by my presence and this was when you could tell it was a large cat, from the way it ran through the long grass. I have now been told that just up the road from this sighting, there was a lamb discovered with its head missing in a unclean manner. Wild cat sightings have been claimed across the British countryside, with numerous alleged sightings in rural Devon and Cornwall. Their existence in the wild here in the UK is still a much debated topic. Plenty of people believe we have enough evidence to suggest they do exist. Brett Bennett recently took photos of huge, four-clawed cat paw prints pretty close to where the black cat was supposedly seen, in Holbeam Wood in Newton Abbott. Brett said: These woods arenapost used very much at the moment due to lockdown, and itaposs only about a five-mile walk from here to Dartmoor, so when I saw the prints it made me think. I sent the photos to my partner, and she said that there had been sightings around this area before. Brett said heaposs recently been finding more animal remains, like deer legs, during walks with his dog, Kalba. Rumours of big cats on the moors of Devon and Cornwall have been around for a long time, often referred to as the Beast of Bodmin, Exmoor or Dartmoor. This theory, made public in July last year, mainly comes from Benjamin Mee, owner of Dartmoor Zoo, revealing three pumas were due to arrive their nearly  years ago, but instead were supposedly released into the wild by circus entertainer and former Plymouth Zoo owner, Mary Chipperfield. Mr Mee said Dartmoor Zoo was expecting a delivery of five pumas after Plymouth Zoo was forced to close down in . Rather than surrender them to another zoo, Ms Chipperfield is thought to have released her favourite breeding pair into the wild, plus a young male to keep them company. Thereaposs been loads of alleged sightings of the animals over the years in Devon and Cornwall. Initially it was rumoured to be prowling across Bodmin Moor, and was called the Beast of Bodmin. The mysterious creature is described as a phantom wild cat, possibly with two sharp prominent teeth like those found on a leopard. It was first spotted in  and ever since reports of the Beast of Bodmin have flooded in. Since , more than  sightings have been reported in the Devon and Cornwall force area.

The Mirror is building on this by connecting people for unique online conversations – it’s a chance to meet someone dferent, find out what others are going through and even help people feel less lonely. Before the coronavirus crisis, Joan Pons Laplana and Thomas Webb might never have met. Joan, originally from Barcelona, is a senior charge nurse at a busy ­intensive care unit in Sheffield. Thomas, Norfolk born and bred, is a supermarket checkout worker. Joan, , is an outgoing father-of-three who is passionate about the NHS and Spanish music.  Thomas, , is a self-described introvert who is into his girlfriend, video games and a drop of cider. But this pandemic has changed who matters in our country. Now, in May , Thomas and Joan are both key workers keeping Britain fed and alive – two of the heroes we all clap for on our ­doorsteps on Thursday nights. For our ground-breaking Britain Connects project, we asked Joan and Thomas to meet up via a videocall and chat about their experiences. The result was a fascinating conversation that touched on love, loneliness, le, death and everything in between. “As you can see from my accent it’s not a Yorkshire accent, I’m Spanish,” says Joan, introducing himself. “I’ve been here for  years, working in the NHS. I’m a nurse. I’m working tonight in intensive care.” Thomas, from Great Yarmouth, smiles. “I work in the local ­supermarket, I’ve lived here most of my le, I’ve got a typical Norfolk accent, I guess,” he says. “According to the Government we’ve gone from being low-skilled workers to key workers,” Joan says. Thomas modestly says his job just isn’t as important as Joan’s. They chat about protective equipment. Joan feels like Robocop in PPE – it takes him  minutes to put on. Thomas says he uses endless hand sanitiser, and that Asda has introduced measures such as screens and one-way systems to keep staff safe. Out and about though, he doesn’t use a mask because he wants there to be enough for people like Joan.Joan speaks eloquently about how he’s felt since Brexit.“In the past few years, people very quickly wanted to know where I came from,” he says. “That has disappeared, now people are not bothered where I come from, they’re just happy to see me and happy that I’m a nurse. “That feeling of belonging has come back because in the past few years, as a non-British national, I felt a bit ‘not wanted’ from the Government and part of society. “In a way, we’ve come back to when I came here years ago. It doesn’t matter where you come from. I hope that this feeling will carry on after.” Thomas looks serious. “It shouldn’t matter where you come from. You’re more than welcome. You call the UK your home.”Thomas has kept apart from his girlfriend Paris in lockdown – to protect her and her parents from the risks his job brings. But they work together at Asda, making it hard. Joan is amazed by Thomas’s resolve in not being tempted to see a loved one. “I would be,” admits Joan. “We’re human. My kids don’t live with me and I’m finding that very hard. “My -year-old... I haven’t seen him for over four weeks. “He’s just had his th birthday over Zoom. But as soon as he turns  you can’t see your kid, because they’re adults. One day I’m allowed to see him, the following day I’m not...” Thomas agrees. “It’s been lonely,” he says. “I work with my partner on a few of my shts and it’s very tempting just to go over there but I can’t because I’ve got to do my job. It’s lonely but she does her best to make sure I’m not by Facetiming as much as she can.” He is worried because his mental health hasn’t been great in the past. “I look at my front door and feel like I can’t open that, I’m locked in,” he says. “I go to work, interact a bit. You can see your work mates but you can’t see your mate mates.” Joan looks serious. “When I see colleagues getting poorly and maybe die, I think, ‘I may be next’, that’s at the back of my mind.” "},{"url":null,"title":"dad schoolgirl genette tate who","story":"NewsDad of schoolgirl Genette Tate who vanished  years ago dies without learning her fateThe -year-old went missing on her paper round in Aylesbeare, Devon in August  but her remains have never been foundShareCommentsByAdam Aspinall:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsDevon schoolgirl Genette Tate went missing  years ago\" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - daily newsSubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Residents outside of Wales are being reminded that the travel restrictions lted in England do not apply here – and anyone travelling into Wales will be subject to Welsh legislation. Temporary Assistant Chief Constable Nigel Harrison said: “Our tourist attractions, parts of the national park, pubs, restaurants, cafes, caravan, holiday parks and campsites all remain closed. “Travelling into Wales for exercise or without a reasonable excuse is not permitted, and the sooner we can slow the spread of the virus the sooner we can welcome people back here. “Increasing the population of our area will place an unreasonable burden on our NHS and other key workers who are working hard to ensure the safety of everyone.Those visiting the mountains of Snowdonia or our coastal areas also need to realise that they could potentially be risking the lives of our Mountain Rescue and RNLI volunteers should they get into dficulties.

Horus, Dadou, Thea and Cersei are believed to have been taken from their mothers before they were weaned as part of the exotic wildle trade. The Born Free Foundation said they were kept in “completely inadequate conditions” in France. The four, now known as the Lions of Lyon, were just a few months old when they were rescued by French wildle charity, Fondation  Million d’Amis. Dadou was found on Paris’s most famous street – the Champs-Elysees – in the back of a Lamborghini missing the tip of his tail after his owner was caught by police officers taking photos with the cub.  Horus, the largest of the four cubs, was found on a child’s bed in an apartment on the outskirts of Paris while his owner was hiding in his neighbour’s cupboard. Police were alerted after images of the cub had been posted on Snapchat. Cersei was found on the same day as Horus in a garage in Marseille and was suffering from a catalogue of illnesses. As well as being very underweight, she also had skin irritation, a dull coat, gastrointestinal problems and corneal ulcers. Thea, the smallest and youngest of the cubs, was surrendered by her owner. She had glaucoma, and was under-developed and underweight, with extreme hair loss and diarrhoea.

But it will take more than  years for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to clear the sum. The cash was spent renovating Grade II-listed Frogmore Cottage to the pair’s high standards after they married in . Meghan, , is understood to have chosen eco-friendly, toxin-free, vegan paint for the walls. Five apartments were knocked together to re-form the cottage, while beams, floors and the water and gas systems were replaced. But in the past six months the couple have spent just two weeks in what was meant to have become their family home. That is unlikely to change after they moved into a £.million, -bed Hollywood villa, loaned to them by actor Tyler Perry. And when they quit being full-time royals earlier this year, Harry vowed to repay the cash. Now it is believed the couple have agreed a “rental-plus” deal, above market rate, to keep Frogmore as their official UK base. The Queen has made it clear they can use it indefinitely. This year Buckingham Palace said they “will no longer receive public funds for royal duties”. But Graham Smith, from anti-monarchy group, Republic, said the couple are still more than rich enough to repay the money, “plus interest”, in one lump sum. He said: “Taxpayers need their money back, particularly now we’ve been hit by the huge costs of the coronavirus. “The couple, with their vast amount of millions in the bank, should explain why they aren’t paying it back immediately.” "},{"url":null,"title":"royal family newsletter must read","story":"NewsRoyal family newsletter - the must-read email with everything you need in one placeThe Mirrors Royal Family newsletter will bring the most important and interesting stories on the Queen, Kate Middleton, Meghan Markle, William, Harry and the rest of the Firm straight to your inboxShareCommentsByZoe ForseyLestyle Editor:,  MAY Updated:,  MAY NewsJust put your email address in the box underneath this picture and we will start sending you our royal newsletter \" to FREE email alerts from Mirror - Royal FamilySubscribeWhen you subscribe we will use the information you provide to send you these newsletters.

Researchers at the Oxford Vaccine Group began testing the vaccine candidate ChAdOx nCoV- in humans on April  to see whether it can protect healthy people from Covid-. The programme will allow researchers to assess the safety of the candidate, and its ability to generate an immune response. - How does the study work  Up to , participants have been recruited across multiple study sites in Oxford, Southampton, London and Bristol. The volunteers have been randomly allocated to receive either the ChAdOx nCoV- vaccine or a licensed meningitis vaccine that will be used as a control for comparison. A separate small group of  volunteers were set to get two doses of the candidate four weeks apart, the first administered at the start of the trial.- Who is participating Volunteers must be aged -, and cannot have tested positive for Covid-. They must also be in good health, not be pregnant or breastfeeding, and must not have previously taken part in a trial with an adenoviral vaccine or received any other coronavirus vaccines. - How will the trial work  The dose used in the trial was chosen based on previous experiences with other ChAdOx based vaccines. Participants will not know whether they have received the Covid- vaccine or the control vaccine until the end of the trial. On April , the first two participants were vaccinated, one with the ChAdOx nCoV- vaccine and one with the control vaccine. On day three, six more volunteers were vaccinated, half with the Covid- vaccine and three with the control vaccine. On the fth day, researchers began vaccinating larger numbers of participants. - What happened next  The participants were given an e-diary to record any symptoms they experience in the seven days after receiving the vaccine, andthey feel unwell for the following three weeks. During a series of follow-up visits, blood samples will be taken to assess their immune response, and their observations checked. If they develop Covid- symptoms during the study, they can contact a member of the clinical team, who will checkthey have become infected with the virus. If a participant becomes very unwell they will be reviewed by staff at the hospital. - When will the results be available  The statisticians will compare the number of infections in the control group with the number of infections in the vaccinated group.. Therefore, it is necessary for a small number of study participants to develop Covid-. How quickly researchers reach the numbers required depends on the levels of virus transmission in the community. If transmission remains high, enough data may be available in a couple of months buttransmission levels drop, this could take up to six months. - What is the vaccine  ChAdOx nCoV- is made from ChAdOx, which is a weakened version of a common cold virusthat causes infections in chimpanzees. It has been genetically changed so it is impossible for it to grow in humans. Researchers hope their version will make the body recognise and develop an immune response to the spike protein - recognisable in images of the virus - that will help stop Covid- from entering human cells and therefore prevent infection. Imperial College London is also progressing with its vaccine candidate and will look to move into clinical trials by mid-June, with larger scale trials in October.:Soccer-La Liga chief confirms clubs will resume group training from MondayFootball in Spain has edged closer to ing after a long pause due to the COVID- pandemic after La Liga president Javier Tebas confirmed clubs in the top two isions will begin training in groups of up to  players from Monday.Theto group training follows a government announcement on Saturday allowing sports teams toto activity regardless of the status of the lockdown in their own region.Previously, only teams from regions that were in phase one of the de-escalation of the national state of emergency would be able toto training in groups.

Itaposs going to be very hot for large parts of England for most of the week, reaching highs of Con Wednesday, which would make it the hottest day of the year so far, he continued. This will occur due to large areas of high pressure, combined with southerly winds from the continent, bringing with it, pleasant sunshine, dry skies and warmer air. Forecaster Alex Burkill added: “Temperatures are going to rise through the week. We could have  or C by Tuesday and C by Wednesday. “There’s uncertainty about afterwards – it could be even higher on Thursday or there’s potential cold air from the West.” It should help gardens and the natural world continue to look their best.

Although full respect to those who choose to, she added.Instead, Elise hasnapost shaved for the last couple of months simply because it hasnapost made the top of [her] to-do list, she said, writing about her experience for Somerset Live.She explained the task is in the back of her mind as something she will eventually do when she has a spare spot. But Iaposve been busy, she said, really busy. While many people have expressed how bored theyaposve been during lockdown Elise has said sheaposs working harder than ever and is certainly not sitting around with nothing to do. She explained: There’s lots of stories about how to fill time during lockdown boredom – but there’s plenty of us out there who are working harder than ever. I don’t just mean the healthcare heroes on the frontline, who have rightly been the focus of any mention of work still going on. There’s plenty of us who are working less noble – but still very demanding jobs. Elise went on to explain that, at her new site, a number of employees have been furloughed but sheaposs still working and thereaposs a lot to be done. I’ve also been working hard to prepare for my senior journalism qualications, spending hours of my own time on that each day, she added. Concerned about the usual exercise she gets running for trains and in her regular netball training sessions, Elise added that sheaposs also followed a workout routine during lockdown. She said: So I’ve come up with a full-on daily exercise checklist– looking to take long walks, - minute hard cardio workout videos and - minute dance videos each day. Most days I do it, but it takes way longer than my non-lockdown routine would take. Elise went on to point out that she doesnapost necessarily think sheaposs shedding any pounds but that sheaposs doing the exercise more because it makes her feel better. It gives me structure and purpose and clears my head, she said. So why specically has Elise struggled to find the time for a quick shave  Because she doesnapost actually shave. Sheaposs never done it in her le. She explained: My headline isn’t entirely accurate. I’ve never actually shaved . You will have to forgive me because ‘de-hairing’ as I would accurately call it would have confused you. Usually Elise uses a combination of hot wax strips and hair removal cream so she can avoid having to shave every day and that horrible prickly feeling you get in between shaves. The only downside to her method is that it takes her around and hour to do it properly. So itaposs much more of a commitment than a quick shave in the shower. Elise continued, saying that usually events in her le will spur her on to de-hair as she puts it. That could be anything from a party or an important, face-to-face work meeting. Of course, there’s none of that at the moment during lockdown, she pointed out. Honestly it’s not just de-hairing – it’s all vanity really. Elise admitted she has felt a bit self-conscious about it all at times. She said: When I’ve been out for my walks in a sleeveless top or dress and it’s crossed my mind – I have tried to consciously keep my arms down to hide my hair .

The Good Omens and American Gods writer made the journey to his home on the Isle of Skye in breach of Scotlandaposs lockdown rules, the Daily Record reports. Writing on his blog, the writer said he travelled after he and we agreed they needed to give each other some space. He is married to singer Amanda Palmer. He described how he flew masked and gloved from Auckland Airport to Los Angelesand then on to London before borrowing a friendaposs car and driving north to Skye. For the latest on the coronavirus pandemic, read our liveblog here Only essential journeys are permitted under lockdown rules in Scotland, with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon stressing the message north of the border is aposstay at homeapos. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, who is also the MP for Skye, said: Can I just remind anyone  thinking of coming to the Highlands this is against the regulations. To come from the other end of the planet is gobsmacking. We will welcome all to the Highlands when it is safe to do so. For now stay away.  In a post on his blog on Thursday, science fiction and fantasy author Gaiman wrote: Hullo from Scotland, where I am in rural lockdown on my own. He said he was in New Zealand with his we and son Ash until two weeks ago, when the country went from level four of lockdown - which it had been on for the previous five weeks - to level three. Gaiman wrote: I flew, masked and gloved, from empty Auckland Airport to LAX, an empty international terminal with only one check-in counter open - the one for the BA flight from LAX to London. Both flights were surreal, especially the flight to London. Empty airports, mostly empty planes. It reminded me of flying a week after  : everythingaposs changed.  I landed in London about  in the morning, got a masked car service to a friendaposs house. He had a spare car , with some groceries for me in a box in the back, waiting in the drive, with the key in the lock. He added: I drove north, on empty motorways and then on empty roads, and got in about midnight, and Iaposve been here ever since. He said his family are looking forward to being together again once the world opens up and travel gets easier, and that Amanda and I are still very much together, even with half a world between us. But Gaiman has been criticised on social media for making the journey.

For updates on coronavirus, follow our live blog HERE.  The original photos were taken last month during Holy Week and show Father Pelc, of St Ambrose Parish, standing in his robes and a face mask, spraying people through their car windows. But the images have suddenly seen a spike in popularity with one having been retweeted ,, as of Sunday. The priest, who has served his parish for over  years, told TODAY heaposs got a pretty wacky mind and pretty accepting congregation - admitting they squealed in delight. The original idea was to do something for the kids of the parish, he told BuzzFeed News.They were about ready to have an Easter unlike any of their past, so I thought, what can we still do that would observe all the protocols of social distancing  Father Pelc first consulted about the safety of the idea with a doctor friend who then provided him with PPE and even joined the priest with his own kids. Referring to the imagesapos popularity online, Father Pelc said: I’m not objecting to it, this whole idea of combating evil is a good one. We all want to believe that the devil is not the most powerful force on the earth and neither is COVID-. Father Pelc went on to tell TODAY while his water pistol ploy was light hearted, the people of Detroit are taking lockdown very seriously.  He said his parish could be re-opened next Sunday for public masses but the feeling he has from people is itaposs too early. People are saying they don’t want to come out just yet. There’s still a lot of fear out there and I don’t blame them. In the meantime, the parish has been making use of livestreams and pre-recorded services, with up to three masses worth tuning in.

Darya, who was  when she found out she was expecting, said it has taken her until now to have the courage to admit the painful truth. The Russian girl’s story was earlier seen around the world after her claim highlighted in a nationwide TV show the pregnancy was from consensual sex with a boy, . Now in a new posting to her , social media followers, Darya, now , said: Here is my long awaited post about the biological dad…. “It is a painful issue for me. “I could not move away for a long time and the pain still remains in my soul.” To a question ‘Who is the father ’, she posted: “It was a rape. “I cannot tell how it happened, because it is painful to recall. “For the long time after that accident, I could not do anything, it was scary and lonely at the same time.” She previously strongly denied as “complete nonsense” a report in Russian newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda that she had been raped on an apartment block staircase by a teen boy. She continued for four months to insist the father was her friend Ivan , , with whom she says she is now in a relationship. Darya now says the report was inaccurate and that her attacker was at least  and not from her school. She said: “This man was very fat for his age. And very tall. “The most scary is that he lives in the same town, and our town is small.” Zheleznogorsk, where Darya is from, is closed to outsiders and is a key location for Russia’s nuclear industry. “I am really scared to meet him somewhere on the street,” she said. “It was in November and really on the staircase. “It was dark already and that is why no one could help. “I cannot say more, think you understand me.” But she added that she knows the name of the “rapist” and the case is being handled by a state investigator from Moscow. I told the Moscow investigator everything that happened,” she said. “This man is so far free, as after I give birth they will do a DNA test andit confirms that man, they will decide what action to take.” She said that she had been unable to tell her mother the truth for a long time. “The most offensive was that I could not tell anyone,” she said. Earlier she and the -year-old boy had stuck to their original story of how she became pregnant, despite doctors saying it was impossible.

My plan was to work as hard as I could to be part of the team.“If they wanted things done a certain way then I was going to do that to the best of my ability thenit doesn’t work out, I’ve done all I can.“There were big changes to training but going away for three weeks in pre-season to Italy was a big one. Usually you’d only be away for a week but this was a long time.“They did lay everything that was to happen out in front of you, though. However, there was a strict menu on offer –you didn’t like it, you’d go hungry.”Training too was completely dferent as Dundee adopted a football strategy that had served the Bonetti brothers in their homeland.As a future coach and boss, Smith says he learned a lot during their time in the City of Discovery, evensome elements of their approach were dficult to get to grips with.“The way they structured training was completely dferent as well but dferent managers all have dferent views,” he added.“Training would change time but we’d train every day and there were a few double sessions.“They relied on doing the same thing rigidly over and over so you knew what you were getting and there was very little change.“I have to say I learned a lot about working on shape and positional play. Previous managers had done shape but not to the extent the Bonettis worked on it.“Training could be a bit off-the-cuff sometimes. They were obviously new to coaching themselves and learning as they went.”There were high-profile disagreements as foreign signings kept Scottish players out of the starting XI.The Bonetti brothers’ volatile nature also led to fall outs behind the scenes, but Smith focused on working hard in training and reaping the rewards.“I always treat people as they treat me and the Bonettis treated me very well,” he said.“I’m not saying they did that with every player – there were definitely a few not treated as well as they should have been.“I played with players I never expected to line up alongside at Dundee. Georgi Nemsadze was wonderful, Claudio Caniggia was a top talent, but they also needed the Scottish guys like myself, Gav Rae, Steven Tweed and Willie Falconer to make the core of the team.“I don’t think the foreign guys really understood Scottish football or knew what to expect.“We all just got our heads down and knuckled down to work. I think the Bonettis appreciated that.“They were good times and I’m sure the fans wouldn’t change seeing those players in dark blue even with what happened afterwards in administration.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/eveningtelegraph/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/05/5ec13040f2f756.60239221-scaled-e1589720048678-121x84.jpg class=attachment-small size-small wp-post-image ","title":"dundee fc john nelms spfl","story":"The result of Tuesday’s failed SPFL inquiry vote has vindicated Dundee managing director John Nelms, according to a Dark Blues fan chief.Following weeks of back-biting and sniping over the Dens Park supremo’s now infamous voting U-turn at the start of April, two thirds of league clubs voted against an independent inquiry.With nine out of  Championship clubs voting ‘no’, chairman of the Dundee Supporters# Association, Kenny Ross, believes a “clear statement” has been made in relation to Nelms# actions.And Ross also insists the response from Dundee fans at large has been one of acceptance.He told the Tele: “The club seem quite relaxed about what’s been going on the past couple of weeks, not saying anything.“John Nelms doesn’t say much at the best of times but I think that relaxed attitude is echoed by the fans.“With nine out of  Championship clubs voting no, there is also a clear statement there and I think it vindicates John Nelms.“Personally, I would have liked an inquiry because there are questions that need answered but it was pretty overwhelming from Dundee’s fellow Championship clubs and % of all the clubs that it wasn’t wanted.“It’s clear from that there isn’t really a problem from most clubs on the U-turn – the majority wanted it with over % voting that way and the Deloitte inquiry said there was no wrongdoing.“With reconstruction talks ending, fans do wonder what John Nelms achieved through the U-turn but I think we are all past it now. I’ve not had anyone on to me about it all, there’s very little online about this week’s vote – I don’t think anyone really cares now.”Rangers vehemently led the call for a vote on an independent inquiry into the SPFL’s conduct during the coronavirus shutdown, as well as Dundee’s actions in changing their vote.That led to Gers fans bombarding online posts from the club and DSA social media, but Ross believes the reaction from fellow Dundee supporters is telling.He added: “Anytime the DSA are posting stuff on social media, we have to go through and delete loads of stuff.“It’s almost amusing now – Dundee fans responding generally laugh at them. Dundee have been getting hammered but they are not rising to it all and that, I think, shows the general feeling of the support.“It is bizarre because Dundee’s vote hasn’t affected Rangers really – our club has been affected more because there’s now no play-offs.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":"https://wpcluster.dctdigital.com/ginkin/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2020/05/pink-grapefruit-tonic-cheesecake-612x360.jpg ","title":"revealed dario bonetti kicked rugby park","story":"The Bonetti era at Dundee didn’t throw up many dull moments – and Kilmarnock fans will certainly remember the night assistant Dario entertained them in the stands at Rugby Park.A combination of a car accident, a paperwork error and Bonetti missing a Killie goal saw Ayrshire fans that night experience both sides of the charismatic and, at times, volatile Italian.With no place on the bench for Dark Blues assistant manager, Dario watched the game from the press box behind the home supporters in the main stand.The Evening ’s former senior football writer, Tom Duthie, had a front-row seat to the spectacle.He said: “Most of the squad had travelled the night before the game, but Dario Bonetti was heading west on the Saturday.“Unfortunately an accident blocked the main road between Glasgow and Kilmarnock and along with most fans, and press, Dario did not arrive at Rugby Park in time for kick off.“When he got there he found his name had not been included on the official list of those in the Dundee technical area and, for once, the assistant manager had to head for the stand to observe the action.“Along with full-back Marcello Marrocco, who was injured, he decided to join us in the press box at the back of the main stand.“Given that the stand is for home fans, it crossed my mind this could lead to problems because I knew there was no way the passionate Italian would stay quiet. He didn#t.“But as well as kicking every ball for his team, big Dario also engaged with the punters sitting nearby and gave them what must have been one of their most entertaining match experiences ever.“Unfortunately for Dario his late arrival meant he missed an opening goal for Killie and although Dundee equalised before the break he was still unaware of it as he headed for the dressing-room at half-time.“There were some confused players in there as he blasted them and told them they were lucky to be ahead.“When he repeated that opinion on retaking his seat for the second-half I can remember a couple of awkward minutes as Marrocco, Dundee#s press officer Niall Scott and I discussed who should be the one to tell him the correct score.“I escaped that dangerous task by pointing out I was not a club employee and they were.“If memory serves me, it was Marrocco who broke the news, to be met with an eruption from his assistant gaffer.“I should add that outside of game time, Dario was as charming as his brother.“In their first season together the pair steered Dundee to a top six finish and produced a team capable of playing football that was as pleasing on the eye as anything theof the country.“As their second season progressed, however, Ivano was making increasingly frequent trips back to Italy and it was clear all was not well behind the scenes.“It came as no surprise when he was replaced by Jim Duffy in the summer of  and in just over another year the extent of the club#s spending during the Bonetti experiment became clear as it plunged into administration and was on the brink of extinction.“For all that, Dundee fans understandably remember those two years with great fondness, as do press men like myself who experienced a time the like of which is highly unlikely to be seen again.”For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"love-island-anton-danyluks-mum-shaves-bum-joins-instagram-delight-fans","story":"Love Island star Anton Danyluks mum has become an instant hit with fans after joining Instagram."},{"url":null,"title":"tunnel-mystery-paisley-abbey-solved","story":"EXPERTS have discovered one of Scotlandrsquos best-preserved medieval tunnels was a m long drain beneath Paisley Abbey - after centuries of mystery."},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-new-transplant-system-launch-date-confirmed","story":"LEGISLATION to introduce an opt-out system of organ and tissue donation for deceased donors will come into force in Autumn ."},{"url":null,"title":"hamilton-grammar-schools-tribute-pupil-brandon-rice","story":"THE headteacher of a pupil who collapsed at home and later died has paid touching tribute to the ldquocharismatic teenager."},{"url":null,"title":"skyes-limit-sabhal-mor-ostaig---unique-gaelic-only-college-set-stunning-island-location","story":"AS global interest in Gaelic grows, students from across the world are travelling to Skye to study at Sabhal Mograver Ostaig, the National Centre for Gaelic Language and Culture."},{"url":null,"title":"jiving-gis-glasgows-george-square---ve-day-memories","story":"BONFIRES so hot they cracked tenement windows.

He was quiet, but had a way about, a really good character and integrated with the boys.“Him and Eoin Jess during my time in Aberdeen were at a dferent level from everybody  in terms of what they could do.“Arild was dferent in that he was just a natural goalscorer, but I don’t even think he liked football.“He actually said at one point ‘I don’t enjoy playing football, I just do it for the money’ and I was blown away.“He said ‘I think I want to write my own book or go into coaching. I think I’d prefer to do that.’McNaughton went on to explain, although Stavrum#s workrate wasn#t the highest, he was the type of talent who would #do nothing for  minutes and score two goals#.Injury and a less warm relationship with Paterson during Pele#s year-and-a-half at Pittodrie saw #Super Kev# making fewer Aberdeen starts, before his final two seasons under Calderwood, where he was once again a mainstay of the team.McNaughton revealed he thinks Calderwood#s tendency to chop and change his team and the lack of a domestic cup run were his downfall, despite top-six finishes and # after McNaughton#s departure # a fantastic run in the UEFA Cup which included meetings with Atletico Madrid, Lokomotiv Moscow, Copenhagen and Bayern Munich.In the episode of Northern Goal, which is available on your favourite podcast app, McNaughton also reveals the real story of his Dons departure, his reflections on owner Vincent Tan, FA Cup and League Cup losses in his time at Cardf City, as well as counting the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Craig Bellamy and Robbie Fowler as team-mates.For as little as £. a month you can access all of our content, including Premium articles."},{"url":null,"title":"bobcast podcast episode 11 coronavirus and the masters","story":"The Oban TimesUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWelcome to Episode  of the Oban Time#s BOBcast.Charting Bob#s progress  and discussing lots of other things golfare  presenters Stephen Day, George Graham and Keith McIntyre.This week we discuss the effect of the Corona virus  on the tours, Steevie#s discovery of old golf clubs which he hopes might make him his fortune, Rangefinders and other golf tech and we take a quick visit to the old course in St. AndrewsAn entertaining listen which you can download for freePlay or download the episode in the link below"},{"url":null,"title":"argyll rallyers in inverness action","story":"Rachel CarruthersUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsThe opening round of the  KNC Groundworks Scottish Rally Championships took place in and around Inverness last weekend with a good entry of  cars.The event, on Saturday March , was three weeks later than usual to try and avoid the worst of the weather. There were, however, large sections of the stages still swathed in snow and ice, making conditions changeable to say the least.Lochgilphead#s Alister MacArthur was back in the forests, after a two-and-a-half year break, in the MR Motorsport prepared Talbot Sunbeam. Co-driver Claire Tilley, from Craignure, Mull, had only completed one event prior to this in the car and that was on tarmacadam and mostly in the dark of Mull Rally. Gravel, snow and ice would be a whole dferent concept in the powerful rear wheel drive car.The car has seen development over the past season and the five stages ahead that day would be as much a test as a genuine attempt to score points.However, after a relatively clean run through the  miles of Stage  # the stage that claimed a large number of competitors due to the slippy conditions # thoughts quickly turned to getting up the leaderboard and grabbing as many championship points as possible.The crew had made it to the afternoon sitting in th place overall and a very quick run through Stage  saw them climb to st. Drama nearly robbed them of a great result when the alternator stopped working and the battery started to go flat in the last  miles of Lochletter , with Alister switching off all but the bare essential electric components to try and make it to the finish. Finish they did and in nd place overall and third in Class . A brilliant start to the new season.Also heading north to Inverness to compete was Ian Parker, whose normal seat in the MkII had been withdrawn as the car wasn#t ready.

Included in this is the Isle of Jura.This is as shockingly reckless as it is offensive.The Isle of Jura is not a #bolthole# as the Daily Mail has chosen to state but a very beautul island steeped in culture and rich history.On both Jura and Islay we, like so many rural areas, are struggling to deal with all of the challenges related to the Corona virus out break. Our local health services have very limited resources as it is, along side a population that has many elderly residents who are more at risk to the virus.We have seen a local uptick in people traveling to Islay in camper vans and this is happening at a time when the UK government is advising against non essential travel.Those who are choosing to travel to our islands of Islay, Jura and the many other islands in Argyll and Bute in order to avoid the coronavirus may end up inadvertently spreading it to islands who arenot as much affected in the same way as so many built up urban areas are. Such actions are as reckless as they are selfish and I would implore people who do not need to travel to our rural constituency to avoid doing so until this global pandemic has passed.Jura, Islay and the rest of Argyll are some of the most beautul places you will ever visit and you won#t find an area where the people are more hospitable and friendly but while this crisis is ongoing I would ask everyone who is not currently living here to avoid traveling here for the time being.Councillor Alastair Redman # Kintyre and Islands ward.To the Scottish public,During this time of unprecedented uncertainty, we are all concerned about the safety and wellbeing of our families, friends and colleagues.Our hearts go out to those who have been affected personally by the outbreak of coronavirus , as well as the many communities around the world that are facing extreme measures in an attempt to slow its spread.We appreciate and are mindful of the challenges iniduals are currently facing as well as the impact this pandemic has had on our vital emergency services as well as the grocery retail sector, supply chain and producers.Like our retail partners, we want to take this opportunity to assure you that Scottish farmers, auctioneers, hauliers, processors and butchers are doing everything they can to maintain the ongoing availability of fresh, locally sourced Scotch Beef PGI, Scotch Lamb PGI and Specially Selected Pork.We would like to thank all those who work in the Scottish red meat industry and their families for their ongoing and unwavering efforts to keep our supermarket shelves and butcher shops stocked, fuelling Scotland with top-quality red meat during this challenging time.As bodies supporting the Scottish agricultural and red meat industry, we are constantly reviewing the developing situation and are doing all we can to support everyone involved in putting nutritious food on your plates.Alan Clarke, chief executive, Quality Meat ScotlandMartin Morgan, executive manager, Scottish Association of Meat Wholesalers Duncan Todd, secretary, Scottish Beef Association Jen Craig, president, National Sheep Association Scotland Penny Montgomerie, chief executive, Scottish Association of Young Farmers Clubs and Gordon King, executive manager, Scottish Craft Butchers.What on earth is going on  It was banal enough when Ben Goldsmith # English financier and environmentalist # tweeted that #overgrazing# by upland sheep farmers, was responsible for the devastating floods in South Wales, rather than record-breaking torrential rainfall.Unbelievably we now have a government official, Dr Tim Leunig, suggesting the whole of the UK does not need farming, and his comparison of the UK to Singapore in this context is absolutely ludicrous. You truly have to wonderthere is something in the water that he is drinking – could it be flood contamination Surely, every person having a full and ing set of neurons and synapses, the complete opposite is the truth, as we dearly need our hard working farming community.The UK Government should be fully supporting the farming industry and indeed, good land management. The Welsh Assembly has totally lost its way with its mindless policy of devastating Welsh forests with thousands and thousands # an understatement # of trees being felled for wind farms, and compounding the felony by covering acres of land with very limited electricity generating solar parks # Wales is not the Sahara and the sun disappears at night! Solar  will generate about  per cent of their maximum capacity in the UK.Returning to farming perhaps some kind person should tell Dr Tim Leunig that the answer lies in the soil and then lead him to a darkened and quiet room so he can lie down and contemplate the truth # wise men recognise that truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.Dave Haskell, Cardigan."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 3 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : amLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsWe join our communities in applauding the people at the sharp end of the coronavirus outbreak.In this time of crisis, we have nothing but admiration for frontline health, care and other local authority staff # and even management # who are having to deal with the virus close-up.Let#s not forget everyone  working on for the benefit of our society, from shop workers to lorry drivers and the emergency services # and many more besides.

From his throne he dispensed news, advice and anecdotes – albeit not always historically accurate. His inimitable irony, perfectly-timed humour and the occasional reprimand to a wayward customer were all fuelled by a generous glass.As former president of the Scottish Licensed Trade Association and Keeper of the Quaich, Donald knew the intricacies of the business intimately from personal experience. His taste was eclectic and his appetite substantial, extending from Dom Perignon and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru to Tennent’s lager and Glen Dronach single malt. On a hot day he’d have an icy Martini or a gin and tonic, proportionately scaled up in a pint glass. Being askedhe had time for a quick ‘small one’, he would reply: #I’ll decide the size for myself,you don’t mind.#The records suggest that his frequent claim to be Scottish Slimmer of the Year, after getting his weight down from  stone to  stone, was fancul.Big D, as he was often called, was fastidious about standards in the little public bar, training his regulars to clear tables of empty glasses and plates promptly, and to keep the log fire stoked on winter evenings.If one of his regulars turned up untypically well-dressed, Donald would raise an eyebrow in mild surprise:  #What’s the occasion for the suit   A funeral   Your latest marriage   Or has your court case come up #In summer, an erratic stream of foreign tourists would have their first encounter with a Scottish pub, standing in the doorway bewildered as to what happens next – sit or stand  Fight their way to the mobbed bar or go to a table and wait for the non-existent waitress  Donald would call them over to his corner and was soon plying them with drinks, food and conversation, not infrequently paying the entire bill for his astonished guests.When a tourist asked him about the quaint red GPO telephone box in Church Square, he told them: #We have the fastest modern communications here – telephone, teletext and tell Donald.#Donald was a Francophile and loved his summers in Collioure, where #Le Grand Ecossais# was almost as well-known as in Argyll. A fixture of the local bars and restaurants, and frequently crossing the border to patronise Spanish hostelries, he revelled in the region’s seafood, wine and culture.His hobbies included cooking, opera, reading and lively conversation on a sweeping range of topics from local history to civil engineering. His knowledge was genuinely wide, but when occasionally encountering someone with a superior command of the topic in question, he would quickly change the subject and admonish: “Och, you’re showing off now.”Donald Clark was born on  July , in Rotten Row hospital, Glasgow. He was the youngest child of Donald Clark and Elizabeth Inglis, following by nine years his only sibling, Fiona.His early years were spent in Inveraray where family le revolved around his parents’ hotel in the little white-washed town.He was schooled at Inveraray Primary and Larchfield in Helensburgh, then Strathallan from  to  where he acquired his love of sports. Contrary to what his dimensions in later le would suggest, he was athletic when young, excelling at rugby and playing for his school and West of Scotland First XV and the old boys’ As.Donald also enjoyed curling, motor boating, snow skiing and water-skiing, where his party piece was to mono-ski down Loch Fyne while drinking a pint of beer.Although not a shinty player, he used his sports experience to coach the Inveraray team in the s and like his father chaired the club.

They feed on flying insects and spend most of their le in the air # including when they sleep # usually coming down to earth to breed. They are fast fliers, often chasing one another over buildings when they give a screeching call.Swts arrive back in Argyll in early May and breed in towns, villages and other buildings in Argyll. They spend around three months in Argyll, departing early-mid August to their wintering grounds in Africa.The British Trust for Ornithology’s Breeding Bird Survey indicates the population of Swts in Scotland has declined by around  per cent since . A similar decline has taken place in England and Wales. The reasons for the decline are not fully known but are believed to be related to changes in insect numbers and a lack of nesting sites as buildings are modernised.Argyll is at the north-western limit of the world range of Swts. Their distribution and numbers in Argyll is not well-known and the purpose of the Argyll Bird Club Survey is to try to find out the size of the breeding population and where they remain.If you have a Swt nesting in your building, or near you, or would like to take part in this survey further information is available at http:argyllbirdclub.org argyll-surveysFor more information about Argyll Bird Club, email Jim Dickson at Argyllbirder@outlook."},{"url":null,"title":"letters to the editor april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsSir,A few weeks ago I launched an appeal on social media aimed at supporting nurses and medics at the Mid Argyll Hospital during this terrible COVID- pandemic.I was initially trying to find outthere was anyone locally who might be interested in dusting down their sewing machine to make a few sets of protective ‘scrubs’ to donate to the hospital. Within a couple of days the response was staggering.There were volunteers from all corners of Mid Argyll willing to sew, donate material and give freely of their time. Local businesses were also quick to respond with offers of material, pattern printing and transport for moving stock around.I am overwhelmed by the support and generosity of people in Mid Argyll. They have risen to the challenge and far exceeded my expectations.We have around  stitchers from Cairndow to Ardfern, and villages and towns in between, producing brightly coloured ‘scrubs’ using mainly donated fabric, scrap material and jazzy duvet covers. The first donation of ‘scrubs’ is expected to be handed over to the hospital this week and we are sure they will brighten up the wards.Our crowdfunding page, ‘Let’s Get Scrubbing for Mid Argyll’, was originally set up to buy everything to make the scrubs. It has broken the original £ target and we would love to hit the £, mark so please feel free to donate.I am overwhelmed and humbled by this experience and publicly thank the group team leaders, the volunteer stitchers, those working behind the scenes and the wider community for their support and generosity.My thanks is also extended to the following businesses who have helped in so many ways: MacLeod Construction, Kit-You-Out, Mary’s Meals, Top Designer, West Coast Motors, LG Upholstery, Clock Tower, Tarbert COS Thrt Shop, Premier Laundry, Ian Y McIntyre, Willie Leitch Sailmaker, Owen Sails and the Lithgow Family at Ormsary Estate.Nikki Thompson, Ardrishaig.Sir,The time will come when we are through the turmoil of this pandemic but as we work our way through it, I wanted to share a situation that reflects the actions of many.I was recently collecting shopping in Tarbert for registered vulnerable people and, as I was taking off my gloves before getting into the car, I was aware of another#s presence close by pushing a mobile rubbish bin. It was Damon. He saw me about to put my gloves into the rubbish bag in my own car and said cheerily #You can pop them into this bin here,you like#.I was so taken by that gesture. What an example of initiative, thoughtfulness and kindness. It summed up the incredible work of so many volunteers, co-ordinated by Team Tarbert#s Fiona, with Margaret co-ordinating prescriptions, and many others.Perhaps there is no better time for us all to reaquaint ourselves with Rudyard Kipling#s poem #If#.It seems to perfectly summarise humanity working at its best, in which, during this crisis, thanks to so many, Tarbert can walk tall. Stay safe.Peter Minshall, Tarbert.Sir,I write regarding the Argyllshire Advertiser edition dated Friday April  and the front page heading #Hospital prepares for Pandemic#.The article states: #No figures have been released about the incidence of coronavirus in Argyll and Bute# because the HSCP spokesperson said #we are following national guidance and due to reasons of patient confidentiality we will not be able to make public where in the Highland health board areas the positive cases are#.This statement is complete nonsense and shows either the HSCP in Argyll has not been privy to this information or they are just using the term #national guidance# as a smokescreen and an excuse and or sheer incompetence.No-one was asking them for patients# names and addresses, merely figures of those affected in a given area.The people appointed to positions of responsibility in Argyll and Bute HSCP are hopeless when it comes to joined-up thinking and accountability.All they will do is spin you a line and quote stuff like #national guidelines#, which is code for #I don#t have a clue#.Karl Edwards, LochgilpheadSir,Scottish and Southern Electricity Networksis extending the support it provides to those most vulnerable by expanding the eligibility of its Priority Services Registerto include customers at increased risk of severe illness during the coronavirus pandemic.Nearly , customers already receive additional care and support through SSEN’s PSR – a free, tailored service.In addition to those self-isolating or shielding for  weeks, customers are eligiblethey:Julie Walker, SSEN."},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column april 24 2020","story":"Colin CameronUpdated:   , : pmLikeGoogle +TweetEmailWant to  We value our content, so access to our full site is  only available on subscription.Your subscription entitles you to -day-a-week access to our website, plus a full digital copy of that week#s paper to read on your pc mac or mobile device.And there#s more # your subscription includes access to digital archive copies from  onwardsMidton has been making the distinctive and coveted awards for the Royal Television Society for the past  years # and this week the company#s resourcefulness in adapting to face shield production was acknowledged by the society.

Greece, Cyprus, Croatia and Bulgaria, all of which Joussen described as ldquowell prepared for summer tourism.Austria and Denmark were named as possible destinations as well, being among a number of EU countries that are starting to reopen their borders.However, the roll out of flights to Europe will have to be done gradually, and in line with both government guidance on travel and the lting of EU borders.Holidays to Europe are also likely to be hindered by the  day quarantine period being enforced by many countries, with tourists faced with spending two weeks in quarantine in Spain before being able to start their holiday.In contrast, visits to France and Ireland will be unhindered by such rules.How will TUI make its hotels safe The package holiday specialist has outlined a ten-point plan, detailing how hotels will operate after lockdown is lted.Plans include restrictions on its popular self-service buffets, which are due to be reduced to a minimum.Instead, food and beverages will be served to guests by staff wearing protective masks, where possible.The measures will be implemented across all of the companyrsquos own-brand hotels, and will also be made ldquoavailable to joint-venture and partner hotels.Guests will face limits on their range of entertainment and activities, with football tournaments set to be banned.Only events, sports and entertainment that involve a small number of participants, and without close contact, will be made available.Other measures include online check-ins, maintaining social distancing in public areas, such as gyms and corridors, and reduced capacity in restaurants, with longer opening hours to spread guest usage.There will also be an increase in disinfectant dispensers throughout TUIrsquos hotels, and ldquoextensive new cleaning practices will be implemented for rooms.TUI said that its new  point plan is in addition to statutory regulations, which will be put in place at all of the holiday destinations where it operates.The

Their first request had been to buy a large toy car theyrsquod seen in some YouTube video, filmed by a wealthy family.You can picture the discussion after that. But thatrsquos when the alternative idea came to me.ldquoWell we could make a bogey cart, I said.Laughter at that expression followed of course, but I was sure I had the name right.It was from my childhood, so I Googled it and showed them what I meant, and they immediately agreed.Then I thought ldquowhat have I done  as I had no idea how to make one!I do have vague recollections of making semi-lethal bogey carts when I was wee using wheels from discarded prams and boxes or planks of wood. I still have a scar on my right knee from a bogey crash.If I could do it in my childhood, surely I could build one now I reasoned. Irsquom not very skilled at these things, but maybe thatrsquos because I havenrsquot tried.Besides, I had the expectations of my children to meet, and so I took on the challenge.It seemed to be a good lockdown activity. The first problem was the lack of materials. I recall a fish box was the best to use, and sturdy pram wheels but, during the lockdown especially, these items are not so easy to acquire.A friend kindly gave me a pallet, and I searched YouTube for advice. My heart began to sink.The videos were all made by people with workshops, tools and carpentry skills I lack. Their fancy-looking perfectly made carts just raised my childrenrsquos hopes.ldquoYea dad, one like that.I could feel my manhood was at stake.My daughter looked at me sympathetically and said: ldquoI know yoursquore busy with other things as well dad.So she gave me a generous five days to construct it.I managed to scavenge some wheels from a toy pram, helped again by a friend, and stood looking at the raw materials, trying to make a design in my imagination.I knew what a bogey cart was supposed to look like, but how to make something with the materials I had seemed a huge challenge.I set to work. I sawed and hammered, and made a good impression of looking like I knew what I was doing.But design challenges, in particular how to fit the wheels I had, which were on a frame, meant that the concept needed refined, and reduced in size.My daughter watched as I stood looking confused then determined then confused again.ldquoI overheard her asking her mum, lsquodo you think dad knows what he is doing rsquoSo I enlisted my childrenrsquos help, sawing and hammering together. At least this way we could all share in the glory, or shame, of the final product!At the time of writing I still have three days left to complete the task. In two days I have managed to make what I have euphemistically called ldquoa prototype a completely new concept in home-made go carts.It looks unsafe just now, but I must emphasise it is unfinished but the basic idea is there. I just hope BMW donrsquot steal the concept!The kids have named it the ldquobug, because itrsquos so small, and, well, looks like a bug!ldquoItrsquos a new kind of cart, a bug-cart! proclaimed my boy.I have three days to find a way to make this bug ldquofly safely.The lockdown is taking its toll on many families but the extra time it is giving some of us with family is one of the benefits. Finding creative activities to do during this time isnrsquot always easy.My kids have become hooked on screen activities which normally wersquod restrict. But these are not normal times, and I think parents need to give ourselves some slack and not worry too much. But there is a sense that this time has grounded many of us in simple meaning.Many of us are sharing skills, like baking, cooking, making things, learning activities, which before we often had little time to do together. But also rediscovering lost skills, or learning new ones by necessity, and making do with what we have like starting off making a bogie cart and ending with a ldquobug.The truth is, of course, itrsquos the quality of the time spent together as much as the quality of the final product that is important. Well, that will certainly be my story when the final version is unveiled!Itrsquos such a time of contradictory emotions I long for the end of the lockdown and the separation from other loved ones, and the loss and anxiety it means.But having this time to fill with meaning also feels like a huge privilege a kind of bittersweet liberation of my time.I have guilt about this, and like others, Irsquom trying to help out to compensate.But let us never forget that this time, and our safety, is made possible by the essential workers who are hard at work, keeping society going at such a dangerous time, and saving lives.Their skills and contributions have so often been taken for granted and unacknowledged.It has brought into sharp focus the  notion that low pay equates with ldquolow skilled work.The reality is that many who are low paid are, in fact, highly skilled and, as we are discovering, the most essential workers.I hope one of the legacies of this time will be a real recognition of the vital skills of many low paid workers, by valuing their work, both with status and proper pay.Letrsquos build statues to essential workers, instead of politicians and generals, and express gratitude for their contribution.And commit to being part of the change afterwards that will make this happen.Such were my thoughts as I assembled the ldquobug ndash my makesht haphazard invention of our lockdown time. I hope I will complete it by the deadline.In my area of East Lothian there is a community Facebook page where we can share our stories from this historic period.The ldquobug will be part of my contribution.We will all have our dferent lockdown legacies and stories to remember and record for posterity.

He then fails to make the connection between lack of these scarce resources with \"draconian laws to enforce an ill-advised blanket lockdown\". The lockdown followed the scarcity as night follows day.There is no mention in the professors letter of the elephant in the room, which may well have been peeking over his shoulder as he wrote. The complete lack of preparedness within the NHS and the private care home sector to handle a surge of infections was the driver for the lockdown. The question which must be answered is why we were so badly prepared, and the answer is staring us in the face, or perhaps even standing beside us in the room  years of Westminster-driven austerity left the NHS so stretched that our resources in every area, PPE to ventilators, were lacking, that is why \"the draconian laws\" to enforce lockdown were required.At least Prof Ennos eventually comes to a cogent solution, and I make no apologies for quoting him: \"The time has come for the Scottish Government to admit past mistakes, pluck up its courage and lead us out of this grotesque lockdown so that we can live in a Scotland where risk is present but pragmatically managed, and our economy, education, culture and inidualism can thrive.\"Quite so.

I have no means of checking the figures and dates he gives, but he willbe aware that the incubation period for Covid- lies somewhere between five and  days. Aside from the index case who brought the virus to the conference, anyone exposed on the th or th of February would be expected, therefore, to exhibit symptoms at the earliest around March and, at the latest, about March . Most likely, many cases were presenting somewhere in between, so it is highly likely that, as early as March  , only a suspicion of an outbreak could have been forming, given most cases would have developed later. Maybe the early contacts were colleagues who had journeyed to the conference with the index case and who, thus, were exposed earlier. Mr Mackay doesnt know and neither do I, but the recognition of the fullness of the outbreak would not have happened until much later.As a retired consultant in microbiology infection control, it irritated me back then when dealing with infection outbreaks, and it still irritates me now, to read such speculative nonsense spouted in the press, usually nowhere near the truth, when the actuality is that a dedicated team will have been working their socks off to control this incident and protect the public.

The population occupies breeding grounds eastwards from Scandinavia towards Siberia.The dotterel is unusual in that it turns the tables on traditional gender roles. The brightly-coloured females lead in courtship before leaving the smaller, drabber males to incubate the eggs and raise the young, and for this reason the species has been counted by the number of breeding males rather than pairs. There are only about - breeding males in the Uk.A new study published by Global Change Biology explores the potential ways that changing environmental conditions may be driving the decline and has found limited evidence that the decline in breeding is driven by climate change of dotterels.It research focuses on snow cover and nitrogen deposition. The amount of snow-cover is important for cold-adapted species of plants and animals.Fewer snow patches, around which dotterel feed, may lead to a reduction in peak insect abundance for chicks and cause unsuitable higher vegetation.Higher deposition of nitrogen tends to result in a reduction of alpine specialist plants, including species of mosses that form key breeding habitats for dotterel.Population declines and site abandonment by dotterel in Scotland during the last three decades have largely occurred at lower elevations, suggesting climate change may be the cause.However, the new study found relatively limited evidence that the decline in the breeding population is being driven by climatic factors on the breeding grounds, despite it previously being mooted as the primary reason.\"Climate change and anthropogenic nitrogen deposition are widely regarded as important drivers of environmental change in alpine habitats. However, due to the dficulties working in high-elevation mountain systems, the impacts of these drivers on alpine breeding species have rarely been investigated,\" the study said.\"The Eurasian dotterelis a migratory wader, which has been the subject of uniquely long-term and spatially widespread monitoring effort in Scotland, where it breeds in alpine areas in dwindling numbers.\"Here we analyse data sets spanning three decades, to investigate whether key potential drivers of environmental change in Scottish mountainshave contributed to the population decline of dotterel.\"We also consider the role of rainfall on the species wintering grounds in North Africa.The study said: \"We found dotterel declines in both density and site occupancy of breeding males primarily occurred on low and intermediate elevation sites.\"High-elevation sites mostly continued to be occupied, but males occurred at lower densities in years following snow-rich winters, suggesting high-elevation snow cover displaced dotterel to lower sites.\"Wintering ground rainfall was positively associated with densities of breeding males two springs later.\"Dotterel densities were reduced at low and intermediate sites where nitrogen deposition was greatest, but not at high-elevation sites.\"While climatic factors explained iation in breeding density between years, they did not seem to explain the species uphill retreat and decline.ldquoWe cannot rule out the possibility that dotterel have increasingly settled on higher sites previously unavailable due to extensive snow cover, while changes associated with nitrogen deposition may also have rendered lower lying sites less suitable for breeding."},{"url":null,"title":"kezia-dugdale-dark-day-devolution-lords-better-embraced-technology-holyrood","story":"The Scottish Parliament was again asked to rise to the challenge of scrutiny in the face of a global pandemic but took weeks to establish its own Covid committee, following all the old rules.

Itrsquos a dark day for devolution when the House of Lords has better embraced technology.Reluctance to a virtual Parliament comes from the belief that it offers a poorer quality of debate and scrutiny than ldquothe real thing.

Asthe theatre of politics was what makes good laws and holds the powerful to account.The New Zealand Parliament has long had a % rule in place, where the whips of one party can cast % of their partyrsquos vote as long as % of its members are present.

It also might just make elected office more attractive to under-represented groups, particularly those with caring responsibilitiesThe criticism of this system is that it puts too much power in the hands of the whips. But that ignores the untrammelled power they have already, often exercised on a whim and informed by baggage and trades.Keeping MSPs two metres apart at the moment brings the capacity of the chamber down to  MSPs.

Railways were new and fast. A railway, they believed, could have brought prosperity to desperately poor crofters and cotters, opened up the Isle of Lewis to new trade, and helped extinguish troublesome land raids and civil disobedience which had become an all too familiar element of island le.Branching off the Dingwall-to-Skye line slightly east of Garve station, the proposed track would have powered steam trains upland, following the road past the Black Water river, through the Glascarnoch glen and rising to ft towards Braemore Lodge and the estate owned by Fowler, already celebrated as one of Britainrsquos most acclaimed engineers.If the scenery didnrsquot take the breath away from railway passengers, surely the prospect of a steep descent towards the head of Loch Broom would have.Or, the engineersrsquo preferred option, a tunnel carved through the hillside which would bring them, blinking, into glorious sight of the mouth of the River Broom sprawling before them.:Scotlandrsquos  best train journeysOnce in Ullapool, rail travellers would simply have stepped from their carriages at a terminus built at the junction of the townrsquos Shore Street and Quay Street, mere steps away from the ferry to the Isle of Lewis, and potentially one of the most magnicent settings imaginable for a railway station.However, as a forthcoming book written by Andrew Drummond, the best-laid plans of even one of the nationrsquos most celebrated engineers was set to go horribly wrong.And a combination of competition, lack of funds, ided communities and a frustrating lack of support from Westminster would eventually see plans stop, start, run out of steam and then hit the buffers for good.ldquoIt was all a bit of guddle, says Drummond, whose book, A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway, will be published this year.ldquoThere were a lot of shenanigans between government, promoters, the Highland Railway Company and other people sticking their oar in.ldquoThere was the extraordinary attitude of civil servants in London, who were very dismissive of the whole thing.ldquoIn fact, the title of the book ndash A Quite Impossible Proposal ndash was one of the comments made by one of the chaps in London.The Ullapool-to-Garve railway proposal was the first of what would eventually become half a dozen railway schemes touted for the area during a boom time in Victorian engineering which unlocked areas of Britain which previously would have taken hours of discomfort by carriages and carts to reach.While the prospect of a train to Ullapool might have tourists today regretting decisions of the past, its vision was not built around their needs, but in herring, crofting and poverty.ldquoThe scheme for the Garve-to-Ullapool railway goes back at least  years before it was given Royal Assent in August , he says.ldquoThe crofters and fishermen of Lewis and Skye had been in revolt. Crofters were invading land, taking it back for themselves and the government was sending troops in to sort it out.ldquoIn the early s, the government had become a bit anxious and the Napier Commission was tasked with looking into the social and economic problems around crofting and fishing.Centred on Stornoway, the fishing industryrsquos biggest problem was getting freshly-caught herring to markets in London, Liverpool and Manchester.The idea of switching from steamers to steam trains captured the imagination of Sir John Fowler. Yorkshire-born, he was one of those Victorian masterminds who appeared capable of just about anything.As chief engineer of the politan Railway in London, he created the worldrsquos first underground railway and laid the foundations for routes which today form most of the London Undergroundrsquos Circle Line. In , he was paid handsomely: the equivalent of almost pound million in todayrsquos money, leading to comments that ldquono engineer in the world was so highly paid.The money helped him to buy the sprawling ,-acres Braemore and Inverbroom estate near Ullapool, where, as well as the suspension bridge across Corrieshalloch Gorge, he put his engineering skills to work building Braemore House on a mountainside ft above sea level, from blue-coloured stone retrieved from a nearby quarry.Surelyanyone could oversee the construction of  miles of railway track from Garve to Ullapool it had to be him ldquoThe line from Garve to Ullapool would have had three sections. The first, Garve to Braemore, would have been very straightforward, adds Drummond.ldquoBut at Braemore, therersquos this steep descent to sea level before the final stretch to Ullapool, again fairly straightforward.ldquoThe tricky part was going down the hill.ldquoThere were all manner of exciting ideas involving both the north and south sides of the valley, but both were steep.ldquoThe southside would have used tunnels and viaducts. It would have been a bit like a helter skelter, butI have confidence in anything it would be confidence in Victorian engineers to do anything they wanted.While some huffed and puffed over the challenges of creating the line, others questioned the suitability of Ullapool as a harbour for the ships arriving to transport countless tonnes of herring.ldquoOne inquirysaid Ullapool was beset by rocks and reefs so ships could not possibly get in there, which clearly isnrsquot the case.ldquoBut the really dficult thing wasnrsquot so much the engineering, it was getting the money together and the government did not want to help.Despite ious commissions and committees to probe ways to improve the fortunes of poverty-stricken island and Highland communities, few positive suggestions were taken up and even fewer received funding.If they wanted to push ahead, the proposers of the Ullapool rail link faced funding the pound, project themselves ndash around poundm in todayrsquos money ndash or finding an established railway business willing to take it on.ldquoThe Highland Railway Company virtually had a monopoly in the north and west of Inverness, and they were not keen on competition, adds Drummond.ldquoThey wanted to extend their line from Dingwall to Stromeferry, on to Kyle of Lochalsh. They didnrsquot want any other lines going to the west coast.Yet common sense and geography should have made the Ullapool route the more attractive. ldquoStornoway to Ullapool is  miles at most, but Stornoway to Kyle of Lochalsh is closer to  miles, says Drummond.If financial support was proving challenging, so too was getting everyone on board the Ullapool express.Some simply preferred the Kyle of Lochalsh option, others argued that shting herring stocks made it dficult to predict the best locations for a rail link.ldquoLewis was practically riven down the middle, adds Drummond.Meanwhile, angry letters were exchanged in newspapers from both sides arguing for and against.ldquoThe Act of Parliament of  had a clause thatwork wasnrsquot undertaken within three years, it would be null and void, says Drummond.While the Ullapool backers fumed, the Highland Railway Company pressed ahead with its Kyle of Lochalsh extension. The -mile section of railway took three years to build and opened in  ndash due to the challenging landscape, it did receive government support.ldquoThat was the galling thing. Someone  got some money but the engineering dficulties were just as bad, explains Drummond.Determined not to be beaten, the proposers of the Garve-to-Ullapool railway carried on. There were further attempts to achieve their dream in , ,  and . Of course, none were successful, leaving the question: what might have been ldquoThe railway would have brought not just fishing trade through Ullapool but all the stuff that hangs off that, says Drummond. ldquoThere was the potential for people travelling to and from work, the provision of education, and medical facilities might have been so much better.ldquoAnd, of course, opening up the railway would open up tourism earlier.Dr Iain Robertson of the Centre for History at the University of the Highlands and Islands, agrees the railway could have brought a long-lasting positive impact.ldquoIt would have been a real tourist asset, he says.ldquoJust as therersquos the Glenfinnan Viaduct that has become a huge attraction, the line towards the head of Loch Broom would have been really spectacular.ldquoYou can certainly imagine a steam train rumbling through the glens on its way to Ullapool.Parallels between opposition and debate over the Ullapool line might well be drawn with todayrsquos controversial HS high-speed link between London and the north, he adds.ldquoThe Garve-to-Ullapool line was very, very isive ndash itrsquos a theme that runs through big railway developments wherever you find them. In this case you have a strong crofting culture, the area is allied to the Free Church, and there may be opposition to any attempt to modernise and change.ldquoHerring shoals can come and go without any warning. And basing your economics on an unpredictable species like herring would have been risky.Drummond, meanwhile, believes Ullapool, with its scattering of whitewashed buildings at the end of a long, twisting road, could today easily have been reaping the benefits of a rail link and still retained its charm.Andother railway proposals to open up sections of Lewis and Skye had also materialised, road congestion from too many tourists would certainly not have posed the same issues as they do today.ldquoThe rail extension to Kyle of Lochalsh didnrsquot cause Mallaig to suffer, adds Drummond.ldquoYou can only wonder at what dference a railway to Ullapool might have made.A Quite Impossible Proposal: How Not To Build A Railway by Andrew Drummond will be published in September by Birlinn.What might have been: the lines that were never builtA spate of railway proposals emerged at around the same time which would have transformed the northwest corner of Scotland.Others would have created rail links between communities now booming thanks to the North Coast  road route.One suggested a rail link between Achnasheen in Ross-shire and Aultbea on the shores of Loch Ewe while another proposed a connection on the Far North Line between Lairg in Sutherland with Laxford.A further plan was lodged for a link between Culrain and Lochinver.Meanwhile, the Hebridean Light Railway Company had plans for Skye and Lewis, with routes that would have transformed island le and tourism.It suggested a line in Skye would have connected the port of Isleornsay with ferries at Mallaig, and another at the port of Uig on the northwest to link with ferries to Stornoway.Another line was proposed between Stornoway and Carloway on Lewis, with branch lines at Breasclete and Dunvegan.None, however, would be built.The only one proposed was an extension of the West Highland Line from Banavie near Fort William to Mallaig.

Every quarter of an hour I tip out another bucket of stones on to the cairn behind the woodshed. What began as a pimple is now half way to Ben Nevis. Some of the stones can be classied as boulders, which is where Alan comes in.I never thought of myself as having anything in common with Robert Burns, but discovering the ratio of stone to soil on your patch makes you realise what he and his brother had to contend with on Mossgiel farm, which was famously rocky and unyielding. As Irsquove worked over the earth, square foot at a time, the ground level has been gradually dropping, so that soon wersquoll have a sunken garden.Digging is good for letting the mind roam, but it leaves little energy for anything . While you can see how Burns might compose poetry during his rural drudgery, it is obvious why Seamus Heaney did not follow his family on to the farm. Among his most famous poems, and one of my favourites, is Digging, where he recalls watching his late father in the potato drills ndash ldquoBy God, the old man could handle a spade. The loss he still felt is palpable. Yet while he chose not to till the earth, like his brothers, he would instead use his pen as a spade, digging up ideas and his countryrsquos past.One of our neighbours spent years clearing their garden of rocks and detritus, more of which would surface whenever it rained. Among the tell-tale trophies they unearthed was a childrsquos school slate. I remember the weekend when I was a young girl when my father, digging, came upon a curved brick, and then another, eventually revealing a neat circle above the village spring, that had been filled in long ago. ldquoWell, well, well, he said. I still hope for such a find, but perhaps wersquove not been delving deep enough. All that has come to light so far has been fragments of china and pottery.The other evening, though, something interesting did turn up. I thought it was just a small animal bone but, after tossing it aside, retrieved it for a second look. Brushing off the earth, I found a hollowed-out flattish tube, with a pinhole opening at one end, stamped with neat letters. It was the stem of a clay pipe, the sort Silas Marner would have clamped between his teeth. Later, I found out it was from the Victorian pipe-making firm of William Christie, which operated in the Calton in Glasgow, from . A few years ago, the remains of the factory were excavated, including the kiln in which this pipe was very likely fired. Given that Christiersquos produced around , pipes a week, many of us probably have one under our feet.Irsquove always been fascinated by the things produced by metal detectorists or those with inquisitive dogs. Last week, I told Alan about the discovery of a ,-year-old Parthian warrior in Iran, whose teeth were in such good condition that a dentist who examined the skeleton said they were like implants. Alan was unimpressed, saying the real story was that theyrsquod been able to get hold of a dentist who, these days, are as rare as hensrsquo teeth.The clipping, mowing and shearing in Hoolet seems set to continue. While we all grow thatch, no weed or wild grass is allowed to rear its head. Only the village green has been letting the side down, turning into a meadow where the tip of squirrelsrsquo tails give away their position. Last weekend, a socially distanced posse resembling the Magnicent Seven set to work after a couple of hours of mowing, strimming, grass-gathering and edging, the green now looks fit for a game of bowls.Usually this is the councilrsquos job, a man with a sit-on mower and face mask whirling around the trees asdoing a cycling proficiency test. This year, however, an email sent to the council, asking when we could expect a mower, was met with a swt and polite reply. There would be no grass-cutting for a while, an official explained, because the men who normally do it are too busy digging graves."},{"url":null,"title":"scots-chef-paul-tamburrini-brings-latest-family-lockdown-feasts-table","story":"Cooking for his family has seen him develop new creations.Last year, Paul left his role at the Macdonald Holyrood Hotel in Edinburgh to embark on a culinary tour.Chicken and noodle broth, olive oil Serves Chicken stock - ingredients.K Chicken wings small white onion, finely diced  celery stock finely dicedSprig of thymeMethod - put the wings into a large pot and cover with cold water, drain and refresh with cold water - place over a medium heat and simmer, skim and discard any impurities that rise to the surface, add the onions, celery  thyme to the stock and turn the heat to a low settingContinue to simmer the stock carefully for around six hours - strain the stock through a fine sieve and refrigerateBroth ingredientsg fine noodles or you can also easily substitute with vermicelli  - litre Chicken stockml extra virgin olive oilCracked black pepperSoy sauce to tasteTo serveHeat up the chicken stock and pout over the fine noodles for  minutes  gently season.

As time went on, however, the interview became more of a discussion about risk and whether it could ever be eliminated.ldquoThe only way ever to ensure that you never catch coronavirus is to stay at home completely, said Mr Gove.ldquoBut there is always, always, always, in any loosening of these restrictions, a risk of people catching the coronavirus. You can never eliminate risk. It is the case that it is extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak.On Ridge on Sunday, Mr Gove said the UK could learn from best practice where.ldquoOther countries have succeeded in ensuring children canto school safely.

Adverse weather conditions and moonless nights were reported to increase seabird fallout.\"The location of the Manx shearwaters colony in Rum is to the west of Mallaig and the current finding confirms that strong winds blowing towards the source of light pollution causes the largest number of groundings,\" said the research.\"Our study confirmed that more birds were grounded in nights with less moonlight and in nights with strong westerly winds showing that birds may be blown from their colony in the direction of the light pollution. Low and high visibility conditions also contributed to higher grounding probabilities.\"Thanks to these findings, rescue campaigns could focus their efforts on nights when the risk of groundings is highest or could inform local authorities under which conditions light intensity needs to be reduced.\"Usually several hundred are saved in Mallaig, Morar and Arisaig and in  there was a record .More than , pairs - more than a fth of the British breeding population of around , pairs of manxies - breed on Rum.The Rum colony is unique in that it is in the high mountains of the island as this is not usually the favoured habitat of the species.Manx shearwaters are clumsy on land so the adult birds only visit the colony at night to avoid predation.Chicks fledging this year are unlikely toto the colony next year as they do notuntil they are three years old.

Whether or not we are the first to be successful, or another country is, it is vital we continue to fight the virus with other countries rather than pursuing an isolationist approach as we have seen from the President of the United States.ldquoIn the mean time, the Government must not lose sight of ensuring we have a comprehensive test, trace and isolate system in place to keep people safe until a successful vaccine is readily available.On Saturday the Government announced it was investing pound, on trialling medical detection dogs on coronavirus, to determinethey can pick up the scent of the disease before symptoms develop."},{"url":null,"title":"thousands-students-worried-pandemic-affecting-results","story":"It comes as Herald research has found one in three of Scotlands universities has still not given a clear formal no-detriment policy - which aims to ensure students are not disadvantaged by the pandemic.The National Union of Students have called on universities and colleges to adopt lsquono detrimentrsquo policies meaning that students should not be penalised for any dip in their grades as a result of coronavirus-related teaching arrangements.There are around a quarter of a million students enrolled in Scotlands higher education institutions which have been hit hard by the pandemic, with colleges losing an estimated  per cent of its incomethis academic year alone, according to the Scottish Funding Council.When the Herald asked the countrys  universities whether their coronavirus policy ensures all students affected by the pandemic will automatically have their degree grade frozen, meaning they can only improve on it , only five confirmed that they were.But Universities Scotland say some institutions find the no detriment designation \"unhelpful\" adding that ldquofairness is the best way to describe the approach across the whole sector.Universities in Scotland that made it clear to the Herald that they have a no detriment policy include Edinburgh, Glasgow, St Andrews, Aberdeen, Dundee, Stirling, Glasgow Caledonian and Strathclyde.Analysis by the National Union of Students Scotland has revealed nearly three in four students were concerned to some degree about their job prospects, while % were worried about their employability.Less than half believed they have received helpful support from their educational institution in the coronavirus crisis. Some % said they had been kept up to date with the latest news and developments.It comes as the Princes Trust called on government, businesses and charities to come together to prevent a youth jobs crisis and to ensure a generation doesnrsquot lose hope.Their research conducted during lockdown found over a quarterof  to -year olds in Scotland say their future career prospects have already been damaged and  per cent say it will be harder than ever to get a job.Last week, Richard Lochhead, the minister for further education, higher education and science in a message circulated to university and college students last week that there would be \"fair assessment\" principal.\"I recognise this will be an uncertain and dficult time for you all and I understand there has been a lot of concern about your exams and outstanding course work,\" he said.\"I have had the opportunity in recent weeks to discuss with Colleges Scotland, Universities Scotland and the National Union of Studentshow qualications will be assessed in a fair way, based on internal assessments and graded units where possible. Across both sectors it is clear that the approach is underpinned by three important principles: fairness to all learners, safe and secure assessment whilst ensuring current public health advice is followed, and maintaining the integrity and credibility of our qualications. We must ensure that these standards are maintained over time, in the interests of learners.\"For university students, each university has adapted its approach to assessment in light of the pandemic, and has sought to reassure students that a principle of fairness will be applied across the board.\"NUS Scotland president Liam McCabe said: \"Students are facing unprecedented disruption to their studies as a result of the lockdown, with our research showing that seven in ten students are concerned about the effect of Covid- on their final qualication.\"We welcome the statement from the Minister for Further Education, Higher Education and Science committing to fair assessment and expect all institutions to ensure students are treated fairly. NUS Scotland believes institutions should adopt a no-detriment approach to assessment, so no student is academically disadvantaged as a result of this pandemic.\"The newly released NUS Scotland survey of over  students between March  and April  covering a range of responses to the coronavirus crisis found that seven in ten students wanted further information or guidance from governments about how their course or degree will be graded or awarded and two in three said they needed more clarity over how this years work will be assessed.Some % were extremely or very concerned over the impact of coronavirus on their exams while a further % were concerned.Two in three either disagreed, strongly disagreed or were neutral about whether their institution was managing the crisis well.Nearly  signed a petition over the past month calling for the University of the West of Scotland to implement a a no-detriment policy for end of year exams due the Covid- outbreak.It said: \"This means that any work submitted towards their final grade will only improve it and not bring down degree classications due to circumstances that are out-with our control.\"During this time it is unreasonable for the university to expect students to carry on as normal and risk the current situation impact four years or hard work. We want to work with the university to ensure that exam are implemented fairly and that no student is disadvantaged.\"UWS has since put out a statement saying that it \"seeks to ensure no detriment\" due to the pandemic whilst \"maintaining the integrity of their higher education journey\".Some students have continued to questioned whether this is no-detriment, saying they are losing out.The university was asked whether their policy ensures that all students affected will automatically have their degree grade frozen, meaning they can only improve on it - but did not directly respond, preferring to direct a prepared statement.Terri Henderson, a fourth year Honours events management student at UWS raised concerns about the university policy with the institutions management saying she felt there had been no progression on implementing the policy from the university other than an email saying that the university was aware that students were anxious and that the they were working on a fair approach.She was concerned that the university were using the \"no-detriment\" in its statement - but in reality did not have a policy that any now work submitted could only raise the degree classication and would not bring it down.\"I am angry about it. I have sent multiple emails and getting no thing back.\"They say no-detriment but it is not no-detriment, as is not standardised with the rest of the educational institutions.\"I was at my grandmothers funeral today , horrible, and I was still being expected to submit work that is going to go to my degree last week, while dealing with all this.\"Glasgow universities managed to bring out their no detriment policies between March  and April  - ours was not released till April .\"Some students are not passing through no fault of their own. Grades absolutely are being affected.\"The NUS Scotland analysis revealed that three in four students had a vocation element to their course, and of those, three quarters believed the Covid- outbreak would have a negative impact on that element of their studies.And of those who received learning support from their institution, just over half feel they have received adequate support to enable them to continue their work to the best of their ability throughout the Covid- pandemic.The analysis also revealed financial concerns during the pandemic.Four in five students were concerned about their ability to manage financially during the Covid- outbreak while one in four were \"very\" or \"extremely\" concerned. Three in four were concerned to some extent about their ability to pay their bills.Two in five have cut back on food spending to make ends meet.Three in five felt that the UK government had adequately considered the dficulties students faces as a result of the crisis while almost half agreed the Scottish Government were acting in their best interests.A Universities Scotland said spokesman said: ldquoIn recent weeks principals have been in close touch with NUS Scotland and their own student associations to understand studentsrsquo worries about the pandemicrsquos impact on end of year assessment.\"Wersquore in agreement that a principle of fairness for students should underpin all decisions universities take when adapting academic regulations around assessment because of coronavirus.\"Universities will each set their own policy on assessment, as was the case before the pandemic, and they are also mindful of the need for academic thresholds and the integrity of the qualications they offer, but students should be reassured that fairness will apply across the board. The best advice is for students to check the policy at their institution.A UWS spokesman said: ldquoWe are committed to ensuring a fair and reasonable approach to assessment, progression and degree classication for all students, and take a compassionate approach to the current circumstances caused by the Covid- pandemic. Our priority remains to support students and seek to ensure no detriment due to the pandemic whilst maintaining the integrity of their higher education journey.Meanwhile in response to the the Princes Trust and YouGov report, Young People in Lockdown Kate Still, director of The Princersquos Trust in Scotland said: ldquoThis paints a truly stark picture of how the coronavirus crisis is impacting young people. An alarming proportion of young people are feeling increased levels of anxiety, and fears are building about their future.ldquoWe cannot allow this crisis to cripple the aspirations and prospects of our nationrsquos young people. The Princersquos Trust is here to help young people through this challenging time, and government, employers and charities need to work together to stop the economic effects of this pandemic from spiralling out of control.Tony Wilson, institute director at the Institute for Employment Studies added: ldquoThese figures should be a wake-up call for all of us. Therersquos clear evidence that being unemployed when yoursquore young can lead to lasting damage to mental health, income and employment prospects, and itrsquos very likely that youth unemployment is already higher than it was in the depths of the last recession. Added to this, up to half a million young people will be leaving education this summer into the toughest jobs market in our letimes. So we need to act now, to ensure that all young people can access high quality employment, careers and training support, and are guaranteed the offer of a decent job before they become long-term unemployed."},{"url":null,"title":"Marianne Taylor  Good dog  how canine companions are getting us through coronavirus","story":"Monty Don may front Gardenerrsquos World, but as regular viewers know ndash and Monty himself would happily admit ndash Nigel the golden retriever was the real star, stealing the show with a wag of the tail as his master explained the finer points of pruning.It came as a real shock last week when Don announced that Nigel had died suddenly at the age of .

For a long time, most Scotstook the constitution for granted. Independence was a minority interest and many Scotswould casually vote SNP for ious local or strategic reasons without any sense of independence being a threat ndash in fact, wersquod vote SNP without independence really crossing our minds.In retrospect, that seems remarkable, but thatrsquos how it was. I once asked the former Scottish secretary Malcolm Rkind why the constitution wasnrsquot a bigger issue  or  years ago and why devolutionists like him werenrsquot pushing harder for change and his answer made sense. It just wasnrsquot dominating Scottish politics, said Sir Malcolm, andit was, why werenrsquot , people marching down the street demanding reform Of course, they are marching nowand a lot of Scots have found the whole thing stressful. I suspect many unionists are, by nature, cautious people and instinctively prefer the status quo, so change or constant agitation for change is uncomfortable for them. Theyrsquove been trapped in the back of the car while their parents bicker and squabble in the front ndash and we never reach our destination.Which is why, politically, the last few weeks have been a relief for many unionists. Broadly, the Scottish and UK governments have followed the same policy on coronavirusand Nicola Sturgeon has struck a collegiate tone. Shersquos also appeared to pull back from her usual approach of emphasising dferences with Westminster, which, I suspect, is one reason her coronavirus approval rating is high among Tory and Labour voters as well as nationalists.:Scots trust Holyrood to stop new virus wave, but not WestminsterThere are some Tories and unionists, however, who seem to want the alignment between Holyrood and Westminster to continue at all times. For example, the Scottish Tory leader Jackson Carlaw questioned why Ms Sturgeon did not move from the ldquostay at home slogan at the same time as the Prime Minster, the implication being she was up to her old tricks of looking for dferences with Westminster for the sake of it.But firstly, the First Minister was right to be dubious about ldquostay alert: itrsquos a rubbish slogan. Secondly, she has worked closely with the UK Government ndash the SNPrsquos Mike Russell pointed out how extraordinary the co-operation is on coronavirus given the stand-off on everything . And thirdly, to expect Scotland to align with the UK at all times is a bad idea, not only because the virus ies regionally but because total alignment misunderstands devolution. The SNP may have been guilty of seeking dference for the sake of it, but some unionists have been guilty of the opposite offence: seeking sameness for the sake of it.What devolution shows is that the reality is in the middle and that dference within the UK is a necessary and desirable part of the system. Indeed, it was part of the case for a Scottish Parliament in the first place that it would be dferent from Westminster. It was said, for instance, that a less adversarial approach would be fostered by the U-shaped chamber and a high number of female MSPs. Then along came a female MSP from Irvine who was inspired to enter politics by a female MP from Grantham. Bang goes that theory.But in other ways, Holyroodrsquos dference to Westminster has been critical to its development. When he was first minister, Labourrsquos Henry McLeish pursued policies irrespective of whether they were dferent from the rest of the UK, on free personal care for the elderly for instance. But part of the reason for Labourrsquos decline in Scotland was that his successor Jack McConnell avoided policies that might create dferences with the leadership in London. It also explains the success of the SNP. Most people donrsquot value dference for the sake of it, but dference when necessary became a way to judge Scotlandrsquos politicians.At least initially, Alex Salmond seemed to understand this when he succeeded Mr McConnell. The emphasis of the SNPrsquos first administration in particular was on being responsible and competent in government, although Mr Salmond was not scared of taking off his jacket and having a fight with London when he thought he needed to.But somewhere along the line, mainly because of the  referendum, this balance between dference and responsibility was lost. The SNP and Nicola Sturgeon knew being dferent to London was popular with a large swathe of voters and in that sense reversed what Henry McLeish did. Mr McLeish pursued policies irrespective of dferences with the rest of the UK, whereas it often felt like the SNP pursued dferences with the rest of the UK irrespective of the policies.:Coronavirus: Politicians and facility bosses say Scottish Government must follow rest of the UK in care home testingTo some extent, coronavirus has re-tuned the parameters again. Nicola Sturgeon has been competent and responsible during the crisis and it was only when the PM, not the FM, changed tack in England that dferences emerged. Not only is this how devolution is meant to be ndash regional dferences when judged necessary by the dferent leaders ndash I suspect itrsquos how most voters would like it to be. We donrsquot want to be the same as England for the sake of it, and we donrsquot want to be dferent for the sake of it, we want to be dferent to England when itrsquos right for Scotland.In that sense, dference is a good thing and nothing to be scared of, even for unionists. The problem is that a few of the most committed unionists, and Tories in particular, seem to view any dference as bad or an SNP plot rather than part of the process. Earlier, I summed up the s with one word ndash chaos ndash but chaos and dference are not necessarily the same thing. Dference done the right way ndash the way itrsquos been done under coronavirus ndash is part of devolution. The aim is dference thatrsquos dynamic but respectful. Itrsquos dference when needed but not for the sake of it. Itrsquos devolution done properly.Our columns are a  for writers to express their opinions.

In their place, flocks of sheep were moved in.To this day, the fate of those who departed and the full story of what they and their ancestors built up at Inverlael has remained cloaked in mystery.Now, two hundred years later, a project aimed at bringing the past to light has taken a major step forward after archaeologists were appointed to carry out specialist work which will help trace both the diaspora and the economic and social le of Balblair - a once thriving township in the area.The project, called Lost Inverlael - Finding Balblair, is being led by Ullapool Museum and has a grant of pound, from Historic Environment Scotland alongside funding from Forestry  Land Scotland.Duncan Mackenzie, an Ullapool-based stalker whose great, great grandparents were among those evicted, likened the archaeological task to a ldquodetective story, adding: ldquoThe only catch is itrsquos five to six hundred years old.ldquoThe evictions took place at Martinmas, in the middle of winter, to ensure the crofters wouldnrsquot try to stay, he said. ldquoMy great, great grandparents fled to the other side of Loch Broomhellip and built a hovel near Clachan. There they lived off razor fish and other shellfish ndash mussels, whelks ndash which were taken from the saltings collected at low tide on the shores of Loch Broom.ldquoThey would have scraped around while the potatoes that had been planted in their land rotted... It was a form of ethnic cleansing.Mr Mackenzie said building up a picture of the activity that was left behind would be just as vital as establishing what happened to the crofters who were cleared.ldquoAt the bottom of Inverlael Glen was the township of Balblair ndash in Gaelic Baile Bhlair ndash which means Village of the Battle, or Village of the Fertile Plain, he explained.ldquoBoth work as names in this context so we just donrsquot know which was meant. We have lots of evidence of activity, of people moving back and forth through Inverlael Glen via the hill tracks to the north and east.ldquoThere was also an anchorage for large boats at the head of Loch Broom, and for a long time, boats were bypassing Ullapool and going straight up to the head of the loch, to Balblair.\"At the easternmost extremity of the glen we have a place where we are hoping to find evidence of iron working at a place called Achadh Domhnuill an Gobha, or Donald the Blacksmithrsquos Site, which possibly tells us there was considerable industrial activity going on there.ldquoThere is also evidence of a revetment, which is a feature used to race water, possibly for the purposes of driving an industrial activity such as iron working. I am hopeful that we can come up with more evidence for industrial metal work going on in the area before it was cleared.Alongside confirmed evidence of a corn drying kiln for barley which was malted during whisky production, there are clear indications the settlement at Inverlael was some way from the primitive conditions often associated with Highland le before the Clearances.ldquoThe landowners here were not buying land in a place that wasnrsquot making money, said Mr Mackenzie. ldquoThey bought it to increase their wealth. The occupiers of this land were much cleverer than we give them credit for.Over the next two years, the team at Ullapool Museum will oversee the investigation through community digs, archive research, genealogy workshops, activity days and interactive tours. Designers at Immersive Minds, collaborating with the Dig It! archaeology hub, will also use Minecraft to build a \"topographically accurate interactive map\" of Inverlael.The wider work is being carried out with the support of Forestry  Land Scotland and its archaeologist Matt Ritchie.Lynne McKeggie, joint director at Dingwall-based Highland Archaeology Services, which has the contract to carry out specialist archaeology work for Lost Inverlael-Finding Balblair, said: ldquoWersquore really excited about it. We love doing community archaeology projects. This one involves lots of digital technology and genealogy. Itrsquos also a really good widespread project in the sense that itrsquos very multi-disciplinary.Project co-ordinator Helen Avenell, of Ullapool Museum, added: \"This project will be an amazing opportunity for our local community to be part of a team unearthing and revealing the hidden history beneath our feet. We know there is a really important story to be told here about the signicance of Inverlael and Balblair and its people."},{"url":null,"title":"health-boards-face-emergency-budget-measures","story":"Concerns have been raised that health and social care services could struggle to cope with day-to-day needs as Scotland emerges from the lockdown, which has resulted in medical procedures being paused for focus to be put on dealing with the coronavirus outbreak.But Scotlandrsquos  integration authorities, mostly made up of integration joint boards , which deliver health and social care services with funding from local councils and the NHS, were facing a stark financial picture before the pandemic took grip.Audit Scotland has described the financial situation of IJBs as ldquounsustainable as many health and social care partnerships are forced to strip their own assets, make internal cuts and use one-off savings from their dwindling reserves.It added: ldquoFinancial pressures across health and care services make it dficult for integration authorities to achieve meaningful change.As IJBs sat down to set their budgets for the   financial year, they were being forced to draw up plans to cut or make savings of a combined pound. million, in order to balance their books - with some already earmarking cuts for further years ahead.Aberdeen IJB indicated pound. million of ldquobudget pressures for this financial year, with East Dumbartonshire reporting a gap of pound. million. Edinburgh IJB, which was unable to set a balanced budget last year until October due to the financial constraints it found itself in, was drawing up pound.m of saving plans for this year. In Glasgow, officials identied a pound million funding gap and almost pound million of ldquopressures.In March, Renfrewshire IJB agreed to hold back pound, of money set to be used for drug and alcohol services ldquofor the health and social care partnership to draw down in support of its transformation programme.But the financial situation across Scotland was thrown into more turmoil as health and social care became the front line for dealing with the Covid- pandemic.Aberdeenshire IJB warned there was now ldquoless focus on financial management due to the situation ndash while East Ayrshire IJB stressed that ldquoextraordinary costs are being incurred and will continue to be incurred for the foreseeable future. Officials also say they ldquomay require to consider emergency budget measures as the impact, financially and operationally of mobilisation and response to Covid- are better understood.Many boards are working on the ldquoassumption that the Scottish Government will step in and cover the additional costs.Scottish Conservative health spokesperson, Miles Briggs, said: ldquoIJBs will be more important than ever in the coming months for delivering social care in each local authority and implementing measures to keep care home residents safe.ldquoAcross Scotland, IJBs have been forced to make cuts to their budgets because of decisions made by SNP ministers and now it is unclear what is happening with money made available to the Scottish Government, through Barnett consequentials, that was meant for councils.He added: ldquoSNP ministers must urgently review the funding deal that they have with local authorities and health boards, so that they are in a position to effectively deal with Covid- and its aftermath.ldquoCuts to local authority funding have a knock on effect to funding available for third sector organisations who provide invaluable care for vulnerable people in the community, which will be so vital in the coming months.Liberal Democrats have also called for more support to be offered from the Scottish Government.Lib Dem health spokesperson, Alex Cole-Hamilton, said: ldquoJoint boards are in a very tough position. The Scottish Government promised they would have a groundbreaking impact on health and social care but they have consistently faced challenges over finances and the flow of patients through the health service even before Covid- arrived.ldquoThe last thing we need is a further budgetary crisis in the midst of the virus crisis. The Scottish Government must ensure that joint boards have the support and resources they need to do their jobs.Nicola Sturgeon has indicated that healthcare will continue to be a priority of the Scottish Government once the country emerges from the emergency situation.She said: ldquoThe financial implications of this virus are going to be felt in almost every area of our lives. We have a duty and a responsibility to manage this and to protect what matters most. As we found out with this pandemic, it has been reinforced, there are few things that matter more than health and caring for the health of the population.ldquoWe will work with health boards, we will work with IJBs. We have been very clear with health boards and local authorities that financial constraints should not be affecting how we deal with this crisis right now.Ms Sturgeon added: ldquoAs we go into a recovery phase, as we start to resume more routine healthcare, these discussions will continue ndash so that we can ensure that we have the ability and the capacity to deal with this virus, which we are going to have to continue to do for quite some time to come, but also the day-to-day health needs of all people across the country.ldquoNone of these issues are going to be straightforward or easy for any government anywhere in the world to deal with but we have a good foundation here in Scotland and will continue to make sure that we work in a responsible way that is about protectiing the things that matter most to us.COSLA, the umbrella organisation for Scottish local authorities, has warned that frontline care, waiting times and peoplersquos mental health are being put on the line when officials are not handed enough money to provide services.A COSLA spokesperson said: ldquoAs we said in our essential services document for the recent spending review, the risks of not investing in local government include increased costs in acute care and hospital waiting times, social isolation and depression when older people canrsquot continue to live in their own community.ldquoWell-being is about much more than investment in the NHS ndash itrsquos about investing in the social determinants of health and wider public health ndash the everyday services that enhance the lives of iniduals, families and communities. It is about investing in early intervention and protecting the vulnerable discretionary services so that Scottish and local government shared policy objectives can be met."},{"url":null,"title":"mps-consider-repealing-eu-freedom-movement-rules-uk","story":"The Immigration and Social Security Co-ordinationBill is part of the move towards the Governmentrsquos new points-based immigration system, to be introduced from , although it does not set out the details on this.These will be fleshed out in the immigration rules, which will explain the future system for EU and non-EU nationals who move to the UK after the Brexit transition period ends on December .:Opposition MPs write to EU negotiator to seek Brexit talks extensionThe Bill will be debated at second reading on Monday and then make its way through the parliamentary process.It was previously introduced in the Commons in December  but stalled weeks later as then prime minister Theresa Mayrsquos minority administration lacked the numbers to win key Brexit-linked votes.Prime Minister Boris Johnson brings it back with an -seat majority but amid pressure for the immigration rules to support those dubbed ldquokey workers during the coronavirus pandemic.A YouGov poll, for the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants , suggested % of Britons would support loosening immigration restrictions for workers who were defined as essential during the crisis.:Brexit trade talks timeline lsquovirtually impossiblersquo, says Deputy Irish Premier Simon CoveneyThe Governmentrsquos list of critical workers includes people in the food production and processing industry, such as delivery drivers, those working in waste disposal and more.In February the Government announced proposals for the new system, with points awarded for specic requirements such as being able to speak English to a certain level, having a job offer from an approved employer and meeting a salary threshold of pound,.Other points could be awarded for certain qualications andthere is a shortage in a particular occupation.A visa allowing doctors, nurses and health professionals from overseas to work in the NHS was introduced in March.Ahead of the Billrsquosto the Commons, Home Secretary Priti Patel said in a brief statement: ldquoThis historic piece of legislation gives the UK full control of our immigration system for the first time in decades and the power to determine who comes to this country.ldquoOur new points-based system is firmer, fairer, and simpler.ldquoIt will attract the people we need to drive our economy forward and lay the foundation for a high wage, high skill, high productivity economy.Labour frontbencher Alison McGovern, however, said the Government needed a dferent approach.She told the BBC: ldquoWe need to look at the system that we have for social careask ourselves: how are we going to improve the pay, improve the conditions, make sure that wersquove got a good number of people coming in to work in social care  And work out our immigration policy along with that aspiration to have skilled, well-paid people working in social care.Elsewhere, Satbir Singh, chief executive of the JCWI, called for further changes and said: ldquoThe fight against Covid- has shown us all just how much our survival and wellbeing depends on our key workers.ldquoSo many of them have come from other countries and help keep this one running.ldquoBus drivers and lorry drivers, care workers and shop workers, nurses and cleaners ndash they are not lsquounskilledrsquo or unwelcome, they are the backbone of our country and they deserve the security of knowing that this place can be their home too."},{"url":null,"title":"https:wwworcadiancouk  \n","story":"May ,  at : pmA group of dance and fitness instructors are hoping to raise mental health awareness during the lockdown with a virtual fundraiser for Orkney Blide Trust, this coming week.

This includes the establishment of a joint ministerial committee to discuss the ongoing pandemic and its management.A statement, released this afternoon, Thursday, on behalf of Alistair Carmichael MP and Lord Jim Wallace of Tankerness said: “Across the country, people are worried about their loved ones and their jobs in light of coronavirus – and they are getting mixed messages from governments.”In a time of crisis, confusion and inconsistency breed fear and put people at risk. A collective approach could help to restore public confidence that our leaders are pulling together.This is not about dropping blame at anyone’s door. The reality however is that in recent days and weeks, attempts to formulate responses to the coronavirus are more notable for apparent disagreements between national governments than for policy substance. We need governments to build consensus and create a shared responsibility across the UK.”We are calling for a more joined up response to what is a cross-governmental challenge – by establishing a coronavirus Joint Ministerial Committee “A coronavirus JMC with an enhanced remit, meeting regularly and with an approach based on consensus and shared responsibility would help to reduce disputes, with all governments involved in developing plans.”It would help to refocus coronavirus response based on national and regional needs rather than political borders. This solution could help reduce the chaos of the current political climate – and point the way towards a better long-term crisis response mechanism in future.”We believe that an enhanced JMC for the coronavirus crisis is the right way to give people confidence in their governments during this time – with a message that leaders are working with, rather than against each other.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

The UK is currently the co-chair of the Equal Rights Coalition. We have a duty to uphold universal human rights.“Earlier this year I welcomed the legalisation of same sex marriage in Northern Ireland. I am proud that the Liberal Democrats have led the way in supporting equal rights.

He stated his belief that Orkney could one of the first places to say “we’re free of the virus.”Since then, Professor Pennington has been called to give evidence to the Scottish Government’s health and sport committee, stating his case for an isles specic plan to ministers on April .Now, he has followed up with a letter to the committee, backing up his proposals by alleging that Orkney has had no one treated in hospital for COVID- since April  — a claim which has neither been confirmed or denied by NHS Orkney.“I am on record as proposing that residents of Orkney and the Western Isles could be freed earlier from social distancing and lockdown than mainland communities,” Professor Pennington told ministers in a letter dated May .“They have had few COVID- cases , they have excellent public health systems, and they control travel from the mainland very signicantly, thus reducing the risk of virus importation.“Orkney has its own testing facility that provides a turn round time of less than two hours. For exit from local controls, a prerequisite would be community testing on a signicant scale, and the establishment of a system of contact tracing. They could also serve as places to evaluate any smart phone apps.”Unfortunately, The Orcadian has been unable to very Professor Pennington’s claim regarding coronavirus admissions in Orkney, due to a lack of available data.Asked to confirm whether there had been any coronavirus admissions at The Balfour since April , NHS Orkney referred The Orcadian to the Scottish Government daily coronavirus hospital figures, which are broken down by health board. According to the government,the number of patients admitted is under five, it is logged as an asterisk in order to protect confidentiality.The last time that there were five or more patients at The Balfour suspected of having coronavirus was April , and the daily figure since then has been recorded as an asterisk .Asked to confirm how many of those patients who have tested positive for the virus in Orkney have made a recovery, an NHS Orkney spokeswoman told The Orcadian on Monday, that it could not disclose this information due to patient confidentiality.However, NHS Orkney has since confirmed that five of the seven people who have tested positive in Orkney at the time of publication have made a recovery. Sadly, two people have died with the virus.Responding to Professor Pennington’s comments, the NHSO spokeswoman added: “NHS Orkney is grateful for continuing to see low levels of COVID- related activity within the hospital. All COVID- data is monitored nationally via the Scottish Government.”copy The Orcadian - A ision of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.

THAT shouldn’t be necessary should it  But, in true B J fashion he is resorting to make do and mend bluster. I am mindful of the blind leading the blind.Let decisions be made by scientists not ill equipped dabbling politicians.That little pat on the head should appeal to you !!But never mind Nicola is letting us out exercise twice a day. It is a shame we are all being channelled into the same crowded places, through the same gates and chokepoints whilst the wide-open spaces and beaches of Shetland are closed down to the majority!!In the present serious crisis she is in full agreement with Wales and Ireland but not with England. How fortunate that is.Britain is no longer ruled by England now that devolution has taken place. Boris Johnson claimed to be PM of 🇬🇧 Britain.He surely meant🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 not 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿 Scotland or 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿Wales.Westminster is reluctant to let goIt is extraordinary sad news from Care Homes and Care Workers, but not unexpected. It takes months of training and years of experience to Barrier nurse to prevent cross-infection. Even the use of PPE requires extensive training. Our most vulnerable people conjugated into crowded homes was an accident just waiting to happen. Hopefully, next time, our care workers will have extensive professional training cross infection control with qualications and wages to match. Our most vulnerable, not all be herded into care homes but perhaps into a chalet system where separation and quarantine would be so much more effective..What is the R rate for Shetland  Looks like zero The politicians # all of them can #go away# .Do your gardening, go fishing, go for a walk whenever and where ever you want. Get the kids back into school. Get our economy open and people back to work.This is my opinion.Dive, e , e # incoming!!!What do you want  A Country with a minimised death toll but teetering on the brink of bankruptcy, or a country that#s suffered a higher death toll, and while perhaps shaken somewhat financially, is still resilient enough to continue without any great undue hardship for the survivors.England at present seems to be trying to steer an admittedly somewhat shaky course towards the latter, the rest of the UK, unfortunately seem hell bent on taking the direct route straight to the former.You cannot sustain increased Governmental expenditure and decreased Governmental income for any longer than the very short term, it called burning the candle from both ends#. We#ve been doing it now for  weeks### Very soon the time will come when Governmental leaders will have to make decisions on how many deaths are acceptable collateral damage to allow them to provide the services the majority need and keep their country afloat. The longer they leave it to make that decision, the more rushed, and by consequence, less appropriate, it is likely to be.There is no vaccine, there is no #cure#. Unfortunately some are going to have to take a hit for the team.It’s unfortunate that three centuries of free-market capitalism hasn’t generated enough wealth to feed the country for more than three months without going bankrupt but don’t worry Michael. Many people share your concerns about the economy and the government is onto it:A confidential Treasury assessment of the coronavirus crisis leaked to Theargues that it will require measures including a two-year public sector pay freeze in order to “boost investor confidence# in the British economy. So, a round of grateful applause for the NHS Staff, Care Workers, Police and everyone at London Transport.I hope the nurses are enjoying all the clapping and rattling of pots and pans every Thursday because that is all they are going to get.It is reassuring to know that things really are ing to normal.At least a public sector pay freeze will not discriminate. It will apply equally across the board and affect everyone from care home cleaners on minimum wage to the head of health and social care at Labour controlled North Lanarkshire council, salary £,“Some are going to have to take a hit for the team.”Yes Michael, in more ways than one.Well put, Malcolm.Incidentally, there is no freeze on public sector wages. Typical nonsense and  information being leaked, another left-wingPR leak from socialist civil servant perhaps I think it was the the Argntine president when speaking about Covid  said, #you can recover from a drop in GDP, you cannot recover from death#The simple fact is unavoidable this virus is here to stay. One day we will all meet it. The single most important thing is to keep the numbers down, so ICUs are not swamped, learn the best therapies to reduce the death toll as much as is practical and research for treatments and a vaccine. Try and avoid peak outbreaks, especially in winter, when the flu   covid combination will be nasty. Isolate our most vulnerable, maybe for a very long time and leave people to chose. I am approaching  years old and have no intention of isolating forever. In due course, I will get this virus and take my chances. I would instead rather enjoy my time than clamber fearfully into a sterile hole forever!!! As for Sturgeons exercise twice a day, she can stick that where the sun does not shine. The simple fact is being fit is perhaps my and everyone best chance for survival, twice a day exercising and the rest of my time on my sweet derriere is stupid, just as Nicola#s latest dictates!!!Ian#s reply to Malcolm#s well reasoned contribution oddly fails to address it.Why I’m reminded of the proud mother watching her son taking part in the passing out parade at Sandhurst.She noticed that everyone was out of step apart from her son!Oh dear, did I just read #BO JO#s policy actually worked# Thats plainly pants, pure and simple.Briefly, to Michael#s point, it is only recently that we paid off our war debt to the USA, so some financial mechanisms will be found.But I think I heard Portugal went into lockdown straight after their first COVID  death, whereas the UK waited for over a hundred. Plainly things could have been very dferent, very much better, and acting quicker would have been far cheaper, with far less loss of le, and a quickerto a ing economy.But it would have also required people being put before profit right from the start.So it really had been business as usual from the bottom feeding disaster capitalists that run the UK.#BO JO#s policy actually worked# indeed.That would be laughableit wasn#t so tragic.Sadly without vaccines and anti-virals, it is that simple. The fact is it has only just started and will be with us until we are all immune or dead. Let us pray for the former and immunity by vaccination. To coin a cliche, it will be total isolation for the most vulnerable until herd immunity develops, as with every infectious viral disease in human history! Development of immunity and resistance is what will stopCovid  eventually, nothing , as withPolio, Smallpox, Measles, Herpes et alNo. We need to keep as many people alive as possible until vaccine is developed.People are not simply expendable.Effective PPE supplies and speed of sufficient testing is critical to this.The Tory led, Tory delayed UK response has been woeful on these.No scope for argument there.Thousands have died that need not have.No scope for argument there either.It has been an ideologically misled catastrophe. genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #But now that you point out about all those genetic iations, we probably ought to phone them and tell them to call of the hunt since they#ve probably not thought of that. Best just let nature take its course and get the economy on track with hundreds of thousands of deaths, a swamped NHS and a profoundly sick and worried population.Bo Jo#s policy was actually endorsed and followed to the letter by all the devolved Governments of the Uk until we got our knickers in a twist about a slogan. I never realised Nicola was a # bottom feeding disaster capitalists # for endorsing Bo Jo#s policy for so long. She only on Sunday became confused and what a fuss out that she made. On the bright side, we may legally exercise twice daily now, what outstanding leadership!Ian your unwavering faith in BoJo the clown, in the absence of any logical rationale or evidence for doing so, is truly astonishing.Robbie, I have no faith in any politician, but I do find Bo-Jo so much better than the other clowns in the circus. I love the way he routed the remoners, destroyed the Socialist horror of Corbyn and so antagonised, confounded and confused his opponents. Most are left with nothing by puerile and infantile comments to make, such as Bo-Jo the Clown. Is that Robbie the level of your wit and argument Again, Tory apologist spin from Tinkler. From mid-Jan through Feb Boris missed  COBRA meetings on COVID  to which Sturgeon was not invited.Yes the UK#s other parliaments fell into line once the Bullingdon Club realised there was to be no Britains Open for Business, herd-immunity-now approach. Elements of that thinking lingered on and are resurfacing now, not the least within the twisted outpouring of local eugenicists.Act in haste, repent at leisure seems to sum up such weakness.I am trying very hard toto see things from your perspective, but I cannot ignore the indicators and commentary that indicates that the UK economy will officially be in recession by the end of  Q.GDP has fallen by % in the first quarter of this year and predicted to be possibly as high as % in the second quarter.The Bank of England has tried to put a brave face on things by saying #the impact is likely to be temporary with activity rebounding strongly once social distancing measures are lted#. The question is when will social distancing be lted.Are you advocating that we just wait and see how things pan out, maybe the idea of a V shaped recovery will happen in the rd and th quarters, a vaccine will be developed in time and the world can go back to the #old normal#A simple warning from history # Recession , Depression, War.Recession, depression, war. Exactly. We know that the mortality rate is roughly .%. UK population is approx  million. Let#s say we just let the virus take its course, albeit slowed due to some adjustments to how we work and % of the population catch it. An effective treatment or vaccine is by no means guaranteed. % of  million is . million. .% of that is about , deaths. Then there are the hundreds of millions of working days lost to people off sick with the virus. Then there are the people suffering long term consequences of the virus and the cost of caring for them. How is this a recipe for a healthy economy  How will this level of death and suffering motivate investment or spending  Where does this assumption that we can just get going again like things were before come from  The world has changed. I know it feels good to bury our heads in the sand and think we can just go back to how things were and let a few old folks die. But that is profoundly naive. There is no simple answer. Except Mr. Tinkler#s. Make of that what you will.Ali asks: # genetic iations from  samples when exactly do you envisage this wonder vaccine that covers all iations to be produced #I don#t know Ali.I#m not a dentist.To my understanding there does not need to be an exact genetic match for vaccines to be sufficiently helpful, but as I can#t trace my male line back over countless generations maybe Ali should consult a bard or a sage instead.There is, and has been, something of a medical research race on for understanding of transmission, for patient management treatment and for vaccines.Prompter action would have kept more folk alive longer whilst progress was made. The usual suspects are welcome to argue that and which way they may like, but it won#t change matters.There has been medical research and hard work for years into a reliable vaccine for corona viruses. How are they doing on that front  You don#t need to be a dentist to find that outYes Ali, but you do need to know the dference between a Virus and Venus, RNA and DNA, a vaccine and socialist vacillation, that is where humanists and left-wing ideologues come up a little short!!As I#m not a puller of teeth its a challenge to tell Ali how this virus dfers from the common cold, or why the research may be getting more funding and focus than the industry and government gave previously.You stated that you don’t need to be a dentist to find that out but, to be fair and reasonable about this , someone with medical training is likely to be better equipped than someone without to come up with insights which could be useful.

It looks increasingly likely that any exit from lockdown and safe re-opening of tourism and hospitality businesses could be during the low season.#Without financial support to tide them over, that could be the nail in the coffin for many businesses.“In Shetland, like where in Scotland, earnings from tourism during the spring and summer months sustains people through the winter and it is a real worry that coronavirus hit just when the visitor season was starting.#It is clear that a -month plan, at least, is needed to ensure that viable businesses can survive to provide a living for their owners and be ready to safely welcome visitors again when the time is right.”Speaking via video link earlier this week, Mr Carmichael welcomed the Chancellor of the Exchequer#s announced extension to the furlough scheme to protect jobs – but added more was needed to help tourism.“Here in the Northern Isles we particularly see that in the visitor economy, which is crucial to us,# he added.#The assistance for bed and breakfast operators, or operators of self-catering accommodation, leaves too many people without the assistance they need.“A support scheme that finishes at the end of August, or September or whenever it will be, simply will not be adequate in parts of the country such as ours.#Those parts of the country that have seasonal tourism require a -month programme, or  the tourism industry that will be left to be resurrected at the end of this process will be that much weaker, and the rebuilding and recovery that much more dficult.” on Wednesday also heard from struggling tourism businesses.One BB owner said she had been unable to apply for support funds as they required applicants to have paid businesses rates, whereas she paid domestic council tax.Living Lerwick has also raised the plight of small tourism operators.Project manager Emma Miller said that as some did not have a business banking account they had been unable to apply for the Creative or Tourism and Hospitality Enterprises Fund, which opened in Scotland to support the industry. raquo"},{"url":null,"title":"general manager at streamline ","story":"We have an exciting opportunity for a self-motivated and results-driven General Manager to join our Operations team at our Lerwick Depot.

He#s down there six nights of the week, has his half a dozen drams and gets a taxi home. He#s loved by regulars and visitors alike.#Everyone takes him under their wing # he#s a lovely man.#He took a turn after the new year and lost his confidence and ended up in a nursing home in Strontian. He then came back to Skye and went to Home Farm.“I contact him every Saturday to have a blether with him, but then Coronavirus struck.#However, I phoned and his nurse and carer said he was doing well. I then spoke to Norman and was chatting about this that and the other and said ‘you#ll be missing your mackerel and herring’, and he said #I#d rather mackerel’.#Norman#s request quickly sent his peers from the Pier into action and what would soon become known as ‘Operation Mackerel’ was up and running.#I put a blog up on the Pier Hotel Facebook page where I update people about how Norman#s doing,# said Sandy.#I mentioned that he was missing a bit of mackerel and the next thing I know I had several offers of mackerel from the village here all the way up to Uig.#I contacted Home Farm to seethey would accept some mackerel coming into the home for Norman and they said it would be no problem at all.#I expected two or three mackerel but Gordon McCririck gave me  fillets courtesy of Just Hooked fishmongers to take up to the home.#Sandy added: #Lo and behold I came home to see a photo of Norman tucking into his two mackerel and potatoes on Facebook.“It delighted a great number of people from the Pier Hotel to see Norman looking so well and sitting having what he asked for – and all thanks to the generosity of Gordon McCririck and Just Hooked.#Speaking to the Free Press, Norman#s niece Christina MacTaggart said: #The old man was absolutely delighted.“The nurse that has been looking after him has been fantastic, she took a fantastic photo of him and I had to share it with the ones from the Pier Hotel.#We had his th birthday party down at the Pier last year.

One of Northern Ireland#s top GPs explained that community pharmacists could also be used during the flu season, while help may be needed from the Department of Health to administer the jabs.Dr George O#Neill said the flu season is just months away and plans must be in place to deliver flu jabs sooner rather than later.Outlining the looming danger that could be realised this winter, Dr O#Neill compared Covid- to the Spanish flu pandemic in .The second wave of that virus hit during the winter months and claimed more lives than the first.If you combine the normal natural flu -you can call it normal - plus Covid-, a double whammy will hit us towards the end of this year so the flu jab is going to be crucially important, he said.Towards the beginning of the winter we#re going to have to administer the flu jabs andthere#s still ongoing problems, which I#m sure there will be, we#re going to have to think of a new way of doing this.We#re throwing ideas around about the flu jabs. Drive-thrus could be a possibility and maybe working with community pharmacists. We have to think of dferent ways of doing this.Rather than putting it off, it should be faced up to now and we should have some idea about where we#re going to be.We#re halfway through May and it#s in September and October when we start to consider giving flu jabs.GPs have already recommenced baby vaccinations and immunisations but the lack of personal protective equipment- mainly face masks - is an ongoing concern.Dr O#Neill, who is the joint chair of the West Belfast GP Federation, believes that the mother of the child should also be wearing face masks.We need so many face masks becauseyou have maybe  babies a week coming in with the mother, the mother should, in my view, wear a face mask, he said.Everybody should be treated as a suspected Covid- carrier.These are things GPs are thinking about at the moment and certainly in both the North and West Belfast GP Federations, we have set up a small sub-group to look at how we can start moving back into the normal world again.Dr O#Neill said changes in the healthcare system that have occurred since the outbreak of the virus would normally have taken years.One of the main positives to have come from the crisis is the increased use of video and telephone consultations with patients. Dr O#Neill has called this development a major game changer.He explained that in some areas, hospitals can carry out % of their post-operation consultations through telephone calls or online video conferencing with a patient.As part of that effort, patients have been encouraged to buy their own blood pressure monitors and pulse oximeters so they can pass on the results to their GP.With video and telephone consultations there is no going back, said Dr O#Neill. This is here to stay and patients like it because it#s quicker.If you ring up you#ll have a response with you within a day.It saves the patient a visit to the hospital, it means we can deal with patients quicker and it#s better all round for everybody concerned.It#s a win-win situation and it#s a major game changer.There#s a positive that will come out this and also new ways of working.What has happened in the last seven to eight weeks has been incredible.The changes that have occurred would have taken years but things have happened quickly and rapidly.Everybody has been working together and towards the same aim. Everyone is looking for the same outcome.There are positives to this, it#s not all doom and gloom.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It all became possible after The Church Mouse shop in Enniskillen received a consignment of defective shirts prior to the lockdown.The manager of the East Bridge Street store, which is run by Enniskillen Presbyterian Church, then thought it might be possible to use them in the quest for PPE.And that is when Eleanor Harpur enlisted an army of volunteers to turn the sub-standard shirts into scrubs for two Northern Ireland hospitals and care homes in the Republic.Quite some time ago we received a large boxed up consignment of white shirts with minor defects that you wouldn#t have noticed, she said.A large number of boxes had been sent to Operation Rescue in Ethiopia and we were able to sell some in the shop, but we still had a lot left over when we had to close in March because of the lockdown.Watching the news one night I wondered whether they would be of any use to the NHS at this anxious time.Eleanor asked two church members, Alison and Gordon Annan, for guidance as the latter had already helped to distribute PPE across Ireland with the help of fellow bikers known as #Bikers Coming Through#.Gordon told me the shirts, almost , of them, could be altered and made into scrubs, which was great news, she said.As a result Gordon delivered  shirts to Margaret Houston of NI Scrubs, a seamstress in Dromore, Co Tyrone, whose team of  home-working machinists removed the collars and cuffs.They sewed a V-shaped neckline cut into the front and made other alternations, which included sewing on pockets, to produce scrubs for the South West Acute Hospital in Enniskillen.Eleanor told how another  shirts went to Co Kildare by van, where Gordon met up with fellow bikers for the onward journey to Co Kerry and machinists there to make more scrubs for care homes in the area.She added that the final  shirts went to the machinists in Dromore again, where they were altered for use in the new Nightingale hospital in Belfast.Eleanor said the delivery of the defective shirts was an example of God working in mysterious ways.Little did we know, when we received this large consignment of shirts, how useful they would actually become, she said.We are so grateful that we have been able to play a small part in helping those who are doing so much for us all.Belfast ,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

It#s imperative that all councils are proposing to furlough their workers must do so on the basis that they will fund the additional %.

It added: To be in a position to sustain service levels into the future and emerge with a feasible long-term plan for economic recovery, greater financial assistance from central government will be required.Meanwhile, Mid Ulster District Council said furloughing just over a third of its workforce would reduce April losses from £, to just over £,.Solace NI, the body of council chief executives, warned last week that local authorities here could run out of cash for staff and suppliers within monthsthey did not get the support they needed.Belfast Most ReadFisheries staff given insufficient time to prepare for safeof angling: MLACommunity gathers to remember Clare and Bethany Smyth after quad bike tragedy Orcas swim alongside boat in Northern Ireland in rare and ‘stunning’ sightingBittersweet homecoming for virus survivor Geoffrey McKillop as he hears lelong friend and her daughter died in quad bike crashCo Antrim-based  Rles deployment to Kabul goes ahead despite pandemic,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

Sharma has announced further funding for vaccine research  FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappBusiness Secretary Alok Sharma has announced further funding for vaccine research By Gavin Cordon, PA Whitehall EditorMay   : PMFacebookTwitterEmailThe Government is investing a further £ million in the hunt for a coronavirus vaccine as ministers announced a ground-breaking deal which could make millions of doses available in the UK as early as September.Business Secretary Alok Sharma said the additional funding would support teams at Oxford University and Imperial College London engaged in the global race to find a vaccine that could finally end the devastating pandemic.At the same time, he said Oxford had signed a global licensing agreement with AstraZeneca which could see it supply  million doses of a vaccine – with  million going to the UK – as soon as Septemberone has been found by then.“The UK will be first to get access but we can also ensure that in addition to supporting people here in the UK we’re able to make the vaccine available to developing countries at the lowest possible cost,” he told the daily No  press briefing.While the announcement will be seen as a boost to hopes of finding a vaccine, Boris Johnson earlier cautioned that there was still a lot to do and that the search may never be successful.Writing in The Mail on Sunday, he said: “There remains a very long way to go, and I must be frank that a vaccine might not come to fruition.”Mr Sharma said, however, that trials of the Oxford vaccine were “progressing well” with the phase one participants having received their doses earlier this week.“The speed at which Oxford University has designed and organised these complex trials is genuinely unprecedented,” he said.He said the additional research funding would help with the mass production of the vaccine so thattrials are successful “we have dosages to start vaccinating the UK population straight away”.In a further move, he said that the Government was putting in £ million to accelerate the completion of the UK’s first vaccines manufacturing innovation centre.The facility at Harwell in Oxfordshire –  which is already under construction – is now expected to open in summer , a year ahead of schedule.Mr Sharma said that once it was operating it would have the capacity to produce enough vaccine doses to serve the entire UK population in as little as six months.In the event that a vaccine was found before then, he said the Government was providing £ million to build a “rapid deployment facility” which will be able to start manufacturing “at scale” from this summer.“The UK continues to lead the global response to find a vaccine, and the Government is backing our scientists to do this as quickly as possible,” he said.Howeverthe search for a vaccine was not successful, he said they were also looking at other drug treatments and therapeutics, with six drugs having entered initial live clinical trials.The announcements came as the latest Department of Health figures showed , people had died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus in the UK as of pm on

to be learned over care homes PA FacebookTwitterEmailWhatsappMichael Gove has said there are ‘big lessons’ to be learned over care homes “There is always, always, always in any loosening of these restrictions a risk of people catching the coronavirus,” he told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show.“The key thing is that we can make these workplaces safe. You can never eliminate risk, but as we know, it is the case that it’s extremely unlikely that any school is likely to be the source of a Covid outbreak.“If for any reason there are risks then we can take steps to mitigate them.”Mr Gove said there are “big lessons” to be learned from the treatment of care homes during the outbreak amid growing criticism of the lack of Government support for the sector.While “signicant steps” had been taken to improve the situation, he said it remained a “challenge”.“We are still living through this pandemic and there will be lessons to be learned,” he said.“There will be a point in the future when all of us can look back and reflect and make sure we have learned the appropriate lessons.”PAMost ReadCovid- is deepening inequalities, says LGBT charityHottest day of the year expected with temperature forecast to hit CUK’s wealthiest lose billions to pandemic as Sir James Dyson tops Rich ListNavy launches probe after leak on board aircraft carrierYoung children will still socially distance at school, health chief says,\"lazyload\":trueBelfasttelegraphSearchSearchNewsNorthern IrelandUKRepublic of IrelandWorldPoliticsBrexitHealthEducationCourtsObituariesArchiveOpinionAnalysisCommentColumnistsEditor#s ViewpointJournalistsBusinessNorthern IrelandFood, Drink and HospitalityUK and WorldBrexitJobsAgriTechnologyAnalysisUlster BusinessTop  CompaniesSportFootballRugbyGAAGolfMotorcyclingBoxingBelfast GiantsOther SportsLeFeaturesFashion and BeautyHealth  WellbeingHouse and HomeFood and DrinkBooksWeekendMotoringHoroscopesEntertainmentNewsFilm and TVMusic and GigsTheatre and ArtsNightleSunday LeNewsSportFeaturesEventsSports AwardsBusiness AwardsSpirit of N.

For many couples, Slaughtneil was more than just an exercise in adolescent revelry. It became the starting point for the rest of their romantic lives. The County Derry Post caught up with four couples for whom Slaughtneil will always be a special place. Sarah and Eamonn Darragh  “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really.”  Kilrea man Eamonn Darragh his we, Bellaghy woman Sarah have an age-old Slaughtneil ritual to thank for fate bringing them together back in . googletag.cmd.push In this case, fate had a name. “Whenever I was at primary school, I was friendly with a fella called Shay Quinn,” said Sarah. “I played with him on the boys’ football team. He was the year above me and when I got to St Pat’s the year after, him and Eamonn were friends. “One night out at Slaughtneil, Shay askedI would go with Eamonn and that was it really. I saw him on nights out at Slaughtneil and in school, and that was how things started.” The disco holds special signicance for Sarah and Eamonn, whose relationship grew as the hills of south Derry reverberated to the incoherent sounds of Mark McCabe. googletag.cmd.push “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil,” she said. “You’d have been checking the Mid Ulster Observer every week to checkit was going to be a late night, orit was a foam party. “Then you had to be good to your parents all week and put the feelers out on a Wednesday or Thursday to seeyou could go. “Our nights out would have all been at Slaughtneil. Eamonn got the bus up from Kilrea and I would get it from Bellaghy on a Friday night, and we continued our relationship from there. “If we both weren’t there, we wouldn’t have met each other, we wouldn’t have been married and having a babyI hadn’t met him through Shay at the disco.” Enda and Laura Heron  “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me!”  For many involved with the GAA, the word ‘lap’ doesn’t conjure up many positive thoughts, butyou ask anyone who crossed the door of Slaughtneil disco, it’s a dferent story. Laura Heron was embarking on a lap of the hall when she bumped into the man who would later become her husband, but they were lucky to be there at all. “We met around the Millennium, when we thought the world was going to end,” she said. “We were doing the lap of the hall, as you do. I don’t have a great memory of it – Enda remembers more than me! “We had a wee kiss that night, but we met a year later, when we were  or so, going to the Elk and the sparks flew from then on.” Even the soundtrack to the encounter belied its good fortune, as the pair met to the unmistakable sound of ‘Toca’s Miracle’ by ‘Fragma’. Memories of going to the disco are still fresh in her mind. “You were always excited to go, you couldn’t wait until Friday night came,” she said. “We always got DCs Coaches from Bellaghy. That was part of the fun too, heading up on the bus for that opportunity to have fun with your friends at the weekend, after school was over. “When you’re that age, going to Slaughtneil when you’re in fourth year or whatever, you think you’re an adult, that you know everything. You don’t realise that you were still a child. “We got married in  and were going out for about  years or so. We went to Australia for a year and came home and settled down from that point, but it all began in Slaughtneil hall.” Jenna Mulhern and David Donnelly  “If he was driving about, we’d always meet at Slaughtneil and we started going steady when we were .”  When Dungiven woman Jenna Mulhern met her husband-to-be David, from Ballinascreen, his time at Slaughtneil disco had been brought to a premature end. “He was actually known in Slaughtneil as ‘Davy Bash’, because he was always in rows,” said Jenna. “He couldn’t come in because he was barred from the place for fighting – that’s why he had to drive about outside. “We got talking, and then the following week, I met him again and we had our first curt.” Jenna remembers her uncle leaving her and her friends over to the disco and having to suffer their excited, and quite vocal anticipation. “My uncle used to leave us over and God love him, he had to listen to the biggest pile of rubbish in that car,” she recalled. “Once we landed it was brilliant, meeting up with everybody and then sneaking out halfway through the night to meet Davy. “Young ones now will never experience anything like it. We couldn’t wait to get dressed up on a Friday night and have a wee blue WKD on the way over. “I know a lot who would have went to Slaughtneil and are still with the same people. I’d say a lot of people have met their first loves there.” Kieran and Paula Tully  “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes!”  There are dozens of women who can look back at Slaughtneil as the place where they met and their future husbands, but a much lesser number who were proposed to there. Paula Tully’s husband Kieran, overcome by the intoxicating mix of perfume and freshly cut turf, popped the question after the couple left the hall for some air back in . “That particular night we came out to be on our own on the bus. I could nearly point out where it was sitting,” said Paula. “We weren’t saying the Rosary now, but we weren’t doing anything bad either! That’s when Kieran asked me to marry him.” “I think it was a spur of the moment thing, but of course I said yes. We went steady until just after I was . When you think about it now, it’s crazy how young we were.” With Kieran from Ballerin and Paula from Glenullin, their story has a Romeo and Juliet feel, with love prospering amid the pitched battles going on around them. “I remember one of my friends fell out with me for a month when I started going with Kieran, because he was from Ballerin and I was from the Glen! “At that time, you had the gang of boys from the Glen that fought with the gang of boys from Ballerin. She thought I was being a complete traitor.” The couple continued the Slaughtneil theme throughout their relationship, with DJ Terry McIl, who played on the very first night of the disco, performing at their wedding. “Our weans think it’s hilarious, that it’s crazy,” laughed Paula. “We had brilliant memories, I don’t regret a second of it. We’ll be  years married this August. If I was to do it all again, I would not change a thing.” See also: SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: Spinning the soundtrack to a timless era SLAUGHTNEIL FEATURE: The goose that laid the golden egg.

Those days seem positively idyllic now, but alas, like the car journeys of her childhood, we’re not nearly there yet. The Covid story fills our daily lives, with a relentless stream of media coverage of illness and death, with graphs distorted so as to frighten and confuse, with front page pictures of the victims. Everywhere is the constant reiteration of the now disproven narrative that the lock up is saving lives. Our politicians vie with one another to virtue signal their intent to prolong the misery and impoverishment of our people, and of future generations. googletag.cmd.push Our elderly are told they are being kept alive, but denied all of the simple pleasures which make le worth living-family, friends, society and their religious practices. Meanwhile, the entire healthy population is under house arrest, policed by the state, but more worryingly by their neighbours in a social media shamefest. Those who “follow the science” know that this foul disease is behaving as many such seasonal viral illnesses have done for millions of years. They travel through communities, and wreak havoc on the elderly and infirm. In Ireland, the median age of death is  years. % of those dying have other, often multiple medical problems, like cancer heart disease and strokes. googletag.cmd.push In most of the community, viral illnesses cause illness and misery to many, but most have a mild illness, recover completely and are conferred with immunity to further infection. Each death is a personal loss for those left behind, but death is a necessary and inevitable part of the human condition. Many older people do not fear it. The science also suggests that this virus was in Europe much earlier than previously thought-possibly in December and January, that the peak of deaths was on th April, which given an incubation period of - days, meant the lockup came too late to influence outcomes. The evidence for this timeline is growing daily, but doesn’t seem to have reached the politicians who are deciding the fate and future of our very civilization.  The dire predictions of tens, even hundreds of thousands of deaths in the UK alone were based on computer models which have been heavily criticized by independent statisticians and mathematicians. The original aim of protecting the NHS, and flattening the curve has been achieved. But now we see the narrative changing, with dread warnings of second waves and the new normal, indeed noto an open society until there is a vaccine. The rules around social distancing, plucked from the ether, without any evidence base are internalized by the population. The media, which is essentially an arm of government, eagerly reinforces the narrative. We should realise that the search for a vaccine for HIV AIDS is now entering its fourth decade. Also safety trials for any vaccine historically take years, and rightly so, given the exposure of entire populations to potential harm. It is clear, as I pointed out in a previous article for this paper about a month ago, that countries who have imposed lockdowns have outcomes comparable to those who took more moderate steps to protect their people. Also, since around half of the fatalities occur in the care home sector, the total failure to protect these facilities with whatever resources were available has cost many lives. It is also clear that the lockup policy is causing at least half of the excess mortality we are seeing, and that this proportion is likely to increase signicantly as people are being denied treatment and diagnostics in the other areas. Heart disease, strokes, cancer and mental health problems haven’t gone away, but their recognition and treatment have. I’ve been working in the NHS throughout this period. On my one sht in the GP Covid assessment centre, I counted fteen staff, including three doctors and many highly skilled nurses, who in a four-hour sht saw three patients, none of whom has Covid. Hospitals are half empty, highly skilled staff idle. There are no elective surgical lists, nor routine outpatient appointments, so people wait in pain for surgery or in anxiety and stress for tests to find outthey have serious illnesses such as cancer. Meantime in the out-of-hours GP service, we see people in mental health crises, deal with people isolated and displaced, those suffering from a relapse of addictions under control for years, and an elderly population terried and reluctant to seek help, because they have been repeatedly told that their NHS is in danger of being overwhelmed, and because they dread separation from loved ones. The distress of those families with children with behavioural or learning dficulties, or additional physical needs is truly heartbreaking. Discussion of the economic consequences of all of this are beyond my remit, but experts say there is not a linear, but exponential effect on the crash which is certainly coming as a result of the almost total cessation of economic activity. In other words, a four-month lockup isn’t twice as bad as a two month one, but many, many times worse. Here in the developed world we are unlikely to starve, although there will be widespread austerity the likes of which we have not seen in generations. But in the global south, where millions live on subsistence wages, the abrupt loss of economic activity and markets for produce will cause catastrophic starvation and cost the lives of millions. Disease is a constant challenge to societies and governments. But the unprecedented response to this one takes us to uncharted and very dangerous waters. There is no evidence that the political decision makers have done any intelligent cost benefit analysis, looking at the big picture of the physical, mental, social and economic outcomes for those whose lives they are entrusted to improve. They are either inept beyond imagining, or willfully colluding in the destruction of society, especially for future generations.

To get ahead of them, you need to be quick off the mark.This weekend will see theof their soccer leagues behind closed doors, marking a conclusion to the sporting lock-down due to the worldwide coronavirus pandemic.With nine games to go, a win for Borussia Dortmund on Saturday would see them cut the margin at the top to a single point by the time leaders Bayern Munich kick off in Berlin on Sunday afternoon.The decision comes after the government gave the green light to games going ahead in mid-May and approximately , tests were carried out on the players, coaches and support staff from all  clubs in the top two leagues at the end of April.The German league website reported a second wave of testing, around the , mark, has flagged up two positive cases which will be monitored.The countrys leader Chancellor Angela Merkel is highly-qualied and holds a doctorate for her thesis on quantum chemistry. She is happy the country has achieved the goal of slowing down the spread of the virus.She handed the responsibility to the organisers of the league and they have put a special sports medicine and match operations task force in place to managed the move back to competitive sport.Tier two club Dynamo Dresden has since put their squad and management team in isoaltion for two weeks after two players tested positive for coronavirus. The rest of the leagues will go ahead.If only we had locked down as quickly in this part of the world. Thank God for local communities and for the GAA, who acted swty to lead people once Leo Varadkar signalled the need to act in early May.The Taoiseach was naiumlve during his appearance on the Late, Late Show to hint at the chance for the All-Ireland championships to be played this year.It is dficult to see how, but the GAA leadership has since issued the statement confirming that there will be no inter-county action until October and club activities wont begin before mid-July,they even do.It leaves uncertainty surrounding the chance of playing games behind closed doors, which is not ruled out, but anyto action – club or county – is subject to public health guidance. googletag.cmd.push SAFETY FIRST When I think back to club month in April last year, there is nothing I would like better than ato action. Laveys clash with Swatragh ending in a draw, Foreglen and Claudy going down to the last seconds and Banaghers clash with Dungiven decided by a point. It would make you jealous thinking about it.Everybody knows how tight the calendar is and that there will only be room for county or club,there is a . But not both.With all players essentially club players and the chosen few on county , it is only fair the GAA cater for everyone and scrap the county scene. It may seem like the nuclear option and an extreme one, but the hierarchy would get huge respect for making such a dficult decision. This reinforces how well clubs rallied around those in need. It was the GAA at its very best.I would feel for Derry hurlers though, who were in a terric situation to eventually get out of Division B. So maybe the GAA could finish out the few games involving the relegation and promotion, so that it is an even keel when  comes around the corner.Deep down and with a realistic hat on, I cant see much being played. The safety of a nation is just far too important. We are not Germany. They got off to a better start, with stronger leadership coming from the top.I just hope the GAA dont force teams to play behind closed doors. It is not an option. There is some dference between Bayern Munichs Robert Lewandowski and say... Derrys Karl McKaigue.Big Lewandowski, now that all the players are tested, can be kept in exile from his family. Professionals can stay in hotels and there is money there to fund that.McKaigue is a physiotherapist and potentially working on the front line. How can he possibly stay in isolation.

At present, there are six people being treated at Altnagelvin Hospital in Derry after testing positive for the disease. Geraldine McKay, the Western Trusts Director of Acute Hospitals, said that the number of COVID- patients at Altnagelvin was very reduced in comparison to what they have been. There have been  deaths from COVID- in recent months in the Western Trusts two acute hospitals at Altnagelvin and the South West hospital in Enniskillen. There have been further deaths in local care homes but a breakdown of deaths in inidual care homes has not been made public. googletag.cmd.push The Western Trust said that there had been COVID- outbreaks in  care homes in the Trust area. An outbreak is defined as two or more cases. Ms McKay said the lower than anticipated number of cases and deaths locally was due to the co-operation of the public and the magnicent work of healthcare staff. As part of the preparations for the expected rise in COVID- cases, the number of intensive care beds at Altnagelvin Hospital had been increased from  to . However, Ms McKay said the intensive care unit never had to work at full capacity over the recent period. googletag.cmd.push She said that the number of people attending Altnagelvins emergency department had decreased by almost % over recent months after people were asked to stay away from the hospital as much as possible to allow staff to cope with the COVID- situation. Ms McKay praised the public for their support for the health service and highlighted how well people locally had taken on board the message to stay at home and maintain social distancing when out in public. She said this had played a vital role in keeping the number of COVID- cases and deaths lower than had been anticipated. People have really done what we asked of them, she said. Ms McKay said the Trust was now looking at how to manage the new normal for hospital services, taking into consideration issues such as social distancing in waiting areas and the use of personal protection equipment for staff.

Robert Fullerton, who is , bought the pound ‘Treasure Bingo’ Scratchcard at his local Vivoxtra store whilst shopping for some essential grocery items on May . Little did Robert know that later the same evening he would discover he’d won an amount , times greater than the price of the scratchcard! The incredible news comes as an amazing boost for Robert and his we Susanas both had been recently furloughed from the company they work for as a result of the COVID- pandemic. googletag.cmd.push Robert works as a spray painter and Susan as a machine operator for a leading local kitchen supplier and, like many across the country, have been furloughed for the past five weeks as part of the Government’s job retention scheme. Robert explained how his le-changing win came about. “I was out doing an essential grocery shop and had a scratchcard in my pocket with a pound win on it. So while I was paying for the groceries, I exchanged it for another similar National Lottery Scratchcard, and bought an extra one for good measure. “I brought the two scratchcards home and played them that night. I didn’t win anything on the first scratchcard and gave it to Susan to check, while I was scratching the second card,” he continued. googletag.cmd.push “Half-way through, it was already showing that I’d won pound, and I started physically shaking. I was thinking to myself, ‘that’s not right’ and had to get up and go outside for some fresh air. “I showed the scratchcard to Susan and took a photo that I sent to my mum and sister – both of whom agreed that I wasn’t seeing things and that, as far as they could see, I’d won three hundred grand! “After a restless night, with little or no sleep, I called The National Lottery the following morning. They asked for some details and then, I’ll never forget, the lady on the phone said… ‘Congratulations, you have won pound,’! “My reply was ‘you what ’ My heart felt like it was going to burst out of my chest. In fact, I still can’t believe it. It’s like a dream come true, especially in these uncertain times when we’re stuck at home and don’t really know how our jobs will be affected by this coronavirus pandemic.” Despite his big win, Robert hopes to get back to work as soon as possible, saying that he loves his job and the ‘banter’ with his workmates. Robert bought the winning National Lottery Treasure Bingo Scratchcard from the Vivoxtra store on Magherafelt Road in Castledawson.

It was announced yesterday that fishing will be allowed as part of the easing of the lockdown restrictions. Glenowen Fisheries, which is based within Creggan Country Park, will be among the local facilities to re-open next. A spokesperson for the fisheries stressed that people would need to pre-book and pre-pay before arriving at the facility. Fisheries Minister Edwin Poots has confirmed that the Public Angling Estatewill gradually re-open to local anglers from Monday. Thirty PAE’s across Northern Ireland will re-open to the public for recreational use, but anglers should only use the DAERA facilities within their local area and should not travel long distances. Minister Poots also confirmed that car parking facilities will remain closed until  May . googletag.cmd.push Speaking about the announcement, the Minister said:“In the interests of public health, I shut down the angling estate on  March, to discourage unnecessary journeys and protect my staff as well as anglers themselves, given that the majority are in the + age bracket and many have concessionary angling licences due to underlying health issues. “While car parks will remain closed until  May to discourage long journeys, I have decided to permit local anglers back on to the Public Angling Estate so that they can participate in their favourite recreational activity. “By its nature, angling is a solo sport or hobby, and its participants can enjoy a day’s fishing without being in close contact with others. The sport has huge benefits for people’s mental and physical well-being and in this time of uncertainty, I know that many people have missed the solitude and peace that angling and being outdoors with nature, brings them. googletag.cmd.push “However, let me be clear – anglers must continue to follow social distancing guidelines, practice good hand hygiene and walk to their nearest PAE, fishing alone or with a member of their own household. I do not want to see crowds of people near the river banks and fisheries.

Sean McLaughlin, the owner of Georges Bar in Bishop Street, had organised a night of live music to celebrate the le of Shenda McKenna on her first anniversary on April . Due to the coronavirus the gig was cancelled, but undeterredthe the singers moved online where they played on Facebook Live streaming service. Music lover Shenda was just  when she passed away. We wanted to mark the anniversary of our beautul friend Shenda, said Mr McLaughlin. We would have loved for nothing more than celebrating her le in the bar, however, the musicians agreed to go online and the event was able to go ahead and raised pound,. googletag.cmd.push Georges Bar is well known for its live music and craic and the regulars regard each otheras family. We call it the Georges family, said Mr McLaughlin, who has owned the bar for seven years. We have a long tradition of charity fundraisingand we would raise a lot of money for the Playtrail, so this seemed like the perfect way to remember Shenda. She was in here every weekend and she loved music. Last week, Georges Bar held another fundraiser in aidof the late Pat ODonnell, known affectionately as Wee Pat, who passed away last Christmas Day aged . Pat was a stalwart of Georges and was part of the furniture here for a number of years, said Mr McLaughlin. googletag.cmd.push Sadly, we lost Pat on Christmas Day , and that void has never, and will never, be filled. Pat had travelled the world and worked looking after garment factories in the likes of Madagascar and Mauritius. His stories were legendary and he lived a really full and interesting le. He was like a piece of the furniture in here and he was in almost every night when he lived in Mountjoy Street and later Abbey House. He was the oldest person in the bar and he had a real love of music. He used to always ask Sean McCafferty to play The Lakesof Pontchartrain for him but we never knew why and then when Sean played it on Thursday a cousin of Pats messaged from Canada to say he lived just a few blocks from Lake Pontchartrain, so now we know! The night in aid of Wee Pat took place on Thursday, May , and raised a further pound for the Foyle Food Bank, bringing the total raised to pound,. Its been really nice to raise this moneyeven though the bar cant open and Im sure its badly needed at this time, added Mr McLaughlin.

The number of parcels being delivered is % more than this time last year, with the districtrsquos other foodbanks reporting an increased demand.In a newsletter issued last week, Mrs Lennon revealed that an application to the Martin Lewis Coronavirus Emergency Fund was successful and that the support the charity will receive will make a ldquosignicant dference to its work in the immediate future.She also said that many of the volunteers have begun to see food and its supply in a dferent way.ldquoThe panic buying, shortages and less opportunities to shop has had an impact on people who have never faced this situation before, continued Mrs Lennon.ldquoPersonally, I hope I understand a little more about the worry that feeding those we love can bringle becomes dficult. I have been so pleased that the foodbank has been able to continue operating in these dficult circumstances, even though it is operating dferently.Mrs Lennon said she is especially grateful to everyone who has helped her with decision making and practical help since the pandemic began.ldquoIt has been humbling and amazing to see God continuing to bless the work and to be able to help those in our community who need the support, she continued.Donations of food can be left at the Asda and SuperValu stores in Downpatrick during their opening hours andanyone would like to make a financial donation they can do so by email.There is also a weekly donation point for people in Saintfield at the townrsquos First Presbyterian Church between pm and pm. Donations can be made on Tuesdays between pm and pm.Partner organisations can still refer people to the foodbank for support either by telephone on   or by emailing fountainfoodbank@gmail, while iniduals who feel they need help can also contact the foodbank directly, providing some basic information. They can also order a food parcel.Mrs Lennon said that due to the very dficult circumstances at present, the foodbank is keen to help as many people as possible, urging them not to be anxious about asking for help.Orders need to be placed by pm on Tuesdays, with parcels delivered on Wednesday afternoons and left outside clientsrsquo homes.Across the district, many groups and iniduals are donating food and money to the foodbank to allow the volunteers to help those in need. They include BM Bargains in Ballynahinch, Crossgar Harriers, Omagh Stockcar Club, Downpatrick FC, Saintfieldrsquos Hollymount Hall and churches in the Saintfield area.Mrs Lennon said: ldquoWe are overwhelmed by the generosity shown by so many at this dficult time. Despite food being dficult to purchase, people are still making donations and many generous financial donations have been made.The foodbank volunteers hope that shoppers will continue to think about the charity when they are shopping and leave items at the dedicated collection points in local stores to help them continue to meet increasing demand.The Fountain Foodbank contact details are  , email fountainfoodbank@gmail or visit www.downpatrickpresbyterianchurch.org..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Aughlisnafin.jpg","title":"Aughlisnafin man Chris makes vital PPE equipment  ","story":"AN Aughlisnafin man has taken his new lesaving charity venture to a higher level.Chris Campbell, is putting his passion for technology to good use by making PPE for care workers on the frontline of the coronavirus pandemic.Chris, who began making PPE from his home a little over a month ago, has been inundated with requests, so much so that he and his small team of volunteers have moved their operation to St Maryrsquos Community Hall in Newcastle.The premises were kindly offered to him by Rob Manley, founder of Newcastle Community Cinema, which has had to close due to the lockdown.By using D printers Chrisrsquos venture, PPE NHS Supplies NI, has so far supplied almost , high-quality sets of face shields and ear protectors to hospitals and nursing homes mdash and thatrsquos just the beginning.Chrishas been helped by generous cash donations by members of the public.He said: ldquoAt the beginning I received an anonymous donation of pound, which overwhelmed me and since then the donations have been pouring in. I am so humbled by the kindness of strangers.ldquoI set up a GoFundMe page that allows charity workers like myself to make instant withdrawals which means I can now purchase materials faster and produce the PPE without much delay.The more D printers that Chris can purchase the more lesaving equipment he can produce. However, costs are rising.ldquoThis week a D printer jumped to pound on eBay. The same printer last year cost pound. You could say they have all but tripled in price, he explained.Chris was diagnosed with ADHD when he was eight years old and has been greatly supported by the ADHD Hub in Newcastle.He says that once Covid- and the need for PPE ends, all funds from his venture will be donated to the Hub which is based in Savoy Lane.Chris says the condition is like a double-edged sword. While his le has been greatly impacted by ADHD, it can help him become a high achiever.ldquoSometimes people with the condition possess an exceptional ability to entertain, but there is always another side to it, he said.ldquoWe suffer from poor concentration levels in many areas and we have limited social skills. We miss out on the social subtleties that most other people take for granted and we are notoriously impulsive, which means school is a very hard environment for most of us.ldquoWhile we donrsquot make friends easily, wersquore exceptionally good at thinking outside the box. Nonetheless, it isnrsquot easy having thousands of thoughts running through your mind every moment, he said.Chris, who is happy to be producing high-end lesaving PPE, had this message for readers: ldquoIf you or a friend or family member are working for the NHS or any nursing home without the proper PPE please get in touch with me to arrange delivery or collection of the face shields and ear protectors.Alternatively you can help Chris fund his project by using the following link https:www.gofundme f d-printed-nhs-ppe-supplies-ni..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Club.jpg","title":"Ballynahich Youth salutes its young heroes  ","story":"BALLYNAHINCH Youthrsquos annual award winners have been announced.

I launched it at the school where I teach and it went down really well, everyone loved it.ldquoBut, sadly with many children loosing members of their family through Covid- the sales of the book have seen a resurgence.The Wizard and I tells the story of a young boy who visited a wizard at the bottom of his garden every time he needed advice.Ciaran added: ldquoThe wizard was always able to answer any questions the boy had, but one day the wizard wasnrsquot there. He then had to start answering questions for himself.ldquoThe boy in the story is myself as I go to visit my grandfather. The girl in the story is my daughter. When she arrives the boy has less time to spend with the wizard, explains Ciaran.ldquoAs a boy I always enjoyed spending time with my grandfather. I was like a sponge and would soak up his answers to my many questions.ldquoSome years later I got married and had a family and didnrsquot have as much time to visit my grandfather until one day he wasnrsquot there any more.Ciaran says the book, which was designed to bring about a conversation about the topic of dying, can benefit adults too.ldquoMy daughter also illustrated the book. When she heard the story she started to draw how she pictured it. When it all came together it was perfect, he remarked.The dad-of-two hopes the book will facilitate big le changes, particularly in the current climate with older generations taking the biggest impact of Covid-.He said: ldquoI think now wersquove been gted more and more time with our families and lots of people are using that time to read to their kids so I think the book is perfect for this current situation.ldquoWhen it was first launched a lot of people asked who was the target audience and who was it geared towards.

The homes are being built at a sprawling site which borders four main roads.The redevelopment of the former hospital site includes a range of housing types including apartments, two and three storey homes and bungalows.It is also understood that the former hospital and canteen building behind it, which are both listed buildings, have been incorporated into the development plan as apartment blocks.The main entrance into the former hospital complex, off Pound Lane, will remain, while itrsquos understood that a new entrance is also proposed on the Ardglass Road side of the old Downe site.Downpatrick councillor Dermot Curran is pleased that contractors are back on site and hopes they are observing social distancing guidelines.He said the redevelopment will go some way towards reducing the number of people on the waiting list for social homes in Downpatrick.Cllr Curran added: ldquoThere are many families on the waiting list for social housing who are classed in the urgent need category which effectively means they are a priority for housing providers.ldquoPeople are watching construction work progress at the former hospital site and perhaps it may be possible for families to move into their new homes before the end of the year.Now that construction work has recommenced comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey confirmed that she is to introduce legislation designed to help protect the supply of new and existing social and affordable homes.She described housing as ldquoone of her priorities and said she has great ambitions to deliver more targeted to areas in the most need.ldquoTo do this, we must ensure we have the means to deliver, the minister continued, explaining that many of the changes required to existing legislation are technical in nature.Ms Hargey said the most signicant change will be an end to the compulsory need for registered housing associations to operate a house sales scheme.The minister said there will always be many challenges on the ability to deliver new social homes such as land availability, infrastructure issues and the availability of public finance, but outlined her commitment to doing all she can to deliver for those in need.Ms Hargey continued: ldquoI am committed to working with my Executivecolleagues to deliver more housing and welcome the priority afforded in the lsquoNew Decade, New Approachrsquo document which sets out how the Executivewill enhance investment and agree a new target for social and affordable home starts.ldquoFollowing the current coronavirus crisis, economic and social recovery will be vitally important for everyone. Whilst there are challenges ahead, a technicality should not stand in our way of delivery. This legislation will help to maximise the possible investment in a key public asset.Ms Hargey added: ldquoWithout a reversal of the classication decision the number of new social homes built each year would be reduced signicantly. It would also reduce access to the funding available for affordable housing through co-ownership..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Council Lead.jpg","title":"Council staff face furlough  ","story":"UP to  Newry, Mourne and Down Council staff could be furloughed as a result of coronavirus, it has emerged.It is believed that the move would save the local authority in the region of pound, a month, with suggestions that the organisation is currently ldquohaemorrhaging money due to a major loss of income.The local authority plans to utilise the job retention scheme with the majority of affected employees working in leisure centres, museums and arts, tourism and community facilities across the district.All these facilities have been closed since mid March as a result of the lockdown.The local authority has confirmed that it will make use of the coronavirus job retention scheme for employees who work in services where there has been a loss of income and who cannot be redeployed.The council is insisting that, at this stage, it does not know how exactly many employees will be impacted.It is understood that some politicians have been informed about the plans to furlough council staff and are confident the employees can retain their jobs when the ious centres and community facilities reopen.Politicians are also supportive of the councilrsquos senior management team for doing all it can to maintain key services during the pandemic and its key role in helping spearhead the community response on the ground.In addition, politicians say they recognise that prudent financial management is critically important in the current climate, given the challenges that lie ahead.News that up to  staff could be furloughed comes amid increasing concern that many local authorities across Northern Ireland that are losing hundreds of thousands of pounds each month may potentially have to look at reducing some services as a result of the pandemic.While many councils do not have major cash reserves, Newry, Mourne and Down Council is reported to be in a much healthier position than most.The Northern Ireland Local Government Associationmdash the umbrella body for the Provincersquos  councils mdash has warned of a ldquocash crisis for local councils as a result of the pandemic.The organisation said councils have gone beyond their remit, giving out , emergency food parcels and opening leisure centres to facilitate this operation.NILGA chief executive Derek McCallan said the organisation is expecting to see councils lose poundm in the non-payment of rates during the current financial year in addition to monthly losses.ldquoThat really points to one thing, cessation or a severe reduction in services, he continued.NILGA wants the Treasury to provide the same financial package it has have given English councils, which translates to around poundm for Northern Ireland. The organisation may also ask the Treasury to underwrite unpaid rates.Mr McCallan added: ldquoRecovery in many cases would be severely haltedthe very facilities and support to get the economy back again are severely restricted or donrsquot exist.Confirmation that Newry, Mourne and Down Council is using the furlough scheme comes after Stormont communities minister Deirdre Hargey said her officials have been working with local authorities to understand the extent to which they can manage the Covid- situation by making use of the job retention scheme. She insisted that her priorities were ensuring that the rights of workers were respected and protecting jobs.The minister added: ldquoThis is a very dficult time for everybody. Our  councils provide very important s and services, continuing to do so during this emergency and looking ahead councils need to be ready to play their part in the economic recovery.A spokesman for Newry, Mourne and Down Council confirmed that the organisation will avail of the coronavirus job retention scheme.He explained that it will apply to employees who work in services where there is loss of income due to the Covid- pandemic and who cannot be redeployed to do other work.The spokesman added: ldquoThis falls in line with guidance from the Department for Communities. At the moment, it is not yet known how many employees will be affected..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Cyclists.jpg","title":"Cyclists Zwifting in virtual races  ","story":"SO what is this new craze  Virtual cycling has been about for quite a few years and is basically riding your bicycle on a trainer in a virtual world.There are many apps and s available but the most popular is Zwt.

The races are seriously competitive, as they usually run in conjunction with other nationsrsquo leagues, and are pretty punishing on the body.Each of us knows our limits but with some choice words of encouragement via headphones during races, these limits can be surpassed. Jimmy is usually on the receiving end of the stick but generally backs it up in the races. Brian is beginning to settle into this new style of racing and improving with every outing.On our latest outing in the Newry League, only Kieran, Brian and myself made the start line and after a measured effort off the start we all ended up in the same group on the road, which was perfect.With the course being flat it was of utmost importance to stay in the draft of the group to preserve energy. Irsquom first to admit that both Kieran and Brian are much stronger riders than myself but with more experience on Zwt I was able to hang onto the group for longer than I expected.The three of us worked hard within the group, but with only six kilometres left we had slipped off the back of our group. I knew I was nearly done and with one last big effort Kieran and myself managed to close the gap to the group and Kieran and Brian were back in business.I was toast and reduced to riding to the finish alone, while the other lads were still firmly in the mix. They both had learnt their lesson and rode the last six kilometres well up in the group, covering every move.By the time the final sprint came Brian had recovered and shot out of the group to take the honours.Kieran rolled in a few places behind him, having succeeded in putting in a great sht during the whole race. I finished a couple of minutes down, but happy that I was able to help for a change. The next round will hopefully see a bigger Shimna turnout.Danny Carville, Barry Fettes, John Irwin and Marty McIlmail are involved in structured programmes and have found the daily training process very helpful during lockdown.One member, Brian Spence, is even using Zwt to recover from a skiing injury, while Lavelle Grant and Johnny Ward have just joined the ranks.Many other local clubs mdash such as Dromara, Newry, Killinchy, Ards and North Down mdash are experiencing similar interest due to the uncertainty of real cycling events this year.There is a lot of interaction between them and good communication, to the point that I believe it has made the whole Irish cycling community stronger and closer than it has been for a long time, helped mainly by the Zwt Community Team Irelandproviding a national sense of belonging in these dficult times.With riders from every county and of every ability itrsquos a credit to the likes of Alan Campbell, from Dromara, who has become heavily involved with the development of ZCTIrl, that this community is increasing daily.Of course Zwt is a global  and each country has its own community, but I believe that the Irish one is as strong as any in the world.Zwt is also being put to other good uses, with hundreds of people using the  to raise money for frontline services across the globe in this time of need.A few North Down members and myself helped raise more than pound, for the Ulster Hospital by riding the hardest course available on Zwt in around six hours. Painful, but well worth the effort.With the current situation worldwide, the cycling community is enjoying having some sort of sporting normality mdashyou call riding events with some of your heroes normality.The professional teams have followed suit and can be found riding around the same virtual world as us amateurs, training, racing and doing guest rides with their followers.There are not too many sports that can say that..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Dundrum.jpg","title":"Dundrum chef cooks his way to final of Great British Menu  ","story":"DUNDRUM chef Alex Greene has booked his place through to the coveted  Great British Menu banquet.The  year-old stunned the judges on Monday nightrsquos finals competition with a potato-based dish starter dish inspired by Belfast-born CS Lewisrsquo The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe childrenrsquosrsquo book.Alex celebrated once more by picking up host, Susan Calman, and swinging her round ndash much to the comediennersquos delight.He first started off his culinary career as a  year-old washing dishes in the Buckrsquos Head restaurant in his home village.Having once worked in Claridgersquos in London and also run his own restaurant, Top Nosh, in Annalong, Alex ed to Deanes EIPIC restaurant in Belfast, where he had worked previously, and helped it retain its Michelin star for the fth year.His dish of onion jelly, pickled onions, five dferent types of potato, a four-cheese custard, and truffle, served in a wardrobe, was described by the judges as ldquoa sophisticated, sexy, sensual masterpiece.

They also claimed the existing plant in Killyleagh is operating well below capacity and can easely accommodate with sewage from Crossgar.But local councillors Sam Osborne and Albert Colmer have been highly critical of the DoErsquos attitude towards people in the Crossgar and Killyleagh areas and say that in a supposed era of open Government and accountability, the Departmentrsquos attitude is nothing short of ldquodeplorable and diabolical.ARDGLASS ndash A former primary school could be developed as a new community facility in Ardglass, it has emerged this week.Education chiefs say they are prepared to hand over the former Ardglass Primary School at the Downpatrick Road to the local Development Association after years of neglect.The school, which closed its doors over  years ago, was to have been developed as a new library facility, and while education chiefs claim this plan is not dead yet, they are prepared to allow the former school to be redeveloped by the local group.In addition, East Down Institute officials are understood to be interested in providing outreach classes in Ardglass and local councillor Dermot Curran says he is ldquodelighted there is now movement on the future of the old building.He has unveiled plans to hold an urgent meeting between the South Eastern Education and Library Board, the Ardglass Development Association, Down Council and the East Down Institute, to discuss a way forward.CLOUGH ndash An elderly woman was the victim of a terrying ordeal last week when masked men tied her up at her Clough home for four hours.The two intruders broke into the pensionerrsquos home at around .am on Sunday morning, tying her feet and hands before demanding money and then ransacking her house.The lady eventually managed to free herself at around am and sought help from a neighbour who reported the incident to police.

Only four of the nine entries went to post with Newcastle ride Tom Newsam setting off in the lead on his own Miss Lennihan, followed by Colin McBratney on Belle Lady, owned and trained at Strangford by Joe Magee.Belle Lady came down and victory went to Midnight Auburn, owned and ridden by Downpatrickrsquos Gerry Lavery, whose son, Declan, is one of todayrsquos top local amateur riders. Miss Lennihan took second as Paddy Fitzsimons had to pull up on Heatherrsquos Braes.The winner was trained by Gerryrsquos brother, Brian, who works for Jeremy Maxwell at Ballee. For Gerry, this was his sole success in the saddle.The third race of the day was the Rearsquos Emporium Open which resulted in another nice local success for Nightmaster, owned and trained at Erenagh by John McCauley and ridden by his son Denis.David Wilsonrsquos Wremando, ridden by Laurence Millar, was second and third past the judge, David Shillington, from Dromara, was Blinky Bill in the colours of Comberrsquos Dessie Osborne, the former good amateur Paul Larkin being in the saddle.On the days leading up to this meeting, the dogs were barking, as they say, for a horse called Supplementary Sam. This horse took part in the fourth race, the Andi Grand Prix qualier and, with Rathfriland jockey Leo Gracey in the saddle, made all at the running to come home four s clear of Glen Keys, ridden by Paul Larkan, and Bentra Road, ridden by Tom Howley.

There are plans for sustainable transport projects including a park and ride scheme to bring visitors into the centre of the resort with the scheme similar to the one which operates during the resortrsquos international Festival of Flight.Cllr Clarke says the Gateway project encourages people to walk and cycle more and believes that the multi-million pound scheme can provide a signicant boost for the wider district economy.He said while people are rightly preoccupied with coronavirus at the moment, work is continuing to look at the future of tourism development across the region.He added: ldquoNewcastle can play its part and we all hope that the Gateway project will not only put the resort on the map, but wider South Down area. The scheme has the potential to create new hotel and retail development, creating jobs and boosting the economy.ldquoThe project is people-driven and providing facilities for them. It is also vital that was is created is used all-year-round, not just during the traditional tourism season. The focus is also in on making the most of the natural environment that we have in Newcastle and the surrounding area.A Newry, Mourne and Down Council spokesman said that the Belfast Region City Deal represents a major investment.He said in the Newry, Mourne and Down area, the investment proposals focus on the Mournes Gateway project and several schemes in the Newry area, including a city centre regeneration project, new theatre and conference facility and southern relief road.ldquoFunding is also being made available for digital infrastructure enhancements and enhanced skills and employability provision across the region, said the spokesman.He said the vision from the City Deal investment was to deliver inclusive growth, deliver up to , more jobs and increase the value of goods and services produced in the area by poundm annually..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Going.jpg","title":"Newcastle man’s extraordinary job post at the South Pole  ","story":"IMAGINE looking out of your kitchen window and seeing a humpback whale idly swimming by, or a small team of seals at play in the water.Therersquos snow and ice everywhere, animals outnumber humans, noise is completely muted but yet you have never felt more alive or connected to the world.Thatrsquos the extraordinary experience Newcastle man Kit Adams enjoyed when he took up a job offer which saw him as postmaster at the Port Lockroy research station on Goudier Island.Itrsquos located off the west side of the Antarctic Peninsula, more commonly known as the South Pole, and is one of the most remote places in the world.The  year-old mountaineer lived and worked with a small team of people over four months in what has become an important heritage site and a tourist destination for people who want to see the thriving penguin community.Employed by the UK Antarctic Heritage Trust, Kit handled the postcards sent by hundreds of holidaymakers on Antarctic cruises who visit the island and claim to have set foot on earthrsquos most southerly point.Back at his familyrsquos home in Newcastle, Kit has had time to reflect on what the experience meant to him.ldquoThe one thing that became clear to me is that itrsquos the type of environment that I want to spend more time in, said Kit, who coped with freezing temperatures of up to minus seven degrees fahrenheit.ldquoIt really affirmed what I thought I wanted to do, and thatrsquos spending more time in the polar regions. Itrsquos just so unique and dferent to Northern Ireland.ldquoWe have got the Mournes on our doorstep mdash thatrsquos what really got me into enjoying the outdoors. Growing up here, snow is always a novelty, which only comes every now and again. When it does, you try and make the most of it. Once I moved to university in Scotland, snow was much more regular thing and something I enjoyed.ldquoI definitely prefer the cold to the heat I canrsquot handle the heat at all to be honest. If you are somewhere cold, there is always something you can do about it mdash put on an extra layer mdash but in the heat I just struggle.A former pupil of Newcastle Primary School and Down High School in Downpatrick, Kit had been to the South Pole three times before he applied for the job at Port Lockroy. He made the application due to a recommendation from a friend who had already worked there.Kitrsquos academic background mdash he has a Geography degree from the University of Dundee and a Masters degree in Polar and Alpine Change from the University of Sheffield mdash made him a perfect fit for the job.ldquoGoing to Port Lockroy was such a unique opportunity that I jumped at the chance, he said.ldquoWhen we arrived last November, we couldnrsquot get onto the island as there was some sea ice. When we did get on, it was completely covered in snow. As the days went by, more rock was becoming exposed as the snow with the ice was melting. At the end of the season, there really wasnrsquot any snow left on the island.Despite being in what of the great expanses of ice and water on the planet, Kitrsquos world on the island suddenly became very small.ldquoThe island is really only the size of a football pitch and half of that is not accessible, he said.There is a Nissan hut where all the resident staff, and any visiting staff, live and work, a boat shed, which is a historic building, and Bransfield House, named after the Irish Antarctic sailor and explorer, Edward Bransfield. This houses the islandrsquos only shop, post office and museum.Kit explained: ldquoItrsquos quite a simplistic lestyle. There was no social media, no great phone connectivity, basic work emails, no running water or mains electricity, but it was nice to get away from wi-fi and it a quite peaceful le in many ways.ldquoYou are with the rest of the team [resident team of five], day in, day out,   on a tiny island and you need to be able to work and live in this small space with the same people every day. We had no means of getting off the island and had to do all our cooking, cleaning, etc. Therersquos quite a lot of work and maintenance to do and yoursquore always busy so you didnrsquot really have a lot of downtime. We got one day off in every .The high point for Kit was the stunning environment and being surrounded by all kinds of wildle.ldquoThere was loads of wildle, several penguin species such as the Gentoo, Chinstrap and Aediles, he said.ldquoYou can really see the penguins transition throughout the season. At the start they are gathering stones and building nests, by the end of the season, their new chicks are learning to swim. There are all sorts of flying birds like skuas, gulls, Southern Giant petrels, and cormorants.

They have completed their fixtures and cannot be overtaken.In the Newcastle League, the biggest losers are Ardglass, who will have nothing to show for their efforts, despite being  points clear at the top of the Premier Division.Celtic Bhoys Academy have already been declared the winners of Division  because they cannot be caught. Division , which was headed by Celtic Bhoys Academy before the lockdown, will remain unfinished, as will the Purdy Cup.The Bobby Dalzell Cup final, between Killough and Ballynahinch Olympic Town, and the Harry Clarke Cup final, featuring Celtic Bhoys and Ballynagross, will be played at the start of next season.Newcastle League secretary Alan Craig said the announcement would bring a ldquolevel of certainty and closure to the clubs.In a letter sent out to clubs he said: ldquoThe committee believed it was the correct procedure to ask the clubs for their input.ldquoWe understand these are challenging times and, in any case, our primary concern would always have been the welfare of the clubs, players, match officials, volunteers and any supporters during this unprecedented period.Mr Craig was unable to give the clubs a start date for the new season.ldquoThe committee have been in constant dialogue and agreed that setting a date for the new season to begin is just not possible under the current Government guidelines being issued.

Whatever measures the government have put in place ndash and they were very quick to take action and order a lockdown and introduce testing ndash they seem to have worked.Gareth said they were concerned like everyone  about the outbreak, but reckoned that they would put themselves at more risk taking a flight home.He said: ldquoOnce all this happened, we did have the conversation with our families about whether or not we should go home, but to be honest, regarding all the news headlines that we have been reading about home and the rest of the UK, we weighed everything up and it seemed that the situation was much worse in the UK and Ireland.ldquoAs we were able to still continue with our jobs, it seemed staying was the best and safest solution for us.The Australian government, along with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Prime Minister Boris Johnston, this week announced plans to phase down current lockdown restrictions over the coming weeks and months. Australia has recorded only  deaths for the whole country out of , confirmed coronavirus cases.The countryrsquos plan to ensure that all people coming into the country will be forcibly quarantined was something that he believed was essential to happen.ldquoOver here, they mean what they say, said Gareth. ldquoWe have been told that for new visitors into the country will be guarded to ensure that they comply with the quarantine.Gareth said that as he and Emmah, who works in traffic control, lived in Newtown, a few miles from the centre of Sydney, they were still able to go to the beach to enjoy during the lockdown.ldquoThere are so many beaches close to us here that we are spoilt for choice, he continued. ldquoThe beaches were reopened a few weeks ago so we could go for a swim, surf, walk or run. Thatrsquos all considered part of your exercise and itrsquos to be able to enjoy that.He said people were still not allowed to sunbathe but that being able to go out to the beach made up for the lack of other social access and activity.ldquoWe have a lot of friends here, particularly other people like ourselves who are all from the same area, and we are missing out being able to meet up with them in bars and restaurants, ldquo said Gareth.ldquoWe are very fortunate that we have been able to go out to the beach on an evening after work, so it doesnrsquot feel like we are so cooped up and we both really love the outdoors le..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.thedownrecorder.co.uk/media/uploads/13th May 2020 Tribute.jpg","title":"Tributes paid to Bears’ chairman who loved sport  ","story":"TOLLYMORE United FC chairman John McIlvenny passed away peacefully at his home last week after a long battle against a very debilitating illness.John was involved in the Tollymore club since its formation in  and was chairman for  of its  years. He occupied the role of secretary for the first season. Anyone that knew John would say he was first and foremost a football man.Having moved to Newcastle with his we, Josie, John soon became involved in the local football scene and went on to manage Newcastle FC.Many of us remember John playing in the old Summer League in the s for the Castlemac team and his team mates calling him Dixie after the great Everton striker Dixie Dean.A le-long Tottenham Hotspur supporter you would have thought John had a big enough cross to bear before he got involved in starting a new football club in his adopted town.A chance discussion in the summer of  led to John calling a meeting and from it Tollymore United was formed. Very soon the club appointed a manager, Clarence Robinson, and within a matter of weeks club had signed a host of players and started training.With Clarence and Sean Lavery looking after the playing side of things, John and his committee started planning off the field. The clubrsquos first presentations dinner was held in May , in the Central Park, with Northern Ireland legend Derek Dougan the guest of honour. Some of the clubs older members still talk about that night.Another first was the clubrsquos annual Christmas party for children, with John acting as Santa, and such was its popularity that committee members frequently had to rush down to the shops for more selection boxes.The club was now starting to establish itself more off the pitch than on it and the big name guests continued to arrive at the clubrsquos annual awards nights. Manchester United legend Tommy Docherty came in , Denis Law in , Liverpool legend Tommy Smith and Everton and Forest star Duncan Mackenzie in , and so it went on with John in his absolute element with Josie at his side.As the playing side of things began to improve there was nobody prouder than John when, in May , the club beat Ballycam Celtic in a play-off to win the Mourne Observer Cup and gain promotion to the Newcastle leaguersquos Premier Division.The merry-go-round of legends continued with Billy Bremner in  and the biggest name of all, Jack Charlton, arriving in  with John, proud as punch, appearing in the Belfast .In  the club had a fantastic season reaching the final of the Co Antrim Junior Shield only to lose - after conceding a golden goal. John, along with everyone , was gutted, but anyone who had been in Quinnrsquos that night would never have believed the Bears had lost.The following year the club lted the Rathmourne Cup with the second team winning the Purdy Cup and players and supporters lting the roof off the Donard Hotel in the company of Liverpoolrsquos Ian St John. What a night that was with John filling the Rathmourne Cup several times and rumours that Pete Law was required to repair the cup after a raucous night have never been confirmed or denied.Christmas  saw the Bears lting the Bobby Dalzell cup and another crazy awards night took place in the company of Emlyn Hughes.While football played a huge part in Johnrsquos le, he was very much a family man. Josie was a constant by his side at every club dinner and to everyone that knew them they were like a double act mdash terric company and great craic.John suffered a loss when his beloved Josie died, but his love of his grandchildren helped him through that dficult period. He was immensely proud of his daughter, Joanne, and loved nothing better than bringing his grandson, Callum, down to Friday night football.It was fitting that the club was able to hold its th anniversary dinner last year in the Slieve Donard Hotel where John previously worked as bar manager. John took his seat with son-in-law Mark alongside Liverpool legend Bruce Grobbelaar and it was like the good old days with John once more in his element welcoming guests and posing for pictures.It most have taken a huge effort on his part to attend but he would certainly not have missed it for anythingThe Tollymore United club, committee, players, coaches and supporters would like to offer their sincere condolences to Johnrsquos daughter Joanne, son-in-law Mark, grandchildren Callum, Clara, Alana and Harry, his sister Anne, nieces and nephews. John will be sorely missed. May he rest in peace..prettyPhoto"},{"url":"http://www.impartialreporter.com/news/resources/images/11342560.jpg","title":"changes exercise regulations prove challenging autism","story":"PLEASE NOTEIt is a tough time for our entire community and especially the business community.

For families directly affected by the virus, the past few months have involved combinations of illness, trauma, recovery and loss.Other people have spent most of the time at home, socially distancing and worrying about the future. Many have lost their jobs. Some have lost hope.The public health response to coronavirus has worked well. But while social distancing and self-isolation help reduce transmission of the virus, they also create unusual social and emotional situations with which most people are unfamiliar. \" fill\"#ea\" to our daily newsletterThe i newsletter cut through the noiseThanks for signing up!Sorry, there seem to be some issues. Please try again later.Submitting...Quarantine has similar effects, resulting in fear of infection, frustration, boredom and annoyance at lack of information. These are psychologically challenging circumstances for everyone.Negative emotions are amplied by spending large amounts of time at home, but can be managed by careful awareness of how we feel, accepting support from other people, and looking after our diet, sleep and exercise as best as possible. Even when our movements are restricted, there is much that we can do.This week, however, just as many people adjusted to the new psychological and emotional landscape, everything changed again. Or did it Certain restrictions are being eased. Some businesses can reopen. A degree of normality is starting to .This is good news. Public health measures are working, so we can go further outside, restart the economy and get people back to work. We must still observe the public health advice, but we can finally start rebuilding our lives.Coming out of quarantine is a psychological transition as much as a physical one, so new challenges lie ahead. Some people are likely to be anxious about easing restrictions, worried about their risk of catching coronavirus or infecting others. The best advice for these people is simple: trust the public health guidance. Despite ious dferences in approaches over past months, most countries have now landed on roughly similar guidelines. Public health officials know what they are talking about. They will monitor the situation over the coming weeks. Trust them.For people who contracted coronavirus and recovered, easing the restrictions can bring additional problems with stigma, finances and tensions in relationships, as well as anger towards governments for perceived inaction. Again, these feelings are understandable and need to be recognised.But while we cannot negotiate directly with emotions, we can observe them, try not to engage, and watch them subside. Taking advantage of our new freedoms – travelling a little further, ing to work – also helps to resolve these psychological issues.Many of the problems we now face are similar to those experienced by anyone who emerges from an institution, like a hospital, after a prolonged stay: lack of confidence, uncertainty about new freedoms, and worries about the long-term psychological impact of the entire episode.How can we navigate this anxiety  There is much that we can do.First, stay informed. Read the public health advice with care. Trust it. Follow it.Second, do not be afraid. Go outsideyou are advised that you can. Physical and mental health are very closely linked. Going outside helps with both. Be sure to take steps forward.Third, take it easy. If you have not been outside in some time, take short trips to build your confidence.

However, over the past few weeks clarityhas been provided by Ministers through a set of guidelines which it is suggested, should be address prior to any formal decision to reopen being made.As such council officers have proposed an initialoperating model to see the borough’s four main sitesreopen.The report states that services at these premises would be availableto the general public on weekdays from am to pm.A Saturday morning slot would,these recommendation are approved by Council, be available only for health care and associated workers.It is also suggested that initiallywaste is limited to black bag and potentially green waste and that only cars are to be permitted.The need to limit the reopening to the four main recycling initially, is, the report claims, “based on a mix of waste product capacity and maximising the use of key staff ”.The report concludes by stating that the implementation of this model is dependant on Council’s abilityto redeploy staff and on the speed at which waste operators could get their service operational, ensuring that the vehicles are road worthy.Given these considerations the report suggests it may take up to five working days from a decision being made to the actual reopening of the four sites.This issue is due to be debated at tonight’s virtual council meeting.The meeting is set to get underway at .pm and members of the public can watch the debate by clicking hereA message from the Editor:Thank you for reading this story on our website.

However in the following days, we work to open the other five sites shortly afterwards.”Addressing the issue SDLP group leader, Councillor Thomas O’Hanlon asked that this matter be dealt with under scheme of delegation in order to ensure that recycling centres can be opened promptly.He also asked that Council’s bulky waste collection service be “restarted in tandem” with the reopening of recycling centres and queriedhow recycling centres could cater for those who are shielding.His comments were address by Council’s ChiefExecutive, Roger Wilson, who said party group leaders had made their “desire to get centres open as quickly as possible” clear.He also said it would be a “matter of practicality”the decision were to remain under delegationas this would “remove the element of having to go through a call in period”.Council’s Strategic Director, Mark Parkinson, said he would agree with Councillor O’Hanlon “on the point about bulky waste collection restarting at the same time” as recycling centres reopen.Ulster Unionist Party councillor, Julie Flaherty, commendedthe “fantastic job” waste men and women are doing across the borough and said her party would support steps to reopen these centres quickly and safely.The Alliance Party’s Cllr Eoin Tennyson asked about PPE for staff and was informed by Mr Parkinson that the council has a sufficient supply of PPE.The Director also informed Cllr Tennyson that Council is meeting with unions “every morning” to make sure “the equipment is reaching the right people” and the supply of this equipment is “reviewed on a regular basis”.Councillor Darryn Causby welcomed the fact Council can now “get these centres open” and asked what type of material would be accepted at that start.He was informed by Mr Parkinson that in line with the initialproposal the sites will accept “black bags and general waste until processors are back up and running” and that “over a period of time, we will expand the waste cycle”.Independent Councillor Paul Berry called for a “common sense approach” to allowing certain trailers access to recycling centres.“Some areas across this borough, do not have a brown bin for their garden waste and I think their needs to be a common sense approach towards letting some trailers with garden waste have access to these sites,” said Cllr Berry.Lord Mayor, Councillor Mealla Campbell, agreed with this point. However, the Council’s Strategic Director explained that restricting sites to cars and black bags only is an attempt to deal with an expected initialpeak in demand.“We will get a vast number of people looking to bring black bags and access the centres,” said Mr Parkinson. “We are limiting it to cars initiallyto manage capacity. Once we are over that peak, and we expect that to be within a few days, we can look at allowing access to trailers and white vans.“In regards to smaller sites, the other thing to consider is their size,we get the demand we expect, we will be forced to close them again very very quickly as they will be at capacity.”DUP group leader, Councillor Mark Baxter said he was concernedthatsmaller sites were not opened quickly, residents in those areas could feel “short changed”.His party colleague Alderman Gareth Wilson, said this issue was one the general public are “engaged with” and are aware that it is a service that can be offeredwith “social distancing kept in place”.He also said Council needs to be very careful about getting the message across about what type of material can be accepted at these centres.This view was agreed with by DUP Alderman Paul Rankin who said thatany announcementwas to be made, Council would need to “give a timeframe or specydetails on when the other five sites are going to open”.SDLP Councillor Thomas Larkham enquired about the openingtimes for the four main centres and was told they would open from Monday – Friday am to pm, initially, in line with the report presented to members.It was also made clear, following a query from SDLP Councillor Eamon McNeil, that a special time slot for NHS and other care staff would be in operation on Saturday mornings from am to  noon.DUP Councillor Margaret Tinsley then asked that Saturday opening hours be extended to allow all those back at work to access to the sites.An announcementon the issue is expected from Council tonight , following a party group leaders’ meeting where the issues raised during the debate will be discussed.Adam Morton , Local Democracy Reporting Service\"\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"Most Popular.\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" data-s-el\"\" title\"\" class\"sc-eKZiaR jSxAXl\"\" alt\"\" layout\"fill\"\" data-index\"\" data-s-event\"gaEvent\" data-s-ec\"navigation\" data-s-ea\"most popular\" title\"\" data-s-el\"\" class\"sc-jtRlXQ cUfQBC\"This website and its associated newspaper are members of Independent Press Standards Organisation Follow us onExploreNewsSportWhats OnLestyleMore from Portadown TimesAnnouncementsJobsPublic NoticesMust ReadBuy a PhotoDirectoryLocal GuideReader ShopUseful LinksContact UsAdvertise My BusinessAdvertise a JobPlace your AdSubscribeEventsArchiveReaders Charter\" fill\"#ea\"©JPIMedia Publishing Ltd. .\" target\"_self\" href\"#\" id\"cookieSettings\" class\"sc-dqBHgY sc-gxMtzJ bAegnq\"Cookie SettingsTerms and ConditionsPrivacy policyNews you can trust since News\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"NewsTraffic and TravelCrimeWeatherPoliticsBusinessEducationHealthPeopleRead ThisCoronavirusSport\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"SportFootballOther SportWhats On\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"Whats OnArts and EntertainmentThings To DoLestyle\" class\"expand\" role\"button\" tabindex\"\"\"\"\" scale translate \" points\"  .  . \"LestyleCarsHomes and GardensMust ReadAdvertise My BusinessFollow us    "}]
