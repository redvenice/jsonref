After a fight broke out they started used guns.\u0027              The vote also ushers in a powerful new executive presidency long sought by Erdogan and backed by a small majority of Turks in a 2017 referendum.

He also urged YSK members to \u0027do your job the right way\u0027, adding he believed the results would be \u0027very good\u0027.Opposition parties and NGOs deployed up to half a million monitors at ballot boxes to ward against fraud. They have said election law changes and fraud allegations in the 2017 referendum raise fears about the vote\u0027s fairness.Earlier, CHP spokesman Bulent Tezcan said the party had reported to the YSK allegations of block votes being cast and of election monitors being beaten and kept out of polling stations in the southeast\u0027s Sanliurfa province.YSK chairman Sadi Guven told the state-owned news agency Anadolu it was taking steps in response to reports of irregularities in the town of Suruc near the Syrian border.The government gave no immediate response to the reports, but Erdogan said there had not been any serious problems.           Earlier today opposition party member Mehmet Sıddık Durmaz (pictured) was reportedly shot dead \u0027during the voting process\u0027, local media said          A woman waits to vote at a polling station in snap twin Turkish presidential and parliamentary elections in Istanbul today          Turks went to the polls this morning in presidential and parliamentary elections that pose the biggest ballot box challenge to Erdogan and his Islamist-rooted AK Party since they swept to power over 15 years ago          Chairman of the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) Kemal Kilicdaroglu and his wife Selvi Kilicdaroglu arrive to cast their ballot at a polling station during the parliamentary and presidential elections, in AnkaraTurkey has been under emergency rule - which restricts some freedoms and allows the government to bypass parliament with decrees - for nearly two years since an attempted coup in 2016.Erdogan blamed the coup on his former ally, U.S.-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, and has waged a sweeping crackdown on his followers in Turkey, detaining some 160,000 people, according to the United Nations.The president\u0027s critics, including the European Union which Turkey still nominally aspires to join, say Erdogan has used the crackdown to stifle dissent. \u0027This is no longer a Turkey we want. Rights are violated, democracy is in terrible shape,\u0027 said health sector worker Sema, 50, after voting in Istanbul.She and others in the city said they voted for the pro-Kurdish Peoples\u0027 Democratic Party (HDP), hoping it would exceed the ten per cent threshold of votes needed to enter parliament.

Erdogan has filed close to 2,000 lawsuits against people, including school children, for insulting him.       Hundreds of thousand of supporters of Muharrem Ince, the main presidential candidate facing Erdogan, gather in Istanbul yesterday          Recep Tayyip Erdogan held his own rally for the AK Party in the Esenyurt district of Istanbul yesterday          Erdogan at a rally of his own supporters this week in the city of Kahramanmaras on Thursday.

If you want, I can even cancel my Istanbul rally for you. Come, confront me, let\u0027s debate on TV.\u0027The event was the second giant rally the opposition leader addressed within the space of two days.Erdogan, a favourite to win the presidential polls, has in the past rejected the opposition candidate\u0027s proposal for a television debate, saying that \u0027I don\u0027t want anyone to get points through me\u0027.Ince has injected a breath of fresh air into the presidential campaign with his dynamism and oratorical skills comparable to those of Erdogan. In Ankara, Ince accused the state-run Anadolu news agency and TRT television of committing a \u0027constitutional crime\u0027 for failing to be even-handed.\u0027TRT aired Erdogan for 181 hours, Muharrem Ince for 15 hours,\u0027 he said.Turkey News, Pictures and Videos plus Erdogan Updates | Daily Mail Online¿Y¿ Party district head shot dead during voting in Turkish election"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/07/22/4D07378000000578-0-image-m-4_1528408339020.jpg","title":"More 3 000 areas England Wales NO burglaries solved year","story":"    More than 3,000 areas in England and Wales had no burglaries solved last year, as citizens say criminals are enjoying \u0027easy pickings\u0027 because of the lack of police presence          The shocking figures were analysed by the Sunday Times after looking at crime figures for 34,250 neighbourhoods in England and Wales.Salisbury, Canterbury, Cambridge, Oxford and St Albans all have high rates of where burglaries go unsolved.In Bristol, there were more than 50 neighbourhoods with more than 20 break-ins that had unsolved burglaries.  Rob Knight, who lives in Henleaze, Bristol, told the paper that his home had been burgled three times in five years, with no arrests made on any of the incidents.The 49-year-old had his truck stolen when thugs broke into his home and snatched his keys, using the vehicle in two ram-raids.Mr Knight blamed the continued crime on the lack of police presence, saying: \u0027We don\u0027t have community police officers on the streets any more and they closed down the local police station.

At its peak, his ‘business’ was bringing in £110,000 a month.Europol, an EU police agency, warned yesterday that people smugglers operating in Turkey and Greece were ‘frequent’ offenders in the trade in black market documents, which is an ‘important enabler’ of organised crime.          Abu Ahmad, who is known as ‘The Doctor’, helps smuggle people across the world by selling them stolen passportsAhmad said all the passports he sold were genuine – otherwise they would be no use at border control.They are either stolen or sold by their owners, who agree not to report them as missing for a few months, by which time they have been used by Ahmad’s customers.He said: ‘Most British passports are stolen. Except if the passport was in the name of someone Arabic or Pakistani or something, that could have been sold.’Ahmad said he had no qualms about profiting from stolen passports and, despite boasting he has smuggled thousands of people into Britain, insisted he was certain none of them were jihadis or criminals.But another Syrian immigrant in Turkey told the Mail at least two people Ahmad helped get into Europe were known Islamists operating in Damascus.The German authorities were alerted about them after their arrival, he said.Interpol, an international police agency, has a stolen and lost travel documents database, known as SLTD, which it says was searched more than 1.2billion times in the first nine months of 2016, providing 115,000 ‘hits’.But on its website, it admits: ‘Interpol is not automatically notified of all passport thefts occurring worldwide, and the SLTD database is not connected to national lists of stolen or lost passports.‘Despite the potential availability of the SLTD database, not all countries systematically search the database to determine whether an inidual is using a fraudulent passport.’In 2014, the head of the agency said just four in ten passports used for international flights were checked against the database.Labour MP John Woodcock, a member of the Commons home affairs committee, said: ‘At a time when several hundred potentially highly dangerous jihadis have fled when Islamic State has been deposed it’s highly alarming to learn that this way of entering the UK illegally seems to be so readily available.’Ed Davey, the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman, said: ‘Criminals who capitalise on the vulnerability of tourists and then profit off refugees and immigrants in desperate need of help must not be allowed to operate so freely.’          One of the stolen passports used to help get people through passport control and across borders.

More carefully. I stay out of the picture.‘I don’t know if the police know. I have no idea honestly. But for sure they’re watching me.

If the NHS can get an extra £20billion a year, then defence surely deserves one tenth of that just to stand still.’But other Tory MPs believe Mr Williamson is stoking the row about defence spending to boost his standing in a future Tory leadership race.In a thinly-veiled swipe, which was also directed in part at Boris Johnson, former minister Nick Boles said: ‘Would it be too much to ask that senior members of the Cabinet behave like grown-ups, discuss serious issues in a serious way, and avoid running to the papers with childish threats?’Another MP said Mr Williamson was at risk of over-playing his hand. ‘There are many who are huge defenders of the military and have been working hard to make the case to protect the deployable capability that keeps us a tier one nation,’ the MP said. ‘But there’s no way we’d break cover now to back this weaselly attack on the PM. Williamson’s intemperate and frankly bizarre media posturing shows just how unsuited he is for any high office whatsoever.’ "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/11/4D73C8E000000578-0-image-m-20_1529836588553.jpg","title":"Andrea Leadsom says customs partnership EU unwieldy impractical","story":"    Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, last night became the latest Eurosceptic minister to publically attack Theresa May’s customs deal proposalPlans for Britain to form a customs partnership with the EU after Brexit are ‘unwieldy and impractical’ and would lead to more bureaucratic red tape, a Cabinet minister has warned.Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the House of Commons, last night became the latest Eurosceptic minister to publically attack Theresa May’s proposal for Britain to enter a customs deal with the EU.Speaking to the Daily Telegraph, prominent Brexiteer Mrs Leadsom said: ‘I think the Custom Partnership looks quite bureaucratic and unwieldy, it has implications for needing to keep alignment with a lot of EU product regulations and so on.‘That does seem to lend itself to a more technology-driven solution than one where you’re seeking to pick up tariffs on third parties which can get complicated.’She continued: ‘The problem with complications, particularly for businesses, they are not keen on more bureaucracy, more red tape. \u0027That is potentially a less attractive option for businesses themselves.’MPs could face \u0027Commons Asbos\u0027 forcing them to stay away...Business minister Claire Perry lashes out at Speaker John...Share this articleThe ‘customs partnership’ with the EU is one of two options being considered by the Theresa May for customs arrangement with the EU after Brexit.It would see the UK would collect tariffs set by the EU Customs Union on goods entering Britain on behalf of the bloc. The other idea is maximum facilitation, which would use technology to minimise customs checks.However, the idea of a post-Brexit customs partnership has been criticised by Brexiteers, with Boris Johnson dismissing the idea as ‘crazy’ and Michael Gove warning of ‘significant question marks’ over the ‘flawed’ plan.Mrs Leadsom added: ‘It’s all very civilised but Michael and Liam are effectively ripping it to shreds. David is taking a more neutral, diplomatic role while Liam and Michael are taking the customs partnership to the abattoir.’"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/08/2B86864F00000578-0-image-m-5_1529826539092.jpg","title":"Ban pupils mobile phones says Brighton College headmaster Richard Cairns","story":"    Mr Cairns says his pupils found it \u0027liberating\u0027 to switch off their phonesLook around the school where I work, and at lunchtimes these days you will see groups of pupils huddled together in intense concentration.You might imagine they’re poring over the tiny screens of their mobile phones, giggling at some YouTube video or app. But no, they are actually battling over a game of Cluedo or Monopoly, seeking the bragging rights of having outwitted their classmates.In our sometimes bewildering age of technological sophistication, such traditional games might seem but a quaint throwback for a generation who’ve grown up with computers, tablets and mobile phones.Yet one of my more gratifying experiences has been to witness their miraculous revival among the pupils of Brighton College, a mixed independent school where I am the Head Master.To the surprise of many of them, they’ve become completely absorbed in the intrigue and strategy of games such as Cluedo, Monopoly and Risk, which are teaching them to celebrate their triumphs and accept their setbacks.So why are they playing them at all? Because, back in September, I decided to bring in severe restrictions on the use of mobile phones at school. And the results have been little short of revelatory.With screen and apps no longer so dominant on the premises, the attention of the pupils has turned elsewhere — and some of it has focused on those board games.Of course, we knew there would be a void to fill in the absence of mobiles, so we invested in a formidable stock of age-old games such as Scrabble, which not only engage the brain far more aggressively than addictive computer video games such as Candy Crush, but, just as importantly, promote social interaction. What the experiment has taught me and the pupils is just how much of a hold smartphones have over society — and just how liberating it can be to switch them off.What’s remarkable is how the benefits of the mobile phone ban can be seen in so many ways within the school.There is more interest in sport and drama, less in social media and selfies. It is infinitely preferable to see a 12-year-old with a cricket bat in his hand than a mobile phone.Pupils are also finding they enjoy actual conversations in the real world, instead of being hooked on superficial exchanges in the virtual one.Take away the phones and you take away the negative reason for pupils not to talk to each other. Just as pleasingly, we have seen an increase in reading. The school librarian has told me that the number of books being taken out by pupils has risen sharply since the ban was introduced.I don’t want to sound authoritarian or anti-technology. The mobile phone is one of the great innovations in mankind’s physical progress, transforming communications, commerce and entertainment.But, like all inventions, its use has to be handled responsibly. And in schools, there can be a significant downside to unrestricted access to mobiles.Fears state students could be \u0027shut out of top universities\u0027...JAN MOIR: Why we must ban phones in school now...whatever...Mobile phone entrepreneur John Caudwell in Lyme disease...Share this articleHaving one to hand makes it harder to concentrate, and harder to sleep well, too. Mental health can be undermined by the relentless pressure of social media, reflected in the neurotic obsession with not missing any tweet or text, no matter how trivial.One American study found that 50 per cent of children say they are addicted to their phones, while 80 per cent admit they check their devices at least every hour.Then there’s the darker side: the mobile phone can be an instrument for both bullying and classroom disruption.Although poor behaviour is not a problem at Brighton, I have been told by teachers elsewhere about the difficulties of maintaining order in classrooms where phones are allowed, especially when pupils actually film lessons or take photos of the teacher.           Brighton College, where head teacher Richard Cairns says the phone ban has been a massive successThe tolerance of such conduct is a recipe for a disastrous breakdown in respect for staff.Gratifyingly, several leading figures in politics and education are now aware of the harm that can be caused to youngsters by mobile phones.Last week, Matt Hancock, the Culture Secretary, urged schools to ban them on the grounds that they fuel bullying and distract from learning.‘I believe young children don’t need access to social media. They are children, after all. They need to be able to develop their social skills in the real world first,’ Hancock rightly said in a speech to the NSPCC.His call was echoed by Amanda Spielman, the Head of Ofsted, who argued that ‘technology has made the challenge of low-level disruption even worse’, and she supported a mobile ban in schools.If Brighton’s experience is anything to go by, such an approach will be a success.There is nothing cruel or unjust about such toughness. On the contrary, it is more compassionate because it gives pupils the space to learn and grow.Under our policy, day pupils in years seven, eight and nine — that is approximately from ages 11 to 14 — are required to hand in their mobiles to teachers at the beginning of the day. They then collect their phones when they go home, between 4pm or 5pm.Boarders, who make up about 40 per cent of the school roll, are required to follow the same restrictions in these years. In addition, they must hand back their phones at bedtime.Older pupils have fewer restrictions, but those in Year 10 still have to subscribe to three days of ‘detox’ without phones, while those in the year above have one ‘detox’ day.When I first brought in the policy, I was told it would not work. I was warned the pupils would ‘kick off’ because they are so hooked on their mobiles.But nothing of the sort happened. In fact, our pupils welcomed the change because it relieved them of the burden of being online the whole time.They found they had more freedom, more time for contemplation. ‘We don’t miss our phones at all,’ a group of Year 9 pupils told me.The process of learning has been enhanced, which is what other research has discovered. A 2015 study by the London School of Economics found banning phones raised pupils’ test scores by 6.4 per cent.And it’s not just better for their work. Boarders have also experienced better sleep without the online frenzy before they go to bed, a vital factor when young people’s brains are still developing.Crucially, it’s also easier for teachers to spot bullying of pupils, or pupils who are feeling isolated: so much online intimidation and taunting — so bad for teenagers’ mental health — is hidden by cyberspace. All in all, the experiment has been so successful that next year the school is to extend the five-day mobile ban to Year 10 pupils.I believe that one compelling reason why the pupils may have accepted the ban so readily is because today’s pupils are generally conservative with a small ‘c’ — fully focused on making a success of their time at school and happy to be relieved of any obstructions to achieving that success.Every generation rebels against its predecessor, and this one’s rebellion is to be more serious, dedicated and responsible. That is why they work harder, drink far less, take fewer drugs, have greater social awareness and are more orientated towards their careers.That’s why they have accepted the phone ban with good grace, and I only hope other schools across the country have the same idea.The fact is, the pupils will realise how good it is for them only once their smartphones have been put away. "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/08/4D9B1EB500000578-5881919-image-m-15_1529913539536.jpg","title":"BBC presenter accidentally brands Health Secretary Jeremy C","story":"    The blunder came as Justin Webb read out a newspaper story about Jeremy Hunt (pictured on the BBC\u0027s Andrew Marr show yesterday)          Webb claimed he had \u0027swerved\u0027 the verbal slip, but listeners were in no doubt about what they had heardCannabis on the NHS for children \u0027by 2019\u0027: Astonishing...Share this articleWebb tried to head off the inevitable mockery by claiming he had \u0027swerved\u0027 away from pronouncing the full four-letter word.However, listeners were convinced they had heard it.He was reading out a story from the Daily Express during the programme\u0027s review of newspapers and news websites. It is not the first time a Today presenter has been embarrassed by the Health Secretary\u0027s name. James Naughtie made the error while Mr Hunt was culture secretary.           Webb (pictured) tried to head off the inevitable mockery by claiming he had \u0027swerved\u0027 away from pronouncing the full four-letter word"},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/24/18/4D96EF9E00000578-0-image-m-10_1529859651638.jpg","title":"Female reporter lectures football fan tries kiss her","story":"    Julia Guimarães was filming to camera when a football fan approached and tried to kiss her\u0027Don\u0027t do this.

Libya\u0027s coastguard has rescued nearly 1,000 migrants who were on boats in distress in the Mediterranean on their way to Europe, the navy said on Monday. Pictured: Migrants arrive at Tripoli navy base after being rescued            Three separate operations took place on Sunday with the coastguard bringing ashore in Libya a total of 948 migrants, navy spokesman Ayoub Kacem said            The migrants were on inflatable dinghies which were facing difficulties in the Mediterranean off the coast of Garabulli east of the capital Tripoli, navy officer Rami Ghommeidh saidA first group of 97 migrants were rescued, while a second operation brought 361 migrants - including 88 women and 44 children - ashore and late in the evening a final group of 490 migrants were rescued, said Kacem.In all a total of 2,000 migrants trying to make the perilous journey to Europe, often on unseaworthy boats, were either intercepted or assisted by the Libyan navy since Wednesday.Monday\u0027s announcement by the navy came as Italy\u0027s far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was en route to Libya for talks on the migrant crisis. Libya is a key departure point for thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the crossing.                                                    On Sunday, 16 of the EU\u0027s 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels to find a way forward despite a longstanding deadlock over who should take in migrants and refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.Salvini, interior minister responsible for border control, wants his EU partners to revise the rules governing asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean so that the bloc shares out the burden of handling them.Under current EU rules, responsibility for handling boatloads of asylum seekers rests with the country where they first disembark. Italy, which lies close to North Africa, has taken in some 650,000 boat migrants since 2014.Salvini\u0027s decision to close port access to foreign-registered rescue vessels has caused a standoff with Malta, which also has refused to allow them to dock.Rescue vessel Lifeline is carrying more than 230 migrants and is stuck in international waters in the Mediterranean.A private cargo ship, the Alexander Maersk, also has been waiting to be assigned a port since it picked up 113 migrants off southern Italy on Friday, the ship owner said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/10/4D9C781A00000578-5882197-image-m-7_1529919363179.jpg","title":"Scot shocked American friend flies 4 000miles tell youre it","story":"    In the clip, filmed at a christening in Loch Lomond, Drew McEwan is told to ask a gardener in the background to move out of shot  As he approaches the woman, she springs up and tags him, revealing herself to be his friend Georgina Wilkinson.

Employees of Zaman gather after it was seized in a crackdown against Gulen supportersAfter Erdogan became the President in 2014, he survived an attempted coup by factions within the military and went on to win the referendum on increased presidential powers.At the time, Erdogan said that the plot was engineered by the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gulen, who headed up a network of schools educating people about the Hizmet movement, which promotes altruism and modesty.Since then, Turkish courts have jailed dozens of officers for alleged coup plots after the failed attempt, which claimed at least 240 lives.According to officials, Erdogan’s life was also put in danger while staying in Marmaris, but he was back in less than 12 hours with a TV appearance during which he declared himself a ‘chief commander’.Although the Turkish President has resolved economic problems, he has also been considered to be an autocratic leader who is against anyone who opposes him.Despite denying that he wants to impose Islamic values and revealing that he is committed to secularism, his supporters still refer to him as ‘Sultan’, a reference to the Ottoman Empire.Turkey lifted the ban on women wearing headscarves in the country’s state institutions in 2013 but bids to criminalise adultery and introduce alcohol-free zones failed.          Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan wave national flags as they wait for his arrivalErdogan has also stated that ‘no Muslim family’ should consider birth control or family planning because of his aim to ‘multiply our descendants’.The AKP has also managed to keep inflation under control after the 1990s when it soared above 100 percent, but in 2014, the economy started to change and unemployment rose above 10 percent.Erdogan wifeRecep Tayyip Erdogan married Emine Gulbaran in July 4, 1978 and the couple have two sons, Ahmet Burak and Necmettin Bilal and two daughters, Esra and Sumeyye.2018 Turkish electionsErdogan declared victory in the Turkish presidential election in June 2018 amid speculation of ‘manipulated’ results and the President received the executive powers he has sought in order to tighten his grip on the nation.The AKP will now rule over Turkey until 2023 after its victory in parliamentary and presidential polls, taking 42.5 percent while Erdogan garnered 52.5 percent of the vote. The opposition’s candidate Muharrem Ince, took nearly 31 percent.President Erdogan will now form a government as well as appoint ministers, vice presidents and top bureaucrats. He will also be able to issue decrees, prepare budgets and impose states of emergency.The role of prime minister has now been scrapped and is thought to further dilute democracy in Turkey under Erdogan’s one-man rule.Erdogan net worthRecep Tayyip Erdogan’s net worth has accumulated to approximately $58 million (£44m) and is the richest Turkish politician according to Top Richest. Erdogan was also listed as the 48th most powerful person on the 2018 Forbes list.However, this figure seems a little high for someone who just earns $58,000 (£44,000) a year, as reported by German newspaper Bild. The article then went on to cite data published by Turkish opposition newspaper Cumhuriyet which stated that all members of the Erdogan family appear to be in business.Bild also revealed that Erdgogan\u0027s son Ahmet’s net worth amounted to around $80 million (£60m) and made claims that he may be supported by the Turkish government.Erdogan’s other son Bilal, who frequently garners media attention for alleged criminal activity, now lives in Italy after being embroiled in a political corruption scandal.The Turkish President also has one of the most lavish official residences in the world, the Ak Saray, otherwise known as the White Palace, which has a whopping 1,100 rooms, 250 of which are for the sole use of the Erdogan family.Thought to be 30 times the size of the White House and believed to be the largest palace built anywhere in the world for more than 100 years, a reported £7 million was spent on carpets and another £5 million on 400 10ft high double doors.The silk wallpaper is thought to have cost £2,000 a roll and one drinking glass in the household is worth £250. Due to the numerous spas, swimming pools, bathrooms and steam rooms, the heating bill is thought to run up to £500,000 every winter. The entire home is thought to have cost £500 million to construct.Who is Nipsey Hussle?

Libya\u0027s coastguard has rescued nearly 1,000 migrants who were on boats in distress in the Mediterranean on their way to Europe, the navy said on Monday. Pictured: Migrants arrive at Tripoli navy base after being rescued            Three separate operations took place on Sunday with the coastguard bringing ashore in Libya a total of 948 migrants, navy spokesman Ayoub Kacem said            The migrants were on inflatable dinghies which were facing difficulties in the Mediterranean off the coast of Garabulli east of the capital Tripoli, navy officer Rami Ghommeidh saidA first group of 97 migrants were rescued, while a second operation brought 361 migrants - including 88 women and 44 children - ashore and late in the evening a final group of 490 migrants were rescued, said Kacem.In all a total of 2,000 migrants trying to make the perilous journey to Europe, often on unseaworthy boats, were either intercepted or assisted by the Libyan navy since Wednesday.Monday\u0027s announcement by the navy came as Italy\u0027s far-right Interior Minister Matteo Salvini was en route to Libya for talks on the migrant crisis. Libya is a key departure point for thousands of migrants hoping to reach Europe, although hundreds drown each year attempting the crossing.                                                    On Sunday, 16 of the EU\u0027s 28 leaders held emergency talks in Brussels to find a way forward despite a longstanding deadlock over who should take in migrants and refugees who land in Italy and other European countries.Salvini, interior minister responsible for border control, wants his EU partners to revise the rules governing asylum seekers crossing the Mediterranean so that the bloc shares out the burden of handling them.Under current EU rules, responsibility for handling boatloads of asylum seekers rests with the country where they first disembark. Italy, which lies close to North Africa, has taken in some 650,000 boat migrants since 2014.Salvini\u0027s decision to close port access to foreign-registered rescue vessels has caused a standoff with Malta, which also has refused to allow them to dock.Rescue vessel Lifeline is carrying more than 230 migrants and is stuck in international waters in the Mediterranean.A private cargo ship, the Alexander Maersk, also has been waiting to be assigned a port since it picked up 113 migrants off southern Italy on Friday, the ship owner said.  "},{"url":"http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/newpix/2018/06/25/10/4D9C781A00000578-5882197-image-m-7_1529919363179.jpg","title":"Scot shocked American friend flies 4 000miles tell youre it","story":"    In the clip, filmed at a christening in Loch Lomond, Drew McEwan is told to ask a gardener in the background to move out of shot  As he approaches the woman, she springs up and tags him, revealing herself to be his friend Georgina Wilkinson.

This option is seen as a good alternative to closures – but how do the volunteers feel?It is just before 7pm on a Tuesday and Wilsden library is about to close. There are a few stragglers, mainly mums with small girls who have been at the dance class in the village hall, where the library occupies one corner.Wilsden is just one of 15 community-managed libraries in the borough of Bradford, West Yorkshire. It opens for one day a week and is staffed completely by volunteers such as Simon Dickerson, whohas volunteered at the library since it became community-managed in 2011. Prior to that, the library was run and staffed by Bradford council, but budget cuts meant that Wilsden’s library, along with branches in nearby Denholme and Wrose, were earmarked to close.“It was inconceivable that our library should close,” says Dickerson. “There was a village meeting called. About 100 people turned up and there was a very strong feeling that the library should continue.”Those three villages became the first of Bradford’s community-managed libraries. Now Wilsden has a pool of 40 or so volunteers who can work a couple of hours on a Tuesday.Like many other parts of the country, Wilsden was handed over to volunteers after Bradford council announced swingeing cuts in 2016. Out of the 29 libraries across the district (population: 528,000), 10 remained council-run, two became “hybrid” operations (a mix of volunteers and council staff), and 17 were given an ultimatum: become volunteer-run or close.So far, only one has closed (and that was due to a third-party lease on the property not being renewed). The rest were saved, due to the strength of community interest in keeping them open. But does that mean volunteer-run libraries are a success, or just delaying inevitable closures?“Local councils have seized on the volunteer idea as an easy answer to budget cuts,” Laura Swafford, chair of the Library Campaign, wrote in the  last year. “The commitment of volunteers is wholly admirable, but the result is that as a country, we have been left without a coherent library service and we have seen no real attempt to find out how well community-run libraries work.”Even before it was passed into community hands, Wilsden was only open on Tuesdays. The day coincides with the aforementioned dance classes, as well as a luncheon club for the elderly. It plays host to three or four children’s events a year, and it houses a book group. As a volunteer, does Dickerson feel it is working? “We get young people in to use the laptops, but not as much to borrow books. And perhaps if everyone who turned up to the meeting to save the library actually used it, I might be a bit happier,” he says.Bradford, where Wilsden is located, is a district of ersity and extremes. It contains some of the most poverty-stricken wards in the UK, as well as some of the richest. Ilkley is a point on Yorkshire’s so-called Golden Triangle, which has some of the highest property values in the country. And just outside Ilkley is Burley-in-Wharfedale, where the local library was handed to volunteers in April 2017.There, community ownership has not just allowed the library to survive, it has revived it, according to volunteer and former parish councillor Niccola Swan. “The library wasn’t exactly dead before, but it was a lot quieter,” she says. “When the announcement came through about library funding, it was a no-brainer for Burley. The parish council immediately said that we were not going to lose our library.”Like other community-run libraries, Burley lost all of its paid staff, who were replaced with a team of around 50 volunteers. But that wasn’t necessarily a bad thing, Swan says. “The library staff we had weren’t local, they came in to do a job. While it was often a perfectly fine job, they didn’t have the incentive to be as engaged with the community.”Usage of the library has grown steadily month on month, Swan says, both in terms of visitors and books borrowed. “I’m really thrilled with what we’ve achieved,” she says.While Bradford’s libraries get their stock from the national library network, funding for maintenance and infrastructure is entirely dependent on the circumstances of each library. While Wilsden sells secondhand books and greetings cards, and receives support from the village hall association, Burley has just secured £150,000 of funding from the parish council for refurbishments, including a new roof.One crucial point with Holme Wood – and, to varying degrees the other libraries – is that they are not just about the books any more: they serve more frequently as wide-ranging “community hubs”. At Burley library, older people often drop in just to see a friendly face, while Wilsden is a lifeline for members of the luncheon club, some of whom may only leave the house once a week.Holme Wood offers resources to improve literacy and learning, through link-ups with local schools that see pupils visit the library for literacy programmes and holiday events. The local job club is based there, and there are courses to teach adults how to use the internet and access council services.“The library’s core business has changed from being only a lending service, and I think this reflects the changing face of libraries everywhere. There are new challenges that have to be faced,” says Daniel Carroll, who is All Star’s Holme Wood community liaison. “People are working together to make the library work. And that means it has to work for them, and to serve the community.”“The volunteers are part of the community, they know the place and the people,” says Swan at Burley. “We do what we always did, but now we can bend the rules. If someone wants to just come in and have a sit down and a cup of tea, then that’s absolutely fine. We’ll get the kettle on, because we can.”Libraries have, for years, provided services other than book borrowing: computer access, DVD loans, event hosting. But the rise of the volunteer-run library is evolution in its purest sense: motivated by a desire to survive. While most would agree that their local library could benefit from more funding from authorities, the reality right now seems to be that libraries are going to require the input of local communities if they are to continue to exist at all. As Dickerson says: “We’re in the middle of some very profound social changes, and those changes are still happening and will continue to happen for some time. Libraries have got to reflect that.”It is worth noting that a declining library service isn’t seen as inevitable everywhere. Ireland’s Libraries Development Committee has just unveiled a scheme to double attendance over the next five years, involving abolishing fines, extending opening hours in almost two thirds of the country’s 330 libraries to 10pm and, crucially, hiring 100 more librarians in the coming months. While the drive and enthusiasm of the UK’s volunteers should be applauded and encouraged, hopefully their willingness to step in won’t consign government investment to the history books."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/dd8be5fe9207594de7ed6f9d3d017c36550cea5d/0_358_4141_2485/master/4141.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=9c6523106723c56756671bb6b5ab4aa1","title":"hermes couriers are workers not self employed tribunal rules","story":"Group of 65 couriers entitled to employment rights, minimum wage and holiday payA group of Hermes couriers have won their fight to be treated as workers instead of independent contractors in what has been described as one of the most significant victories against exploitation of gig-economy workers.An employment tribunal in Leeds ruled that the couriers were entitled to receive the minimum wage and holiday pay, and to reclaim unlawful deductions from their wages, because they had incorrectly been classified as self-employed. The GMB, which helped bring the claim, said the ruling was likely to affect 14,500 Hermes couriers who are engaged under the same contract as the 65 couriers who took the case to the tribunal.Frank Field, the Labour chair of the work and pensions committee, said the decision ranked “among the most substantial judicial interventions ever to support vulnerable workers in this country”.The GMB’s general secretary, Tim Roache, described it as “another nail in the coffin of the exploitative, bogus self-employment model which is increasingly rife across the UK”.He said: “Bosses can’t just pick and choose which laws to obey. Workers’ rights were hard won, GMB isn’t about to sit back and let them be eroded or removed by the latest loophole employers have come up with to make a few extra quid.”Roache urged Hermes to have a meaningful discussion with the union but the delivery company indicated it would appeal against the judgment.A Hermes spokesman said: “We will carefully review the tribunal’s decision, but we are likely to appeal it given that it goes against previous decisions, our understanding of the witness evidence and what we believe the law to be. The judgment mirrors verdicts in cases brought against Uber, Addison Lee, City Sprint, Excel and eCourier, where judges have ruled that the staff should be given the legal classification as “workers”, thereby receiving the minimum wage and holiday pay.The GMB has announced legal action against three Amazon delivery companies on the same principles.The union said there would be a further hearing in the tribunal to determine the holiday pay, minimum wage and any unlawful deductions to which the Hermes couriers are entitled.  Michael Newman, from the solicitors Leigh Day, said: “This judgment acknowledges that Hermes couriers, as the customer-fronting ‘face of Hermes’, play an integral part in the success of the company. It confirms that they work for Hermes as part of Hermes’ business.”Field, who co-authored a 2016 report, Wild West Workplace, Self-Employment in Britain’s “Gig Economy”, said it was “a mega knockback to those companies still using old means of exploiting vulnerable workers”.In February Theresa May announced a number of new labour policies that she said would help uphold workers’ rights, in response to a Downing Street-commissioned review which called on the government to improve the quality of work for people on low pay.However, to the disappointment of workers, trade unions and Labour, the government only pledged to consult on possible changes to the use of self-employment, which may not include changing the law."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4be3b3312a0b24e365565500673a6f255e84e155/0_136_3326_1996/master/3326.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=74daa412aef42e3a0e54676c5c1c337d","title":"supermarket watchdogs oversight may extend to amazon and boots","story":"Grocery Code Adjudicator hopes to win new powers after complaints from suppliersThe grocery industry watchdog is hoping to win new powers to oversee Amazon and Boots after receiving numerous complaints about their treatment of suppliers.Christine Tacon, the Grocery Code Adjudicator (GCA), already oversees 10 retailers including the big four supermarkets – Tesco, Sainsbury’s, Asda and Morrisons – and has the power to issue multi-million pound fines if suppliers are treated poorly.The competition watchdog is currently assessing a group of up to four additional retailers that could come under Tacon’s remit from August, if it finds their grocery sales amount to £1bn or more.Amazon’s shift into groceries, after buying Wholefoods Market and teaming up with Morrisons for its Amazon Fresh food home deliveries, is thought to have potentially put it within the GCA’s sights, while Boots’s sale of sandwiches and drinks as well as shampoo, toothpaste and suncream, may also put the health and beauty chain in the frame.Tacon said she was particularly keen to include those retailers that were treating suppliers poorly while competing directly with the 10 companies she currently oversees. She said Boots and Amazon were the chains mostly mentioned by suppliers, who complained that they either paid later than agreed or asked for additional cash. But Tacon added she could not be certain the two retailers will come under her remit as there was “no cast-iron definition” of groceries, and it was difficult to assess the amount of relevant goods they sold.She said retailers might argue that products such as toothpaste, for example, should not be included, which might take their overall grocery turnover below the £1bn cut-off point.The potential extension of GCA’s powers comes as Tacon named Asda as the worst of the UK’s big four supermarkets in its treatment of suppliers for the second year in a row.The Walmart-owned chain did better than the Co-op, which is currently under investigation by the watchdog, and Iceland, which once again hit the bottom of the pile, but sits well behind its major rivals, according to CGA’s survey of 1,000 suppliers.Still, Tacon said Asda had shown improvement in the past year. “I am delighted to report significant improvements across all regulated retailers,” she added. In one measure of her powers, Tesco, which faced a major investigation by the GCA in 2015, has overtaken Sainsbury’s and Waitrose to become the major supermarket best rated by suppliers, although it still sits behind Aldi, which has come top of the annual survey. Tacon said she hoped Asda’s dealings with food producers and grocery manufacturers would improve if its planned merger with Sainsbury’s went ahead, because the latter had better systems in place for dealing with suppliers and had consistently scored better in the annual survey.Nevertheless, she warned that she could not prevent suppliers being squeezed by a new bigger retailer after the merger as she did not have the power to intervene when suppliers were agreeing prices with retailers.“If a company is prepared to supply something at a lower price who am I to interfere? We end up with better prices for consumers,” she said. Tacon said she was open to the idea of her remit being extended in some way but warned “I’m not the industry fairy godmother” highlighting she had only been able to improve practices at the supermarkets because her role was clearly defined and backed by strong powers."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/833d806774383b54a8ad58a8e164d5853a881061/0_374_5616_3370/master/5616.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ea8e9d457df92e3d0e7f209b6f8607c3","title":"the ultimate character test do you thank the bus driver","story":"A new meme hails ‘people who thank the bus driver’ as the best of humanity - even Russell Crowe approves. But does everyone agree?You’ve hit the red stop button, the bus is slowing to a halt, the doors lurch open with a hiss, you go to disembark ... but wait.Do you thank the driver?The question of public transport protocol has become an unlikely meme on social media, alongside claims that it is the ultimate test of character – with those who give voice to their gratitude hailed as “the best of humanity”.According to KnowYourMeme, the meme originated on Reddit two weeks ago, when a user elevated “people who say thanks to the bus driver” to pharaoh status. From Reddit, the meme – reminiscent of so-called “wholesome memes”, a knowing attempt to make the internet a kinder place – spread to other platforms and was applied to various established formats, such as Distracted Boyfriend and Exploding Brain. “People who don’t say thanks to the bus driver” were also condemned.The popular Instagram account Brown Cardigan, followed by nearly 400,000 people, embraced the cause with characteristic near-deranged fervour, collating the best – and increasingly aggressive – expressions of “unrelenting gratitude” under the hashtag: #justthankingbusdriverthings.“WOW. Huge. Memes that change lives and empower everyday heroes. Our job here is done,” read the caption beneath the story, which reported “a whole new sense of job satisfaction” and even an uptick in career change inquiries.Brown Cardigan’s self-appointment as a “conductor of goodwill” may have been facetious, but the meme nevertheless sparked an earnest debate about passenger etiquette.But debate elsewhere on the internet flagged the possibility that the weight of the implicit expectation to thank your bus driver could vary by region.In Australia, where Brown Cardigan is based, a loud “CHEERS DRIVER” or exaggerated nod of thanks is de rigeur on alighting the bus, in the smaller cities of Brisbane and Perth in particular, but not infrequently in Sydney.His tweet caught the attention of Gladiator actor and lively tweeter Russell Crowe, who agreed, adding: “It’s simple common courtesy.”But discussion in New Urbanist Memes for Transit-Oriented Teens – a Facebook group of nearly 100,000 mostly millennials interested in urbanist issues – suggested that view was by no means the case elsewhere in the world. Londoners in particular were singled out for scrutiny.One member described thanking the bus driver as “Irish culture”.“I used to thank bus drivers when I lived in a city where that was a thing people did,” wrote one commenter. “For now, I live in a city that mercifully rejects small talk and the forced emotional labor of giving and accepting thanks (New York) – so I no longer do.”Several respondents distinguished between the relative convenience of expressing their thanks while exiting from the front door, and the potentially unseemly volume necessary to be heard from the back.A minority were unapologetically ungrateful. One woman wrote: “I don’t talk to strangers so I don’t thank my bus driver.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5ecfdd9afbd5a4a996b43d265290a83762173858/0_152_2717_1630/master/2717.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=0f2a5b298861ee91bd025c313acff1ef","title":"blame liberal democracy flaws erdogan win turkish","story":"How many warnings do liberals need? The victory of Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, hands power, virtually for ever, to a ruler of 80 million people on Europe’s southern border. His opponents are jailed, his press is censored, his promised reforms give him unlimited control. He is undeniably popular.There is no point in simply deploring Erdoğan and, by implication, insulting his electorate. Europe now faces two populist (and ostensibly popular) autocrats, Erdoğan and Russia’s Vladimir Putin, across its eastern frontier. They are matched by similar “strong-man” leaders in Hungary, Poland, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Austria and Serbia.These regimes are no longer aberrations. Populism is becoming the norm across a swath of states in eastern Europe, characterised by personal rule, xenophobia and the suppression of parliamentary and media opposition. Churchill’s warning of “an iron curtain descending” returns to haunt the continent, except that this time the curtain is not Soviet communism but populist autocracy.The one sure way to exacerbate this trend is for western Europe simply to hurl abuse at it. As in Donald Trump’s America, people do not like being told they are idiots, racists or deluded Nazis when voting for what they see as their interest and their national identity. They particularly do not enjoy it from rich countries that, as they see it, steal their young people and make them admit Asian and African refugees in their place.The currently fashionable “death of democracy” movement draws attention to the failure of electorates to vote for the liberalinternationalist programme – hence Trump, Brexit and anti-immigrant parties in Italy, France and Germany. But the fault, if fault it is, lies not with the voters but with the institutions that are failing to respond to their demands. If the traditional vehicles of public debate – political parties, the media, academics – do not hear them, they will turn to leaders who do.Western abuse of populism is not the answer. It will not alter these elections, though its “soft power” could try to aid oppressed parliaments and newspapers. More realistic is to set an example, to reassert that democracy is not about validating power but about curbing it. Since Aristotle, it has been about checking “mob rule” through constitutional balances, criticism and opposition, ersity and devolution.The real message of the Turkish election is that there is nothing inevitable about a mature democracy. It needs constant refreshment, everywhere. Parliaments and parties need updating. Local government needs liberating. Media pluralism needs defending. Social media hysteria needs limiting. One person, one vote, one time is not democracy but autocracy. Turkey is not our business. But democracy is."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c29555f53b00b0ea160f9fc55e6bbf3270d66056/0_235_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=461bb2b8dbf432a48500e3ad330e41f5","title":"britain heatwave how to cope drink water instagram filter","story":"Drink water, hang out in the freezer aisle and – most important – use the right filter on InstagramIt’s a truth universally acknowledged that Brits can’t deal with weather. Seemingly any weather. We’re obsessed with it, but we’re bad at it. It snows and we’re calling into work saying there’s no way we can possibly travel, despite the fact that Russians manage to grit their entire cities at 6am each morning. Temperatures reach 21C and people act like they’ve been tossed into a fiery pit of hell. And the exhaustion, oh my God. It’s a trial, so here I am with some handy tips. You can buy me a cool jug of Pimm’s later.High summer is the only time it’s ever acceptable for men to walk into a supermarket without a shirt on. Even then it’s touch and go. But might I recommend to everyone the freezer aisle? Just grab five minutes of cool respite by opening the door and nestling your hot little face next to the McCain chips and Dr Oetker pizzas.I would also recommend befriending Karen from work, who carries one of those handheld electric fans at all times. It sounds like a bee on MDMA and will get on everyone’s nerves, but it works. If you haven’t already learned that Amaro is your go-to summer months filter, then that’s where to start. Snap pics of your feet in the lapping shore of your nearest beach (crop out the plastic waste). Hold an in-focus ice-cream up in front of a flawless blue sky (rainbow sprinkles preferred). Artfully arrange this summer’s hyped new novel on a patterned picnic blanket, with a “Finally got around to reading!!!” caption, even though its publication date was a week ago (to imply that you usually finish a new release on the same day). Try not to get photobombed by a: seagull, naked child or somebody else taking a selfie.In the pub at 1pm any other day and your mates would stage an intervention, but during a “heatwave” it’s basically mandatory. If you work at a tech startup your boss has probably already passed around ice-cold beers and hired an ice-cream van for the reception, but the rest of us have to find a way to slink off to a sunny spot in a pub garden (and immediately moan that it is too hot). The humidity however, is exhausting (“Mate, I’m so tired, you tired?”, “I cannot deal”, “It’s too much for me, I need a lie down”) and adding booze to the mix is a recipe for falling asleep on the bus home. Pace yourself, and – sorry to be all public health awareness on this – but DRINK WATER. For the non-drinkers, the struggle of sipping from a Diet Coke and dealing with friends who have used heatstroke as their vodka mixer is real. TfL reported that temperatures on the tube last summer reached 31C. Which is almost a human rights violation, especially when you’re in the shadow of a thousand armpits. On the bus, there’s always that one sociopath who closes the window. People flap free-sheet papers in faces, total hazard. I would advise, if at all possible, to avoid public transport. Walk. Not just because walking keeps you fit and you spot things you would never notice otherwise, but so that you don’t arrive at your destination steaming from your insides having been cooked on the top deck of the number 24 or wearing your shirt like a second skin. As with at non-heatwave times of the year, the main piece of advice here is: don’t be a woman who is flaunting your curves, showing off your pins or displaying your assets. Wear a bag at all times, like Shia LeBeouf at Cannes. Come heatwave time, however, the tabloid paps are out in force. So just know that if you will wear a crop top near the Diana memorial fountain or dare to swim in the mixed pool on Hampstead Heath, your midriff is gonna end up on a front page.For my milkier friends out there, as someone who was once asked by a person who spoke English as a second language: “Why you have no blood?” I can empathise with the risk of sunburn. Remember that anyone, regardless of complexion or skin colour, can burn. So always put on sunscreen. But if your general skin tone is printer-paper, be sensible.I manage to burn every year without fail, which is highly amusing to friends, but also not great for obvious health reasons. Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent of all cancers. There are options to cover up. Annoyingly, because they are awful, bucket hats are making a comeback. Plenty of people are choosing to wear swimwear originally designed for religious purposes, but have reached an even wider audience. We are all excited about England doing well in the World Cup, but try to avoid becoming red and white all over.Finally, I’d like to recommend open-water swimming. It’s great any time of the year, but when temperatures soar, it’s lovely. There are open-swimming spots all around the UK. Ponds and rivers among foliage (River Derwent near Chatsworth House, Peak District) infinity pools near the sea (Tinside lido in Plymouth Jubilee pool in Penzance, Cornwall) tucked away in cities (Bristol lido) Scotland’s glorious lochs beach pools (the Tidal pool on Margate beach), and, oh wow, the lakes (the … um, entire Lake District, Hatchmere in Delamere Forest).Also, seek out a cafe terrace with those Parisian-style outdoor tables and chairs, and try to ignore how much harder it’ll be to live the life for real once Brexit comes through.

A year on from that remarkable general election result, this is the challenge facing Jeremy Corbyn and the people at the top of the Labour party – a difficult but urgent task in increasingly trying times.Just over a week ago, I was among the 3,000 or so people who spent an overcast Saturday in north London,\u0026nbspat the celebration of politics and music branded\u0026nbsp Labour Live. Whatever its detractors claimed, it was a well-intentioned, creative event – but the sparse crowd and rather wearied atmosphere highlighted issues far beyond the organisers’ control.Notwithstanding the passions that occasionally coursed around the site, the day reflected the inertia that has set in on both the right and left since last year’s election – and more specifically, Labour’s current lack of energy and big ideas, which was never more evident than when Corbyn took the main stage in the early evening and delivered his big speech.It was essentially an oration I have heard many times before, in 2015, 2016 and 2017. Over an uneven, often apparently improvised half-hour with no discernible beginning, middle or end, he tumbled through homelessness, the need to “take the commodity out of education”, the mounting mental health crisis, and more. Brexit got the briefest of mentions, 20 minutes in. The tenor often sounded more despairing than optimistic. Potentially powerful lines were often mangled by verbal tics (“as a society” is a phrase that urgently needs to go). There was a lack of any real story about the current condition of Britain with the kind of coherence and emotional lift that might speak to the people who are yet to be convinced.For sure, Labour has a set of entirely justified moral convictions. Thanks chiefly to the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, it has the beginnings of an across-the-piece economic plan, and some very interesting ideas about making the country more equal from the roots up. But what the party doesn’t yet possess is an account of the last few turbulent years of British history, and any human, emotional story about what the country might look like if it gets to implement its programme. So when its big figures get to their punchlines, there are often only empty bromides. “We want to live in a world where there is decency, and above all, hope,” said Corbyn – which was very nice, but floated off into the air as soon as he had said it. The usual questions remained unanswered: What is the United Kingdom? Why should it hold together? Where has it been, and where is it going? And as well as all the despair, where are the spots of hope that point to a different kind of country?Such, perhaps, are the perils of attempting to make political headway while maintaining a stubborn reticence about the biggest change the UK has faced since the second world war. Right now, politics begins and ends with Brexit: the current Labour habit of talking about the past, present and future as if leaving the EU is a tangential subplot simply doesn’t make sense. But that is what the leadership does, having concluded that, as the government tumbles into shambles after shambles, the best thing to do is sit the whole mess out and say as little as possible. It is some achievement that many leavers think Corbyn is a remainer, while remainers are split between those who think he is secretly one of them, and those who damn him as a hardcore Brexiteer. This in turn blurs into a wider sense of paralysis and confusion – not a good look for an opposition that may go into a general election much sooner than some people think.In some alternative universe, there might be a Labour party that began making the case for single-market membership in the summer of 2016, and whose leader was the star speaker at the weekend’s People’s Vote march. But as evidenced by those irate chants of “Where’s Jeremy Corbyn?”, he and his allies resolutely believe that talk of another referendum is for the birds, and we have to leave the European Union – albeit with a secure deal, a transition period, a customs union, and maintained protections for workers’ rights and the environment. Given where Labour stands in relation to many of its own voters, that is a reasonable position. Indeed, when anti-Brexit protesters at Labour Live unfurled their “stop backing Brexit” banner during Corbyn’s speech, he should have thought on his feet, and restated it. Instead he kept stumm and some of his media outriders then tried to paint the disrupters as craven lackeys of the establishment (something proved, apparently, by the fact they have an office in Millbank Tower). Once again, what we missed was a clear, confident, consistent Labour narrative.The cleverest radicals tend to present their ideas as matters of modesty and common sense, so as to accomplish one of politics’ most overlooked imperatives: the necessity of reassurance. Beyond Brexit, that also ought to apply to large swathes of Labour policy. Whatever the factional tensions, one point needs to be made again and again: that as well as being a newly revived movement, Labour is also a political force steeped in knowledge and experience, and is successfully running all of England’s big cities. Maybe Corbyn and McDonnell are wary of comparisons with soggy European social democracy, but if their ambitious plans for regional investment banks are similar to what exists in Germany, that point ought to be made every time the policy is mentioned. If Corbyn wants to create a school system that isn’t built around incessant testing and league tables, he might point out that some of the most successful European countries offer lessons in how to do it.There are big areas of policy – defence and foreign affairs, chiefly – that the left tends to ignore, but (and I’m being somewhat diplomatic here) which still sit between Labour and the voters it will need if it’s going to win. Perhaps most importantly, the party should stop framing its policies in terms of a return to the pre-Thatcher past – 1945 and all that – and start basing what it says in the future. It ought to be Tory free-marketry that feels like yesterday’s thing.If Labour does not yet have the collective capacity or inclination to do these things, the reason is not hard to identify. Beyond the union-funded Centre for Labour and Social Studies (aka Class), the Corbynites have no supportive thinktanks. The online noise surrounding their project tends to be about either the necessity of campaigning or factional battling, so questions of strategy and ideas tend to get lost. Put another way, the foundations of the new Labour party in Twitter and Facebook mean that many of its followers have become well-versed in the art of online shouting, but less used to discussing the challenges Labour faces. A little too much attention, perhaps, is paid to “melts”, centrist dads, and not enough to the difficult questions that political parties with their eyes on power always have to face.Six weeks before Labour Live I was in Walsall, one of those large post-industrial, leave-voting towns – see also such places as Nuneaton, Derby, Mansfield and Dudley – where Labour seems to be falling behind.

France’s group-stage exit as the holders in 2002 was sealed in a defeat by Denmark and although they have ensured there will be no embarrassingly early departure from Russia, the repeat of that fixture on Tuesday has plenty riding on it for the Danes.Sixteen years after Denmark last reached the knockout stages at the World Cup in Japan and South Korea, they face France at the Luzhniki Stadium knowing victory would ensure their progress. Åge Hareide’s side have conceded one goal in six matches and are unbeaten in 17 games, although the failure to beat Australia after taking an early lead through Christian Eriksen’s brilliant finish in Samara has left a question mark hanging over them.Hareide, a Norwegian who spent three seasons in English football during the early 1980s with Manchester City and Norwich, took over from Morten Olsen in 2015 and has attempted to redefine Denmark’s approach in order to be more effective.After the retirements of the 1992 European Championship-winning side who featured Peter Schmeichel and Brian Laudrup, Olsen made the most of the steady but unspectacular generation who followed. In 2002 a 2-0 win over France in Incheon courtesy of goals from Dennis Rommedahl and Jon Dahl Tomasson, which meant they topped Group A, was the highlight of his reign, as Denmark were comprehensively beaten by England in the next round.Aside from a quarter-final appearance at Euro 2004, when they lost 3-0 once again – this time to the Czech Republic – Olsen’s tenure became renowned for their ordinariness as Denmark failed to qualify for the 2014 World Cup and Euro 2016. His departure after 15 years was greeted with optimism by most supporters and their patience was rewarded with a place in Russia after Eriksen inspired the 5-1 play-off thrashing of the Republic of Ireland in Dublin. Now for the hard part.France’s narrow victories over Australia and Peru mean the pressure is off Didier Deschamps’ side, although they need a victory to guarantee they win the group and avoid a tie against the likely Group D winners Croatia in the next round. But a win for Denmark would mean they leapfrog France and top the group and, with Deschamps expected to rest some of his senior players, Hareide will fancy his chances of causing an upset.Much will rely on Tottenham’s Eriksen, who has 17 goals in his past 22 games for his country compared with six in 57 matches when Olsen was the manager. In the absence of Yussuf Poulsen, suspended after being booked for conceding a second penalty in as many matches via VAR, Eriksen’s partnership with the Feyenoord striker Nicolai Jørgensen could hold the key to Denmark’s hopes, although Hareide perhaps did not help himself when he suggested fans’ criticism of his side was unfair.“I knew it was a picky football country when I arrived because the Danes like to call themselves the Brazilians of Scandinavia,” he said. “I think it’s quite good to be unbeaten in 17 matches, so what do people want? If we had won against Australia, I think people would perhaps still have been critical.”The punctured lung suffered by William Kvist in the opening match against Peru means Ajax’s Lasse Schöne is, at 32, the oldest player still available for selection and Hareide, who is the only manager to have won the Danish, Swedish and Norwegian league titles, acknowledged the best may be still to come from this squad.“The situation is a little unusual for some of our players,” he said. “They are young and they are going to learn from this. It is hard mentally and physically to go through this. But I think they have done really well to work hard for the team and have a good morale going into the match against France.”He will be wary of allowing France’s well-stocked midfield the chance to dominate and has called on his players to show more composure.“We made mistakes against Australia that better teams would punish us for,” he said. “We cannot risk that now. We must be much more alert to France and their counterattacking game. If we make technical mistakes in the final third it will make it too easy for them.”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/64210430bd47a9bdb95a557bc82a0e09e5397f57/48_102_5279_3168/master/5279.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=dad8cbb7d52af78e2a9f04d15d8edc06","title":"group permutations how teams can qualify for the world cup last 16","story":"With the final round of group games to play, here is how teams can still qualify for the knockout stageGoing into the last round of World Cup group fixtures, here’s how the qualifying situation stands in each of the eight groups. Eighteen nations are in contention for the 10 places left up for grabs in the last 16 – and in Group F potentially any of the four teams could still qualify.Already qualified for second round: Russia, Uruguay, France, Croatia, England, BelgiumRussia and Uruguay have both qualified. A draw on Monday and Russia top the group on goal difference. Uruguay need to win to take the group.A draw will be enough to guarantee Portugal progress, though Iran can qualify for the second round for the first time if they can beat Portugal. Spain are almost certain to progress unless Iran beat Portugal and Spain lose to Morocco by a wider margin.Croatia are through. Argentina, Iceland or Nigeria could all join them in the next round. A draw against Argentina will be enough for Nigeria, provided that Iceland don’t beat Croatia. Iceland need Argentina and Nigeria to draw, and then if they can beat Croatia by two goals or more they can just about edge out Nigeria. Argentina need to win, and hope Iceland don’t beat Croatia. If Iceland and Argentina both win, it would come down to goal difference between the pair. Get the abacus out.Brazil, Switzerland and Serbia are in contention for the two places. Switzerland know they need only a point against Costa Rica to progress. Serbia need victory against Brazil to be sure of going through – a result which would potentially send the Seleção home early if Switzerland also get a positive result.Germany’s sensational last-minute winner against Sweden has made this one of the most complex group situations – Mexico and South Korea could join either of those teams in the last 16. Mexico are in the box-seat with six points - a point against Sweden and they are through. Sweden need a better result against Mexico than the result Germany get against South Korea to progress. South Korea can still edge through if they beat Germany and Mexico beat Sweden, and there’s at least a two-goal margin in there somewhere.There’s also a bizarre edge case in this group, where if South Korea beat Germany 1-0, and Mexico beat Sweden 1-0, the rules state that Sweden and Germany will only be separated by their disciplinary records – not by the fact that Germany beat Sweden.England and Belgium are locked together at the top of the group, both guaranteed to progress. Their final match will determine who tops the group. As they have identical records so far, if their final match is drawn, the team with the better disciplinary record (currently England with two yellow cards as opposed to Belgium’s three) will top the group. If they end up with identical disciplinary records, lots will be drawn to decide who finishes first – which could be key to potentially avoiding a route that includes facing Germany or Brazil in the quarter-finals.Japan will progress if they get at least a draw against eliminated Poland. Colombia and Senegal face each other. A draw in that game will be enough for Senegal to progress. A draw might also be enough for Colombia to progress, but they would be relying on Poland beating Japan at the same time."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f757e06d470b566ca4226dd27c0bc2a31d9c2001/0_9_3820_2293/master/3820.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=874e296940d23b12b32dabbb05e96db4","title":"mikel john obi lionel messi nigeria argentina world cup","story":"Nigeria v Argentina has rich World Cup history and this meeting falls more than a decade after the captains met in a youth finalMikel John Obi smiles. “Yeah, Messi stole the Golden Ball off me,” the Nigeria captain says, and he remembers how it happened as if it were yesterday. The story comes from the World Youth Championship of 2005, when Mikel drove Nigeria to the final, where they faced a Lionel Messi-inspired Argentina.“Before the game people said that I was going to win the Golden Ball for being the player of the tournament,” Mikel says. “But then Messi scored twice, both of them penalties, Argentina won 2-1 and I got the Silver Ball. Messi has kept on stealing awards from me!”Cue more laughter. The serious point is that Messi has been messing with Nigeria and Mikel for too long. Indeed, Argentina have held an Indian sign over Nigeria at World Cups going back to 1994, when the African nation first qualified.Nigeria are contesting their sixth World Cup and it is a remarkable detail that they have been drawn to face Argentina at the group stage in all but one of them.In 1994 they lost 2-1 to a pair of Claudio Caniggia goals in a game that saw the biggest bang come afterwards, when Diego Maradona failed a drugs test, was sent home and banned. He would never play for Argentina again. Nigeria suffered 1-0 defeats in 2002 and 2010, on the back of goals from Gabriel Batistuta and Gabriel Heinze respectively, and in 2014 they lost 3-2.Mikel played in that game, having missed 2010 through injury, and so did Messi, who scored twice. Messi had also played in 2010 and he was a star of the Argentina team that won gold at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, when they beat Nigeria in the final, with Ángel Di María scoring the only goal.Nigeria can point to the 1996 Atlanta Games, when they beat Argentina 3-2 in the final. That team were from the golden age of Nigerian football and featured Kanu, Jay-Jay Okocha and Sunday Oliseh, among others. Emmanuel Amunike scored a stoppage-time winner. The triumph is fondly remembered but, in terms of tournament successes against Argentina, it stands in glorious isolation.Mikel and his teammates are determined to break the World Cup jinx when they take on Argentina in Tuesday’s Group D finale in St Petersburg and it has the ingredients of the most decisive meeting between the countries yet.Nigeria know that after the 2-0 win over Iceland, another victory would ensure qualification to the last 16 while a draw would be enough as long as Iceland do not beat Croatia by a couple of goals. Even then Nigeria could go through on goals scored. For Argentina, the equation is simple. Only a win would keep their hopes alive.The subplots are numerous and mouthwatering and yet Messi, inevitably, feels like the central figure. His travails against Iceland and the horror-show loss to Croatia have been well-documented but Mikel knows better than to view him as anything other than the player he and his teammates must stop.Nigeria beat Argentina 4-2 in a Krasnodar friendly last November and they draw a measure of strength from the result. But it was significant that Mikel highlighted how Messi had not featured on that occasion.“A certain human being wasn’t playing,” Mikel says. “Actually, is he even a human being? Messi is Messi. He decides games and the last time we met he scored two against us at the Brazil World Cup. Without him, they are definitely less of a team. We can’t put all our attention on Messi but he is the man that we need to stop. Do we have to put somebody to mark him? Maybe yes, maybe no because when you do that you are playing with less balance.”Nigeria played with great balance and purpose against Iceland, when Ahmed Musa scored both of the goals, after the manager, Gernot Rohr, made a tactical change. He abandoned his usual 4-2-3-1 formation and went with 3-5-2.Mikel, who made his name as a defensive midfielder over 10 and a half seasons at Chelsea and plays for Tianjin Teda in China, has typically operated as a No 10 at international level. It was where he played in the opening group tie against Croatia, which Nigeria lost 2-0.Mikel did likewise against Iceland. Rohr started him in the central holding role, although he and the midfielders either side of him – Oghenekaro Etebo and the impressive Wilfred Ndidi – did get up and down the pitch. Rohr will weigh up whether to continue with the approach against Argentina.And so here Nigeria are once again, confronted by the opponents who have become their nemesis. “We knew we would get them,” Mikel says. “I said to a friend of mine: ‘Trust me, Argentina are going to be in the same group as us.’ It’s crazy. I don’t know why but it keeps happening.”Mikel and Nigeria crave a different ending."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/66ede6f05888e0066e07b5329dc41d099491d97c/64_0_4927_2956/master/4927.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1342e962a935e2e1e1f55325d7647222","title":"quiz world cup hat tricks","story":"Harry Kane picked up a match ball thanks to two penalties and a deflection.

But maybe, in the end, it’s not you. It’s us. The experience of Video Assistant Refereeing in the English season had only pointed one way at this World Cup. The endless delays while a middle-aged man fiddles with his ear. The jeers in the stadium. The complete absence of any information. It all felt like something that would diminish decisively the primary experience of the stadium-going fan. But in Russia it has actually worked well. A quick sprint off to check a screen. Decisions made in seconds not minutes. Less fussicking and prancing about and super-officious officialdom. VAR has prevented rather than created controversy, and has stilled the tedious chunter about decisions, so often a last resort for those who would rather not analyse the actual game. If it does nothing else World Cup VAR has saved us from the grisly spectacle of Neymar’s backward e against Costa Rica being rewarded with a match-turning penalty. If it makes him stay on his feet just a little more, everyone wins. And meanwhile English football take note. It doesn’t have to be an enormous VAR palaver after all. Barney RonayThere has been only one other World Cup, in 1966, when England have scored more than their current total of eight goals. Harry Kane has five of them, putting him at the top of the list for the Golden Boot, and meaning Gary Lineker is the only England player in history to have scored more World Cup goals. Yet the strange thing is that Kane’s team-mates have found it unusually difficult to provide him with chances from open play. Two of Kane’s goals have come from penalties, one was a fluke and the other two arrived from corners. That apart, it is difficult to think of a clear chance for Kane. If his team-mates can start picking him out, it may be that the World Cup has not actually seen the best of Kane yet. Daniel TaylorFollowing your team around the globe occasionally conjures wondrous stories of coincidence. Staying at the Oka hotel in Nizhny Novgorod was an England supporter whose mother, recently passed away, hailed from the once-closed city around 250 miles east of Moscow. She had left for north London in 1946 and would never return, with her son having pledged to visit her birthplace in her stead. That England’s schedule would take them back to Nizhny, formerly Gorky, was already a stroke of luck, but the fan had actually discovered, much to his amazement, that the address where his mother had lived was virtually opposite the hotel allocated to him by his travel company. And, what is more, the building is still occupied by someone bearing her maiden name. His next mission is to meet, face to face, the cousin he never knew he had. The football almost felt like a sideshow to the main event. Dominic FifieldHow do you measure your World Cup experience? For the number of countries whose elimination is guaranteed after two games, with no points and in some cases not even a goal to cheer so far, the football side of things clearly can’t have been a highlight. But spending time in the cities where the likes of Egypt and Peru have been out in force to support and represent their nation, there is a tangible sense that they will go home from Russia feeling they’ve had the opposite of a worthless trip. Maybe it has something to do with the length of the wait to experience something like this. It has been 28 years for Egypt and 36 for Peru. Their joy at throwing themselves into the party, their emotions at singing their national anthems and waving their flags, the fervour with which they supported teams as they went out fighting, meant something in itself. Amy LawrenceThere is a school of thought that Neymar was laying it on a bit thick when he burst into tears after Brazil’s late win over Costa Rica but in one sense his lachrymosity was good to see. Whatever you think of the Paris Saint-Germain forward’s solipsism, he is clearly desperate to succeed at a World Cup and it is a counterpoint to any suggestions that this competition does not hold the allure of old to its star participants. “These tears are from happiness, overcoming obstacles, grit and will to win,” he wrote on Instagram after his outburst. What we have seen in the past week and a half – from Neymar’s emotion to Germany’s wild celebrations against Sweden, the pile-ons whenever England score and the atmosphere of intense hostility when Switzerland faced Serbia – is that international football still stirs passions like no other form of the sport. It is easy to get sniffy about some of the quality on show but that is to miss the point that World Cups have always appealed more to the visceral than the cerebral. A group stage full of incident and tension suggests reports of the tournament’s ill health have been exaggerated. Nick AmesGermany will never forget Toni Kroos’s sensational 95th-minute free-kick that sunk Sweden and rekindled their World Cup hopes. But Sweden must move on quickly from the pain, which was compounded by the way that the German bench gloated in the red-raw aftermath of full-time. “It was disgusting behaviour from the Germans, a total lack of respect,” said the midfielder, Emil Forsberg, and he was not the only Swede to offer up emotional sound-bites. Janne Andersson, the manager, was fuming during the post-match melee and he could not keep a lid on it during his press conference. “People behaved in ways that you do not do,” Andersson said. Sweden can still qualify by beating Mexico and their focus has now turned to that. One tip for them – avoid listening to Oliver Bierhoff, who is a member of Joachim Löw’s Germany staff. “The fact is that Sweden’s negative way of playing and so much time-wasting doesn’t deserve to be rewarded,” Bierhoff said. David HytnerThere was more gloating when Switzerland recorded their 2-1 victory over Serbia but this time there was rather more to it. A bit of background. Xherdan Shaqiri and Granit Xhaka are ethnic Albanians with their roots in Kosovo, where a Serbian crackdown on the Albanian population only ended with Nato military intervention in 1999. Shaqiri was born in Kosovo but his family were forced to flee to Switzerland when he was a baby due to conflict while Xhaka was born in Switzerland – his parents having also fled there from Kosovo. “My uncle’s house burned down and our house was left standing but everything had been stolen or broken and the walls were sprayed,” Shaqiri has said. Xhaka’s father had been a political prisoner for three-and-a-half years, having committed the crime of demonstrating in favour of Kosovarian democratic rights against the communist central government in Belgrade. When Shaqiri and Xhaka scored the goals against Serbia, they made the sign of the Albanian double-headed eagle. Fifa may discipline them for provoking the general public. After what their families lived through, they would surely do it again. DHBy the eternal flame, there is a vast statue of the unknown soldier, stretched prone, his right arm reaching out towards an unseen finish line. About 100 yards away, a gaggle of runners engage in a slightly awkward group warm-up while a terrier called Phoebe scurries about in a frenzy of excitement. This is the Kazan parkrun and, like so much else in Russia this month, the World Cup has made it a little different. Parkrunning is a phenomenon that began in Bushy Park, Teddington, in October 2004. The idea is simple: a timed 5km run on a properly measured course, the ethos being very much about participation rather than competition. It has proved wildly successful, and now stretches to 1,533 parks across 20 countries. A subculture of “parkrun tourists” has developed, as runners “collect” races along various themes. More than 20 runners, for instance, have ticked off all 52 London parkruns, while a recent trend is to try to complete a list of parkruns starting with every letter of the alphabet (apart from X there are no Xs). Zs, understandably, are prized, which is why one visitor from London made the trip to Zhukovsky, about 25 miles from Moscow, on the Saturday before the World Cup began. The Kazan parkrun began in April 2015. It features a brutal hill in the middle of each of its two laps, and attracts an average of 29 runners. On Saturday, there were 38, at least five of them British, including Simon Marland, the secretary of Bolton Wanderers, who came a highly creditable fourth. The week before, there had been around 30 Australians. The local reaction was bemused but welcoming, as the World Cup does its job of bringing different cultures of together. Jonathan WilsonThe front page of Saturday’s Herald Sun wondered “Time for Cahill?” The Australian asked “Forget Wally – where’s Timmy?” After one point and two games in which their only goals have been Mile Jedinak penalties, Australia seems to be losing patience and wants a return to what it knows. And more than anything it knows Tim Cahill. He may be 38-years-old, hasn’t started a game of any description since November and hasn’t scored a club goal since April 2017, but there’s still seemingly a big part of the Australian psyche that can’t let go. Which isn’t a surprise: this is Australia’s fifth World Cup, the first being in 1974 and Cahill has scored in the other three. It must feel weird for him not to be starting. But he’s stayed on the bench for their opening two games and apparently not happy about it either: will the unflaggingly stubborn Bert van Marwijk give in to the clamour? Nick MillerRussia’s 3-1 victory over Egypt put the debate to rest: their defeat of Saudi Arabia wasn’t just a fluke. The Russian team have gelled unexpectedly well, dissecting a flawed Egyptian side that nonetheless boasted a threat in Liverpool star Mo Salah. Behind the winger Denis Cheryshev, the rising star Aleksandr Golovin, and the surprisingly spry Artem Dzyuba, Russians are also joking about it coming home. It’s a sea change from the mood before the World Cup when this side was said to be the worst in the country’s history. And the press let them know it. “I’m a little bit surprised that the national team continued to speak to the media at all because it was a really bad attitude from the press and from the fans,” Igor Rabiner, a popular Russian sportswriter, told me last week. Russia’s first real test, Uruguay, will come on Monday. If the team continues to play as they have, they’ve a fighting chance. And the country will be behind them.

Essam Elhadary saves well, tipping the ball over the bar in theatrical style. 65 min: Egypt substitution: Ramadan Sobhi, formerly of Stoke and now a Huddersfield Town recruit, on for Marwan Mohsen. Saudi Arabia substitution: Asiri on for Bahebri.63 min: Another ball in behind from Egypt for Mo Salah to chase. Almosailem is quick off his line in the Saudi goal to avert the danger.60 min: Good tracking and an excellent covering tackle from Egypt’s Gabr on Salman. Saudi Arabia win a throw-in deep in Egypt territory. Nothing comes of it and Egypt get a goal-kick.58 min: Trezeguet shoots high over the bar again. You can’t fault him for effort or willing, but his finishing has been dreadful today. 57 min: A hopeful ball into the box from Egypt. Trezeguet leaps and sends a powerful header about a foot wide, before sinking to his knees with an anguished look.55 min: Al Faraj drags Salman to ground down near the flag and Egypt win a free-kick that might as well be a corner. Mo Salah drives it in low and fails to clear the first man. He’ll be disappointed with that, Clive.53 min: Saudi Arabia continue to dominate possession but look a little short of ideas on how best to use it. This is unlikely to go down as one of this World Cup’s better encounters, although I’d be delighted to be proved wrong over the next half hour or so. 49 min: Saudi Arabia are dominating the early stages of this second half. As things stand, they’ll finish bottom of the group on goal difference, behind Egypt. They win a corner, which Al Faraj takes long. Warda clears. He replaced El Said in the Egyptian ranks near the end of the first half, I’m told.47 min: Saudi Arabia get forward and Hattan Bahebri shoots weakly at Essam Elhadary from a tight angle. 46 min: Saudi Arabia get the ball rolling again with no changes on either side. Meanwhile at the Samara Arena, Uruguay lead Russia 2-0 and have a man extra after Russia’s Igor Smolnikov was sent off in the first half for two bookable offences. Half-time admin: Ali Gabr was booked was booked for the tug on Al Mulwallad that gave Saudi Arabia their second penalty of the game.Peep! A half that was fairly low on quality ends in controversy, with referee Wilmar Perez taking an age to decide whether or not to award the penalty with which Salman Al Faraj cancelled out Mo Salah’s opener. Saudi Arabia had an earlier spot-kick saved, with Esam Elhadary celebrating his new status as the oldest player in World Cup history with an agile e that belied his 45 years.Salman Al Faraj sends the goalkeeper the wrong way and blasts the ball down the left. That penalty looked a little harsh too - Fahad Al Mulwallad and Ali Gabr both had a hold of each other’s shirts as the Saudi striker went to ground. 45+4 min: Perez is consulting his screen on the sideline, presumably on the recommendation of the VAR officials. He’s taken three minutes so far but he’s sticking with his verdict. Penalty for Saudi Arabia.46+1 min: There’s a shove on Al Mulwallad by Ali Gabrin the Egypt penalty area and Wilmar Perez blows his whistle again.45 min: We’ll have three minutes of added time. Elhadary is fit to resume play for Egypt.43 min: That’s a great save from Elhadary and he appears to have hurt himself him making it. He’s currently down getting treatment. Truth be told, it was a harsh decision to award the spot-kick in the first place. Al Sharahani was crossing from the left and the ball hit the trailing arm of full-back Ahmed Fathi, who was running back to block. Did the ball hit his hand? Yes. Was there any intent or awareness? None whatsoever. Nevertheless, Wilmar Perez blew his whistle and pointed to the spot and the lads in VAR Towers chose not to overturn the decision. What a save from Essam Elhadary, who celebrates becoming the oldest player in World Cup history by saving Fahad Al Mulwallad’s penalty kick. He es to his right and knocks the ball off the crossbar and back into play. Super agility from the 45-year-old.Referee Wilmar Perez spots a handball in the Egypt area and points to the spot. It’s going to VAR.36 min: Salman Al-Faraj is pulled up with a pull-back from the byline and unleashes a rasping drive. Ahmed Hegazi blocks his shot and the ball goes out for a corner. Nothing comes of it. 35 min: Trezeguet (aka Mahmoud Hassan) goers close again, curling the ball narrowly wide of the far post again. 33 min: Salah and Treziguet combine beautifully outside the Saudi penalty area and the latter tees up the former with an insouciant flick of his foot. From distance, Treziguet proceeds to curl a decent effort narrowly high and wide of the angle of post and crossbar. 31 min: Ahmed Faithi puts the ball out for a Saudi corner. The out-swinger drops deep for Hussain Al Mogahwi at the back post. He passes to Yasser Al Shaarani, who shoots high over the bar.28 min: Egypt win a free kick in a good position, which Said Abdalla curls into the Saudi penalty area. Rather unconvincingly, Almosailem punches clear when he could have just caught the ball. 28 min: Meanwhile at the Samara Arena, Uruguay have taken a two-goal lead over Russia and look like they’ll be topping the group. You can follow that one with Jacob Steinberg. 25 min: Salah misses a glorious chance to put his team two up. Put through on goal one-on-one with Yasser Almosailem once again, he chip the ball over the keeper once again, but can only watch in horror as it bounces wide of the right upright. Most Liverpool fans would have put the farm on their Egyptian superstar scoring that one.23 min: That was a wonderful finish from Salah, who sprinted between two defenders to latch on to a long, bouncing ball from deep. He controlls the ball beautifully with his first two touches before lifting it over the onrushing goalkeeper with his third. He wheels away in celebration as the ball bounces into the net. The delivery from Said Abdalla was superb too. Egypt lead and it’s through Mo Salah.20 min: Mo Salah is flagged for offside after getting in behind the Saudi defence to chase a nicely weighted through-ball. Motaz Hawsawi got the better of him again, stepping forward to ensure Salah was caught offside on the back of his mistimed run. 18 min: Mo Salah turns on his afterburners and gallops down the right touchline after a long ball. Motaz Hasawi pulls off the impressive feat of beating Mo for speed and plays the ball back to his goalkeeper. Good defending. 17 min: On ITV, Iain Dowie is on co-comms and it is his belief that Egypt are playing too defensively. He suggests they move one of their sitting midfielders, Mohamed Elneny or Tark Ahmed, further up the pitch.16 min: Good play from Salem Al Dawsari, who goes on a mazy run from halfway before unleashing a shot from the edge of the penalty area. After all his hard work it’s a lame effort and the Saudi Arabia man blast the ball high over the bar.13 min: THere’s a break in play as Marwan Mohsen changes his boots after kicking the ground behind the ball – rather than the ball itself – as he attempted a shot on goal. That’s quite a miscue. 11 min: Saudi Arabia continue to dominate, but there’s not much in it. Salem Al Dawsari tries a shot from distance but his effort is high and wide of Essam Elhadary’s goal. 10 min: Meanwhile at the Samara Arena, Uruguay have gone a goal up against Russia courtesy of a Luis Suarez free-kick. 9 min: Salman Al Faraj sends in an outswinger, which Ahmed Hegazi thumps clear with a powerful header. 7 min: Fairly scrappy stuff so far between two poor quality teams struggling to find their rhythm. The Saudi’s attack down the left flank with Salem Al Dawsari on the ball, cutting inside. The ball’s crossed and Ahmed Hegazi heads it out for the first corner of the game. 5 min: Saudi Arabia attack through the centre and Hattan Behebri tries to prod the ball in behind the Egypt defence for Fahad Al Mulwallad to chase. He mistimes his pass and a promising looking attack breaks down.4 min: Egypt attack down the right flank with Mo Salah on the ball. He attempts to send a cross towards Treziguet at the far post, but his delivery is poor. Saudi Arabia clear.2 min: Saudi Arabia start on the front foot, getting forward into Egypt territory with right-back Mohammed Alburayk on the ball in Egypt territory. He plays the ball up the line and Egypt clear their lines.1 min: Egypt kick off, their players wearing white shirts, black shorts and white socks. Saudi Arabia’s players wear green shirts, shorts and socks. Game on! Not long now: The teams emerge from the tunnel moments after I realise I had originally listed this match as being played at the Samara Arena, rather than its equivalent in Volgograd. It’s a good job I’m writing this report from a minute-by-minute bunker in London. We’re just one Egyptian national anthem and a coin-toss from kick-off. This just in: Egypt have apologised for an incorrect team sheet which appeared to leave Liverpool star Mohamed Salah out of their starting line-up to face Saudi Arabia. Salah has been struggling with a shoulder injury suffered in the Champions League final in May and is also reported to be considering quitting international football due to his unhappiness at being used for political ends by the federation and politicians in Chechnya, where the team have been based.But his omission appears to have been nothing more than human error, with an apology being issued after the original team sheet included Amr Warda instead of Salah. Goalkeeper Essam El Hadary, 45, was included and will become the oldest player ever to feature in a World Cup finals. We’ll have the full line-ups for just as soon as the Egyptian officials correct their clerical error. PA Sport.You want added needle? Of course you do. While there may be nothing more than pride at stake today, there’s plenty of that exact commodity to play for. This is the first ever all-Arab derby at the World Cup finals, although a good lawyer might argue that Saudi Arabia’s matches against Morocco (1994) and Tunisia (2006) fit that particular bill.A potential record-breaker: Should he feature at an point today, Egypt goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary will become the oldest player in World Cup history at 45 years and 161 days old. The record is currently held by former Colombia goalkeeper, Faryd Mondragon, who played at Brazil 2014 as a 43-year-old. Former Cameroon striker Roger Milla was the record-holder before Mondragon, having played at USA 94 when he was 42. Northern Ireland’s Pat Jennings, England’s Peter Shilton and Italy’s Dino Zoff have all kept goal in the World Cup aged 40 or over. Zoff is the oldest player ever to win the World Cup, having skippered Italy to victory at Spain 1982 when he was 40.Our Experts’ Network: Commissioned and published before the tournament started, events may have overtaken our informative and insightful team profiles, but they remain a handy pointer to what we can expect from both teams. Volgograd is the venue for a game in which both sides are playing for little more than pride after losing their first two matches. Uruguay and Russia have already secured passage to the knockout stages and will play simultaneously in Samara to decide who tops the group. Saudi Arabia and Egypt will be hoping to exit the tournament on a winning note and with the pressure off, here’s hoping we get a good contest. Kick-off is at 3pm (BST), but stay tuned for team news and build-up in the meantime."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16f3cee40018e6845fed8c5150d827bdf0577568/62_32_1424_854/master/1424.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b57e4a321c352c3dcbeb19b63e4ef5ff","title":"world cup 2018 groups a and b get set for finales live","story":"Reports that Sergio Agüero could be dropped against Nigeria, Jefferson Farfan set to miss Peru’s final game after a bad injury and moreAnd with that, we are duhn.“If you are still looking for dreadful (but in their own way brilliant) hat-tricks, then Lineker’s for Barcelona against Real Madrid in 1987 is the Daddy,” emails Mark Meadowcroft. “One from a throw in, one from a rebound, the third an assist from the goalkeeper. All three finished with him on his backside. What a stunningly good striker he was. No luck in any of them. A world class player in his time and this is his legacy at Barca.”Some of the best goals he ever scored, those. News: it appears that ITV have been punished for their totally irrational lack of faith in the national team: More than 14m people watched England’s World Cup victory over Panama on Sunday afternoon, one of the biggest TV audiences of the year.There were a further 2.8m requests for live streams of the match across the BBC’s website and 250,000 people watched it after the match on on-demand.The audience for the Panama match was down on the peak audience of 18.3m who watched the side’s opening win against Tunisia, which was broadcast on a Monday night. However, both matches were easily among the biggest TV audiences of the year.Television audiences have been in steady decline for many years but the World Cup, along with the royal wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, has shown large numbers of Britons are still willing to tune in for big live events.England’s final group match against Belgium will be shown live on ITV on Thursday night. The commercial broadcaster also has first choice on which games to show in the round of 16, meaning it is highly likely they will also show England’s first match in the knockout round.Not at the World Cup news: reports in Italy suggest that Radja Nainggolan has completed his medical and will soon move from Roma to Inter.Did I say Vibes? I believe I did, and from there we have but one one possible segue.“Is it just me, or are people getting a bit too excited about England’s win over Panama?” emails Bryan Tissinger.  “First, Panama is one of the worst, if not THE worst team in the tournament. Second, England scored one legitimate goal from open play against Panama – the others were two penalties, two set-pieces, and a fluke goal. I saw a stat that Kane received only 12 passes all match. That is not a recipe for success against any decent team.”Most people I know are quite sensible about it. I think the first 30 minutes against Tunisia tells you more about England, and no team will fancy facing their attackers, nor doing the running you’ll need to do against them. And goals from set-pieces are as legit as any other goals - again, teams will be trepidatious whenever England get a corner against them because they know they’ll be looking to score. In short, England probably won’t win the World Cup and might well lose to the first decent side they play, but have the firepower to sort anyone.I’ve got football withdrawal symptoms. 86 minutes and 24 seconds to go. Yellow ticker: Mohamed Salah will not start for Egypt today but goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary will, thus becoming the World Cup’s oldest-ever player, aged 45. “It’s a fair point in general,” emails Benedict Dries-Jenkins with regard to earlier Madrid discussion, “though I do think that, as understandable as it may be, Kroos’ wondergoal has glossed over the fact that his general performances in the first two games have been quite poor. Marcelo was also all over the place against Switzerland, and not in a good way...”That’s kind of the point, though. Madrid aren’t the most cohesive team ever, but they have the inidual brilliance to do the necessary at the crucial moment, just as Kroos did. Bad news: Jefferson Farfan will miss Peru’s game against Australia after sustaining what his manager called a “traumatic brain injury” in training. “Farfan collided with a team-mate during a training session and we were very concerned,” Gareca said in his pre-match press conference. “He was unconscious for a couple of minutes. The player received all the medical assistance required. “He is OK but it was a scare. He is doing well. Unfortunately he cannot play tomorrow but the most important thing is he is recovering and will get well. There are some protocols in terms of recovery of a player so that means it is mandatory for a player to remain in hospital for 72 hours until he is stabilised. He could be released from hospital but we understand the healthcare of the the players is priority. We have to be very grateful for the immediate attention of the medical team and extremely grateful for Russia for being so well prepared for this kind of event.” “I guess “Vermaelen v Welbeck, lip smacking!” is a reference to this?” emails James Errington.Yes, I know you’re vexed about the football that isn’t on your screen, but we’re about ready to start contemplating this afternoon’s entertainment. My guess is that we’ll see few goals: Russia need a rest after their lungbusting efforts while Uruguay will uruguay for they are Urguay. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia and Egypt just aren’t good enough to score any goals. Oooh yeah. Here’s Jacob Steinberg’s World Cup Fiver. Try not to get too excited.“Vermaelen v Welbeck, lip smacking!” enthuses Dan Friedman aren’t we all, with this weather we’re having. “Just like the battle of the Arsenal keepers yesterday which current reserve keeper Ospina won easily despite FA Cup Szczesny not making any obvious Caballeros.”It looked a lot like he was keen to though, and it’s the thought that counts. And as it goes, I thought Khadim N’Diaye’s effort from yesterday was almost as good – I was extremely taken with how he fruitlessly flew back following the initial error. I was less taken with what this meant for my betting slip. I wonder what will happen to Lingard next season, though. If Mourinho is desperate to include Matic every game, with Fred and Pogba also around, there’s no midfield space, so he might need to play from the right. He’s capable of it, but a decent right-back would make it much easier. Jesseh Lingard, then. There’s still plenty of work to do - he has a tendency to disappear from games, and needs more consistency in his finishing of easy chances. But he makes the players around him play better, has excellent pace and movement, can do special things, and isn’t scared. Alex Ferguson, Louis van Gaal, Rio Ferdinand, Paul Scholes, Jose Mourhino and Gareth Southgate all rate him - it might not matter so much that your daboyfriendyou don’t. “Re your last post about Madrid players performing well, tweets Mike Emery. “The Man Utd players are also doing surprisingly well. Lukaku, Lingard, Young, Pogba. All except De Gea, oddly.”Yes, that’s true. Lukaku is benefitting from proper service, while Lingard has been helped by playing in his position against miserable opposition. All of that lot have plenty to prove when things get real next week. An interesting element of this World Cup is how well the Real Madrid players are playing, because Madrid are great on the basis of great players rather than any great team cohesion. This does not make them less great, it simply makes them different, and the interventions of Kroos, Modric and Ronaldo have amplified that.“Can’t wait for Phil Jones vs Michi Batshuayi when Europe’s heavyweights battle it out later this week,” tweets Dan Friedman. I’m more into Thomas Vermaelen v Daniel Welbeck, which will take us right back to good old 2011.I’d love to see full-strength England v full-strength Belgium. I’m not certain England could get close to De Bruyne in midfield, and I also fancy Lukaku wouldn’t mind facing England’s back-three. But I don’t think any team will relish facing England’s attackers, nor the running they’d be forced to do. Roselaar has tweeted to let us know that: “Belgian press reporting Belgium will field ‘B team’ against England: replacements for Vertongen (yellow card), Meunier (yellow card), De Bruyne (yellow card), Lukaku, Hazard and Mertens.Fair enough. Annoying, but fair enough. “Hi Daniel,” begins Antonio Andre. “Spain and Morocco actually share more than the Melilla land border. “The City of Ceuta is also a Spanish enclave surrounded by Moroccan territory.”Ah. I appear to know more about penny sweets sold in the newsagents of north west London than I do about important geographical facts. When was the last time the World Cup was won by the country which looked the best in the group stages? 1990 perhaps, when Germany started by handing Yugoslavia one of the great trouncings.If Game of Thrones vibe is your thing.Apparently Sergio Aguero, Argentina’s only goalscorer so far, will be dropped for the crucial game against Nigeria. this punishment for trying to get the manager sacked. Yeah, who are players to have an opinion on who (mis)manages them? Apparently, Angel di Maria and Ever Banega will also play instead of Marcos Acuna and Enzo Perez, while Willy Caballero has also been dropped in case he tries a dink pass that costs a goal again. “Why didn’t Kyle Walker get himself booked yesterday?” asks Richard Powell. “Can already see Phil Jones’s gurning face as he brings down CoutinhoNeymarÖzilReus in the box in last minute of the quarter final.”Yeah, but England will be 1966-0 up by then, so not to worry. “Here in Norway NRK have women as their summariser,” emails Bob O’Hara, “and it doesn’t seem at all odd. Now Jan Mølby summarising in Danish still with his Scouse accent that sounds strange.”On which point, enjoy this on his lost and found goal against Manchester United by Gregg Bakowski.Lessons for ignoramii: “Spain and Morocco share a land border,” tweets @nikiforenko666, and indeed they do. I am now cognisant of the Melilla fence. How should England go about the Belgium game? My guess is they’ll leave out anyone carrying a knock or on a yellow card, but otherwise will set about it. Here’s Stuart James on Belgium’s weakness out wide.YELLOW TICKER: Sky are now interviewing a child with a John Stones mask on, pretending to be John Stones. For those less well-versed in Portuguese than me, this is Ronaldo asking Iran fans to keep it down, as he’s trying to sleep. Yeah, that’ll work. Sky Sports News have just called Spain v Morocco a “local derby”. Which it almost is: the Straits of Gibraltar are 8.9 miles wide, so I think we’d have to shed the “local”, but otherwise the countries are far closer than, say, Watford and Luton of Fordshire derby fame. I could while away the hours Conferrin’ with the flowers, Consulting with the rain.Alternatively, I could do this, and so could you. “Re Talksport,” emails Christian Storm, “they should be reminded that John Motson literally squeaked his way through his last couple of years commentating and nobody batted an eyelid. Also, I’m very hungover at my desk and accidentally played this clip. Now everybody is looking.”Nah, they were looking at you already and still are. They can taste the self-loathing. “What I don’t get, is how or why some of the players seem to wear long sleeves or even an extra layer under their shirts,” emails Matt Salter.“When I played in AJY U-12s for Barnet Shul, it didn’t matter if there was ice on the ground, our manager made us wear short sleeves with no vests and said that way we would run more to keep warm (he was a nice guy, really was). But these internationals are playing in 30 degrees heat and still some of them with long sleeves and other layers.What’s that about?”I too am an alumnus of the AJY league. I think it was there I developed my passion for beaten teams crying at full-time. As for your question, I wonder if part of it is nipple-protection, and I also think that some of the undergarments offer a circulatory benefit. As we know, marginal gains beat talent and doping every time. So: was Harry Kane’s hat-trick the stuffiest ever scored? Others worthy of a shout: "},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/88b6a05d06748b6955e4595fba33ad58f66c603d/39_0_2922_1754/master/2922.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=2c522e848faec2b1ace42abadd38c0bf","title":"world cup 2018 uruguay v russia live","story":"77 min: Torreira goes down holding his right ankle. He was caught by Kuzyaev.76 min: Dzyuba reminds me of Nikola Zigic, which isn’t a compliment.74 min: A dismal clearance from Muslera goes straight to Zobin. The midfielder advances under pressure and rolls a pass to the right for Dzyuba, who cuts on to his left foot before slicing a shot high and wide, in the style of a man who’s never kicked a ball before.73 min: Nahitan Nandez makes way for Cristian Rodriguez.71 min: Dzyuba goes down after being caught in the face by a zesty aerial challenge from Godin. That’s some Uruguayan retribution for the big man. The VAR checks for a penalty, but Godin isn’t penalised.70 min: Dzuyba is a foul machine, a comedy oaf up front. He’s just giving away free-kicks all the time. 69 min: Desperate for a goal, Cavani saunters down the left, cuts into the area and bangs a shot miles wide. Oh Edinson.64 min: Nandez scoots inside and slips a pass through to Cavani, who falls over when Ignashevich comes near him. No penalty.63 min: Giorgian De Arrascaeta replaces Rodrigo Bentancur, who was on a booking.60 min: Fyodor Smolov replaces Aleksei Miranchuk. Russia are out of changes.59 min: Bentancur bustles in from the right, outmuscling Zobnin, and sees a shot blocked after combining with Caceres. Then he picks up a booking for clattering into Zobnin.56 min: Russia are exerting a bit of pressure. Uruguay are having a snooze. At least it’s keeping the locals engaged.52 min: A free-kick to Russia on the right. The volume rises. Not for the first time, though, Samedov launches it into orbit.50 min: They could probably blow up for full-time now.47 min: Cavani, yet to open his account, whacks the free-kick into the wall.46 min: Urugusay get the game underway. Russia have made another change, bringing on Daler Kuzyayev for Gazinskii, who was on a booking. Uruguay are soon off pursuit off another goal, though, and it’s not long before Suarez has won a free-kick 25 yards from goal.“Very little discussion of who Iran would like to play, I’d point out,” Joseph Harvey says. “I assume Russia.”Point taken. But I will be surprised if they beat Cristiano Ronaldo.Peep! Peep! Uruguay are cruising thanks to Luis Suarez’s free-kick, Denis Cheryshev’s own goal and Igor Smolnikov’s red card. They’re on course to win Group A at Russia’s expense.45 min: There will be two added minutes.44 min: “Taking off Cheryshev is surely a sign that Russia are throwing in the towel on this one now, and preserving their best player for the last 16 instead of trying to chase a 2-0 deficit with 10 men,” says Christopher Clough. “Probably a decent decision, even though I reckon whoever plays Spain rather than Portugal is at a massive disadvantage.”42 min: Uruguay are playing keep ball. This could become very boring.39 min: “I would argue that finishing runner-up is better for Russia as their next game will be played in Moscow, as opposed to the winner of the group playing in Sochi,” Bill O’Leary says. “Plus, there isn’t a whole lot of difference between Spain and Portugal at present.”This feels like an optimistic reading at the moment.37 min: Torreira overhits the free-kick. 36 min: Laxalt tears down the left flank and he has far too much pace for the Russian right-back, who slides to chop the Uruguayan down. That’s a second booking. Russia are down to 10 men. Can they get Toni Kroos to play for them?31 min: Ronaldo could wrap up the Golden Boot if Portugal get Russia in the last 16.29 min: Suarez is outpaced by the 148-year-old Ignashevich.28 min: Smolnikov picks up a booking for fouling Vecino. Russia are in danger of imploding. Moments later Bentancur’s racing through the middle of Russia’s non-existent defence after a fine pass from Suarez. He tries to slip the ball under Akinfeev, who stands firm! The ball squirms clear, but Cavani can’t force the rebound home and Russia somehow survive. But they’re flirting with humiliation here.27 min: I’m certain that was a Cheryshev own goal. Laxalt will claim it but the replay suggested the shot was going wide. 26 min: Two set-pieces, two goals. Uruguay are stealing England’s thunder! This is identity theft!Torreira’s corner’s headed away and reaches Laxalt on the edge of the Russia area. Laxalt takes a touch and then lets fly with his left foot. The shot looks to be heading wide - until it hits Cheryshev’s heel and spins low to Akinfeev’s right! That is mightily unfortunate, not that Uruguay care.Cancel the tournament. 23 min: Dzuyba heads Torreira’s free-kick behind for a Uruguay corner.22 min: Suarez wins a free-kick on the right, Kudriashov pushing him.19 min: Cheryshev, who’s a very positive presence on the left, drives at Uruguay again and tries to send in a cross. The ball skews behind. Off a Uruguayan? The referee doesn’t think so. Goal-kick.17 min: Russia win a corner on the left. Cheryshev swings it in and Dzuyba’s header bounces over. He’d been penalised for a foul, though.15 min: Amid all the talk of trying to plot a path to the final in the knockout stages, the start to this game feels instructive from an English perspective. For all the arguments about why it would be beneficial to throw the Belgium game in order to avoid Brazil or Germany in the last eight, another way of looking at it is that it would be dangerous to lose momentum. Uruguay are Russia are just playing instead of wondering.14 min: The Russian corner comes to nothing.12 min: Back come Russia, looking for an instant response. A long ball’s sent to the left and Dzyuba nods it down to the edge of the area, where Cheryshev arrives to smack a shot straight at Muslera. The goalkeeper punches it out and the ball’s scrambled behind for a corner.This is magnificent. The free-kick is inside the D, inches outside the area. Ignashevich and Cavani are jostling and pushing on the edge of the wall. They’re slightly blocking Akinfeev’s view. Ignashevich ends up pushing Cavani, but he goes with the Uruguay striker and that opens up the space for Suarez to belt a low, right-footed shot firmly into the bottom-left corner! You always sensed that Russia were in trouble. As it stands, Uruguay are winning the group.What a free-kick from Suarez!9 min: Russia put themselves in a hole, a desperately poor pass from Samedov sending Suarez haring down the left. The striker cuts inside and tries to pick Cavani out in the middle. The cross is cut out - but the ball runs to Bentancur, who’s brought down by Gazinskii on the edge of the area. The Russian’s booked. And...8 min: The Samara Arena is in a state of pure frenzy. The noise! The Russian fans are up for this. It’s going to be difficult for Uruguay to keep their cool in this atmosphere.6 min: Sam Matterface is commentating for ITV. I’ve texted Jason Cundy for his opinion on Sam.2 min: Uruguay seem to have lined up in a back four rather than a three. It’s another deceptive teamsheet! This will be debated for days and days on Twitter, no doubt. Enough of that, though. Here come Uruguay, pinching the ball in Russia’s half. Cavani plays it to Vecino, who drills a low shot wide from 25 yards.Peep! Russia, all in white, kick off from right to left. Uruguay are in light blue shirts and black shorts and there’s a rare old atmosphere. Ros! Si! Ya! Ros! Si! Ya!We’ve had the anthems. The locals enjoyed belting out Russia’s. The game will begin imminently.Here come the teams, marching out at a hot and sunny Samara Arena! “There is a Uruguayan comedian Darwin Desbocatti who describing Coates playing for the national team said that he was like a hand gun in your glove compartment, you are really hoping not having to use it but in some circumstances it can save your life,” Claudia Alen says.“I first saw Sebastián Coates at the 2011 Copa América,” Kari Tulinius says. “He looked like he was going to be an legend of centre back, but it never quite worked out for him in England. He’s always been good for Uruguay, though.”An email! “For some reason I thought Sebastian Coates was Portuguese,” says JR in Illinois. “That’s pretty much all my thoughts regarding this game. I am looking forward to Luis Suarez biting someone again but I know it is extremely unlikely in a relatively meaningless game like this. Starting next round though the odds of him sinking his chompers into someone go way up. Ramos and Pepe are very bite-able.”JR, why not scour our team guides?Russia run a lot. Here’s some pre-match reading courtesy of Andrew Roth.The other game in Group A is Egypt v Saudi Arabia. You can follow the dead rubber here.Uruguay have changed their system, opting for a 3-5-2. Maybe that will give them more fluidity in attack. They’ve also changed personnel, with Sebastian Coates, Diego Laxalt, Lucas Torreira and Nahitan Nandez in for Guillermo Varela, Jose Gimenez, Carlos Sanchez and Cristian Rodriguez.Russia make three changes to the side that beat Egypt. Igor Smolnikov is in for Mario Fernandes, Fedor Kudriashov replaces Yuri Zhirkov, 83, and Aleksey Miranchuk makes his World Cup debut after stepping in for Aleksandr Golovin.Hello. Not much to see here, to be brutally honest. Both of these sides are already through to the round of 16, Russia after crushing Saudi Arabia and Egypt, Uruguay after George Grahaming their way to a couple of forgettable 1-0 victories. You never know, 1-0 to the Uruguay could yet become the chant of the 2018 World Cup.Russia, of course, will be hoping to become the first side to breach Oscar Tabarez’s defence. The hosts have hit eight goals in their first two matches, which makes them as good as England, and they’re feeling much better about themselves than they were before the start of the tournament. It’s easy to forget how little Russian fans expected from their team, whose form before this all got going had been utterly wretched.Funny what 90 minutes in the company of Saudi Arabia can do for the confidence – but the reality check could be on the way. Uruguay haven’t exactly flowed yet, but they do have Edinson Cavani, Luis Suarez and enviable street smarts when it comes to tournament football. This is a step up in class for Russia and we’ll have a much better idea of their true level after a match that will decide who finishes top of Group A. Russia’s goal difference means they’re in the driving seat at the moment, but Uruguay will overtake them with a win.It’s likely to be competitive, especially as the team in second will probably have to play Spain next. Mind you, the team in first will probably have Cristiano Ronaldo for company in the next round. Where am I going with this? I don’t know. Back in a minute, I’m off to consult my wallchart.Kick-off: 3pm BST, 5pm in Samara."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e7b4b3b6cd9a972b1cee26ed4c53d0b38fedb36d/0_214_2480_1488/master/2480.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6b9d5295c3a052366fec6d408969ca71","title":"what is it really like to be a parent share your experiences","story":"We’d like to hear how parents feel about the way their children have affected their livesIt can feel like parenting is harder now than it used to be.

Blanch the sliced potatoes in the boiling water for about two to three minutes, until they have lost their rawness but still hold their shape. Drain and leave to steam dry, then toss with the thyme, some salt and pepper, and a couple of tablespoons of olive oil.Lay the flatbreads on a baking tray and heat the oven to 200C390Fgas 6. Spread the creme fraiche or ricotta over the breads, top with the onions, then the potatoes, and finish with a good grating of parmesan.Cook for eight to 10 minutes, until everything has melted together. I start making this salad when the asparagus and new potatoes arrive in May, and stop when the nights begin to draw in. The vegetables change with the season, but this version is my favourite – one that makes the most of the best tomatoes and runner beans. The key to this salad is the sharp dressing, which mellows as it hits the vegetables. Pour it over the potatoes while they are warm, crushing them a little so the dressing flavours them all the way through.500g new potatoesFlaky sea salt4 eggs100g kalamata olives1 small cucumber300g mixed ripe tomatoes2 tbsp baby capers300g runner or green beans, topped and tailed and cut on the diagonal into 3cm piecesA few sprigs of dill and parsley, leaves picked and roughly choppedLemon zest (optional)For the dressing3 tsp dijon mustard2 tsp wholegrain mustard4 tbsp olive oil3 tbsp white-wine vinegar1 tsp runny honeyPut the new potatoes into a medium saucepan with a generous pinch of salt and cover with lots of cold water – you need a good amount of water as you will be adding other things to the pan later. Bring to a boil, then leave to simmer for 12–20 minutes (depending on their size).In another small pan, bring some salted water to a rolling boil, add the eggs and cook for six minutes, so the middles are only just set if you’d like them hard-boiled, cook for one minute more. Run the cooked eggs under cold water for 30 seconds, then crack the shell on a hard surface and leave to cool.Meanwhile, make the dressing by whisking together all the ingredients, then taste and season. You want it to be quite punchy, because it will mellow when it hits everything else.Pit the olives and rip them in half. Slice the cucumber thickly. Roughly chop the tomatoes into different sized pieces and season well with salt. Put them all into a large bowl with the capers.When the potatoes are nearly cooked, add the beans to the pan and cook for the final three to four minutes. Drain everything and leave to steam dry in the colander. Once the potatoes have lost their moisture, add them to the bowl while they are still warm and pour over the dressing. Use the back of a spoon to crush them lightly, so they split and soak up some of the dressing.Peel the cooled eggs and cut into quarters, dot them around the bowl and finish with the chopped herbs and lemon zest, if using."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/983dd26cc7cb21ac94cd905ceec037f1a210a77a/0_0_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=01a36e9c0ba256d43f58f52ca7fd7493","title":"seven ways to strengthen your core","story":"Keeping these muscles in good condition will help you fend off a bad back – just make sure you mix it upA strong core isn’t about having photogenic abs, looking good in swimwear or grinding out another deadlift. It is a key element in dozens of everyday movements, including simple things such as carrying your shopping or getting out of bed in the morning. Many people know that a weak core can lead to a bad back, but the benefits of strengthening it are sometimes underappreciated. An analysis of studies published between 1970 and 2011, for instance, found that “core stability exercise was better than general exercise for reducing pain” in chronic low back pain patients. Given that back pain affects 540 million people globally, just five or 10 minutes a few times a week spent improving core strength is an excellent investment.Spine researcher Dr Stuart McGill at the University of Waterloo in Canada has spent his career studying back pain and its rehabilitation. He recommends a “big three” set of exercises. This consists of the curl-up, the bird dog (or quadruped) and the side bridge, all of which are low-intensity and suitable for almost everyone.Gyms usually offer short core-strength classes. Even if you much prefer exercising at home, it is always a good idea to make sure you are doing exercises correctly to avoid injury. Fitness apps such as Gixo and TrueBe use your smartphone camera to connect you to a trainer, so you can also have a one-off or “booster” PT session at home.Crunches and sit-ups were once the go-to core exercise for gymgoers and fitness routines. But these exercises are now thought to be quite hard on your back and to isolate muscles that would be better exercised in combination. Plank exercises – and other more dynamic movements – use more muscles at the front, side and back of your core. There are many different varieties, starting with the simple half plank – on your forearms and knees, rather than toes, maintaining a straight back. Longer is not always better: good form maintained for a small time is much better than bad form dragged out for minutes.Dead bugs are one of the simplest and most effective core exercises. Lie on your back with your arms extended, knees bent at 90 degrees, calves parallel to the floor. Keeping your lower back in contact with the floor, extend and lower your left leg and bring your right arm up. Tap your heel to the floor, return to the start and repeat with the opposite arm and leg, making sure your lower back never arches.Mixing it up is crucial, as is focusing on trying to keep your deepest abdominal muscles “engaged” – they are the ones you will feel when you cough. To add difficulty to a home routine, consider a TRX suspension trainer or a Swiss ball. These add a stability challenge to standard exercises. Others swear by pilates – although a Cochrane review suggested that, while it is effective, it is no more so than others form of exercise for pain and disability."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/0a256faab8539d949622c4d57e49114d162598d1/1468_315_1699_1019/master/1699.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=a1184709906421045d25cd5a2697ebfb","title":"jeremy hunt name curse strikes again at bbc","story":"Yet another broadcaster replaces crucial consonant in health secretary’s surname It is a verbal landmine that has gone off at Sky News, BBC Television and the BBC’s flagship morning radio show.And once again, Jeremy Hunt’s name has been taken in vain, with a presenter on the Today programme mispronouncing his surname by replacing a crucial consonant. Justin Webb made the error while reading out a story about the health and social care secretary during a review of newspaper coverage.“The paper says that health secretary Jeremy Cunt ... Hunt is understood to favour a cap on social care.”Responding later to a tweet asking why presenters on the programme couldn’t help replacing the H with a C, Webb claimed he had made an “important swerve”, suggesting he had left off the final “t”, but social media had already lit up.Another BBC broadcaster, Jim Naughtie, has previously recalled his colleagues on the Today programme throwing up their hands in mock surrender after an infamous slip of the tongue as he introduced the then culture secretary.Naughtie said the late BBC newsreader Rory Morrison had come to the rescue with a faultless delivery of the morning news bulletin that followed the gaffe in December 2010.Other broadcasters to have made the same slip over Hunt’s surname include the Sky News health and science correspondent Thomas Moore, the BBC political journalist Ellie Price and the Sky anchor Claudia-Liza Armah."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c235dcf7dc166efa0f40a6059f9e904c56192fcf/271_333_2629_1577/master/2629.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=ba01812f3db9df97dd0173cc4426fbbf","title":"lewis hamilton sebastian vettel lives on line f1 french grand prix","story":"• Vettel collided with Valtteri Bottas at F1 French Grand Prix• ‘We’re not pootling around, we’re putting our lives on the line’Lewis Hamilton has conceded the crash involving Sebastian Vettel and Valtteri Bottas at the start of the French Grand Prix was a racing incident and not indicative of the German being prone to error under pressure.Hamilton, who won Sunday’s race, criticised the decision to give Vettel only a five-second penalty for causing the collision but admitted such incidents will happen when drivers are pushing to the limit.The Mercedes driver led from pole at Paul Ricard but Vettel, who made a quick start from third had nowhere to go into turn one and clipped the rear of Bottas’s car. Hamilton’s team-mate sustained a puncture while Vettel had to replace his Ferrari’s rear wing. Enforced stops dropped both drivers to the back of the field. Vettel finished fifth and Bottas seventh, a result that ensured Hamilton retook the lead of the world championship by 14 points.He had said the penalty had not been sufficient, given Bottas also took damage to the floor of his car, but said: “It is really a racing incident and those things can happen. We’re all going into that first corner at great speeds. We’re all on the edge, we’re fighting for world championships, we’re not pootling around, we’re out there putting our lives on the line, we’re out there putting the cars as far beyond the edge as we can in the safest manner. It’s not like a train track, you don’t just stay on the rails. Sometimes you can go off. We’re only human.”Vettel’s recovery was impressive but he would have been hoping for better than fifth before the race. “It didn’t feel or didn’t appear there was a lot I could have done differently,” he said. “I tried to get out of it. You don’t hit the brakes 200 metres before the corner just because you think it could be a bad spot to be in, you still try to be competitive.”Hamilton avoided the crash and proceeded to run a controlled and dominant race, with Max Verstappen’s Red Bull finishing second and Kimi Raikkonen’s Ferrari third.Hamilton said the race had again showed the current cars, which create major air turbulence, make overtaking difficult. “I think it’s the fundamental issue of the cars,” he said. “Max has to be 1.5 seconds faster than me to overtake, or more. Anything less than and he’s got no hope. I want to see more closer racing, not just at the start of the race, so I hope they are able to somehow figure that out.”F1 will instigate new aerodynamic rules for next season in an attempt to reduce dirty air to allow cars to follow one another more closely but the problem will reman this season.The teams head to Austria this weekend for the second round of the sport’s first triple-header before going to Silverstone for the British Grand Prix the following week.

Julian Savea’s confirmed move to Toulon (he is out of favour but has 46 Test tries) was another reminder of their greatest battle but in most positions there is remarkable depth and Scott Barrett was superb in the second row. Damian McKenzie is box office but his game management when called upon at No10 remains up and down. Still the team to beat by a distance though. Gerard MeagherConfirmation that they are, without question, the leading lights of the northern hemisphere. Such resilience to overcome the Wallabies in Sydney at the end of a quite breathtaking series and, indeed, season for Ireland. Joe Schmidt managed to rotate his squad to the extent that only Adam Byrne did not feature and still claim Ireland’s first series win in Australia for 39 years. The depth he is striking upon is formidable – particularly in the back-row – and while it feels almost mundane to mention their half-backs, Conor Murray and Johnny Sexton remain so integral. Not so long ago the standout fixture of the coming autumn was New Zealand’s trip to Twickenham, not any more. GMWales were flatlining while England moved to second in the world rankings, armed with two Six Nations titles, but as Warren Gatland approaches his final year in charge, he has probably never had a stronger squad. Summer victories over South Africa and Argentina in a two-Test series took them to third behind Ireland and New Zealand: still some distance to go, but they look equipped for the faster, more reactive game that Test rugby now demands. Gatland has options in most positions, no longer reliant on a group that has served him for most of the decade with many showing signs of wear and tear. Paul ReesEngland’s tour of South Africa had virtually everything. Fast starts, altitude sickness, sparkling tries, self-inflicted errors, belated redemption ... at times it felt like a giant game of snakes and ladders. No-one will ever know what would have happened had England prepared differently for the first two Tests at altitude their 2-1 series defeat was particularly harsh on Jonny May, whose form from start to finish was outstanding. Doubts still remain, however, about their consistent ability to dominate sides up front even when they are comfortably ahead on the scoreboard perhaps that will change if all their key men can report fit and fresh this autumn. The biggest conundrum remains Danny Cipriani. Even on a wet day in Cape Town unsuited to his creative talents he offered one fleeting moment of genius which could make the difference between England enjoying a successful World Cup or falling just short in Japan. He deserves to start again in November. RKGetting there. The first Test victory in Brisbane was a reminder that they will be some force by next year’s World Cup but discipline became an increasing problem as the series wore on and Kurtley Beale’s try in Melbourne was one of the few times they carved Ireland open. Will Genia was badly missed after his injury in the second Test and while Michael Cheika appears to still be raging, he knows his team are more or less on track. David Pocock fitted back in seamlessly. GMThis was South Africa’s most encouraging series for a while. It was not just the outcome: Faf de Klerk and Duane Vermeulen were both outstanding, coach Rassie Erasmus is clearly making a difference and, slowly but surely, the nation is falling back in love with the Springboks. To see Siya Kolisi become the first black African to captain the Boks in a Test match was one of the year’s most uplifting and significant sporting moments. They should approach the Rugby Championship with renewed confidence. Robert KitsonA comfortable victory over an Argentina side that showed little resistance in Resistencia meant a rare away victory over a tier one nation for Scotland, but it did not entirely make up for the previous week’s defeat to the United States. A year ago, Scotland lost in Fiji but went on to impress in the autumn and the Six Nations. They are behind their rivals when it comes to depth, but at full tilt they are getting there. PRReasons to feel hard done by in all three Tests against the All Blacks at the hands of officials and it is such a shame because in the first two they were competitive to say the least. The best defensive side of the Six Nations showed some of that resolve but still they do not look like one who can go for 80 minutes. If their upward curve can continue however, England will be genuinely concerned and amid all their injury problems, players such as Anthony Belleau have impressed. Fantastic to see Wesley Fofana back, too. GMFiji lost their final Test of the window, a surprise 27-19 defeat in Lautoka by Tonga – the first time they had lost to them since 2011. But, they were crowned Pacific champions for the fourth straight year the previous week when they beat Georgia 35-17 after defeating Samoa a week earlier and that was enough to lift them above the ailing Argentinian side.  sportAnother wretched series prompted the Pumas’ head coach, Daniel Hourcade, to resign. The Pumas were one of the stories of the 2015 World Cup, dumping their 10-man game and attacking from all over the pitch, but after the tournament they introduced a rule that said no one would be considered for selection if they were based outside the country. It has stifled competition for places and with Hourcade continuing to preach an expansive game, they became predictable and forgot what it took to win. PRThe United States’ victory over Scotland was the most impressive result this month for an emerging nation. Japan won the first Test against Italy, but given their superior position in the rankings, it was more of a surprise when they lost the following week before comfortably overcoming Georgia. The United States, who are in England’s World Cup group, defeated Russia, who will open next year’s World Cup against Japan, 62-13 a week before the Russians beat fading Canada by 23 points.

Hampshire and Yorkshire played out a draw at the Rose Bowl (one of the last places in the country you want to be at 10pm given its transport “links”) but anecdotal evidence suggests that very few people came in to watch the last session and far more did that traditional British thing of looking at their watches at about 7.30pm and saying: “Shall we go to the pub?” I had thought that pink-ball county cricket was largely a dry run for pink-ball Test cricket, but the issues involved in such matches are either settled or lie in the hands of the five-day game, so why hold day-night Championship matches in 2018?James Vince has his hundred at Old Trafford.

But let’s not think about that just yet. It’s going to be a peculiar round with five daynight games, a midday start here at Old Trafford on what looks like yesterday’s pitch while the stewards clean up after the ODI, and only two games staring at the prescribed hour: Glamorgan v Northants at Sophia Gardens and the game to be at – Yorkshire v Surrey at wonderful Scarborough. Those of you who are there – you lucky, lucky few. It would be hard to top the excitement of the last round, but fingers crossed in what is going to be a scorching week of weather.At aforementioned Scarborough, head of the table Surrey take on a Yorkshire side topping the stragglers in fifth. Surrey were magnificent at Guildford – young guns-a-roaring. Yorkshire come straight from the bore-fest at the Ageas – and with one fewer rest day. They are still missing seven players with either England or the Lions Surrey will be without Sam Curran, Jason Roy and Ben Foakes. Here at the Old Trafford dog-fight, Lancashire need a win to lift them from the doldrums with another couple of disastrous hours at New Road losing them the match against Worcestershire. There look like big changes a-foot with a very different-looking squad – Chanderpaul has been left out and Joe Mennie is missing - another concussion victim. Liam Livingstone and Parkinson are still away with the Lions. Hampshire, who play the Royal London Final on Saturday, are missing Liam Dawson. At Chelmsford, Essex and Somerset both come straight from a loss. Somerset are without Matt Renshaw, heading home after breaking a finger at Guildford, and Jack Leach, laid up for seven days after being hit on the head by Morne Morkel in the same game. Ryan ten Doeschate returns to the Essex captaincy after suspension.Stuart Broad returns at Trent Bridge for a bowl with the pink kookaburra in Nottinghamshire’s day-night game against Worcestershire.In Division Two, Derbyshire take on Leicestershire with the pink Dukes ball, and at The Riverside Durham play Warwickshire in another day-nighter. Warwickshire come from a brave run-chase, Ian Bell still in breathless form.Glamorgan meet Northamptonshire for the wooden-spoon match at Wantage Road and Kent, fresh from a wonderful win against Warwickshire, play Middlesex, also cock-a-hoop- after victory over Leicestershire. Sam Billings will resume the captaincy from Joe Denly, but Matt Henry and Darren Stevens are rested ahead of Lord’s. Middlesex remain without Nick Gubbins and Tom Helm on Lions duty – although Dawid Malan continues as captain."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f902ba3cbc6b779045543d3bef318621200dc897/416_785_6463_3877/master/6463.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=3a0689233912291a254cb5b58f5e62eb","title":"rachel parris comedian musical standup political satire mash show","story":"The whip-smart comic talks about mocking Piers Morgan and Donald Trump, mixing scorn with good cheer and moving from songs to satire‘Determined cheerfulness is something I happen to do very well,” says Rachel Parris. If you’ve seen her live musical comedy shows, you won’t need telling: they present Parris as a wholesome West End Wendy forever on the verge of a nervous breakdown, performing songs that put a brave face on a chaotic life (The Gym Song) or – like her terrific X Factor spoof I’m Amazing – clothe sharp satire in faux-positivity.No one who saw her excellent but unheralded stage shows ever doubted Parris’s talent, but it’s a big surprise that she’s now found her mainstream niche in political satire. Her whip-smart work on the BBC show The Mash Report has been adored – and deplored – by tens of millions, and she’s become one of the most prominent political comics in the UK and beyond.On the one hand, it’s a classic rags-to-riches story, from an act whose spring tour – tickets hitherto hard to shift – ended up playing to packed houses. On the other, Parris makes no bones about how unsettling the past few months have been. Judging by the number of times she says she doesn’t know if she’s allowed to answer my questions, she’s still adjusting to life under a new kind of scrutiny.The 34-year-old feels misrepresented by the widely told story of her breakout success. In February, her weekly Mash Report slot mocked Piers Morgan’s ITV interviewlove-in with the US president, replete with a graphic of the former’s tongue up the latter’s backside. It made a very big splash: “There was a lot of excitement and fury,” says Parris, euphemistically (I think she means hostility and hysteria), “directed at my door. And now everyone’s like, oh it was that item that blew everything up with The Mash Report. But it wasn’t. It was the sexual harassment one.” This was a heavily sardonic tutorial in How Not to Sexually Harass Someone that Parris co-wrote and performed (with host Nish Kumar as her stooge) two weeks before.That episode, she recalls, aired without fuss. But her life changed when the BBC tweeted her clip from it the following Monday morning. “Within three hours it had millions of views,” says Parris. “My phone was going ding ding ding ding. It all happened so quickly.” In both the harassment and the TrumpMorgan segments – and in later ones exploring the phenomenon of the public apology, say, or Jacob Rees-Mogg – Parris mixed scorn and butter-wouldn’t-melt good cheer into a highly potent satirical cocktail. Even in the first series, she says, “the joke was to have me reading out egregiously offensive or stupid social media output, and staying very upbeat while I did so”.Her success as a satirist has surprised her, too – although she insists on the small-p political content of her prior work, and its consistency with her Mash Report material. “Yes it’s about Jacob Rees-Mogg, but it’s also about how that affects feminism, women’s rights. For me, there’s always got to be a personal or social angle.”She’s delighted, meanwhile, to have shaken off the musical comedy label, which sees her patronised by fellow comics and has, Parris argues, kept her off panel shows. “Over the years, producers have said, ‘what would Rachel do on it? There isn’t a slot to do one of her songs.’ And it’s like: ‘No, I talk as well!’” No such problem any more: it’s amazing what a reported 26m online views can do. “Now, instead of having to fight to get in the audition room, people are – for the moment – coming and asking me if I want to be on.”That’s “a dream come true”, she says: her appearance on QI in particular. But she’s not abandoning live performance – with her colleagues in the Regency-era improv format Austentatious, resident monthly in the West End. Nor in her solo shows: she’s now cooking up a “greatest hits plus bits of The Mash Report” package to take on the road in autumn. It’s designed to break new fans in gently to what she’s been doing on stage for years. Otherwise, she says – drawing on recent experience – “the initial reaction is ‘why is Rachel Parris who does political satire trying to sing and play? Has she lost her mind?’”And then? Well, Parris is hoping for some calm after the storm (“I think things are going back to normal now …”), but by no means a return to obscurity. Her first half of 2018 “has changed the whole concept of a career path”, she says, “because what would have seemed like a pipe dream now seems possible”. Alongside the autumn tour, there’s series three of The Mash Report, due later this year. Beyond that, she nurses an ambition to emulate Tim Minchin’s transformation from comedian to musical-theatre maestro – and dreams of writing her own sitcom or Victoria Wood-style solo TV show. “Which all my instincts tell me is not going to happen,” says Parris, modest to a fault. “But after the year I’ve had, it now seems like – well, who knows?”"},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ff0d7f3285f0208251bdeb535131a170a7fe5bef/400_580_3903_2342/master/3903.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=1439e91fb03a402126f2ea90aac0184f","title":"apple appease customer free macbook keyboard repairs","story":"Company’s admission over faulty keyboards follows litany of complaints Apple has admitted that its MacBook and MacBook Pro laptop keyboards made since 2015 are susceptible to becoming stuck or breaking, and is promising to repair them for free.Following a litany of user complaints across support forums, specialist media, class action lawsuits and 31,000-strong online petitions, Apple said it had determined that a “small percentage of the keyboards” were affected by the issues.The keys can feel sticky and letters or characters can fail to appear when the key is pressed, or keys can repeat unexpectedly.Keys were found to be prone to becoming stuck when small amounts of dust and debris collected under them, leading to inoperable keyboards and irate users. A second iteration of the keyboard was launched in 2016, which also appears to be affected.“Apple or an Apple authorised service provider will service eligible MacBook and MacBook Pro keyboards, free of charge,” the company said in a new support document. “The type of service will be determined after the keyboard is examined and may involve the replacement of one or more keys or the whole keyboard.”The 12in MacBook made from early 2015 and the 13in and 15in MacBook Pros made from 2016 are covered by the repair programme up to four years from when they were purchased. Apple also said that consumers who had already paid for a repair could request a refund of the charges, which could have cost hundreds of pounds.This is the second time in 12 months that Apple has relented on support issues to attempt to appease customers and maintain brand loyalty. In December, it admitted to slowing down iPhones with ageing batteries and reduced the cost of its battery replacement programme.Market watchers welcomed the news in appeasing customers of Apple’s computer line. But Patrick Moorhead, the head of Moor Insights \u0026amp Strategy, said the issues simply illustrate just how loyal users were to Apple’s brand and platform. He said on Twitter: “Apple Keyboardgate demonstrating. Just how loyal and forgiving Mac users are.

On Monday morning, EPP MEPs held a free vote in an indication of the acute isions within the bloc. The European parliament has the power to trigger the EU’s little-used rule of law mechanism, known as article 7, but this was the first time it attempted to do so.The vote is only a first step a final decision to launch the procedure requires a two-thirds majority in the European parliament.If a majority of MEPs vote in September, ministers will be obliged to consider whether there is a serious and persistent breach of the EU’s basic democratic values in Hungary.The Dutch Green MEP Judith Sargentini had spent 13 months drafting a report to prepare for the unprecedented procedure. It is based on the work of many international organisations and raises 12 key concerns about the erosion of democracy in Hungary. The draft report highlights fears about the functioning of Hungary’s constitution, which has been amended six times since 2012. It also itemises concerns about the centralisation of justice, declining transparency over state funds and threats to freedom of expression and the right to equal treatment.“Close friends do not shy away from telling each other the unpleasant truth,” the report states. “Based on the process sketched above, your rapporteur sees the need to request the council to come forward with appropriate measures to restore inclusive democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights in Hungary.”The report was completed before the Hungarian parliament passed widely criticised anti-immigrant laws last week that made it a criminal offence punishable by a jail term to help people lodge asylum claims.The European commission is “now going to review the Hungarian legislation on migration to determine whether it is compatible with European rules”, a spokeswoman said last week.Hungary’s response was made plain in a radio interview during which Orbán lashed out at the commission for “pestering, pressuring and attacking Poland” and “attacking Hungary”.The EU triggered the rule of law process for the first time in 2017, when it took action against Poland for changes to the judiciary that international experts say threaten the rule of law.Poland’s EU affairs minister will appear before his 27 counterparts from the other member states at a hearing on Tuesday, where he will seek to counter the charge of a “systemic threat” to Polish democracy."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e1a8cb25e3fe23e77dda89c00ae569ded1571a6c/0_200_5184_3110/master/5184.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=6524e04b4d4be5f891053ff5131132be","title":"muharrem ince concedes defeat to erdogan in turkey elections","story":"CHP politician vows to continue fighting one-man rule in opposition during Ankara speechRecep Tayyip Erdoğan’s main challenger in Sunday’s elections, Muharrem İnce, has conceded defeat, urging the re-elected Turkish president to embrace all the country’s 81 million citizens and vowing to continue the fight against one-man rule in opposition.“I accept the election results,” İnce said at a press conference at his party’s headquarters, adding that despite some votes being stolen, the overall result was not in question. “We will live the consequences of having one-man rule in the legislature, judiciary and government. I will keep up the fight as someone who got the approval of one person among every three in Turkey.”Turkish voters re-elected Erdoğan to another term in office on Sunday in elections whose outcome is likely to shape the country for years or even decades to come. The president, who has already ruled Turkey unopposed for 16 years, will be sworn in to another five years in power, leading up to the centennial of the modern republic’s founding from the ashes of the Ottoman empire.Erdoğan will assume vast new powers narrowly approved in a referendum last year, including the power to appoint senior judges and unelected vice presidents, and to pass decrees with the force of law.He will face few checks on his power from a diminished parliament where the majority is a coalition that includes his ruling Justice and Development (AKP) party and the Nationalist Action Party (MHP), who performed surprisingly well, doubling their expected share of ballots.On 16 April 2017 Turkish voters narrowly approved a package of constitutional amendments granting President Erdoğan sweeping new powers.The amendments will transform the country from a parliamentary democracy into a presidential system – arguably the most significant political development since the Turkish republic was declared in 1923.Under the new system - which is not due to take affect until after elections in June – Erdoğan will be able to stand in two more election cycles, meaning he could govern as a powerful head of state until 2029.\u0026nbspThe new laws will notionally allow Erdoğan to hire and fire judges and prosecutors, appoint a cabinet, abolish the post of prime minister, limit parliament’s role to amend legislation and much more.The president\u0027s supporters say the new system will make Turkey safer and stronger. Opponents fear it will usher in an era of authoritarian one-man rule.\u0026nbspThe outcome of the vote is the culmination of years of Erdoğan’s pursuit of an executive presidency, a goal that has seen the Turkish leader ascend the highest echelons of power in the country while simultaneously crushing opponents, intimidating or co-opting dissident media outlets, and reprising a role as commander-in-chief protecting Turkey from external and internal enemies.Erdoğan struck a defiant tone in his victory speech early on Monday in Ankara, saying Turkey had set “an example” for the rest of the world, vowing to carry on military campaigns in Syria, fight terror groups and raise Turkey’s international prestige.“We have received the message that has been given to us in the ballot boxes,” he said. “We will fight even more with the strength you provided us with this election.”İnce, a former physics teacher, ran a dynamic campaign that energised an opposition movement that had struggled to find charismatic leaders to represent them. He campaigned on a platform to reverse the presidential system and return Turkey to parliamentary democracy, end the ongoing state of emergency, stop prosecutions of journalists and civil society members, restore the rule of law and send Syrian refugees back home to their country.He had sought to appeal to Erdoğan’s conservative base by emphasising his own religious credentials and vowing that the country’s secularists, if elected, would not discriminate against religious countrymen. His rallies in the major Turkish cities drew crowds of hundreds of thousands of supporters, culminating in one attended by at least one million people in Istanbul on Saturday.But in the end, İnce’s appeals led to a performance that showed he was more popular than his own party, the CHP, but was not enough to force a second-round runoff with Erdoğan. Polls showed İnce would likely lose such a race, but the prospect was seen as representing a major setback for the incumbent.İnce now appears a powerful enough figure to wrest control of the CHP in the wake of the race. He said his party made mistakes in the elections but declined to elaborate on them or say whether he would assume a role within it.He also denied rumours that had spread on social media overnight that he had been threatened into conceding the vote, due to the fact that he was not seen publicly for hours after polls closed on Sunday."},{"url":"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5b6b5a28bd5741a7c087415d67ef82243da3ab64/0_163_4852_2911/master/4852.jpg?w=620\u0026amp;q=55\u0026amp;auto=format\u0026amp;usm=12\u0026amp;fit=max\u0026amp;s=b7721be2e46cc82fa60ef101fbe7355f","title":"nine eu states to sign off on joint military intervention force","story":"Initiative is backed by the UK which will be allowed to participate after BrexitNine EU member states have agreed to establish a European military force for rapid deployment in times of crisis, an initiative which has won the backing of the UK as it seeks to maintain defence ties after Brexit.Spearheaded by the French president, Emmanuel Macron, the joint enterprise will allow national armed forces across Europe to coordinate and react swiftly together.Ministers from France, Germany, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, the Netherlands, Estonia, Spain and Portugal signed a letter of intent in Luxembourg on Monday.Since the election of its new government, Italy has backtracked on its initial support, but Rome has not ruled out the country’s future involvement.Macron had outlined his vision of strategic autonomy for European defence in a keynote Sorbonne speech last September.The development has caused some anxiety within Nato, where officials are concerned about any duplication of roles and distancing by European nations from the US.However, Nato’s secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, who was in Luxembourg for discussions on European security and defence before a summit of the military alliance in Brussels next month, told reporters: “I welcome this initiative as I believe it can strengthen the readiness of forces. We need high readiness that is exactly what Nato is now focusing on.“I just see this new initiative as something that can complement and actually reinforce the work which is ongoing in Nato to strengthened and increasing the readiness of our forces.”France’s defence minister, Florence Parly, told the newspaper Le Figaro on Sunday: “Defence Europe requires a common strategic culture … The deadlines and decisions in the EU are still much too long compared to the urgency that can arise from a critical situation in a country where Europeans would consider that there is a strong stake for their security.”The European Intervention Initiative is outside the EU’s structures, so will allow for full UK involvement after Brexit.At a separate meeting of ministers in Luxembourg, rules for military projects within the EU’s so-called Permanent Structured Cooperation on security and defence, or Pesco, were also signed off, although it is unclear as yet whether the UK will be allowed to take part.The rapid deployment force was initially due to be part of the Pesco arrangements, which have the goal of harmonising defence spending, hardware design and strategic planning, but concerns were raised in Paris that finding agreement among 28 member states in regard to time-sensitive events could prove difficult.The UK has traditionally been wary of efforts to build a European defence cooperation that could challenge Nato structures, but has become a champion of such initiatives since the vote to leave the EU.A French government source said the UK’s involvement was key, as the two military powers shared similar cultures and analytical approaches on how to tackle a crisis. “That culture is not shared between every EU member state,” the source said.The initiative is expected to aid joint planning on events such as natural disasters, crisis intervention or the evacuation of citizens from hot spots.Since 2007, the EU has had four multinational military “battle groups” but the troops have never been deployed.

In another world, she would be with friends in the school playground. Instead, she is bent double at the hips, gouging out weeds from the earth under a savage sun between banked rows of tobacco plants using a heavy hoe, made of a tree branch and a metal plate.About this contentShe looks up in some wonderment, unused to questioning such a life for a child. She is not unusual. There are 18 tenant families on this tobacco farm in the Kasungu district of Malawi, each living in a straw hut. Only two of the other girls go to school, she says. Two-year-old Jackson Phiri stumbles past. He has a miniature hoe, fashioned by his father, Lazaro, because he cried every time he saw his mother and father set off for the fields carrying tools and wanted one for himself. There seems an inevitability about the lives of these children.Without a pen and an exercise book, she could not do schoolwork, her teachers pointed out. But she lives with her older brother and his wife and baby and they have nothing. “I help them in the fields,” she said.She would go back if she could. “I would like to do nursing,” she said. Instead, she weeds, builds earth banks for the tobacco plants and sews the harvested leaves together to suspend them from branches so they dry in the air. Weeding is the worst. “It is a hard job,” she said.Tiyamike is just one of many children in Malawi who see little future beyond the tobacco fields. A report in 2011 estimated there were 1.3 million worldwide under the age of 14. The figures are hard to come by, but the International Labour Organization last year reported that child labour was on the increase, in spite of the tobacco companies’ protestations that they are working to end it. “Child labour is rampant,” the report said.These children live in the poorest of families. Tiyamike’s brother Madalitso Phiri, 27, took her in seven years ago after their father died. He doesn’t want her or the rest of his family to work in the tobacco fields. Like many of the tenant farmers, he sees tobacco as a cash crop that will give him a windfall at harvest time, with which he can change their lives. “I need to get capital so I can buy land and stand on my own two feet and my children can be brought up well,” he said. “I want my children to own shops and sell things.”It’s a dream the tenant farmers all nurture. That when the money comes in, they can go back to their home villages and buy land to farm for themselves or open businesses. But when the crop is sold, the money is never enough.Yeriko Phiri, 26, and his wife, Esther Banda, 20, thought their son, three-year-old Chifundo, had malaria. They took him to hospital, with a promise from their landlord that he would pay the bill. Eight days later, Yeriko was still working alone in the fields. He and his neighbours were very worried – without Esther’s help, he would not be able to get all the work done. In the end, Esther offered to leave her pots and plates, which she had been using to prepare food for herself and her son, with the hospital as surety. Then she set off on the 9km walk home, with Chifundo on her back.When she arrived home, the family were together again, but not smiling. “We haven’t had lunch today. We don’t have money to go to the mill to grind maize.”The families are given a weekly ration of maize, which they grind to a flour, mix with water and eat twice a day as a porridge. They are given salt and the tools they need, but have no cash unless they do extra piecework in the maize fields.Because he was alone, Yeriko could not do the piecework after working on the tobacco plot to afford the 300 kwacha (40 cents or 30p) to mill a pail of maize.The 17 tenant families – 18 including the farm manager – started the season in October and will work on the land for about 10 months until the crop is sold and they get their money.The leaf-buying companies, Alliance One, Universal – in Malawi known as Limbe Leaf – and the tobacco giant Japan Tobacco International (JTI), which does its own buying, grade the tobacco and decide the prices farmers are paid. The leaf buying firms say they tell contract farmers not to use children and that stopping child labour is a priority.In Malawi, the bales are transported by lorry to the auction halls in the capital, Lilongwe – a cost paid by the farmers. Most farmers are under contract to a leaf buyer. If they don’t take the price they are offered, they could put their bales up for auction but they risk not selling at all.Studies of the livelihoods of farmers in five low-income countries led by the economic and health policy research programme of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta, Georgia, have found that farmers at the end of a season just repay debts. “Unequivocally for the vast preponderance of these leaseholders, the livelihood is very bad,” said Jeffrey Drope, the programme’s vice-president.Farming tobacco to produce the leaf that fills cigarettes can involve: Drope said that families “admitted to pulling their kids out of school to work in handling tobacco directly without protection”. The children were exposed to wet leaves – with the danger of contracting green tobacco sickness – as well as fertilisers and pesticide, he said. The companies insist under-18s are only permitted to work with dry tobacco and that they have training policies to minimise risks with green tobacco“Handling dried tobacco is not considered as hazardous work,” JTI said.BAT says education is key on safe practices​ with green tobacco​ PMI\u0027s prevention advice includes wearing long sleeves, gloves or rainwear. A study in Malawi, headed by Donald Makoka of the Centre for Agricultural Research and Development in Lilongwe, found even the earnings of the contract and independent farmers who sublet to tenants were inadequate.For the tenant farmers, whose cheap labour substantially contributes to the profits made by the companies, it’s a grinding life of hard labour seven days a week. But it is only human to try to alleviate stress from time to time.In the farm the  visited in Kasungu, Isaac Mboba, 20, has made a guitar from an old vegetable oil canister and a piece of wood. “My aim was to become a musician … I never saw a guitar but I thought I could create my own musical instrument. I saw pictures in the newspapers.”Mboba sings as the children dance. “My friends, this is the world  Take care of it  People are not good  The whole world has problems  Help us, hold our hands  We are poor  Don’t leave us alone.”The tobacco industry says it is opposed to exploitative child labour. All the major companies contribute to the Eliminating Child Labour in Tobacco (ECLT) Foundation, set up in 2000, including Philip Morris International (PMI), BAT and JTI, as well as the leaf buyers Alliance One and Universal. The International Labour Organization, the only UN agency to have dealings and take funds for projects from the industry, is an adviser to the board. Because it is independent, the companies say, the foundation can require governments to take action.The companies say they have made it clear to farmers that they must not use child labour. PMI established a programme in 2011 “to improve labor practices and progressively eliminate child labor on all farms from which we purchase tobacco”. There is monitoring and countrywide assessments of labour practices and “engagement with stakeholders” for improvement.Green tobacco sickness is a form of nicotine poisoning that workers can be vulnerable to absorbing through their skin, especially if the leaves are wet because of rain, dew or sweat.What are the symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, stomach cramps, headaches, and dizziness while farmers are working or several hours after work ends. Symptoms can last 24 hours extreme cases may require emergency help. Tobacco firms say they ban under 18s from hazardous work and only allow them to handle dry tobacco when there is no risk to health.How prevalent is it? One US study found about one in four workers harvesting tobacco in North Carolina suffered from green tobacco sickness in a single season.PMI funds the NGO Verité, which works towards “supply chain sustainability”, to evaluate the effectiveness of the programme, it says on its website.BAT says: “We have always made it clear to all our suppliers of tobacco leaf and contracted farmers that exploitative child labour and other human rights abuses will not be tolerated.”BAT says it commissioned a report from a development consultancy called DD International in 2012 which found tobacco farmers were not trapped in poverty but were increasing in prosperity. The report looked at 40 or so case studies in three countries – Brazil, Bangladesh and Uganda.BAT and JTI consider it acceptable for children of between 13 and 15 years of age to do light work on a family farm, provided it is light work permitted by local law. JTI quotes the ILO, which says: “Work that does not affect their health andor personal development, or interfere with their education, can generally be regarded as positive.”JTI says all its suppliers are assessed via the Sustainable Tobacco Programme. The company has a scheme called Arise (Achieving Reduction of Child Labor in Support of Education), which it says has taken more than 39,000 children out of child labor in Malawi, Brazil, Zambia and Tanzania since 2011.Alliance One says the elimination of child labour is a “top priority”. It purchases most of its tobacco from contracted farmers whom it can direct to comply with policies including “a prohibition against employing anyone under the age of 18 for hazardous tasks”. It seeks compliance through education and training and has more than 700 people in Malawi working on “agronomic and labor standards” with farmers. It also has a commitment to improving farmers’ incomes, it says.Universal says it takes “the issue of child labor very seriously” and is undertaking “significant efforts around the world to mitigate the risk of child labor in our supply chain”.Reporting and EditingSarah Boseley and Mark OliverDesignersJuweek Adolphe and Sam Morris"},{"url":null,"title":"irish","story":"Garda\u0026iacute removed woman from her home recently due to medical, safeguarding concerns\u0026lsquoWe live in a democracy - not Turkey\u0026rsquo: Gerard Craughwell calls for election to be heldEngineer tells court of \u0026lsquoslapdash\u0026rsquo and \u0026lsquoamateurish\u0026rsquo work done by Christy WalshJudge says actions of Jimell Henry (36) \u0026lsquoa serious betrayal of trust\u0026rsquo which put lives at riskDr Muiris Houston: The young and very old are particularly at risk but we are all in danger of overheatingDaniel Doyle, who was serving a sentence for drug dealing, found unresponsive in his cellIrish Prison Service says up to 14 gangs operating across Ireland\u0026rsquos eleven prisonsPolitician denies charges of filing incorrect tax returns between August 2002 and 2007It is understood the driver fell ill before crashing outside a west Dublin churchOrganisers say people had been sitting by their laptops since midnightLeo Varadkar says free markets and open economies are better for the long termMinister raises possibility of privately run terminal, says second runway an \u0026lsquoimperative\u0026rsquoMinister will review progress made on child safeguarding protocols in SeptemberThe 23-year-old died after he sustained stab wounds in a Dublin park over the weekendMikolaj Wilk (35) died from multiple stab and slash wounds after the attack on June 10th\u0026lsquoYou\u0026rsquore censoring yourself: you say \u0027my partner\u0027, you say they\u0027 instead of she or he\u0026rsquoMonday to to get weather of 27 degrees with further roasting hot conditions expectedAlmost 600 assaults recorded last year but number of country\u0026rsquos biggest hospitals not includedHydration points to be set up outside hostels amid concerns for people in urban areas"},{"url":"https://www.irishtimes.com/polopoly_fs/1.3542272.1529869811!/image/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/box_300_160/image.jpg","title":"it s not my job to help theresa may on brexit says varadkar","story":"\t\t\t                                        \t\t\t\t\tTaoiseach Leo Varadkar: ‘It’s not my job to help Mrs May’.

We are not all heroes and we are not all broken by service,” he said in his valedictory speech earlier this month.Gemma Morgan, an army veteran, told the : “The military puts huge effort into creating a separate society, a separate fighting force, for good operational reasons,” she added, “but sometimes the real world can be more complicated and there is often a reverse culture-shock and loss of that sense of belonging once someone leaves”.She blames the “tick-box exercise” of resettlement for not properly allowing veterans to create a new sense of purpose after their service. Instead of just writing CVs, those leaving military service “need the space to decompress away from the team to ask ‘who the hell am I?’” says Ms Morgan..html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:0}.html-embedponent .quoteponent ponent-content{margin-right:16px}.quote__source,.quote__author{white-space:normal}@media only screen and (min-width:730px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-60.83px}.html-embedponent .quoteponent .quote__content:before{margin-left:-12pxpadding-right:1px}}@media only screen and (min-width:1008px){.html-embedponent .quoteponent{margin-left:-82.33px}}The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to changeArmy veteran Gemma Morgan“If you still see yourself as a soldier after you’ve left, you’ll never transition.”“The infrastructure is there so it’s just the content that needs to change. This can be a quick win and we need to start doing it properly for the sake of the veterans.”Speaking exclusively to the , Mark McDonald, a veteran of 23 years service, revealed how he needed help transitioning back into civilian life having been diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis in 2005. “Once you leave the gates you’re on your own unless you ask for help,” he said, “and pride can be a problem sometimes.”“My pride got in the way of me asking for a mobility scooter, but my wife talked me into it. Now I can do the shopping or go with my son to watch his football matches.”He was shocked and angry to be told that as a former soldier his local authority wanted to do extra checks as part of his application to foster his son, in case he had been “institutionalised”.“Did they think I’d have my child marching up and down outside the house?” he asked. “Would they do this with a former policeman or ambulance driver?”Ssafa helped Mr McDonald with his financial planning after being medically discharged in 2013. He feels service leavers should receive such help as standard on resettlement courses.“In the military all your bills for food, accommodation and tax come out of your pay before you get it. It sounds basic but if you don’t know how to organise yourself with money you can easily end up thousands of pounds in debt.”Prince William lands in Israel in historic royal visitGerman politicians row over use of burkinis in school swimming lessonsDoctors are so tired from long shifts that they \u0026#39behave like they are drunk\u0026#39Comment: From Turkey to Trump\u0026#39s America, freedom is withering before the march of the strongmenItaly\u0026#39s populist government to crack down on migrant beach vendors selling fake designer goodsBriton killed in hit-and-run while on family holiday in Cyprus named as father-of-two builder‘Filthy canopies, needs a paint job’: Donald Trump attacks restaurant that asked his press secretary to leave Comment: It\u0026#39s about time that a Royal visited Israel.

It\u0027s about getting them to agree doctrines, policy and strategic thinking rather than a new force - which is why we singed up to it.EU defence ministers are due on Monday to agree on the rules of that pact, known as Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO). The pact will have the backing of a new multi-billion euro defence fund from 2021, and it appears unlikely it will include Britain.Angela Merkal backs the European Intervention Initiative but wants it to be closely linked to EU defence effortsHowever, Ms Parly admitted that this was still in embryonic form. The time frames and decisions within the EU framework are still much too long when it comes to an emergency, which can arise from a critical situation in a country where Europeans feel there is a serious security issue, she told Le Figaro.This is clearly an initiative that allows the association of some non-EU states, she said. The UK has been very keen because it wants to maintain cooperation with Europe beyond bilateral ties.Earl Howe, Britain\u0027s junior defence minister, said last month: “It will help to achieve what we are looking for, which is a deep and special partnership with our European colleagues in defence and security”. Germany\u0027s Chancellor Angela Merkel has welcomed the opportunity to involve Britain in the force.But she also stressed that the EU’s existing defence pact and any “common military strategy” are “closely related”, which will stoke Brexiteer fears that the force could involve Britain in a European army by the back door.Mr Macron is thought to be keen to involve Britain in future European defence cooperation as one of the continent’s most effective militaries.But he is also pushing for the force in part because of frustrations with the slow pace of EU defence integration. The EU has created four multinational military battlegroups since 2007, but troops have never been deployed. Italy had initially expressed interest in the initiative.The new government in Rome is considering the possibility of joining but has not made a final decision, said Ms Parly. Despite Brexit, the UK is keen on securing a security treaty with the EU by 2019 that would continue to grant it access to continental databases, weapons contracts and intelligence sharing. Many EU countries support the idea.Prince William lands in Israel in historic royal visitGerman politicians row over use of burkinis in school swimming lessonsDoctors are so tired from long shifts that they \u0026#39behave like they are drunk\u0026#39Comment: From Turkey to Trump\u0026#39s America, freedom is withering before the march of the strongmenItaly\u0026#39s populist government to crack down on migrant beach vendors selling fake designer goodsBriton killed in hit-and-run while on family holiday in Cyprus named as father-of-two builder‘Filthy canopies, needs a paint job’: Donald Trump attacks restaurant that asked his press secretary to leave Comment: It\u0026#39s about time that a Royal visited Israel.

A group of 65 Hermes couriers took the delivery service to the tribunal after they said they had been denied basic workers’ rights.The tribunal found that the couriers were not independent contractors, which Hermes argued, but instead were workers, and therefore entitled to rights\u0026nbspsuch as the\u0026nbspnational living wage\u0026nbspand holiday pay. The\u0026nbspdecision was described by the GMB union as a “landmark” ruling.Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said: “This is yet another ruling that shows the gig economy for what it is – old fashioned exploitation under a shiny new facade.“Bosses can’t just pick and choose which laws to obey. Workers’ right were hard won, GMB isn’t about to sit back and let them be eroded or removed by the latest loophole employers have come up with to make a few extra quid.“Not only will this judgement directly affect more than 14,000 Hermes couriers across the country, it’s another nail in the coffin of the exploitative bogus self-employment model which is increasingly rife across the UK.”Frank Field MP, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee and previously delivered a scathing report on working conditions at Hermes, said the ruling “ranks among the most substantial judicial interventions ever to support vulnerable workers in this country”.“Can even the World Cup produce a better result than this?\u0026nbspThe decision is a mega knockback to those companies still using old means of exploiting vulnerable workers,” he added.A Hermes spokesperson said: “We will carefully review the tribunal’s decision, but we are likely to appeal it given that it goes against previous decisions, our understanding of the witness evidence and what we believe the law to be. \u0026nbsp“Nevertheless we have always been fully prepared for any outcome of this decision and its impact on 15 couriers and former couriers.\u0026nbspIn the meantime it is business as usual and we remain committed to providing couriers with the benefits of flexible working and the ability to earn well in excess of the National Living Wage.” The hidden cost of self-employmentDelivery company Hermes savaged in critical Frank Field reportSimon McVicker, director of policy at IPSE (the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed) said uncertainty about who is and is not self-employed needs to stop.“It is unacceptable that policymakers are relying on costly, time-consuming court cases as the first port of call in determining employment status,” he added. “We should be cautious, however, not to take today’s case as being representative of the ‘gig economy’ or wider self-employment, and then try to regulate these ways of working into oblivion.“The reality is that the vast majority of self-employed engagements are what they claim to be: genuine business-to-business engagements which are beneficial to both parties, and to the wider UK economy.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

A group of 65 Hermes couriers took the delivery service to the tribunal after they said they had been denied basic workers’ rights.The tribunal found that the couriers were not independent contractors, which Hermes argued, but instead were workers, and therefore entitled to rights\u0026nbspsuch as the\u0026nbspnational living wage\u0026nbspand holiday pay. The\u0026nbspdecision was described by the GMB union as a “landmark” ruling.Tim Roache, GMB general secretary, said: “This is yet another ruling that shows the gig economy for what it is – old fashioned exploitation under a shiny new facade.“Bosses can’t just pick and choose which laws to obey. Workers’ right were hard won, GMB isn’t about to sit back and let them be eroded or removed by the latest loophole employers have come up with to make a few extra quid.“Not only will this judgement directly affect more than 14,000 Hermes couriers across the country, it’s another nail in the coffin of the exploitative bogus self-employment model which is increasingly rife across the UK.”Frank Field MP, who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee and previously delivered a scathing report on working conditions at Hermes, said the ruling “ranks among the most substantial judicial interventions ever to support vulnerable workers in this country”.“Can even the World Cup produce a better result than this?\u0026nbspThe decision is a mega knockback to those companies still using old means of exploiting vulnerable workers,” he added.A Hermes spokesperson said: “We will carefully review the tribunal’s decision, but we are likely to appeal it given that it goes against previous decisions, our understanding of the witness evidence and what we believe the law to be. \u0026nbsp“Nevertheless we have always been fully prepared for any outcome of this decision and its impact on 15 couriers and former couriers.\u0026nbspIn the meantime it is business as usual and we remain committed to providing couriers with the benefits of flexible working and the ability to earn well in excess of the National Living Wage.” The hidden cost of self-employmentDelivery company Hermes savaged in critical Frank Field reportSimon McVicker, director of policy at IPSE (the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed) said uncertainty about who is and is not self-employed needs to stop.“It is unacceptable that policymakers are relying on costly, time-consuming court cases as the first port of call in determining employment status,” he added. “We should be cautious, however, not to take today’s case as being representative of the ‘gig economy’ or wider self-employment, and then try to regulate these ways of working into oblivion.“The reality is that the vast majority of self-employed engagements are what they claim to be: genuine business-to-business engagements which are beneficial to both parties, and to the wider UK economy.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

information research department ird","story":"Created with Sketch.In 1949 the man who conceived Big Brother gave a semi-secret government department a list of 38 ‘crypto-communists’\u0026nbspand ‘fellow travellers’ –\u0026nbspa revelation that has given rise to a peculiar revisionism of his legacyClick to followThe Independent OnlineGeorge Orwell’s cooperation with the government’s Information Research Department has led to some on the hard left branding him a ‘reactionary snitch’To many, he came close to being a secular saint.George Orwell, born 115 years ago on Monday, was the writer who challenged the iniquities of imperialism and capitalism, who took a bullet in the throat fighting fascism, and who taught a Western audience about the horrors of Stalinist communism.That he died young, of tuberculosis at the age of 46, in 1950, served only to enhance his posthumous reputation.\u0026nbspHe became, in the words of one astute critic, “the James Dean of the Cold War,\u0026nbspthe John F\u0026nbspKennedy of English letters”.Death may also have saved him from curdling into the kind of bitter, contrarian conservatism that seems to have been the fate awaiting many a one-time youthful socialist.Instead, Orwell is often remembered as a man of “genius”, the “greatest political writer of the 20th\u0026nbspcentury”.The commonly accepted view of the man is encapsulated in the aims of the foundation bearing his name.\u0026nbspThrough the coveted Orwell Prize, the Orwell Foundation seeks “to celebrate honest writing and reporting, to uncover hidden lives, to confront uncomfortable truths, to promote Orwell’s values of integrity, decency and fidelity to truth”.And yet there is one blemish – or complication – in the reputation of St George.It lay hidden until 1996 when Foreign Office file FO 111189 was made public under the 30-year rule.The hitherto secret file revealed that in 1949 the great writer had, via his friend Celia Kirwan, given a semi-secret government propaganda unit called the Information Research Department\u0026nbsp(IRD) what became known as “Orwell’s List”.Orwell effectively handed over to the British authorities the names of 38 public figures whom he thought should be treated with suspicion as secret communists or “fellow travellers” who sympathised with the aims of Stalin’s Russia.When the existence of Orwell’s List was revealed in 1996, and when the Foreign Office finally ulged who was on it in 2003, the initial reactions seemed tinged with sadness and hedged about with qualifications.But the internet was young then.Now it has grown into a giant bristling with social media channels and anger\u0026nbspswift to judge, slow to reflect.And so George Orwell, a hero to so many, is now demonised online as a “fake socialist”, a “reactionary snitch”, a traitor, a McCarthyite “weasel”.“Orwell’s List is a term that should be known by anyone who claims to be a person of the left,” declares one fairly widely circulated condemnation.\u0026nbsp“At the end of his life, he was an outright counter-revolutionary snitch, spying on leftists on behalf of the imperialist British government.”“He was an anti-socialist,” asserts another indictment, “corresponding with British secret services and keeping a blacklist of writers.”So widespread has the vilification become,\u0026nbspthat “Orwell as snitch”\u0026nbspis sometimes played with – not entirely seriously – as an internet meme.“I can’t get very worked up about the list,” he says mildly.\u0026nbsp“I don’t see it particularly as a mistake. \u0026nbsp“You just have to see it in the context of the time.”And that context, reveals Taylor, was explained to him by the left wing former Labour leader Michael Foot.Taylor recalls: “Foot told me that the great difficulty if you were a left wing Labour MP in the 1940s was working out exactly where your friends stood.\u0026nbspYou didn’t know whether some were listening to you and agreeing, and then going straight to the British Communist Party’s headquarters in King Street and telling them everything.”“Another example of the kind of thing they were facing,” says Taylor, “was the man who worked in the Foreign Office in the room next to Orwell’s IRD friend Celia.\u0026nbspHis name was Guy Burgess.“There were at least a dozen elected parliamentarians taking their orders from a foreign country,” adds Taylor.\u0026nbsp“What could be more traitorous than that?”Years after Orwell listed him as giving the “strong impression of being some kind of Russian agent”, the Mitrokhin Archive of KGB documents revealed that journalist Peter Smollett had indeed been a Russian agent.Driberg, who was\u0026nbspnamed on Orwell’s List as well as the KGB papers (Getty)Also listed by Orwell, and as a KGB agent by Mitrokhin, was the leading Labour MP Tom Driberg.Laying aside the irony that Michael Foot was himself once falsely accused of being a KGB agent, it is, then, perhaps no coincidence that the IRD was in fact set up, not by a headbanging Tory, but by Labour foreign secretary Ernest Bevin.“This was at a time when the Soviet Union was swallowing up what had previously been independent East European states,” says Taylor. “The IRD was producing reasoned expositions, pamphlet literature, telling people on the ground in Eastern Europe why they should resist this kind of stuff. \u0026nbsp“But a lot of British people were still seduced by the idea of our ally ‘good old Uncle Joe Stalin’, when in fact the bloke was a mass murdering psychopath.\u0026nbspAnd you were also dealing with some really hardline ideologues.“So Orwell’s idea was, if you are going to get somebody to write these kinds of pamphlets, they have to be genuine democrats.“He was a democratic socialist who wanted democratic socialists, not right wingers, to be writing this propaganda.\u0026nbspBut he wanted them to be people who had seen through the Soviet illusion, not covert stooges for Stalin’s Russia.”And so Taylor’s anger – such as it is – is reserved, not for Orwell, but for those like the late Labour MP Gerald Kaufman, who greeted the revelation of the list with the “pathetic” remark: “Orwell was a Big Brother too”.“This wasn’t Orwell denouncing anybody,” says Taylor.\u0026nbsp“He wasn’t writing public articles in the press saying ‘these people are evil’.It should perhaps be noted that Celia Kirwan was a bit more than just a friend.\u0026nbspThree years earlier, Orwell had actually proposed marriage to her in the emotional turmoil that followed the death of his first wife Eileen.Kirwan rebuffed his advances, but some have suggested that Orwell, aware of his failing health, might have been seeking the comfort of a beautiful woman when\u0026nbspon 6 April 1949\u0026nbsphe wrote offering to name those who “should not be trusted as propagandists”. \u0026nbspHe certainly knew the list was not for Kirwan’s eyes only.\u0026nbspAs noted by Timothy Garton Ash, the historian who persuaded the Foreign Office to reveal the document in 2003, Orwell sent his list to Kirwan with a reference to “your friends” who would read it.And as Garton Ash also noted, the IRD did not confine itself to relatively innocuous pamphleteering.In the New York Review of Books article that formed the first detailed analysis of the list’s contents, Garton Ash wrote: “By the late 1950s, IRD had a reputation as ‘the dirty tricks department’ of the Foreign Office, indulging in character assassination, false telegrams, putting itching powder on lavatory seats\u0026nbspand other such Cold War pranks”.When he sent his list to Celia Kirwan in 1949, Orwell might not have known that this was the IRD’s direction of travel, but of all people, the author of 1984, who envisaged the Ministry of Truth, should surely have been aware of the possibility.\u0026nbsp \u0026nbspThat said, as Garton Ash also wrote, not much seemed to have happened to the people on Orwell’s List (apart from missing out on the IRD pamphlet-writing gig).\u0026nbspIt seems their names weren’t even passed to MI5 or MI6.In America, Hollywood actors blacklisted during the McCarthy era\u0026nbsphad their careers and lives ruined.\u0026nbspIn England, Michael Redgrave appeared on Orwell’s List in 1949 and starred in the film adaptation of Orwell’s novel 1984 seven years later.Peter Smollett, named by Orwell as a likely Russian agent, got an OBE.2017 isn’t ‘1984’ – it’s stranger than Orwell imaginedREAR WINDOW: COLD WAR:The British Ministry of PropagandaBig Brother with a high moral senseIn other words, what happened to those on Orwell’s List seems to have borne no comparison to the fate of Big Brother’s fictional victims or the real millions who died in the purges and repression ordered by Stalin.What if Orwell had given the government a list of closet Nazis, he wondered.\u0026nbsp“Would anyone be objecting?”And in truth, there does seem a certain asymmetry in the online articles of denunciation.Indeed it is hard not to sense the inspiration of Private Eye’s (fictional) veteran class warrior Dave Spart in some of the articles condemning Orwell as “a social democratic traitor collaborating with the capitalist state against revolutionaries trying to create socialism.”“Sure, the USSR did a lot of objectionable things,” says one writer.\u0026nbsp“But … Western imperialist countries commit much more heinous crimes throughout the world every day.”Which is one way to gloss over the Gulag.The 15 best opening lines in literature115 Pride and Prejudice, by Jane Austen“It is

He urged Indians to be proud of their culture and history.“The gems of India’s unique heritage, such as yoga, will be respected by the world at large only when we ourselves respect our culture and traditions,” he said.Around the world, public yoga events were held in Afghanistan, Japan and Peru, while Australia and South Africa celebrated on Monday.“From Tokyo to Toronto, from Stockholm to Sao Paulo, yoga has become a positive influence in the lives of millions,” Mr Modi told participants on the lush green lawns.“In a world where non-communicable diseases, stress and lifestyle related ailments are rising, yoga can play a central role in mitigating these diseases to create a healthy mind and body.”In the buildup to Thursday’s event, Mr Modi took part in a social media campaign, begun by his BJP party ministers, to get people to share videos of their fitness workouts on Twitter.Celebrities\u0026nbspfrom Bollywood actors to sports superstars\u0026nbspgot involved, and Mr Modi’s own video showed him performing yoga on a boulder in his prime ministerial gardens.Social media was again awash with videos emulating Mr Modi’s on Thursday, including from staff at Delhi airport, pupils at thousands of schools and members of India’s armed forces.Amid questions over his appeal, PM Modi’s party sweeps to key victoryPlea to Indian PM in London for ‘tortured’ captive elephants Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accused of spying on citizens India PM makes point of visiting Palestinians after meeting NetanyahuThe Indian navy released pictures of sailors doing yoga on board the world’s oldest aircraft carrier, the INS Viraat, decommissioned last year, and soldiers guarding the world’s highest battleground, the Siachen glacier in northern Jammu and Kashmir state, did yoga routines at an altitude of around 18,000 feet.The events clearly mustered a huge amount of public support. For some, however, there was a sinister edge to having public institutions take part in a scheme closely associated with the prime minister’s messaging. Even prisons were involved, with 15,000 inmates due to take part in yoga events on Thursday in the capital alone.Sagarika Ghose, a prominent journalist and political commentator, wrote on Twitter: “Believer in yoga, try every morning, immense benefits. But concerned: why does a GOVERNMENT need to promote yoga? Yoga’s an inidual choice, a personal option.”Mr Modi’s rule, she said, was “fast becoming an escapist Bollywood film where song and dance attempt to distract from hard realities”. One of the most liked responses to Ms Ghose’s tweet told her to “go to Pakistan” if she couldn’t show loyalty to India.For Ajay Mehra, a political scientist at Delhi University, the International Day of Yoga “has become an imposition”, forced on the people by government.“Something like yoga should not be part of a political project,” he told The Independent, adding that there were certain yogic practices – chanting mantras for instance – that could be offensive to some groups in a plural society, “Muslims in particular”.Mr Mehra noted that Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of India, stressed the importance of secular, pluralist leadership while also being a devoted practitioner of yoga – “but he didn’t publicise it”.International Day of YogaEnter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

An announcement from the broadcaster\u0026nbspTRT\u0026nbspcame soon after the\u0026nbspAnadolu\u0026nbspAgency, who reported that he had won 52.51 per cent of the vote with 98.4 per cent of the total counted.Independent election monitors and the opposition both maintained that less than half the votes had been counted at that point.\u0026nbspThe president’s main rival, Muharrem Ince -\u0026nbspwho state media\u0026nbspsaid had\u0026nbspwon 30.72 per cent of the vote -\u0026nbspurged\u0026nbspobservers and his supporters to stay on at counting centres, warning that vote rigging was\u0026nbsplikely to place if they left under the impression that the result had been decided.But speaking in the early hours of Monday, the head of the Supreme Election Council\u0026nbspSadi\u0026nbspGuven confirmed the result. He said\u0026nbspthat Mr Erdogan\u0026nbspreceived the absolute majority of all valid votes and the remaining ballots\u0026nbspwould not affect the outcome.In his speech Mr Erdogan\u0026nbsphad\u0026nbspwarned:\u0026nbsp“The Turkish public has mandated me as president according to unofficial results. I hope nobody will damage democracy by casting a shadow on this election and its results to hide their failure.\u0026nbspThe main opposition Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP)\u0026nbspdid not immediately concede defeat.\u0026nbspBut it moved from suggesting that Mr Erdogan\u0026nbspmight not win the 50 per cent required to avoid a run off against Mr Ince\u0026nbspto saying it would continue their campaign for democracy\u0026nbspwhatever the result.Mr Ince\u0026nbsptweeted that he would hold a press conference on Monday.During his address, Mr Erdogan\u0026nbsppraised the electoral process and pledged that economic progress would be made with a number of major infrastructure projects before thanking “ brotherly” countries which have already congratulated him.The\u0026nbspHungarian leader Viktor Orban, who has been condemned by fellow European Union states for a number of his hard-right policies, was the first to congratulate Mr Erdogan, it was reported. He was\u0026nbspfollowed by\u0026nbspPakistan\u0027s\u0026nbspPresident Mamnoon Hussain.At home, the Turkish president’s followers took to the streets lighting flares and hooting car horns. Supporters of the opposition parties were also gathering while their leaders insisted that the full count was yet to take place and Mr Erdogan may not reach the 50 per cent figure necessary to win outright, and avoid a second round run-off.Victory gives Mr\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspa second five-year term and more power than any of his predecessors after a narrow referendum win last year. Mired in accusations of fraud, that referendum concentrated authority in the office of the president at the expense of parliament and the judiciary. The opposition want to review these constitutional changes which they say will create an autocracy. Under the new constitution, Mr\u0026nbspErdogan\u0026nbspcould serve a further term from 2023, taking him to 2028.Election in Turkey: the reaction in picturesSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate in IstanbulA supporter of Mr Erdogan carries his portrait in front of a Turkish flagFollowing the election, a shipowner reads a newspaper that covers the resultSupporters of Muharrem Ince, defeated opposition candidate, wait outside the Republican People\u0027s Party (CHP) headquarters following Mr Erdogan\u0027s claim of victoryPeople in an Instanbul barber shop listen to Muharrem Ince\u0027s speech following the resultsSupporters of the pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party (HDP) hold photos of its leader Selahatin DemirtasSupporters of Mr Erdogan celebrate outside the AK party HQ in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraMr Erdogan waves to supporters in AnkaraSupporters of Mr Erdogan light flares as they celebrate the resultThere had been\u0026nbspfurther scepticism from the opposition about the results given by the state news outlets for the parliamentary poll running in tandem with the presidential one.\u0026nbspThe Kurdish rights\u0026nbspPeoples\u0027 Democratic Party\u0026nbsp(HDP) received 11 per cent of the vote which, it had been expected, would make opposition parties the majority in parliament. But the\u0026nbspNationalist Movement Party\u0026nbsp(MHP)\u0026nbspwhich is in alliance with Mr Erdogan’s\u0026nbspJustice and Development Party\u0026nbsp(AKP)\u0026nbspwas said to have received 11 per cent of the vote, twice as much as forecast by polls, giving the\u0026nbspruling coalition a majority.The AKP\u0026nbspwas said to have 42 per cent of the parliamentary vote, while the CHP\u0026nbsphad just under 23 per cent.In Istanbul, Mr Erdogan’s followers had no doubt about their leader’s victory. Alim Abdulhamit, waving an AKP flag outside the party headquarters, said: “This was never in doubt, he was always going to be on top, praise to Allah. It has now a fact and those who stood against us should accept it. They made a lot of noise, but the people chose President Erdogan who has done so much for us.”But watching the celebrations grim-faced, Adem Bulent, a 20-year-student and supporter of the CHP\u0026nbspwas convinced of \u0027dirty-tricks’.Erdogan tells a girl in military uniform that she would be honoured if killed while fighting“How can this be over? It is nor for the AKP to decide who wins, it is for the people, he said. What has happened has made many of us suspect even more that some fraud has gone on. Of course we are going to protest,” he wanted to stress.Defeat in the elections will be deeply demoralising for Mr Erdogan’s opponents who had fought a highly-energised and co-ordinated campaign and had repeatedly stated that they would be able to stop his march to what critics claim is an imperial presidency.Indeed, victory for Mr Erdogan in the presidential vote and the AKP in parliament was not the expectation among many who had turned up to vote during the day.\u0026nbsp“We are voting for our children’s future that is the reason we voted the way we did, we thought hard about it and I think we made the right decision”, said Nejat Bayan as he and his wife Pinar deposited their ballot papers. “There are a lot of things wrong right now, and strong action is needed, so these elections are crucial and we need the right result.”After supporting Mr Erdogan and the AKP all their adult lives, Mr Bayan and his wife were joining their daughter Buse in voting for the opposition CHP\u0026nbspand its candidate Mr Ince in the parliamentary and presidential elections. And they were\u0026nbspdoing so in one of the staunch AKP loyalist centres in Istanbul, at a polling station, Piyale Pasha Elementary School, where a young Recep was once a pupil.Voters hopeful for change on pivotal polling day for Turkey’s futureKurdish voters could hold key to Turkey\u0027s electionsTurkey opposition quietly optimistic ahead of presidential electionHow Turkey\u0027s elections will affect its struggling economyDoubts had\u0026nbspgrown every day since\u0026nbspMr Erdogan called a snap election 17 months early about the president\u0027s ability town.\u0026nbspEspecially against\u0026nbspan opposition which had\u0026nbspbeen galvanised and had\u0026nbspshown surprising unity, co-ordinating tactics and directing their members to vote strategically.Casting his\u0026nbsp own vote in Istanbul\u0026nbspMr Erdogan maintained that the country was experiencing a “democratic revolution”. While a group of supporters in the street chanted his name, he continued: “With the presidential system, Turkey has set the bar high concerning efforts to reach beyond the level of contemporary civilisation.”Estimates for voter turn-out were standing at as high as 87\u0026nbspcent of the electorate in many areas. More than 56 million eligible voters can make their choices in around 180,000 ballot boxes around the country. And it is what happens to these ballot boxes which had\u0026nbspraised concerns about rigging of the results.Reports were coming in however within a few hours of the polls opening of alleged fraud by Mr Erdogan’s supporters. A video was posted showing a ballot box being opened in Suruc district near the Syrian border, and disturbances temporarily stopping voting in the area where police also found four bags of stamped ballot paper in a car.Meral Aksener, the presidential candidate for the nationalist Good Party (iYi) - who are in parliamentary alliance with the CHP\u0026nbsp-\u0026nbspsaid: “We are urging the incident on Suruc very closely. I urge state officials to save the honour of the state”. Mr Ince declared “We need 36 hours of mobilisation to ensure that there is no electoral fraud.”\u0026nbspForeign observers are in Turkey to monitor the election. Both President Erdogan and the Prime Minister, Binali Yildirim, had criticised teams from the West, including from the\u0026nbspOrganisation for Security Cooperation in Europe\u0026nbsp(OSCE)\u0026nbspwith Mr Yildirim claiming they are “behave like spokespeople of radical political structures, we think this means interference in election one way or another.”The president and his supporters have avoided criticism, so far, of the\u0026nbspmonitoring team\u0026nbspfrom the Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Secretariat, which has Russia, China and India as members. Officials were inspecting polling stations in Istanbul and Ankara. Krishna Kengappa, one of the officials in Istanbul said a report would be produced showing\u0026nbsptheir conclusions on Monday.Some voters, while acknowledging the risk of fraud, were focusing on the strategic voting. Ozlem Dinles, an artist, is backing\u0026nbspHDP in the parliamentary poll, but will support Mr Ince of the CHP if there is a second round.\u0026nbsp“The aim is to get change, move Erdogan so we must find a way to that through voting. I have become more and more optimistic that this is possible” she said.The optimism was also prevalent at a polling station in Nisahantasi, a middle class enclave and a firm CHP base. A businessman in the tourism field said:\u0026nbsp “When Erdogan called the election I thought it will all be over very quickly, with the first round. But the opposition has learned to work together and we believe a second round will take place and Erdogan will go.” His partner, a food writer, added: “Yes, this really is happening we can see the opposition gaining support and Erdogan’s support slipping”. Neither wanted to go give their names however, there is fear of retribution if such\u0026nbspoptimism failed to\u0026nbspturn into reality.For Bahri, a taxi driver, the removal of Mr Erdogan was wistful thinking by his enemies. “He is going to win, I know that is going to happen. Seven out of ten people who use my taxi say they will vote for him and I will as well” he declared. “Europe had been stifling us, and now we are stifling them, and for that we need Erdogan”. It was nothing personal against Europe, Bahri wanted to add, “After all, I myself have just got an Oxford diploma in taxi driving.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

I feel like I can do anything,” Bayan al Soumady says over the phone from Riyadh. The excitement in her voice is infectious.\u0026nbsp“I drove myself to work today.\u0026nbspMaybe it’s just a little thing, but everything feels like an adventure now.”The 24-year-old pharmacist is one of thousands of women across Saudi Arabia who took to the road for the first time on Sunday after the kingdom abolished its long-standing ban on women driving.\u0026nbspAs the clock struck midnight, in a show of solidarity and celebration, women did victory laps around the centres of Riyadh, Jeddah and\u0026nbspDammam,\u0026nbsptrailed by Saudi television crews and the rest of the world’s media.Throughout Sunday – the first day of the Saudi working week – women who had already managed to convert their foreign driving licences\u0026nbspstepped into newly purchased cars, or borrowed those belonging to fathers and husbands, to commute to work and run errands alone. Some headed out of the cities on the long, straight desert roads to drive fast for the pleasure of it.\u0026nbsp“Life can feel very complicated here sometimes,” says\u0026nbspBayan, who is half Syrian and learned to drive while\u0026nbspstudying in Damascus.\u0026nbsp“It’s frustrating not being able to rely on yourself for simple things like going to the supermarket 10 minutes away. I know it doesn’t fix everything – but being able to drive is a big step,” she adds.The historic moment gives women unprecedented freedom in a country where the male ship system effectively renders them second-class citizens, unable to make many important decisions for themselves.\u0026nbspSaudi Arabia’s tiny activist community has fought against the ban since it was enforced by police and licensing agencies in 1990. A surprise royal decree from King Salman last September, however,\u0026nbspannounced the end of a policy which has been perhaps the foremost symbol of the oppression faced by women in the conservative kingdom. The move, designed to help get more\u0026nbspwomen into the Saudi workforce, is part of a raft of wide-ranging social and economic reforms installed by crown prince Mohammed bin Salman\u0026nbspin the year since his appointment.\u0026nbspSaudi Women celebrate their freedom to driveA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman gestures while driving in Dhahran, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives at night in Al Khobar, Saudi ArabiaSaudi women embrace as they celebrate the lift of the female driving ban in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman drives to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaFadya Fahad is one of the first female drivers for Careem, a ride sharing company in Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman stops at a petrol station while driving to work in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaA Saudi woman waits for coffee on the commute in Jeddah, Saudi ArabiaTo hammer home the message that change in Saudi Arabia comes from the top down, in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban 17 prominent activists have been arrested. Eight are still being held without access to their families or lawyers, and no charges have been brought against them.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, many ordinary Saudis embraced what one national newspaper called “history in the making”. \u0026nbsp“The logistics of half a country suddenly being able to learn to drive are quite something,” Susan Newbon, a British driving instructor training Saudi women to teach their own students, tells\u0026nbspThe Independent. “Honestly, I’ve never seen anything like it. It’s a very strange but very important occasion.”\u0026nbspSome women will have to wait a while to get behind the wheel\u0026nbspthere are huge waiting lists for gender-segregated lessons across the country, and a course of classes can cost hundreds of dollars. That is an extravagant expense in a country where households are tightening the purse strings following a global plunge in oil prices and amid national austerity measures.\u0026nbspLSE Saudi Arabia academic: Lifting ban on women driving is being used to deflect bad newsLearning to drive will also still depend on the goodwill of husbands, fathers or sons – meaning women from conservative families will not be enjoying their new right yet.\u0026nbspOn Sunday, at least, the mood across the country was jubilant, with “tawakkali wa intaliqi”, or “have faith and drive”, celebratory events taking place across the kingdom.\u0026nbsp“I’ve been using my husband’s car today,” Bayan says. “But I’m going to get my own as soon as possible.

Instead, like so much else in the country, it’s a combination of religious diktats, social pressure and purposefully convoluted licensing rules which has effectively stifled women’s freedoms and make it illegal for them to get behind the wheel.\u0026nbspWhen a royal decree goes into effect on Sunday, for the first time in decades, that is going to change.\u0026nbsp The independence is going to revolutionise life for many - including Pilar al Amad, from Kohbar, on Saudi Arabia’s east coast. If the rules had changed a few months earlier, she says her recent family tragedy may have been a little easier to deal with. \u0026nbsp“I was pregnant with twins and my husband was away with work when I went into labour,” she said.“I had to rely on people from work to drive me to the hospital and it was really stressful. I lost one of my twins a week after delivery. I feel like if I had just been able to drive the whole situation would have been easier.”Pilar’s surviving baby daughter has been in an intensive care unit for the last three months.Ahmed Yosri)“I can’t wait to be able to come and go as I please without having to go when my husband goes or else pay for an Uber,” she added.\u0026nbspLifting the driving ban is a deeply symbolic move in a country where ship system means that most decisions in a woman’s life are made for her by her father, husband or son.The kingdom’s newly appointed and immensely powerful crown prince, 32-year-old Mohammed bin Salman, is the driving force behind the new measure aimed at liberalising Saudi society - which will, crucially, bring more women into the workforce.Allowing women to drive is part of ‘Vision 2030’, an ambitious roadmap of socio-economic reforms designed to wean the kingdom off its dependence on oil revenue.\u0026nbsp Other bold moves include curbing the powers of the once notorious religious police and even a promise the conservative kingdom will return to a more “moderate” form of Islam.\u0026nbspBefore Prince Mohammed was appointed crown prince a year ago, such rapid change was unthinkable. In visits before and after his appointment, however, The Independent has witnessed how many ordinary Saudis have begun to relax into the changes.In the Red Sea city of Jeddah, more and more women are choosing to forego wearing headscarves altogether, and shops sell abayas - the cloak-like robe women must wear by law - in navy, grey and white as well as black. Even in the more conservative desert capital, Riyadh, people now blast Western pop music from cars and groups of teenagers - both boys and girls - roam around parks and malls unsupervised.\u0026nbspSunday’s historic moment is somewhat overshadowed by the arrests of 17 prominent women’s rights activists in the weeks leading up to the lifting of the ban.\u0026nbspWhile eight have been released on bail since, the rest have still not been charged and have not been allowed access to their families or lawyers.The arrests have widely been viewed as an attempt to intimate Saudi Arabia’s tiny activist community - and serve as a reminder to everyone that change in the kingdom will only come from the top down.\u0026nbspDespite the crackdown, though, excitement for Sunday is building. Newspapers and television stations across the country have gone into overdrive celebrating “history in the making”.\u0026nbspPink “ladies’ parking” spaces have sprung up in major cities and community events focussing on family road safety organised under the slogan “Tawakkali wa Intaliqi”, or ‘Have Faith and Drive”, are planned across the country tomorrow.Mabkhoutah al-Mari, 27, with her new driving license at the Saudi Driving School inside Princess Nora University on 23 June (APNariman El-Mofty)“Everyone is embracing the changes,” said Susan Newbon, a driving instructor from South Wales who is training up Saudi women to teach their own driving students and hold exams.\u0026nbsp“This is a young nation, where people know change is overdue. It’s logistically a massive undertaking but Saudis are more than ready to be able to do this. There’s a real sense of celebration.”Many challenges are still waiting in the wings. Complex rules on the mixing of genders in work and social environments mean it’s not clear whether women-owned businesses or female employees can mix with male customers and clients in certain industries the threat of harassment and backlash from religious conservatives is also a problem feared by many women.\u0026nbspThe long overdue social reforms are also being ushered in in part to sweeten a bitter pill: the House of Saud has been badly hit by a global plunge in oil prices since 2015.Saudi Arabia struggles to employ its most-educated womenSAUDI WOMEN: Tahany Omar, 36, has a Masters of Business Administration from the US but has found the job market challenging in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia she works in an investment firm, but not in management.

The government introduced its first-ever VAT (at 5 per cent) on 1 January and has begun phasing out fuel subsidies - meaning that while women will be able to get behind the wheel from next week, it will cost a lot to fill up the tank, and there aren’t enough jobs for everyone to drive to.Mohammed bin Salman’s reforms are more a continuation of the House of Saud’s long-term thinking than an out of the blue new agenda, David Butter, an associate fellow at London’s Chatham House, told The Independent.\u0026nbsp“Lifting the driving ban will provide a lot more scope for women to participate in the workforce and society,” he said. “But the changes do raise all sorts of questions.”Enter your email addressFill out this fieldor register with your social accountAlready have an account?

If the US insisted in a bilateral US-UK negotiation that we be allowed to cheese from Vermont that was called feta cheese, and if the British accepted that \u0026mdash and allowed for the sale of Vermont feta in the UK \u0026mdash that would put them in contradiction to whatever obligations they may have to obtain to protect feta in the UK as a result of a free trade agreement with the EU.A Government spokesman said: \u0026ldquoLeaving the EU gives us a golden opportunity to secure ambitious free-trade deals that are in the mutual interests of the countries involved while supporting farmers and producers to grow and sell more great British food.

and it went up to £7.38 from April 1, 2018.The wage increased from £5.60 to £5.90 for 18 to 20-year-olds, and from £4.05 to £4.20 for under 18s.However, apprentices were only entitled to £3.50 if they are under-19 - this increased to £3.70 from April 1, 2018.In April 2018, the minimum wage for 25-year-olds rose from £7.50 to £7.83 an hour.The national limits are legally binding.Anyone who thinks they are not getting the National Living Wage or National Minimum Wage should complain to their employer in the first instance.If this does not get anywhere, the next step is to take the complaint to HMRC who will investigate.Those who are self-employed, voluntary workers, company directors and family members who live in the home of the employer and do household chores do not qualify for either rate.There is no difference in pay for those that live in London compared to elsewhere.The only discrepancy is for people working in agriculture or horticulture.Workers already employed before October 1, 2013 are entitled to the pay set under their contract of employment.This is a voluntary scheme aiming to recognise the actual cost of living, to which 3,000 employers have signed up.Under it, the lowest rate of pay is calculated according to the cost of living in the UK based on the changing cost of a basket of groceries.The amount is set by the charity Living Wage Foundation, and accredited employers include local authorities, NHS trusts, banks, retailers, charities and construction companies.The foundations calculations put the real Living Wage at £8.75 an hour - and £10.20 in London.These rates also apply to over-18s in recognition that young people face the same living costs as everyone else.And while companies are not legally entitled to pay more than the National Living and Minimum Wages, those which have signed up to the real Living Wage scheme have pledged to pay all workers those rates.The rate is calculated every November, and accredited employers are committed to any increases.While theres no legal obligation for your employer to pay you more than the National Living Wage (£7.50 from April 1, 2017), if your company is accredited by the Living Wage Foundation you should be receiving more than that.The foundations head of partnerships Graham Griffiths said anyone concerned can use their online whistleblowing service, and any employer not adhering to the Real Living Wage faced losing its accreditation.Graham said one area where it was challenging to pay the living wage were retail and hospitality but pointed to Ikea, Aldi and Lidl, which have agreed to pay the same rate.The scheme was launched in 2001 by parents in East London, and the foundation was set up in 2011.In 2005 following a growing interest from employers, the Greater London Authority established the Living Wage Unit to calculate what the lowest pay should ideally be.In 2008 Trust for London selected the scheme as a special initiative and made a grant of more than £1million to campaign for it and set up an accreditation scheme for employers.In April 2016 it became the inspiration for the governments higher minimum wage rate, which it rebranded the National Living Wage.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

They’ve far too much to discuss among themselves.”Migration is plunging European politics into crisis again. German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s coalition is threatening to break apart over the issue.While in Italy, the new government is threatening to close its southern border — blocking migrant rescue ships from landing — and open its northern border, encouraging illegal migrants and asylum seekers to head north to Germany and Sweden.So worried is European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker that he is hosting a mini-summit tomorrow to try to find a solution to the migrant crisis which can help save Merkel’s political career.It is tempting to look at the EU in crisis and say that is why the UK is leaving. But this crisis is making it more difficult for Britain to get a reasonable Brexit deal.The European Commission is running the Brexit negotiations.Its priority is in defending the theology of the European Union, rather than finding practical solutions. As one leading figure in the Government laments to me, Brussels’ chief negotiator Michel Barnier “won’t budge off CETA (Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement) with Northern Ireland stuck in the customs union”.This kind of Canada-style free trade deal is regarded by the Government as inadequate.Mrs May and co have long hoped that the member states, nearly all of whose economies would be hurt by such a limited agreement, would intervene at some point and tell the Commission to engage more constructively with the UK. But this is happening all too rarely.One of the reasons is, in the words of one member of the Brexit inner Cabinet: “Only four national capitals are fully across Brexit.”Many of the countries that are most sympathetic to the UK don’t have the capacity to follow all of the issues concerned.Over the past few years, the key to any deal in Europe has been Merkel. She is not now going to ride to Britain’s rescue— as David Cameron found to his cost in the renegotiation.But the German Chancellor could push the Commission towards a slightly more pragmatic approach.However, she is now trying to keep her own governing coalition together, as well as come up with a deal with the French for eurozone reform, leaving next to no time for Brexit.I am told that when Brexit is discussed in meetings she is “visibly distracted”, turning to aides for advice far more frequently than she does on other issues.This situation is one of the many reasons why the Government should have prepared vigorously for no deal: A credible threat to walk away from the table if the Commission didn’t behave in a reasonable fashion would have got the member states’ attention.But Mrs May now must hope the EU can patch together some deal on migration and that the member states begin thinking seriously about what kind of post-Brexit relationship they want with this country.WHEN the Cabinet gathers at Chequers next month to thrash out the UK’s offer to the EU, one of the most contentious issues will be customs.The Brexit inner Cabinet is split between those who favour a so-called “new customs partnership” (NCP) with the EU – which would see the UK continue to apply EU tariffs after Brexit, with companies receiving a rebate if their goods stayed in Britain rather than heading to the continent – and those who advocate Max Fac, which would use technology to minimise border checks.Two Cabinet working groups are trying to find a way to make these ideas work. Neither group has had a decisive breakthrough yet. But I am told the Max Fac one is “not a million miles away” from a solution.The challenge for the PM is to make these plans acceptable to her own side, including David Davis and Liam Fox. One Brexit inner Cabinet member tells me: “She’s got to have David and Liam. If she doesn’t have them, then she has no solution.”Both Davis and Fox support the Max Fac option. But there are influential figures in No10 who remain convinced that NCP is the option to go for. They argue only NCP can help deal with the Irish border issue and get the Government through next month’s crucial Commons votes on the customs union. They warn: “No NCP, no Brexit.”The fear among Brexiteers is Mrs May will use this Chequers meeting to try to push through a modified version of NCP. They fear the reason the whole Cabinet will be present on the second day is to give Mrs May the numbers to do this if the Brexit inner Cabinet remains split on the issue.Doing this, though, would be extremely risky. It would leave Mrs May with a policy that neither her Brexit Secretary nor her International Trade Secretary support.THE Chancellor and the Defence Secretary aren’t just split over how much money the military should get, but what it should be spent on, too.One Cabinet ally of Philip Hammond’s complains that Gavin Williamson wants to “spend the money on uniformed officers when he should be spending it on robotics and the like”.Their view is that this would be a better response to the 21st-century security challenges Britain faces.But in truth, Britain needs both conventional and new, hi-tech forces if it is to respond to the variety of threats now out of there. That is why we MUST spend more on defence.Those close to Williamson point out that if the Government doesn’t increase the defence budget, our status as the leading military spender in Europe – upon which so much of our influence in the world depends – will be under threat as the French and the Germans increase their military budgets.NEXT week, Theresa May will give a speech setting out the Government’s post-Brexit industrial strategy.Key to this must be artificial intelligence, an area where we are one of the leading nations in the world.I understand that the importance of maintaining the UK’s edge in AI is what led to Mrs May accepting Home Secretary Sajid Javid and Digital Secretary Matt Hancock’s argument that visa rules for tech entrepreneurs must be relaxed.The countries that succeed at AI will end up defining this century.So any deal with the EU must preserve the UK’s ability to regulate these industries of the future in a way decided by us, not Brussels.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

She could be the most important discovery of the 21st Century.The bodies were handed over to the Inkari Institute in Cusco, Peru, in April 2017.The institute investigates archaeological discoveries connected to the Inca civilisation.Unlike the other bodies, “Maria” was much larger, had all her organs, finger and toe prints.Thierry Jamin, president of the Inkari institute, believes Maria could have been a hybrid between a human and an alien race - known as the Greys - but Steve has dismissed this claim.Another body, possibly that of a four-year-old child, also had three fingers and toes all the bodies were covered in a strange white powder.Steve and fellow researcher Barry Fitzgerald flew out to the south American country in July last year to interview key players.During their trip they were taken to a secret location high in the Andes to see the different sized bodies for themselves.Dressed in surgical gowns, they examined X Rays and the bodies themselves.It comes after press conference was held in Lima back in March to announce the discovery to the worlds media - before any DNA results were known.Steve believes “Maria” is the only real body among the mysterious  collection - but believes she may have been professionally altered by grave robbers so she would be worth more on the black market.We set most of our investigation on Maria as she is clearly a body, not a mummy as listed many times because she has her internal organs,” he said.Our scientists and professors of Genetech Laboratory in Sri Lanka confirm that Maria has a very unusual DNA. “It has been discovered that she is 98.5% primate, (like humans) 1.5% unknown. She also has a huge mutation in her genes that cannot be identified to any known disease.The grave robbers dug up a body 1400-1800 years old and more than likely had her professionally altered not knowing she was already special due to her DNA. “This could represent a new form of human. “An amazing scientific discovery that may be lost to the world due to human greed.”Steve believes Marias eye sockets may have been altered by a professional taxidermist so she looks like she has wider eyes and had finger bones.She also has an elongated skull - but Steve believes this is dues to the boarding process - where babies were tied to boards in order to stretch out their skulls.However he believes some remarkable features such as horizontal dermal ridges, an absence of ears and large lower canine teeth - are real.Steve says that his team are the only ones who have managed to obtain authentic DNA results.He said: ”Samples were taken by doctors in Peru that were guided by our scientists. A full chain of custody obtained. “We believe we are the only ones with a chain of custody. Without this, the DNA samples cannot be proven to be the correct ones and untampered. “Simply, without chain of custody, any analysis is pointless. We got this.When viewing scans, photos, videos and X-rays, our scientists could not identify any anatomical alteration. That does not mean it does not exist.”The bodies were also covered in diatomaceous earth which Steve believes was purposely applied to the bodies to possibly cover up evidence of alteration.Steve says that during his trip he uncovered a thriving black market ring to illegally pillage graves and create unusual looking creatures and pass them off as “aliens”.He says there is now a £1million price tag on Marias head on the international black market.We took on this case to disprove many of the unscientific claims that these mysterious bodies were in fact extraterrestrial in origin, and we have managed to do exactly that - except for the large Maria body.Steve and Barry are now desperately trying to have Maria released to the Peruvian government.He said: We were in communications with the Mayor of Nazca who wants the bodies released and placed in a museum in Nazca. “Authorities continue to search for the bodies and had even developed a task force called Task Force Wawita.We know where these bodies are being kept and the preservation of these bodies is extremely important. “The bodies are degenerating fast. Also there are a number of other parties hellbent of convincing the general public that all the bodies represent living and breathing hybrid reptilian aliens. “This is simply not true and must end. Lab reports by others involved are questionable and even the credentials of doctors involved. “The amazing discovery within the DNA of Maria deserves the upmost academic attention and nothing less.Steve and Barry are producing a three-part documentary revealing their findings.Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

It is staggering that the ­Government is still undecided on ­fundamental principles.But the Tories’ woes were hugely exacerbated by their election calamity, caused in part by Remainers hoping Labour would betray Brexit.That emboldened diehards in the Lords and Commons — operating alongside the lavishly-funded, slickly orchestrated campaign colluding with Brussels to annul the biggest vote in our history.Meanwhile the national conversation has degenerated into a tsunami of hate, chiefly from sanctimonious Remainers branding Leavers uneducated racists.How much better off we would all now be if on June 24, 2016 they had grudgingly accepted defeat and pledged instead to make the best of Brexit.In fairness, some Remainers did. TV’s Richard Madeley spoke for them recently when he said we now had a duty to see it through in full by leaving the single market and customs union.He was right. To pretend that Brexit can be “softened” to honour the substantial Remain vote — a nightmarish fudge which Boris Johnson warns of today — is simply dishonest. There is leaving and there is remaining. That’s it.Brussels has revelled in Britain tearing itself apart. Now it is sidetracked by its own problems. A deal looks miles off.Theresa May has only one path forward. At next month’s pivotal vote, she must defeat the backbench rebellion hoping to shackle us to a customs union restricting our trading future. That is not Brexit, as voters would quickly realise. It would reignite the Leave ­campaign with unprecedented ferocity.And the PM and her Cabinet must not be derailed by Remain-fanatic businesses muttering about pulling out. Previous such threats have proved bogus, like all those dire economic forecasts.Leaving may not be smooth in the short-term. That must not deter us.When the EU finally realises Brexit in full is inevitable maybe they will stop playing games and agree a deal.But if the Remain resistance succeeds in crippling Brexit, it will bring on chaos.Our current divisions will seem like happy hour. And it will be their fault.HEARTBREAKING, isn’t it, to see Argentina in disarray and the Germans wobbling at the World Cup?

I’m out of here.”Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith has told Mrs May to turn the tables on “bullying” Eurocrats when she returns to Brussels this week.He believes she is in her strongest ­position yet to get them to discuss their relationship with Britain when we leave on March 29 next year.In the 15 months since Article 50 was triggered, they have refused to discuss trade while our own MPs argued among themselves.But Mrs May’s hand was strengthened last week after she saw off the rebels to get the EU Withdrawal Bill through ­Parliament.Tory MP Mr Duncan Smith warned she must show her mettle as she faces the biggest test of any PM in peacetime at next week’s Brussels showdown.He told The Sun on Sunday: “Theresa May now has the upper hand in these talks.They have been watching us fight among ourselves over Brexit for months and didn’t have to do anything because her position was so weak.“They knew there was an outside chance it wouldn’t happen, so they’ve dug in on all the practical stuff such as trade and bogged us down with other details.“But now it has been voted through. We are leaving. They cannot stop it.“I’ve advised Theresa to tell them bluntly to agree to talk about trade or she is leaving.“If they refuse to engage, she must have the resolve to get up and leave the table — making clear she will take our ­£40billion contribution with her.“Theresa must put her cards on the table and tell them she wants to talk about trade now.“If they tell her they don’t want to, she should put her business card on the table and say ‘Tell you what.There’s my ­number. Give me a buzz if you change your minds.Meanwhile, we’ve got nothing more to say to you’.“Then she should turn to her aides and say, ‘We can catch the ten past six if we hurry now.Can you get some cars because we’re on our way.We’ve got work to do. Nice to see you all. OK, guys. Take care. Goodbye!’“That will bring them to their senses rather quickly.“The 27 other EU countries are desperate for a deal so they can sell us their cars, cheeses and potato products.“They’ve tried to push us around for the past couple of years but Theresa has the upper hand now and she must show them who’s boss.”Slamming the way EU officials have treated Britain as “disgusting”, Mr Duncan Smith said: “Undiplomatic doesn’t begin to cover it.“They’ve done their level best to ­humiliate and be rude to us. They are meant to be our friends and allies.”Singling out chief negotiator Michel Barnier, European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker and ­European Parliament co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, he added: “Come this week, we can tell them their days of behaving like ­playground bullies are over.”He said Wednesday’s flagship vote was THE most significant bill passed in the Commons since the treaty to join the fledgling ­European Economic Community in 1973.Crucially, it removes any chance of Brexit being derailed and the clock really has begun ticking towards our departure in 278 days.Brexiteers now warn that the PM must finalise a deal by November, to leave time to clear it all by February.Mr Duncan Smith said: “She is in a stronger position than she’s been in for some months.Getting the most critical bit of legislation through last week means she goes to the European Council knowing our departure is now settled.“That means she is back in charge of the negotiation and there is no way they can stop Brexit.“Now it’s down to raw negotiation, and the question facing the EU is how much they want to have a good relationship.“We do, and the Prime Minister has been open about that. But she has to be ready to walk away.“I’ve done negotiations in business and that’s what you do. You say, ‘There’s nothing on the table that I can agree to here. Sorry, I’m off’.“Never buy a car until you’ve attempted to walk out of the showroom at least twice.There is no better way to get the price down than to say, ‘I’m off, it’s too expensive, I’ll go somewhere else.’It’s not so much calling their bluff. It’s calling them out.“It’s kind of like poker — and Theresa has to force them to show their hand.”Last week’s decision to pump an extra £20billion into the NHS — partly funded by savings from EU contributions — will also send a clear message to Brussels that Britain is leaving.Mr Duncan Smith said: “It’s a down-payment that says we have to leave.“It shows she knows we’re leaving and we won’t be paying them any more money after a set time.”But has Mrs May got what it takes to face down the Brussels bully boys?Mr Duncan Smith said: “I think she has the steel to surprise them.“We’ve seen before what she’s like when she really digs her heels in.

She went to sleep and wrote the essay in the morning after her brain processed the information while she was sleeping, the headmistress said.Researcher Fran Knight, of University College London, who is monitoring the experiment, has found the teenagers are getting an extra hour’s sleep, falling asleep at the same time as before, around 11pm, but waking at 8am, rather than 6.45am, with many reporting being less grumpy and able to focus better.The Sun Online has contact Queen Annes school for comment."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415917138.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"erdogan claims victory in turkey elections as figures show president has over 50 of the vote","story":"The 64-year-olds victory brings with it a new system granting the president sweeping new powers which critics say will cement what they call a one-man rule.The vote - held more than a year early - completes Turkeys transition from a parliamentary government system to a presidential one following a referendum last year.Erdogan delivered his victory speech to flag-waving supporters from the balcony of his ruling AK Partys headquarters in Ankara shortly after 3am.He said: Starting tomorrow, we will start working to realise the promises we made our people.“The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens.Erdogan also pledged that authorities, who have waged a nationwide crackdown since a failed military coup two years ago, would act more decisively against terrorist organisations.WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR...The president added that Turkish forces would continue to liberate Syrian lands so that the 3.5 million Syrian refugees in Turkey could return home safely.Erdogans victory paves the way for another five-year term and under the new constitution, he could serve a further term from 2023, taking him to 2028.Supreme Election Council head Sadi Guven said early on Monday, 97.7 per cent of votes had been counted and declared Erdogan the winner.Guven said that based on unofficial results, five parties passed the threshold of 10 per cent of votes required for parties to enter parliament.Cheering Erdogan supporters waving Turkish flags gathered outside the presidents official residence in Istanbul, chanting: Heres the president, heres the commander.Cihan Yigici, an Erdogan supporter in the crowd, said: Justice has been served!Left wing rival Muharrem Ince, who won 31% of the vote, has yet to officially concede defeat.His Republican Peoples Party said it believed the election could go to a second round, moments before Erdogan claimed victory.Thousands of jubilant supporters of the pro-Kurdish Peoples Democratic Party, or HDP, also spilled into the streets of Diyarbakir after unofficial results showed the party coming in third.The party received 11.5 per cent of the legislative vote - surpassing the 10 percent threshold needed to enter parliament.Supporters of Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan attend his election rally in IstanbulThe HDPs performance was a particular success since presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas, eight more of its lawmakers and thousands of party members campaigned from jails and prisons.HDP says more than 350 of its election workers have been detained since April 28.The imprisoned Demirtas, who has been jailed pending trial on terrorism-related charges, was in third place in the presidential race with 8.3 per cent of the vote, according to Anadolu.Revellers waved HDP flags and blared car horns, while one supporter, Nejdet Erke, said he had been waiting for this emotion since morning.Erdogan insisted the expanded powers of the Turkish presidency will bring prosperity and stability to the country, especially after a failed military coup attempt in 2016.A state of emergency imposed after the coup remains in place.Some 50,000 people have been arrested and 110,000 civil servants have been fired under the emergency, which opposition lawmakers say Erdogan has used to stifle dissent.The new system of government abolished the office of prime minister and empowers the president to take over an executive branch and form the government.He will appoint ministers, vice presidents and high-level bureaucrats, issue decrees, prepare the budget and decide on security policies.The Turkish Parliament will legislate and have the right to ratify or reject the budget.With Erdogan remaining at the helm of his party, a loyal parliamentary majority could reduce checks and balances on his power unless the opposition can wield an effective challenge.The presidents critics have warned that Erdogans re-election would cement his already firm grip on power and embolden a leader they accuse of showing increasingly autocratic tendencies."},{"url":"https://www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/NINTCHDBPICT000415673322.jpg?strip=all\u0026amp;w=960","title":"meet the pooches worlds ugliest dogs","story":"There was some fur-ocious competition, but thanks to her giant lolling tongue, English bulldog Zsa Zsa had it licked — winning the first prize of 1,500 dollars at the annual event in California on Saturday.Organiser Christy Gentry said: “It’s a fun and daft way to advocate that all animals deserve a safe, loving home.”AMY JONES brings you some of the leading mutt ugly contenders in the pack. Our journalists strive for accuracy but on occasion we make mistakes.

On the contrary, it is more compassionate because it gives pupils the space to learn and grow.“Our pupils welcomed the change because it relieved them of the burden of being online the whole time.“They found they had more freedom, more time for contemplation. ‘We don’t miss our phones at all,’ a group of Year 9 pupils told me.”The ban sees pupils in years seven, eight and nine, (approximately from ages 11-14) required to hand their phones in to teachers at the start of the day. They are then returned at the end of lessons.Year 10 pupils are required to have three days a week of ‘detox’ from their handsets while older boys are forced to spend a day a week away from their mobiles.Mr Cairns credited the ban with improving the sleep of boarders and says it makes it much easier for teachers to identify possible victims of bullying, which is often hidden from view in cyberspace.He added that he hoped other schools across the country would follow suit.It comes as Culture Secretary Matt Hancock called for mobile phones to be banned from schools.The Minister hailed headteachers who do not allow the devices and called for more to “follow their lead”.He warned that mobiles could have a real impact on students achievements, but insisted the Government would not legislate to outlaw their use.He told the Daily : There are a number of schools across the country that simply dont allow them.While it is up to individual schools to decide rather than Government, I admire head teachers who do not allow mobiles to be used during the school day.

They didn\u0027t address the problems or find solutions.:: EU leaders hold \u0027frank and open\u0027 talks at emergency migration summitEurope\u0027s migration policy doesn\u0027t work - the asylum burden remains on frontier countries like Italy and Greece to take the strain. And the returns policy doesn\u0027t work - failed asylum seekers (economic migrants) are not being returned home - either because their home country won\u0027t take them or because the EU country they are in fails to deport them often it\u0027s both.So they are left to live in an unpleasant illegal limbo.I am in touch with a number of people who I met through the years as I\u0027ve reported on migration.They have repeatedly been rejected for asylum and yet they are still here, trying again. The \u0027populist\u0027 and anti-establishment governments who secured power because of the 2015 failures have now politicised the issue and are forcing fundamental change.The paradox being that while the optics are of boatloads still arriving, the figures show that arrivals are a fraction of the number they were.This has caused ructions all over the place: :: Germany:: The Italian \u0027populists\u0027France and Italy have been lobbing insults at each other over the migrant issue. It\u0027s extremely unusual for two such central players in the EU to be at loggerheads.It\u0027s a useful demonstration of how the Italian \u0027populists\u0027 roll and it\u0027s playbook-Trump stuff.The two men who call the shots in Rome - Matteo Salvini and Luigi Di Miao, the figureheads of the two coalition parties and both now deputy prime ministers - used their vast social media presence to appeal to their support base by denouncing the what they termed the arrogance of the French president (who had dared to suggest that the migration crisis was largely a political row rather than an actual crisis).An aside: Emmanuel Macron cast himself as anti-establishment when he won the presidency just over a year ago (was it only a year ago!?). Now he feels firmly establishment and up against the real mavericks in Italy. :: The migrants on the MedAn ever-growing number of charity rescue ships are stacking up in the Mediterranean with hundreds of rescued migrants on board waiting for a country to accept them.Italy and Malta are essentially playing chicken with them: each country holding the line not accepting the boats until an imminent danger to life forces them to.It\u0027s tough, reckless, maybe even illegal but, frankly, it\u0027s been effective in forcing the issue onto the table at EU level.Italy has made it clear that it isn\u0027t willing to deal with this issue alone.This short film which we made 18 months ago is an attempt to explain what\u0027s happening on the Med - nothing\u0027s changed since we filmed it. Watch it below. The discussion at EU leader level seems to be going round in circles. They are talking this week about issues they were talking about three years ago: \u0027hotspots\u0027 to process asylum seekers, asylum centers outside the EU, beefing up the external borders.There is no single solution and any discussion must begin with an acceptance that you can\u0027t stop migration.

We wouldn\u0027t swap him for anyone in the tournament in terms of number nines.\"He went on to say that he is \"very confident\" that Kane will continue to deliver.\"You know that when he gets opportunities he\u0027s going to bury them. You sit there very confident in his ability to take chances,\" he said.\"He\u0027s not just a player that stands up front and waits for chances and that\u0027s important within the ethic of the team we\u0027re trying to create,\" he added.England won the game with the most goals the team have ever scored in a World Cup finals match.The two penalties and a deflection from Harry Kane, two headers from John Stones and a strike from Jesse Lingard left Panama behind.Kane\u0027s hat-trick was the first for England at the World Cup finals since 1986 and it made the captain the first England player to score five goals in the group stage.Many are already tipping him for the tournament\u0027s golden boot - the player who scores the most goals in the World Cup finals.Southgate joked that part of the reason he was pleased with Kane\u0027s hat-trick was that it meant the captain would be less annoyed when he was taken off the pitch during the game. Some of England\u0027s players were able to spend Monday morning relaxing after their emphatic victory, with none of the side which started against Panama in Nizhny Novgorod taking part of the light session back at Zelenogorsk.England player Jesse Lingard was among those revelling in England\u0027s victory today, tweeting a picture of his successful strike with a tornado emoji and the hashtag #JLingz.As the team heads towards their Thursday clash with Belgium, Southgate commented: \"I\u0027ve heard talk of, \u0027Is it better to finish first or second?\u0027 I am not sure how we\u0027re going to work all of that out really so let\u0027s just go and enjoy the game again.\"It\u0027s nice that it\u0027s a game where we\u0027re not up to our neck in pressure.\"We have got some decisions to make because the harmony of the group is important to me.\"   England are now currently level with Belgium on goal difference."},{"url":"https://e3.365dm.com/16/09/2048x1152/c9acd19b5862641864cd5a0c26dd75ec3fda9de2eb818a1d308797068c1674a4_3784790.jpg?20160912122747 ","title":"sicario 2s benicio del toro its about making the right moral choice","story":"In an illegal covert operation, Alejandro is hired by the Americans to kidnap Isabela, a Mexican kingpin\u0027s young daughter, to inflame the conflict between cartels.As CIA agent Matt Graver, played by Josh Brolin, tells him: \"You\u0027re going to help us start a war\u0026#8230 With everyone.\"But Del Toro explains that this is a character driven film, centred around one man doing the right thing rather than an exploration of drug wars and immigration.\"The heart of this film for me is really seeing how a heartless hitman could suddenly have a conscience and it\u0027s partly though his actions - getting a medicine through what he\u0027s doing to an innocent girl - which is a mirror of what happened to his own daughter, and that journey shatters the shell around his heart. \"When he\u0027s given the order to get rid of the girl he does the right thing - makes the right moral choice.\"And to up the stakes, Isabela\u0027s father is not just any cartel kingpin - he\u0027s the man who in the first film murdered Alejandro\u0027s entire family.As the film shows illegal immigrants being trafficked over the border by the busload, it\u0027s impossible to ignore the parallels with the current US immigration debate.Del Toro says: \"To me, the fact that these characters exist in that [border] world makes it a character driven piece\u0026#8230In the film there is often a very fine line between the \"good guys\" and the \"bad guys\", with governments, police, soldiers and criminals all fighting their own private battles.Del Toro explains: \"I think in a way you start rooting for [Brolin\u0027s] character and my character, but they started the fire. It\u0027s like - they look like they\u0027re putting out the fire, but they were the arsonists.\"That\u0027s what stories do, it plays with that expectation, and I think that\u0027s done cleverly by the writer Taylor Sheridan. I can watch a movie like Frankenstein and I root for Frankenstein but is he the monster really?

The future king is visiting a country founded in the dying days of the British Empire and where the ghosts of our shared past still loom large.  This is the first official visit by a member of the Royal Family to the state of Israel since it was founded 70 years’ ago. Prince Charles has been to Israel for the funerals of the former prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and the late president Shimon Peres but until this week the Palace and the Foreign Office had rejected multiple invitations by the Israeli Government for an official trip. Prince William’s itinerary has been meticulously planned to avoid, as far as possible, any diplomatic controversy.  His five-day tour of the Middle East began in Jordan and will end in Palestine to emphasis the visit is politically neutral. Meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Reuven Rivlin have been carefully balanced by an audience with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas when the Prince travels to Ramallah. Yet William cannot escape either Britain’s past or Israel’s troubled history since its foundation. Tonight he will stay in the King David Hotel in Jerusalem where in 1946 Zionist insurgents fighting for independence killed dozens of British soldiers charged with maintaining peace in the protectorate. When the UK agreed to hand over control of the region to the United Nations two years\u0027 later there was resentment that we were more interested in protecting our interests in neighbouring Arab countries than helping the founding of Israel. The fact that the British royal family has made frequent visits to Saudi Arabia in the intervening years has done little to change this perception among Israelis.

The Prime Minister is so strongly behind the plan to grow Britain\u0027s biggest air transit hub, one of her ministers, Greg Hands , has already quit the government in order to vote against it.  And Boris Johnson is currently in an unspecified foreign nation, in a conveniently timed overseas trip, so the famously anti-expansion Foreign Secretary can hold on to his job without having to go back on his promises. But Theresa May hasn\u0027t always been a big fan of Heathrow Airport expansion. In fact, before she was Prime Minister, she was staunchly against the idea. The PM - whose Maidenhead seat is in Heathrow Airport\u0027s flight path - made an audacious bid to wipe her long-lived bias from history. But it was on the internet and, of course, the internet never forgets.  A simple check using archive tools shows how a string of critical statements were unceremoniously deleted from her constituency website.  She said locals would be devastated by a third runway and there were no planes currently on the market that would meet green targets. She added in the 16 January 2009 post: A third runway will result in thousands of additional flights, increased noise and more pollution for thousands of people. We need a better Heathrow, not a bigger Heathrow.” So her view was clear and the post was still up on the site as late as May 2015. But after that, it mysteriously disappeared - and now brings up a \u0027not found\u0027 error message.  It\u0027s not a one-off either. In March 2008 she warned the evasive government had already made up its mind on expanding Heathrow. But some time before January 2016, that too was deleted.  What does the PM say about changing her tune on Heathrow? The Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman said today: I think the PM has set out on a number of occasions why she believes expanding Heathrow is the right decision for Britain. She thinks it sends out an important message about global Britain and making the most of the opportunities that lie ahead of us.” Asked if Mrs MAy still thinks her constituents will be ‘devastated’ by a third runway? “As I say you can look to the Prime Minister’s various comments on why it is the right decision to take.

And an MP not voting doesn\u0027t necessarily mean they have abstained - a deliberate choice to withhold their vote. Here\u0027s a round up of the reasons your MP might not have voted.  The Speaker of the House of Commons and his or her deputies are members of political parties.

Defence Minister Guto Bebb lashed out at \u0027inflammatory\u0027 Tories for attacking business - while Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom rebuked Theresa May\u0027s customs plan. Firstly Mr Bebb criticised Tories who had turned on firms for warning about the impact of Brexit. Jeremy Hunt said Airbus was completely inappropriate for threatening to leave the UK. And Boris Johnson reportedly said f*** business! at a reception. But Mr Bebb told the BBC: The dismissive attitudes shown towards our business community by senior Cabinet ministers is both unworthy and inflammatory.”  Mr Bebb added: Do the leadership aspirations of multi-millionaires trump the need to listen to the employers and employees of this country?” Both Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt are millionaires - and both have held ambitions for leadership. Business Secretary Greg Clark sided with Mr Bebb today, telling MPs Airbus was entitled to be listened to with respect. Downing Street was forced to defend its position today amid the row. Asked about Jeremy Hunt\u0027s comments, Theresa May\u0027s spokesman said: If individual companies or others choose to make their views public, that is up to them.   But he refused to comment on Boris Johnson\u0027s alleged remarks, saying: Well look, I don\u0027t see what I can usefully add on some sort of alleged anonymous briefing of a remark that may or may not have been made. I think the fact we\u0027ve had 2,500 meeting would suggest to you we\u0027re engaging with business.  Meanwhile fresh splits opened at Cabinet level as a minister publicly shot down one of Theresa May\u0027s two options for customs after Brexit. Andrea Leadsom, the Leader of the Commons, claimed the PM\u0027s preferred model of a customs partnership was bureaucratic, unwieldy and impractical. She added: The problem with complications, particularly for businesses, they are not keen on more bureaucracy, more red tape. That is potentially a less attractive option for businesses themselves. Instead she urged the PM to pick the Brexiteers\u0027 favoured \u0027Max Fac\u0027 option - even though civil servants have warned it could cost \u0026pound20billion a year. Asked about Ms Leadsom\u0027s criticism, No10 insisted the \u0027customs partnership\u0027 remained on the table. But the Prime Minister\u0027s spokesman admitted: More work needed to be done in relation to that model. That work is being conducted by a working group. More work is being done on both options. That remains the position. The EU has as a customs union. This means the 28 member states trade EU goods for free - and set an equal tariff on non-EU goods. For example, US car imports to the EU carry a 10% tariff. Being in the customs union benefits the UK, because the EU is our largest trading partner and it prevents lorry checks at the border. But Theresa May wants the UK to leave the customs union because otherwise, Britain will have to follow EU rules and cannot strike trade deals around the world. She is considering two options. Customs partnership: This would see Britain collect tariffs on all imports on behalf of the EU. If the UK tariff is lower than the EU one, then firms would be able to reclaim the difference. Maximum Facilitation - \u0027Max Fac\u0027: This would use high-tech tracking devices to monitor the flow of goods. Businesses would operate as “trusted traders” and would be able to pay any tariffs at regular intervals rather than every time they cross a border."},{"url":null,"title":"11 best spots uk watch","story":"Advertorial11 best spots in the UK to watch an amazing sunset this summerThis week marks the summer solstice – and is also the official start of summer.

June 21, the summer solstice in the Northern Hemisphere, is the longest day in the year - affording us approximately 17 hours of daylight. Technically, this also means that the nights will start drawing in again now - so there\u0027s really no time like the present to get out and explore the great outdoors on some of the country’s most breathtaking bike rides. We\u0027ve taken a look around the UK to find the best places to watch the sun setting. 1. Museum of Scottish Lighthouses, Fraserburgh, Scotland  A small village called Maud in Aberdeenshire offers a starting place for a traffic-free cycle to the coast. If you\u0027re in the mood to learn then head to the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in Fraserburgh. The sun will set at around 10.12pm this week in this part of Scotland, so you\u0027ve got loads of time to enjoy the start of the summer. Bike need replacing?   If your existing bike needs replacing, you\u0027ll want something efficient and speedy for the roads - like the Carrera Parva Hybrid bike , which comes in versions for both men and women and is now just \u0026pound210 (a saving of \u0026pound90). And if you don\u0027t need a new bike, why not have yours checked over before setting off. Like any mode of transport your bike needs to be looked after and regularly checked for wear and tear. Halfords offers a 32-point Free Bike Check which includes:  Frame, saddle and handlebar Wheels including tyres, rims, spokes and hubs Brake system including levers, calipers, pads and cables / hoses Drivetrain including gears, levers, chain, bottom bracket, cranks and cables  2. The Eden Project, Cornwall   Why not spend the day enjoying the amazing sights at the Eden Project? Best of all, if you arrive by bike you\u0027ll get a discount on entry. The sun sets on Eden at around 9:30pm on the solstice. Bear in mind though that the Eden Project shuts at 6pm, so you\u0027ll need to watch the sun go down somewhere nearby.  Get there in style on the Carrera Subway 1 Hybrid Bike , \u0026pound300. With easy to use 24 speed Shimano gearing, your effort for building speed will be minimised on all terrains, while its lightweight aluminium frame means you can quickly and efficiently ride to your destination. Camping out?   Planning to camp? Be sure you book in advance as you won\u0027t want to be without a pitch. Croft Farm Holiday Park is just a mile from the Eden Project and three miles from the beach. Pentewan Sands is also nearby and boasts amazing family facilities - as well as the nearby Pentewan Cycle Trail. Consider taking a Halfords Vis A Vis 4 Person Tent with you, which is currently reduced to just \u0026pound60, (was \u0026pound150, save \u0026pound90). The simple tunnel design is easy to pitch in approximately 20 minutes. With two separate bedrooms and a living area, it\u0027s perfect for families or groups of friends. For additional comfort pack an Urban Escape Folding Table And Bench Set , \u0026pound40 (was \u0026pound50, save \u0026pound10) which folds down into a single carry case to make it easy to transport and store.  3. Pembrokeshire Coast National Park, Wales  The Pembrokeshire Coast Path is an absolutely beautiful part of Wales and a stunning place to watch the sun go down. There are loads of campsites in the area, including some unique places to stay. There are plenty of bike routes too, with some offering traffic-free options if you want a more peaceful ride. In Pembrokeshire you can expect the sun to set around 9:39pm. Why not try..   The Boardman ADV 8.8 Adventure Bike , \u0026pound750, is a bike truly made to help you explore new possibilities. This bike is adept at riding in comfort on roads but really excels when you want to get off the beaten track.   4. White Nancy, Cheshire   Located on Kerridge Hill, White Nancy is a local landmark from which you can see all around the area, from Wales to the west and the Pennines to the north. From time to time White Nancy is painted to look like other things, like a Christmas pudding or with Olympic rings when London hosted in 2012. The sun will set over White Nancy at around 9:36 this week. Need to drive?  Heading further afield to enjoy the sunny days? If you\u0027re packing up the whole family into the car for a camping trip, make sure it\u0027s in good running order first. A Free Car Check performed by Halfords experts will put your mind at rest. Book online or just pop in to your local Halfords store and trained colleagues will carry out a free car bulb check and check your battery, wiper blades, engine oil level and air conditioning, and check for any windscreen chips. They\u0027ll even give you a free screenwash top-up too.  If you\u0027re making an unfamiliar journey, don\u0027t forget to get the Garmin Drive Sat Nav , \u0026pound79.99 (was \u0026pound99.99, save \u0026pound20.99). With lifetime map updates you\u0027re never going to find yourself driving down a newly-closed street or down a disused road. 5. Edinburgh Castle, Scotland  There are few places that are as stunning as Edinburgh Castle, located atop Castle Rock. The views of Edinburgh from the castle are amazing, and a great place to watch the end of the day roll around. Sunset here will take place at 9:58pm. 6. Hampstead Heath, London  The scenery on Hampstead Heath always pleases the eye. This amazing part of London has views of every landmark you could hope for and it\u0027s a wonderful place to watch the sun go down. This will happen at around 9:18pm in the capital.   7. Osborne House, Isle of Wight   The home of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert is quite a sight to see. Accessible by bike (and ferry, if you\u0027re not an island resident), it\u0027s the ideal place to see during the day before you settle down somewhere to watch the sunset. If you\u0027re up for the cycle, Shanklin Chine on the west of the island is well worth an evening visit.

Remember, you\u0027re British!”, screamed the officer to HMS Spartan gunner Ron Douglas as a massive German bomb ripped into the British warship. The Luftwaffe had just launched an anti-shipping glide bomb attack on the fleet, with radio-controlled missiles and the ship was sinking fast. But when the order was made to abandon ship, there was one problem for 18-year Ron...he couldn’t swim. Now 93, Ron was one of the lucky ones and is believed to be one of the last known survivors of HMS Spartan. Five officers and 41 enlisted men were posted killed or missing presumed killed, and 42 enlisted men were wounded after the bombing on January 29, 1944, during World War II.  Memories of that awful night still haunt Ron and he has barely spoken about it until now. Fresh from a naval training base in Portsmouth in late 1943, Douglas had never seen live action before. Sitting in his room, legs crossed with a cup of tea in his hand, he recalls the day in 1943 when his conscription papers arrived at his home in Glasgow, Scotland. “My mother came to see me one day, crying. She said, ‘It’s your papers. You\u0027ve got to go to Portsmouth’. I said, ‘Where\u0027s that?’ and she told me it’s over 400 miles away, and that I needed to report to the barracks there.” At that time, the apprentice plumber had never been farther than a mile from his home. “They put me on a train to London with my conscription papers. I was scared as hell.” Douglas commuted straight to Portsmouth to start his basic training as a naval gunner.  “They called all the new recruits into a room, and a senior officer told us, ‘You\u0027re now in the British Royal Navy. You may have broken your mother\u0027s heart, but you won\u0027t break mine. I\u0027m your mother now.’ That\u0027s how they spoke to you,” said Douglas. A few months later, he was issued assignment papers and instructed to board the HMS Spartan, a brand new Dido-class light cruiser warship that had been commissioned only six months before Douglas stepped foot on it. The Spartan left Portsmouth and made several stops in the Mediterranean prior to anchoring in Anzio Bay, Italy, to provide anti-aircraft support. Douglas knew he was going to Italy because the Germans were there. But that’s about all he knew. When the Spartan arrived, it joined a group of battlecruisers in Operation Single as part of the Battle of Anzio. It was around 7pm on January 29, 1944, and the sun had just gone down.   Outrage as Kensington Palace\u0027s \u0026pound24million mega-basement plans approved despite \u0027flouting council rules\u0027  Douglas was stationed at his gun placement on an upper deck of the anchored Spartan, preparing to bombard German ramparts along the beachhead. Our ships started coming in closer together in the bay, and I knew something was up. Then the air-raid siren went off on one of our destroyers, and all guns pointed to the sky.” He looked up to see two squadrons of German fighter planes coming right at them in a V-shape formation. They were part of the German Luftwaffe, and the first enemy aircraft Douglas had ever seen. “They sounded like a hornet\u0027s nest,” recalls Douglas. “My guns had ammunition belts and were ready to go. I’d never seen action before, and I\u0027m sitting there gung-ho but scared out of my mind. My ranking officer announced, ‘Enemy aircraft approaching from the south. Guns at the ready. Await order to fire.’” As Douglas awaited the order, he could see rows of bullets puncturing the surface of the Mediterranean Sea like a flame racing through gasoline. The Luftwaffe was launching an anti-shipping glide bomb attack on the fleet, with radio-controlled missiles released at a distance and guided towards their target via a remote-controlled rocket engine.  “Hold it..,” commanded the officer before adding a sentence that Douglas has replayed in his mind ever since. “Don\u0027t panic! Remember, you\u0027re British,” said the officer with a voice as calm as brushed velvet. “Don\u0027t panic?” balked Douglas at the memory of it. “I’m 18, sitting in an elevated gun placement on a battleship with 0.5-inch machine guns in a four-gun mounting, and I’m watching German fighter planes getting closer and closer—firing at us. They had armour-piercing bullets that could tear up our deck. “When we got the order to return fire, all hell broke loose. I\u0027m shooting and the sight on my gun is vibrating like crazy. I couldn\u0027t see if I hit any of the planes as they were travelling at 400 miles an hour.” When the Spartan shook from bow to stern, Douglas knew they had been hit. “I smelt smoke, and the captain announced that we\u0027d been hit in the bulkhead and had a large hole in the side of the ship. ‘Don\u0027t panic,’ said the ranking officer again. ‘Remember, you’re British!’ “I didn’t know that the ship was sinking. I just knew that it had been hit. They get hit all the time. But when there\u0027s a hole below the waterline, it\u0027s definitely time to panic. There were people running all over the place.” The Spartan had received a direct hit to its boiler room from a radio-controlled Henschel Hs 293 monoplane bomb, travelling at about 200 metres a second. After an hour of failed attempts to distinguish the fire, a general order was given to abandon ship. Unfortunately for Douglas, he was not part of that order. “I took this to mean get off the ship as fast as I could, said Douglas, Because it could explode with the munitions on board. But I was manning machine guns, and told to stay put and keep firing.”  Romford killing: Friends of boy, 15, stabbed to death at birthday party heard screaming and crying \u0027he\u0027s dead, he\u0027s dead\u0027   The Spartan was taking on water fast, which extinguished the fire but caused it to start listing on one side. Douglas donned a lifejacket and continued to man his post. But when the ship started to roll over, he knew there would soon be a point where it would be too late to jump off. “It was very dark, and other people were already in the water, yet I was ordered to keep firing. You can\u0027t abandon your post. The officers in the British Navy were very strict. If you left your post and created danger, they could shoot you.” But the ship was sinking, and all around him people were leaping off the side into the sea. “Once the ship goes down, you don\u0027t have much chance. I said to my mate beside me, ‘If he doesn\u0027t give the order, I\u0027m emptying this ammunition and getting off’. He said, ‘Me too, Scottie. I\u0027ll jump with you’.” Thankfully, it didn’t come down to them being shot on duty after surviving a sinking ship. But when the officer gave the order for his evacuation, Douglas remembered one striking fact. He couldn’t swim. “I told the officer, and he replied, ‘I don\u0027t care. Jump!’” His gun placement was as high as a three-story building, and as he looked down at the rolling waves below he knew he would almost certainly die if he stayed onboard. So he jumped. When he entered the water, his first thought was of his mother. “I thought I was going to die, and was thinking about my mother and if I would ever see her again. The waves were rolling and the water was ice cold. There were guys all around me screaming for help, but I was trying to save my own life and didn\u0027t want to drown.” His lifejacket kept him afloat as the waves pulled him far enough away from the sinking Spartan to avoid being sucked down with it. Now he had to survive the freezing cold and huge waves that dragged him around in the pitch black winter’s night. As events played out, this may have saved his life from the German planes circulating overhead and firing at the men in the water. “There was another guy not far from me, and we held onto each other. I didn’t want him to die either. He said to me, ‘I\u0027m not going to make it, Jock.’ He was crying. Many guys were crying. I told him, “You\u0027ll be alright. We\u0027ll get home to Blighty, don\u0027t worry.’” “But the waves were getting bigger, and we were going up and down. I was so frightened, and shaking like a leaf. I told him that his mother would be coming to meet him at the barracks. It was just my attempt to cheer him up because mothers don\u0027t go near the barracks.” “The waves were rolling so high that I could see one moment and not the next. I was soaking wet, freezing cold and frightened I was going to die.” As he awaited rescue with fellow shipmates, some of whom were injured, the bodies of men who had drowned or been shot or killed in the blast were floating among them. At one point, he looked over at the Spartan as it was turning over, and saw a few people still onboard. After an hour in the water, Douglas started to doubt whether anyone was coming for them. “I didn’t know if we were going to get rescued. I had this little light on my lifejacket, and could see other little lights bobbing up and down in the water.” When he saw a rowing boat coming around to pick the men out of the sea, he starting trying to get to it. “We did the doggy paddle, but it was enough. They pulled me out by my shoulder and my hair—anything to get a grip on me. But it saved my life because some guys never came out at all. They picked out bodies that were floating in the water, but some of them had just sunk.” When he climbed aboard the rescue cruiser, he took a hot shower and was given new clothes and later taken back to the barracks at Portsmouth, debriefed and told he would be getting survivors leave. “I went home to my mother, and she asked, ‘What are you doing here?’ because I\u0027d recently had leave a few months earlier. She knew you didn\u0027t just get leave like that in the forces. So I told her they had given us all special leave. I never told her the truth, and she only found that out from my older brother after the war.” Douglas was glad to get back to his mother in Glasgow, but was soon plagued by nightmares of his ordeal. “Sometimes I would wake up and wonder where I was. My mother would say, ‘You\u0027re at home, and you\u0027re not going back. I\u0027ll stop them from taking you back. She didn\u0027t even want me to leave the house, but I had to go back or the Navy Police would throw me in the slammer.” Both of his older brothers served in the Royal Navy, and during national service he didn’t see either of them for four years because they had leave at different times. “My mother later asked me why I didn\u0027t tell her the truth, and I said that I was afraid she would have given me hell for being on a sunken ship. Honestly, that\u0027s what she was like.”  The following year, Douglas joined the Pacific fleet for the war campaign in Japan. Medical officers vaccinated him for tropical diseases like malaria and beriberi, but did not inform him or the other sailors where they were going. All he knew was that their destination was a central depot in Australia, which would be a jumping-off point for someplace hot and belligerent. There were other sailors onboard who had survived Spartan, but he never once held a conversation with any of them about their ordeal. “I was terrified to get back on a warship again, but we never spoke about it to each other,” he shared. As he was heading to Australia on new assignment, the war came to an end, and Douglas was demobilized and returned to Scotland. He emigrated to Canada in 1954, and soon afterwards met his English-born wife, Edith. They had two children, and he went on to become a trades superintendent with Honeywell. This year, the couple will celebrate 63 years of marriage, and both currently reside at Rockcliffe Care Community in Toronto, which is owned by Sienna Senior Living.  More than seven decades have passed since that day, and Douglas has barely spoken about his time during the war. “My wife knows I was in the navy, but I never spoke much about the war. I don\u0027t talk about it. She didn\u0027t know me when I was a sailor, and found out later during the course of conversation that I was on the Spartan.” "},{"url":null,"title":"england world cup fan gets","story":"NewsEngland World Cup fan gets racist hate mail for putting up St George flagsWARNING OFFENSIVE CONTENT: The 31-year-old Sikh business owner defiantly bought four more flags after the vile letter arrived in the post\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByRosaleen Fenton13:21, 25 JUN 2018Updated13:55, 25 JUN 2018NewsThe anonymous letter was sent after two flags went up at GMS Heating \u0026amp Plumbing (Image: GMS Heating \u0026amp Plumbing)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email A Sikh supporter of England\u0027s World Cup team has received racist hate mail after hanging two St George flags in his shop.

Mum-of-two Amy Stevens said they thought they were going to die and her children were petrified following the horrendous incident.  Amy and partner Lee Jeffrey have no idea why around eight balaclava-clad men should target their  property in Whitleigh, Plymouth, which left children Shanella, aged 11, and Amelia, aged seven, traumatised.   It is believed there was also damage caused to the home of a 96-year-old neighbour during the incident, Plymouth Live reports.   The couple now have a repair bill of more than \u0026pound1,000 but say that pales when they think of what could have happened to their children. Shanella had not long left the bathroom when the window was smashed, showering the room with glass. And if Lee, 33, had not locked the front door of the couple’s flat when he saw the men approaching, the couple fear they could have come inside and caused mayhem. “You can fix a window, but if Lee had not been able to lock the front door in time and my daughter had still been in the bathroom I dread to think what would have happened,” said 31-year-old Amy.  “It was awful, the children are shaking every time there is a knock at the door now, but, to be honest, I am too.” Police are investigating the incident but have yet to identify the men involved or the vehicle they escaped in. They are also trying to work out the motive for the attack. The incident happened in the same street where police are still investigating the cause of a blaze which damaged two cars on June 1. Arson has hot been ruled out.  Amy and Lee have no connection to that incident and are mystified as to why anyone should want to attack their property or the family. The drama unfolded at about 11pm on June 23, when Lee was watching TV in the front room of the ground-floor, two-bedroom flat. “He was on the sofa and heard a massive banging and shouting outside,” said Amy. “He looked out and saw about eight men in balaclavas and rushed to lock the front door.  “Then the men started batting hell out of the windows. The smashed all of them.” She said the front door window, another window and all the panes in the bathroom window were smashed. “It was like something you would see on Crimewatch. “They have caused about \u0026pound1,000 of damage.” Police reacted quickly to the incident as soon as the family rang in.

Along with Prince William, the couple have been known by their official titles ever since, and their children George, Charlotte and Louis have also taken on their title.  But like many other things in the royal family, this will change when the Queen dies .  William and Kate will get new titles to represent them moving up the line of succession.  At the moment, Prince Charles is the Prince of Wales. This title isn\u0027t just his, it\u0027s the title which is traditionally given to the heir to the throne and Charles is the 21st man to be given it. Diana became the Princess of Wales after she married Charles in 1981. Technically, Camilla should now have the title but she turned it down out of respect for Diana. But after the Queen\u0027s death and Prince Charles becomes king, Prince William will become the Prince of Wales and Kate will probably be offered the title of Princess of Wales.  It probably wouldn\u0027t have gone down well with the public if Camilla took the title, but it\u0027s a very different situation with Kate. She might decide she wants to use the name as a tribute to the mother-in-law she never met. Until Wills, Prince Harry won\u0027t get a new title when his grandmother dies as he is much further down the line of succession.  When he married Meghan Markle earlier this year, the Queen gave them the titles the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.  Even though the Duke title has been used before, Meghan is the first Duchess of Sussex because of a rather upsetting course of events surrounding the original.  The original was Prince Augustus Frederick, the son of George III born in 1773. He was university educated and campaigned for the abolition of slavery.

The RSPCA were called to assist officers who were probing the unexplained death of a woman in April last year. The animal charity were first told there were around 30 dogs - but when inspectors arrived they were shocked find a staggering 82 chihuahuas inside. The pooches filled every corner of the filthy and cramped house in Birmingham - including behind kitchen appliances, and had matted coats, fleas and burns.  The dogs were believed to have descended from just one couple - Blue and Tinkerbell - four years ago. As a result of inbreeding, some had serious behavioural issues and were extremely aggressive and unhappy. RSPCA inspector Herchy Boal said: “The officers asked us for help with around 30 dogs but I was busy dealing with another emergency elsewhere. “When they called me again a few hours later they were extremely concerned about the conditions they had found the dogs in, claiming they believed there were actually in excess of 40 small breeds. “When I arrived at the property I found 82 dogs inside.  They literally started appearing from everywhere. We would move the washing machine and suddenly there’d be six faces looking at you. It was incredible where they were able to hide. “The house looked like an earthquake had hit it, everything was higgledy piggledy, it was really chaotic and dirty. “We called out a vet who said the house was too hazardous and the dogs couldn’t stay there, it was filthy and cramped. They were all hiding - barking and snapping at us.” West Midlands Police had launched an investigation after a woman who lived at the property died.  But following their enquiries, they established that there were no suspicious circumstances and that she had died from complications after an accident. All 82 dogs were removed and taken to the charity’s Newbrook Farm Animal Hospital in Birmingham. Staff worked through the night to check over all of the dogs and ensure they received necessary treatment. Inspector Boal said: “We didn’t finish work until 11am the next day. “The woman and her husband, Stephen, had started out with two pet chihuahuas - Blue and Tinkerbell. Unfortunately, they didn’t get their dogs neutered and four years later, they had 82 dogs.  “This was a classic hoarding situation but it was clear the couple had loved their dogs and things had simply got out of hand. “We worked with Stephen to renovate and clean the home while we cared for the dogs. We returned four of the dogs to him and re-homed the rest. “Two of the dogs that went back to Stephen had serious behavioural issues and were extremely aggressive and unhappy. But when we returned them to him they were like different dogs and were so much happier. “This was a really sad case but it was also a really memorable one for me due to the sheer number of dogs involved.  “I really hope we can use this story to make it clear why it’s so important to neuter your pets not only to avoid unwanted litters but also to avoid inbreeding which can result in serious health and behaviour problems in puppies. Multiple dog households are very challenging, and with this job, I had no idea how many dogs I was taking out. They literally started appearing from absolutely everywhere.

Toddler Aaron Cadder was playing in his grandmother\u0027s kitchen when he got hold of the dangerous product and spilt it on his legs, reported the Daily Record.  The corrosive liquid - which is available to buy at supermarkets - soaked through the two-year-old\u0027s trousers causing him to suffer serious burns and a frightening allergic reaction. Mum Paula said when she first saw Aaron in hospital it looked like his face had melted and thought his little one would be left blind.  Paula, 25, from Glasgow , said: “He was in so much pain and never left my side afterwards.   “He looked like an acid attack victim.      “It’s just unimaginable that such a common household product could do so much damage.   “Thankfully Aaron has made a full recovery but he has been left scarred for life.”   Paula, who also has a daughter Kelsey, seven, says her partner Peter, 28, a construction worker, took Aaron for a haircut before heading over to his mum’s house in December last year.  Aaron and his gran Margaret, 63, are extremely close and he stays over once a week.  Paula, a full-time mum, said: “Margaret had been cleaning the oven when Peter and Aaron popped round, so she put the bottle back in the cupboard.      “Then she left the room for a couple of seconds to pop some washing on when Aaron came running after her screaming.   “His little face was red and swollen. When she spotted the oven cleaner on the floor, she realised he must have gotten hold of the bottle and ran his face under cold water.   “She called Peter’s sister, who lives up the road and they took Aaron to Glasgow Royal Infirmary , where Peter and I met them.   “During the car journey, Margaret noticed Aaron was grabbing his legs and when she tried to pull his trousers off to look further, they were stuck.   “She discovered the oven cleaner had soaked through to his legs.”        At hospital, doctors sprayed Aaron’s legs and face with water to remove the cleaner.   Later that day, he was transferred by ambulance to the Royal Hospital for Children to receive specialist care.    Paula said: “When I first saw Aaron’s face, I was shocked – it was so red.   “It looked like his face had melted.   “His eyes had swollen to the size of golf balls and he couldn’t open them.   “I immediately thought he’d be left blind but as soon as I walked towards his hospital bed, he shouted ‘Mummy’.   “It was such a relief that he could see.”    Surgeons took Aaron into theatre where he was given a general anaesthetic so they could remove the dead skin and bandage him up.   Doctors revealed he’d suffered a third-degree burn on his left leg which stretched from his ankle to his groin, and he needed skin grafts to repair the damage.   Thankfully Aaron’s face wasn’t burnt by the cleaner – instead, he’d suffered an allergic reaction which doctors prescribed antibiotics and eye drops for.   And three days after the accident, the little tot underwent two skin grafts in a two-hour operation on his legs.   Paula says: “It was awful, I felt constantly sick with worry and couldn’t stop crying.   “After his operation, Aaron was forced to wear a half cast on his leg so he couldn’t bend it and undo the skin graft.”      After a week in hospital, Aaron was discharged just two days before Christmas day.   Paula said: “He was forced to sit still instead of playing with his toys.”   Eight days later, Aaron’s cast was removed and doctors were pleased with his progress.   Paula says: “Doctors told me he would be left scarred and gave me gel to reduce the redness.   “I’m just thankful that they’re on his leg and are easily covered up.  He’ll need more skin grafts in the future as he grows but we’re taking it each day at a time.  Every day I replay receiving that phone call telling me Aaron had been hurt.

Now he has spoken to Hull Live in his search for clues.   “It happened around the time of my birthday, I had not been out on a heavy night but I simply don’t remember anything around that time, he said. In fact from Christmas up until waking up in hospital is a total blank. “Apparently, I was found outside the Tigers Lair. I’m not sure if any CCTV from the time would shed any light on what happened. “I might have had a couple of drinks but I don’t think I would have been on a big night out. I was on my own at the time so family and friends cannot help. “I have no idea whether I was assaulted, fell, was hit by a car or had some kind of aneurysm. My dad thinks the trauma was too great for a fall and it does appear I was attacked.” Having made a significant recovery, Mr Fisher now feels it is time to try and find out what happened. “It is not fair on my girlfriend as I just keep asking what happened, he said.  “It is tormenting me now and I need to try and figure it out. People keep asking me about it and I just have to tell them I have no idea. I lost my phone or it was stolen so I cannot look at texts or phone calls from that time to help me.” Mr Fisher says he knows the lapse in time will make finding answers difficult, but he remains hopeful. He said: “I understand it is a very strange situation and it may seem odd to be asking questions more than two years after it happened, but I have spent time trying to get better and when I try to put what happened aside I can’t. “I am pleading for anyone who knows anything to come forward. I know it was a long time ago but I am desperate for answers. “I just want to know what happened so I can get closure and move forward with my life.  Mr Fisher has worked hard to recover from the devastating brain injury, for which he spent two months in a coma for, but it is a constant battle. He said: “I was in hospital in an induced coma for two months and the first thing I remember was being transferred from Hull Royal Infirmary to Castle Hill’s brain injury unit. “I then concentrated on learning to walk and talk again and managed to do to in a fairly short space of time. “I had a blood clot on the side of my brain and I had lengthy surgery. My right side is not right and it is like I have had a stroke. “I have friends from my time in the brain injury unit who are now confined to a wheelchair so in some ways I feel lucky.” But despite making huge progress he still suffers badly from memory loss and poor motor skills. “My short term memory is completely shot, he said.

Happily, Meghan seems to have taken to everything like a regal duck to water - and she also appears to be big hit with her in-laws.  Not only does Prince Charles have an endearing nickname for her , but she was also seen having an actual laugh with the Queen on a visit to Cheshire - and Her Maj strikes us as VERY tough crowd.  But whatever it is the Duchess of Sussex is doing, it appears to be working, as the Queen has given her granddaughter-in-law a pretty impressive seal of approval.  Meghan is set to take over from the Queen in her role as patron of the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders. She\u0027ll be sharing the responsibility with Prince Harry. As part of their new roles, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will welcome those in the Queen\u0027s Young Leaders programme to Buckingham Palace this summer, continuing to honour youngsters from the Commonwealth.   The job is believed to be one close to the Queen\u0027s heart, after she started it five years ago, reports the Express .  As an introduction to her new role, Meghan will attend the reception which will pay tribute to those who have made changes to their communities, including mental health advocacy, tackling violence against women and saving lives.

Temperatures could soar between 30C and 35C in parts of the country as a run of fine and dry weather continues through the end of June and into July.  Wall-to-wall sunshine is expected, putting the UK in line with the sunny holiday hot spots in southern Spain. It will be perfect weather for the beach or lazy afternoons in the park or garden, but pollen and UV levels will be very high.   Hay fever sufferers are in for a difficult time and sun worshippers need to take precautions to avoid painful burns.  Temperatures were expected to peak around 29C in London Monday, and in the low to mid twenties elsewhere in the UK. The highest temperature recorded in the UK so far this year is 29.1 Celsius at St James Park, central London, on April 19.    The top temperatures in Scotland and Northern Ireland this year were both recorded on May 29.  Achnagart in Ross and Cromarty, Scotland, boasted a temperature of 27.5C while the heat hit 25.3C in Castlederg in Co Tyrone.  People in Hawarden, Clwyd, enjoyed 26.8C, the top temperature in Wales this year, on May 27.  Met Office forecaster Mark Foster said it is possible the hottest day for the year for all four countries could be bettered this week. He added: There is a fairly good chance we will see the hottest day so far. There is a chance it could possibly be tomorrow.  Temperatures are on Monday expected to reach around 29C around in London and between 24C to 27C across England and Wales while Scotland in the south and south east could see around 25C to 26C and Northern Ireland is looking at 25C. Higher temperatures are expected over the next days and the south west of England, the south and parts of Wales could enjoy 30C. Blazing sunshine could send the UK\u0027s temperatures soaring above those in Madrid, Istanbul and Athens, and it could be well into next week before it starts to cool down. Overnight values should also remain in the mid teens for many places after the sun goes down.  Some light cloud is possible in the north and west slightly reducing temperatures, while anyone wanting to escape the searing heat should head to the east coast where it will be cooler. The heatwave comes as England fans gather outdoors to watch World Cup action from Russia, and a number of big events take place here at home, including Wimbledon starting on July 2. Urging everyone to take precautions in the sun, Mr Foster said: High pressure is going to dominate this week so we can expect very high levels of pollen and UV. If you are in the sun you have a greater chance of getting burnt in the short term. The heat the UK is having is homegrown as high pressure, according to the Met Office.  Long days, very still conditions and clear skies help June temperatures to get very intense. The sun in June is relatively the highest it gets in the sky and heat can build up over successive days. A spokesperson for The Weather Channel said: “Dominant high pressure over the north-west of Europe will result in a very warm week. “There will be lengthy spells of sunshine for the British Isles but it will be hazier with high-level cloud for Ireland. “Temperatures are expected to lift around 1C per day - peaking across Ireland on Friday when June records could be broken. Saturday will be the warmest day for central and southern parts of the UK.”  However, some changes could be on the way for early July. ​ Pressure is likely to ease through France and Spain eventually leading to a risk of some thundery showers in southern areas of Britain. The heat may spark a few showers or an isolated thunderstorm during the first week of the ​new month, while cloud could also edge across north-western parts of the country with the threat of changeable weather sweeping in from the Atlantic. But the majority of the UK will stay fine and warm.  Later in ​July, computer models are indicating more periods of warm weather but there may be isolated periods of rain almost anywhere in the country. But these will be brief with many places still bathed in warm and dry weather for long periods. The Met Office\u0027s outlook from June 29 to July 8 says: The final few days of June will stay dry and sunny across much of the UK, although it may be cloudier with a chance of rain at times in the far north of Scotland. It will feel cooler than of late across parts of Scotland but elsewhere it will remain very warm or hot.

Drew McEwan was left stunned when Georgina Wilkinson, disguised as a gardener, showed up at his niece\u0027s christening. Georgina posed as a gardener as Drew and his family were taking photos at Loch Lomond in southern Scotland. After flying in that morning, she tagged him and ran away laughing - and then hopped on an eight-hour flight home that afternoon, the Daily Record reports.  Drew, Georgina and eight others have been playing the bizarre game since they all met by chance in China in 2014. Georgina had arranged to get one over on Drew with the help of his brother and sister and kept it under wraps until last Friday. And while the family photos were being taken after the christening, the photographer, who was also in on the joke, asked Drew if he could tell the gardener working away in the background to move because he was in the shot.  But Drew was left stunned when \u0027gardener\u0027 Georgina stood up, tagged him and then ran away. Digital consultant Drew, 31, tsaid: “My brother and sister had been planning it for months with Georgina behind my back. They even picked her up at the airport that morning. “I’ve never felt so betrayed by my own flesh and blood.”  Drew, originally from Newton Stewart in Dumfries and Galloway, added: “I didn’t even get a chance to talk to Georgina. You have to just tag and run, you can’t stay and chat. “I was in shock that she’d put so much effort into it. Flying over from America and back in one day is unbelievable. She had to make sure she was home in plenty of time for work on Monday. It’s my turn to tag one of the group now. “Obviously I’m not pleased with the bar Georgina’s raised for me but I must admit it was brilliantly executed.  “It was captured on video and you can see how surprised I was when I realised the gardener was actually Georgina. “When the video was posted on Facebook, it was unbelievable how many comments and messages we received. “To top Georgina’s tag, my one will need to be captured on video, I’ll need to have a great costume and it will need to involve international travel. I’m not telling a soul what I’m planning though. I’ll need to keep it as much as a surprise as Georgina did with me.”  Drew’s sister Angela enjoyed helping Georgina with the elaborate hoax. “It was the most fun to plan and I’m so glad we got to be part of this infamous game of international tag”, she said. Georgina thanked the Angela for “allowing me to ruin a cherished family occasion. In particular Angela for offering up her daughter’s baptism in the name of fun. She added: “Sorry Drewbs, you are now... it.” "},{"url":null,"title":"mum pinned down shredded black","story":"NewsMum \u0027shredded\u0027 by hungry bear survives after desperate husband punched creature while it gnawed her legsWARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT: Mum-of-three Casadi Schroeder, 33, had a miracle escape after being pinned to a Canadian forest floor in an attack that left her needing 34 staples in her leg\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsByPatricia Murphy10:16, 25 JUN 2018Updated10:38, 25 JUN 2018NewsCasadi Schroeder is lucky to be alive after her run in with a black bear (Image: SWNS)\u0026nbspShare\u0026nbspCommentsGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA mum has told of her remarkable escape after being pinned down and mauled by a black bear in a dawn attack at a gospel camp. Casadi Schroeder, 33, needed 34 staples in her leg after the frightening attack in which an American black bear pinned her down on the forest floor. The mother-of-three was guest speaking at a Bethel Gospel Camp when she awoke to the bear attempting to claw through her cabin door on June 10. Casadi and her pastor husband Brad Schroeder, 33, scared the bear away but they feared the animal would attack a group of children sleeping in a tent near the food hall.  The couple did not have a phone signal while camping in Jeanette Lake in Meadow Lake Provincial Park, Saskatchewan, and were unable to raise the alarm. Keeping a safe distance from the bear, Casadi followed the animal to the food hall to warn campers and disturbed him attempting to climb into the building’s window. The stay-at-home mum, of Lanigan, Saskatchewan, Canada, said she didn’t fear the bear until it began to charge at her, pinning her down and digging its teeth into her leg. Watching his wife from the cabin window, Brad ran to her aid and began kicking and punching the bear as it gnawed on her legs. Casadi said: “There was no cell service and I felt really anxious. “I knew there were kids sleeping in a pop-up tent on the way to the camp’s kitchen and I thought if he was hungry they weren’t safe. “I told my husband that I didn’t feel good about it.  “I was keeping a good distance from the bear but I knew I had to warn people. There was no cell service at this camp so I couldn’t call anyone. “When I took the blind corner at the kitchen, I saw the bear looking in the window. “When he saw me, he stopped and turned around. “I wasn’t scared at that point I just thought he was curious and I knew bear attacks were uncommon. “In what felt like the blink of an eye he was right in front of me charging toward me and I started to panic. “I knew I needed to stay calm and not run, but back away slowly. “He started running at me really fast.  I felt his teeth sink into my leg. I was so shocked I began yelling at the top of my lungs. “He was biting me so deep, it felt like it was to the bone. “I thought I was going to die. I spoke to Jesus at that moment and said, ‘I am ready to go’. “I knew that if he went anywhere near my neck I was going to be dead. “The next thing I saw was this barefoot kick the bear right into his head. It was my husband.” Brad added: “In a situation like that you don’t even have time to think you just run. “I have little snippets of memory but all I wanted to do was get that bear off her.”  The bear released Casadi and she managed to run to the nearest cabin where its occupants pulled her inside to safety and alerted 911. In the meantime, Brad ran to their cabin to make sure the couple’s children Noah, eight, Mika, six, and Phin, two, were safely locked inside. The ambulance arrived at the remote camp an hour later and rushed Casadi to Meadow Lake Hospital where her wounded legs were stitched together with 34 staples. Casadi said: “The doctor told me my injuries were the best-case scenario. “If that bear had bitten me from the waist up I’d probably have life-threatening injuries. “I think it was God and Jesus who ensured that it wasn’t more serious and that the damage wasn’t life-threatening.” Conservation officers later trapped the black bear and put it down, fearing it was suffering from rabies and matching its DNA to a hair found on Casadi’s clothes. A spokesperson from the Ministry of Environment said: “Conservation officers trapped a black bear in the area Sunday afternoon that appeared to be similar to the one involved in the attack. “The bear was put down and sent to the University of Saskatchewan for a necropsy. DNA samples were also sent to the Alberta Fish and Wildlife lab in Edmonton for testing.” Those tests have confirmed that the bear captured and put down was the same bear involved in the attack.

Noura Hussein, 19, was jailed a year ago and told her mother she wanted to kill herself after being raped by her husband Abdulrahman Mohamed Hammad.  Her mother Zainab Ahmed told the BBC : She hated herself after he raped her.  She had got a knife ready to take her own life if he touched her again. But when he went to do it again, she stabbed him - which her mother says was self-defence.  After Noura was sentenced to death, the online campaign #JusticeforNoura quickly garnered legions of followers across the world with celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Emma Watson also backing it. She is currently jailed at Omdurman Women\u0027s Prison where all the inmates live in one yard and only have sheets to protect them from the harsh sun. Noura\u0027s cousin Abdulrahman Mohamed Hammad was twice her age when he proposed to her in 2015 when she was 16. Zainab said Noura wasn\u0027t upset by the idea of marriage but asked to continue with her education. She also didn\u0027t want to marry until her mother had given birth. However, family pressure quickly started to mount - particularly from her father Hussein. Women in al-Bagar had been having children out of wedlock and he was anxious that his daughter would not do the same. Noura took part in the initial wedding ceremony but then ran away to stay with her aunt in Sinnar, 350km away.  She was told that if she returned home, the marriage would not be completed. However, the ceremony was finalised but Noura was told she didn\u0027t have to live with her husband and stayed with her family for another two years. Noura told him that she didn\u0027t want to be married to him but family elders pushed for them to live together as a married couple. After pressure from family and the elders, she moved in with him in April 2017.  CNN obtained a first-hand account of what happened afterwards with Noura saying she tried for resist his advances while staying in the honeymoon flat.  She stayed in a separate room and even tried to escape one night but the door was locked. Noura said: I refused to eat, I refused to leave my room. However, on the ninth day his family members arrived and viciously attacked her and held her down while Abdulrahman raped her.  She went on: The next day he grabbed me, threw me on the bed and tried to climb on top of me. I was fighting back and my hand found a knife under the pillow. We began grappling over the knife. He cut my hand and bit down on my shoulder.I ran to my parent\u0027s house. I had no idea how I got there. I was still carrying the knife. Her parents were shocked when she arrived at their door holding the murder weapon. She told them: I killed my husband after he raped me. The family was now under threat and so her father Hussein took them to the police station. Hussein denies he took her there to turn her in but she was arrested and charged with premeditated murder. They appealed to the elders to help but they refused and ordered them not to see Noura in order to protect their other children. They fled to another village after their house and business were burned down.  After Abdulrahman\u0027s family rejected compensation, Noura was sentenced to death by hanging last month. Her lawyer is appealing the sentence and trying to get a pardon. The verdict is expected soon. Noura\u0027s mother is hoping the elders might convince Abdulrahman\u0027s family to ask for the death sentence to be commuted. Dr Joan Nyanyuki, Amnesty\u0027s director for East Africa, said: At this stage this seems highly unlikely. Had they done this during the sentencing they could have requested mitigation. At this stage a family would have no say in a judicial decision.

It was, of course, ever thus when predicting what may be in store for a football club.On the pitch, however good the squad may look, successful results can never be taken for granted.The season just ended is an example of that. While it would not be realistic to expect Dundee to finish in the top four, there was reason to believe the players should have been good enough to have mounted a serious challenge to make the Premiership’s top six.That they didn’t was disappointing but, despite some complaint about that, the reality of a club the size of Dundee is that any campaign that ends with them still in the top division has to be acceptable.The hope has to be that, with the right additions, next term will see that top-six challenge materialise.If it does, it can become a regular occurrence.As for the new stadium, it goes back to that phrase – seeing will be believing.The plans are impressive and the feeling the best bet for the future is to move away from Dens, home for the last 119 years but now ageing and in many ways impractical, is a sensible one.But the aim was the first spade would be in the ground at what’s been dubbed “Nou Campy” just north of the Kingsway and adjacent to Camperdown Park at some point this summer.Yes, there’s another couple of months to go before that becomes a false promise but, with no final planning permission in place as yet, time is running out.Of course, even if that’s what comes to pass, it doesn’t mean the stadium won’t be built.As we’ve seen up the coast at Aberdeen, such projects can be delayed, delayed and delayed again.If Nou Campy never gets off the ground, it doesn’t have to follow the club will be plunged into the latest of what down the years have been many crises.For many fans, wherever the team is playing, so long as it continues to be backed by the Keyes cash and is riding high in the Premiership, that bright future will have arrived.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2b7163e9578-397x564.jpg ","title":"125 years of dundee fc jocky scott recalls winning league cup against celtic","story":"\t\t\t\t\tIn their 125 years, Dundee have five major trophies in their cabinet and, with almost 45 years since they last lifted silverware, it shows just how difficult it is to be top dog.Just like today, back in 1973, when the Dark Blues lifted their last trophy, managing to battle past the Old Firm was one of the biggest hurdles.Dundee legend Jocky Scott was part of the 1973 League Cup-winning side and says meeting Celtic in the final, rather than the semi, gave the side a completely different mindset going into the game at Hampden.Between 1969 and 1977, Dundee lost five Scottish Cup semi-finals to the Hoops. However, the one time they met them in a final they ran out 1-0 winners in December 1973.Jocky said: “The team that won the League Cup was a very good side.“Unfortunately, we couldn’t do more in the Scottish Cup because we kept meeting Celtic in the semi-final – we just couldn’t beat them.“When Rangers and Celtic are dominant, it’s very difficult. You’ve got to catch them on a bad day or get them in a final where you are on a hiding to nothing and just go out and play.“A semi-final is the worst game of all.“You’re within touching distance of the final but you’re not there yet.“Some players don’t handle that too well but then can handle a final.“Around 1973, we’d played Celtic in a few semi-finals and they were all very close games.“We were never really hammered in any of them but they just had that wee bit more experience of playing in semi-finals and winning them.“We had experience of losing semi-finals.“Psychologically that’s a big thing, whereas when you get to a final it’s different.“We were, obviously, the underdogs – with that there’s nothing to lose, just go out and play, do your best and hope it’s good enough.“You need wee breaks, too, and we got them.”In the midst of the miner’s strike, the 1973 final was an eerie affair with just 27,974 spectators braving the snowy conditions.Striker Gordon Wallace got the all-important goal late on to secure the trophy for the Dark Blues.Scott added: “Rab Wilson played it up to Gordon Wallace.“He had Pat McCluskey at his back but he took it down on his chest and in one movement hit it low into the corner.“The goalie was taken by surprise with the quickness Gordon hit it.“It was a typical striker’s goal, instinctive, didn’t think – bang.“We scored and went ahead – I don’t think we did that in any of the semi-finals we played, we were always having to fight back. We scored first and had something to build on.“It wasn’t like we scored and sat back and defended for 60 minutes or we were fortunate or anything.“We’d had a go at them, played well in defence and attack.

A one-sided 5-1 success over Motherwell at Ibrox in the last four set up a clash with Rangers at Hampden. The Gers were favourites but this was a Dundee side that feared no one. They showed that with a 3-2 victory.After failing to live up to being favourites when they faced Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final later that season, the next campaign saw them again win the League Cup.This time they cruised a group made up of Clyde, Raith and Airdrie and, although they lost the first leg in the quarters against Stirling Albion 3-1, back at Dens a 5-0 success saw them through.Hibs were then taken care of in the semis and the final against Kilmarnock was a fairly routine affair, a Bobby Flavell double being enough retain the trophy.Nine years later came Dundee’s most glorious day when, under the guidance of Bob Shankly, a fantastic season was crowned by clinching the club’s only league title.It came at Muirton Park, where a 3-0 win over St Johnstone – who were relegated – saw them beat off the challenge of Rangers in what, until that final day, had been a nip-and-tuck race.The league was won with the use of just 15 players, though with the likes of Alan Gilzean, Alex Hamilton, Ian Ure, Andy Penman and skipper Bobby Cox in the line-up, it was a special team.It was back to the League Cup for the last major success and, if the 1973 triumph is not the most talked about of the five, it was a laudable achievement. It came during the time of the three-day week and power cuts, meaning the final had an early kick-off to save power, so attracted a crowd of just 27,974.The game was decided by a solitary late goal from the prolific Gordon Wallace and if many reports make it sound forgettable, it should be remembered victory was over a Hoops side that would go on to reach the European Cup semi-finals.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/976302492.jpg-279x180.jpg ","title":"argentina cant expect messi to carry them says dundee hero caniggia","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFormer Dundee star Claudio Caniggia has urged the current Argentina side not to be a one-man team in Russia this summer.The Argentines got their World Cup campaign under way on Saturday against Iceland but could only manage a draw.Today they face Croatia and will hope to kick-start their campaign.Caniggia went to three World Cups – almost returning for a fourth at the age of 42 in 2010 – and arrived to much fanfare at Dundee in 2000.He says his country’s best chance of winning it all for the first time since 1986 is if Lionel Messi’s supporting cast step up to the plate.The 51-year-old rose to international prominence during the 1990 World Cup in Italy alongside Argentina great Diego Maradona and insists the difference between that side and today’s is the expectation on the other players.Caniggia said: “Messi doesn’t get the same support from his team-mates Maradona did.“I knew Maradona was the complete footballing genius but I didn’t think about keeping up with him. Never.“Every player has a responsibility, even those who don’t play much.“You can’t give all the responsibility to Messi, because then what’s the point of you being there?“Imagine if I’d thought in 1990 the world champions had to carry me through. No! Carry us? We’re in it together.“I’m Argentina’s striker and I have to drag them through it, too.“That was my responsibility. You’ve got to have character, determination, ambition and impulse.”Argentina are fifth in the betting to lift the trophy and Caniggia believes they can do it, particularly with the talent they have up top.With Messi, Gonzalo Higuain – who has come under fire for his performances for his country – Sergio Aguero, Paulo Dybala and Angel Di Maria to choose from, goals shouldn’t be a problem. Defensively, however, they could come unstuck.“What’s in our favour is the best attacking players can put fear into anyone,” added Caniggia.“Their names alone unsettle the opposition. The other teams don’t think ‘Higuain is being criticised in Argentina’. They think: ‘he’s Juventus’ top goalscorer’.”“Our weak point is we’re still not solid at the back, and there are still a couple of places up for grabs.”Caniggia was in his early thirties by the time he arrived at Dens Park in 2000 and remarkably had the chance to play at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.“We’ll never know now but to play 30 minutes would have been perfect. I was in good shape and I hadn’t lost my pace. But I couldn’t decide, and later I regretted it. It would’ve been unbelievable to play.”\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2d0ee006656-836x564.jpg ","title":"bowmans new dundee united role is vital says boss csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tManager Csaba Laszlo is delighted Dundee United legend Dave Bowman has agreed to take on the new role of the club’s Scottish scout.It will see ‘Bow’ take on responsibility of identifying players already operating north of the border who could become signing targets for the Tangerines.And during the season he will be the man who makes sure Csaba knows exactly what to expect from future opposition.“I am very happy about Bow’s decision to be our scout. He will look for new players for us and he has experience in this direction, so I know he will recommend the right people,” said Csaba.“He will also look at opposition and this is vital for us. He is very close to the first team and it is an important position.“Paul Sturrock is doing a lot of work, but he will more or less be down in England and Bow will be here as our man on the ground.”Meanwhile, having signed nine players already this summer, the pace of the rebuilding is set to slow, though there will be more new arrivals in the coming weeks.For Csaba it is important that most of the players he wanted were secured in time for pre-season training getting under way on Thursday.“For the pre-season, more or less 90% of the team must be ready,” added Csaba.“You have to prepare the team, so it was important we had made these signings.“The majority of players we wished for and who we talked to are here.”United are still in the market for another central defender, while one more striker could be added to the squad in the coming weeks.That could see a number of trialists joining up for training and possibly even games, though Csaba has decided against arranging a closed-door game in which an entire line-up of players looking to earn a contract would be used.“Maybe there are one or two possibilities for that (trialists), but if you have to go on trial, for me, there is something wrong.“I am not against loan players but they must be one who can help the team and they have to have ambition.”Fans will get their first look at the new signings in a friendly at Brechin on Tuesday week.So far that’s the only pre-season game fixed up, but at least one more is likely to be confirmed soon.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"convincing players to come to dundee united has not been easy admits csaba","story":"\t\t\t\t\tCsaba Laszlo admits getting the players he wants to rebuild Dundee United this summer has not been easy.But he’s revealed the more quality signings that have been made, the less difficult the process has become.With other clubs, often from top divisions, also keen on players like Callum Booth, Craig Curran and Frederic Frans, the Tangerines had to pull out the stops to persuade them to sign up at Tannadice.That saw Csaba making a point of speaking to every potential target individually, rather than doing business through their agents.“If we are in the Premiership it is easier to attract staff and players, but we are not,” he said.“I have talked to every single player we have signed to convince them to come to Dundee United.“It was not an agent calling them to tell them Dundee United were interested, it was the manager calling to say you are important.“I think this was a reason why we’ve got players. It’s a lot of work and it’s not finished.“Frans and Booth both had offers from Premiership clubs here, Frans also from the top division in Belgium.“They have come here and, when other players see that, it made it better for us to get others to come as well.”Csaba has also revealed not one of the new faces had a problem with the new 25-miles rule he’s introduced.From now on, every player will have to stay no further away from Tannadice than that and, contrary to what some predicted, it’s not been a problem.“Before it could be Willo Flood, myself and some directors travelling on the team bus, now every player will be together,” he added.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee kid henvey signs new dark blues deal","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDundee kid Matty Henvey has signed a new one-year contract.The 18-year-old striker broke into the first team near in late December and went on to make four appearances.He was side-lined by an injury suffered as he scored a dramatic late goal in the win at Hamilton Accies at the end of January and missed most of the rest of the season.Matty\u0026#8217s goals in the first part of the season were key to Dundee\u0026#8217s runners-up position in the development league.He joined the rest of the first team squad last week for pre-season training.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/B88-1971-08-00-Children-at-Broughty-Ferry-Beach-CDCT.jpg ","title":"dundee people from the 1920s to now hot summer days in the ferry","story":"\t\t\t\t\tFamilies enjoying a day out on the beach, kids having a splash about in the water, fishing off the harbour\u0026#8230 while somethings have undoubtedly changed over the years, it’s clear many things have remained exactly the same in Broughty Ferry.The suburb has long had a host of attractions and activities for residents and visitors alike.We dive into our archives once more to see what summer days were like in the Ferry.\t\t\t"},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b2780eda4be9-180x180.jpg ","title":"dundee people karen helps to heal and comfort others","story":"\t\t\t\t\t“My job allows me to help heal and comfort others who are going through grief.”Karen Docherty, 42, has arguably one of the most unusual jobs that we have featured in this column. She is a spirit medium full time.From her studio, Sacred Spirit in Carnoustie, she is able to give messages from those who have passed away to those who were closest to them.Karen has been able to connect to the spirit world her whole life but only began developing the skill about seven years ago.She said: “I really began my development seven years ago when I travelled down south to meet with Tony Stockwell.“He noticed straight away that I had the ability to be a great medium so he became my first teacher.“I then became a guest on the Scottish dates of his tour.“People think that you can either talk to the spirit or you can’t – and while not everyone has the ability to, if you can connect with the spirit world you need to develop your skills and gain understanding of what they are communicating to you.“For instance if a spirit shows me a sandcastle I know that means someone has been married in a castle. However, you need to work at it to be able to gain that understanding.”Whilst Karen appreciates there is now a greater understanding and interest in mediumship, there are people who see it as a “circus act”.Mediums are especially in the spotlight now as it is portrayed on a bigger platform with TV programmes dedicated to the skill.“There is such a big interest in this kind of work that it has become incredibly accessible with people even going live on social media, but I feel that takes away the personal aspect of it.“I try to give very personal details to people so they know I am telling the truth and I am reputable.“I have even been featured in magazines who have done “psychic under the spotlight” tests and gave me full marks for accuracy.“I feel incredibly lucky that I am able to do this job. I get really emotional but you can’t not get emotional!“I have ladies who sit opposite me in a state of grief and I feel anyone who comes to my events or for a one-to-one session is hurting or grieving and I am able to help those people. I am doing this to bring comfort to people and to help heal them and that is really important to me.“I wouldn’t change my ability at all, I love it.”As well as providing spiritual readings Karen also teaches mediumship to those who have the ability.She said: “I can instantly tell if someone is a medium or has the ability to be, I don’t know why, it’s just a connection.“I travel the world teaching mediums and also have regular students here in the studio. About 80% of those students are here because I have picked up that they have the ability.“I also do online teaching, so if anyone believes they could have the ability to reach the spirit world they should get in contact to develop their skill further.”Karen will be on stage at the Whitehall Theatre on Wednesday June 27.Tickets are priced at £16 and can be purchased from the box office.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people pictures thousands gather at park for dundees race for life","story":"\t\t\t\t\tThousands of fundraisers turned up at Camperdown Country Park for a very worthy cause.Race for Life saw women and men of all ages, mostly decked out in pink, as they took part in a 10k run to raise cash for Cancer Research.Running, walking, jogging and even sprinting, more than 2,000 participants took part in the race around the city’s largest public park.There was also a 5k option, with some participants completing the event while twirling 4lb hula hoops – also known as powerhoops – round their waists."},{"url":"https://www.eveningtelegraph.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/06/5b14fff717cc5.jpg ","title":"dundee people residents celebrate after saving post office from closure","story":"\t\t\t\t\tHilltown residents were rejoicing after the community saved the local post office from closure.Following the retirement of the sub-postmistress in 1991, the Post Office announced the branch would be closed.The plans caused an uproar, with residents and councillors all pulling together to oppose the plan, which was finally shelved.Betty Hand, of the Ladywell off-licence, who was a customer of the branch, supplied bottles of bubbly for the celebratory party.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"dundee people rubbish effort a good example","story":"\t\t\t\t\tPupils  Barnhill Primary School in Dundee have taken part in a litter pick.Fifteen youngsters took part and collected rubbish from their school grounds and the surrounding area.Councillor Craig Duncan, who also joined in, said the pupils were enthusiastic and that three bags of rubbish – including plastic bottles, crisp packets, sweet wrappers and broken plant pots – were collected.Mr Duncan said: “The kids were cheerful and are all up for doing another one.

This will be Neil’s second year in charge and just like everything else he has a specific style he wants to play.“I think we saw, I would say, more than glimpses of it last year.“It is a style of play

obstructive parking.\"Inconsistent and obstructive parking is a nuisance in our communities and greatly impacts on our ability to easily get around by foot, and so it is critical we empower local authorities to tackle this important issue,\" he said.Today a coalition of disability and mobility organisations called on Highland Council to develop an Inverness Street Charter, setting out measures to improve accessibility.Produced by the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in liaison with Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and Highland Cycle Campaign among others their \"manifesto\" \u0026ndash Putting Inverness Streets Ahead \u0026ndash identifies pavement parking along with other issues such as street clutter and shared spaces for vehicles and pedestrians as restricting safe access.RNIB campaigns manager Catriona Burness said: \"For too many people our streets remain a daily obstacle course.\"We believe a Street Charter would help to enhance the quality

National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) in collaboration with groups including Autism Rights Group Highland, Guide Dogs Scotland and the Highland Cycle Campaign.It sets out a range of barriers it says prevents Inverness being truly accessible to all, including too many bollards of different types and heights, unfenced cafe tables and chairs spilling into pavement areas and refuse bins on

deaths before stronger action is taken,\" he said.\"I\u0026rsquove been concerned for some time about the condition of buildings not only in Inverness but across Highland.\"We\u0026rsquove spent years trying to persuade owners of buildings to act responsibly. It hasn\u0026rsquot worked. We need to bring about a cultural change whereby owners take greater care and pride in their properties.\"I believe this will need to be supported by legislation which makes it compulsory for buildings to be checked regularly.\"He suggested surveys every three years, adding: \"We\u0026rsquove spent years in and around Inverness trying to persuade the owners of buildings to act responsibly and it hasn\u0026rsquot worked.\"\u0026nbspHighlands and Islands MSP Mr Stewart was successful in having legislation revised four years ago to allow local authorities to recoup money they spend on serving notices or for work carried out if a building is deemed dangerous.In January, kiltmakers Duncan Chisholm and Sons in Castle Street was served with a dangerous buildings notice by Highland Council and the local authority appointed contractors to make the building safe. It will recover the costs later.In March it also ordered building owners with glazed canopies to check they had adequate inspection and maintenance arrangements in place.This followed incidents at both the Inverness and Inshes retail parks in 2017 and earlier this year where panels fell from their fixings, in one case resulting in a shopper having stitches to his head after being hit with broken glass.Mr Stewart said: \"Although councils can act if buildings are deemed dangerous and go on to recoup money from owners if they carry out work, there\u0027 more that can be done to bring in more preventative measures.\"Businesses are under severe pressure at the moment with rising city centre costs. But a crisis incident could not only injure people but affect their insurance and their reputation.\"A council spokeswoman said: \"We regularly remind building owners that the responsibility for ensuring the safety of members of the public in and around their buildings lies with them \u0026ndash whether commercial, retail, business, public or privately owned.\"The new maintenance guide can be

major surgery and, although I’m heading towards full recovery, the absence gave me an opportunity to re-evaluate my priorities and I decided that my own health and family must come first in future.“As a life-long Dons fan It’s not been an easy decision to make and I will certainly miss mixing and working with footballers, business colleagues and our passionate supporters on a daily basis.“It’s been an honour and a pleasure to serve the Club and I have no doubt that AFC is in a strong position across all areas of the Club, with plans now well underway for the new training facilities, a very strong and committed football management and back room staff, and a hard-working group of good people across all departments.“I’m grateful to many people both within and out with the Club for their efforts and ongoing support in enabling AFC to reinstate and consolidate its rightful position at the top end of Scottish football and I wish Derek, Tony, the board, executive team, and all of my good friends at the Club the very best in future.“It’s an exciting time for anyone associated with the Club and I’d encourage everyone to get behind them”George Yule joined the Dons in 2012 as executive vice chairman following 30 years in the oil and gas industry.Dons chairman Stewart Milne said: “George has played an important role in the day to day operations of the Club for almost six years, particularly in the areas of business development and building relationships with corporate and general supporters.“He also played an important role in the development of the community arm of the Club which led to the creation of AFC Community Trust.“Latterly he was a key member of the project team which successfully secured planning consent for the £50million community sports hub, training facility and new stadium.“George very much appreciates the scale of the task that lies ahead for the Club, not only in delivering the community and training facilities, as well as the new stadium, but also in substantially growing the Club so that it can retain its position at the top of Scottish Football and continue to make its mark in Europe.“I have enjoyed working with George during that time, and personally appreciate all that he has contributed to the Club’s progress over his time with us, we are indebted to him, and wish him all the best for the future.“He may be leaving his current role, but we are comforted in the knowledge that he will continue to play a role both as a fan and an ambassador of the Club.”\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"mcinnes set to open up talks with skipper shinnie after his return","story":"\t\t\t\t\tDons boss Derek McInnes today confirmed he is ready to open up contract talks with skipper Graeme Shinnie.Negotiations on tying down Shinnie’s long-term future to the Reds could begin before the start of the season.Scotland cap Shinnie’s contract expires next summer and Championship side Bristol City have reportedly been tracking Shinnie.The 26-year-old will be free to talk to any interested clubs from January 1 when the winter transfer window opens.Ideally McInnes wants to secure the future of his skipper long before then.He said: “Getting Graeme Shinnie on a new contract is something we would all want.“Graeme had a lot to deal with over the summer as he was away with Scotland and got married.“I am sure we will pick up on that (contract talks) over the next few weeks.”Signed from Inverness Caley Thistle on a two-year deal in 2015, Shinnie penned a contract extension in January 2017 until summer 2019.The midfielder-defender travelled to South America with Scotland at the end of the Premiership campaign and earned a debut cap in the 2-0 friendly loss to Peru.He started the next game, a 1-0 loss to Mexico, when Dons team-mate Scott McKenna was skipper.McInnes said: “It was a huge relief for Graeme to get that first international cap.”Skipper Shinnie was today returning to Pittodrie for pre-season training having been given an extra few days break.Aberdeen returned from summer on Friday but players involved on international duty with Scotland over the summer were given a few extra days off.Centre-back McKenna and Scotland Under-21 winger Scott Wright also reported back for duty.The Dons were today set to jet out to the Republic of Ireland for a week-long training camp in Cork.They will face Cobh Ramblers in a friendly on Saturday.Aberdeen’s three summer signings are in contention to make their debut in that friendly – midfielders Chris Forrester, Stephen Gleeson and Lewis Ferguson.McInnes is happy to let SPFL arbitration sort out the training compensation for 18-year-old Ferguson which will now go to a tribunal.Aberdeen and Ferguson’s former club Hamilton have failed to agree a compensation deal for the teen.It is understood the Dons offered more than £100,000 for Ferguson with Accies’ valuation believed to be around £900,000 for the midfielder who made 14 first-team starts for Hamilton last season.McInnes said: “We’ll go to the tribunal but I’m confident and comfortable that we’ve done our due diligence and the tribunal outcome will reflect that.“Hamilton have got such a high regard for Lewis so I’m not surprised it’s going to a tribunal.“Hamilton have produced some good players. I hope that can continue to be the case and that Lewis can reach a good level. He has settled in well.“I’m pleased we have a young player like that as we cannot always sign ready-made players at Aberdeen.“McInnes aims to have secured more new signings before the Dons face Burnley in the Europa League second qualifying round.Aberdeen host the English top flight Clarets in the first leg at Pittodrie on Thursday July 26 with the return a week later.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"offers over 120000 two bedroom flat in aberdeen city centre2","story":"\t\t\t\t\t65 Holburn Street, sitting in the heart of Aberdeen city centre, offers colourful and comfortable living.Description: The ideal purchase for a first-time buyer, this spacious basement flat forms part of a traditional granite property and is within walking distance of the city centre and all its amenities.Lounge/kitchen: Bright and airy, the kitchen is fully-fitted with plenty of counter space.

As with other gull species which are opportunist in diet, junk food and bits of plastic provided by us humans can be inadvertently consumed.Over many years the Gleaner oil depot, which has a concrete bund in case of oil spillage, has provided a safe nesting site for around 20 pairs. The suggestion that this colony could easily find an alternative site is perhaps wishful thinking as suitable sites nearby in Mid Argyll are already occupied by other gull species or don’t have the required habitat features.Thankfully, however, this should not prove necessary. Following a productive on-site meeting last week with the Scottish Canals\u0026#8217 environmental scientist, the project architect and TSL contractors we noted 10-15 birds sitting on eggs and unaffected by the work going on around them.Planned works over the coming weeks should not affect these gulls, Oystercatchers or Black Guillemots from nesting and will also not impede the building work which is scheduled to be completed by next spring.The Mid Argyll hub project and new canal museum will largely reflect the social and cultural heritage of the Crinan Canal, but should also encompass the important and often decreasing natural history of the Crinan Canal corridor. These breeding birds are also a part of this and should not just be something to ‘chase off’ to somewhere else.Excellent viewing and educational opportunities from the new build will be possible to watch this colony raise their chicks as well as providing a point to lookout for other wildlife on the loch.Nearby, the tidal estuary of Loch Gilp provides us with an often highly under-valued unofficial nature reserve that links Ardrishaig with Lochgilphead, which in winter hosts important numbers of duck and waders, in summer includes breeding Eider ducks and Common Terns and during migration is a vital stopping off point during adverse weather for passage Whooper swans, Brent geese and Black-tailed Godwits to name a few.Increasingly good work is being undertaken by locals and the Phoenix Trust to help clear up some of the increasing amounts of shoreline rubbish.Keep up the good work!Jim Dickson, Argyll Bird Recorder, CairnbaanSir,I have been out and about Islay the past week speaking to my constituents, visiting local businesses and monitoring the roads department\u0026#8217s progress with road repairs.Unfortunately CalMac management\u0026#8217s shocking handling of our local ferry service is really taking it\u0026#8217s toll on many local businesses that depend heavily of Islay\u0026#8217s growing tourist trade. We simply cannot allow CalMac to continue to make the same errors every year without consequences.On another subject, I have been unimpressed with our local roads department management\u0026#8217s sluggish response to a large number of complaints from local residents and myself about the plague of potholes scattered across Islay.There are many roads across Islay that have some potholes marked to be filled while others remain unmarked despite them in many cases being side by side. This scattershot approach to pothole repairs is as random as it is ineffective.In the future we will need to see a more long term resurfacing solution to our local roads with less short term, random and piecemeal patchwork.Cllr Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,In the run up to National Volunteering Week (June 1- 7), Cats Protection would like to extend our thanks to the many thousands of volunteers throughout the country who offer their time and expertise to help cats and kittens across the UK.In 2017, our 10,200-strong volunteer network contributed an incredible 5.5 million hours, each volunteer gifting a wealth of expertise and immeasurable passion to the charity. Their dedication enabled Cats Protection to help around 200,000 cats and kittens nationwide.Cats Protection is always on the lookout for new volunteers to join the UK’s biggest cat community. Though a large part of our work is helping cats, through fostering and rehoming, our volunteers have the opportunity to become involved with a range of interesting activities such as organising fundraising events, helping with publicity or managing funds and resources to benefit the greatest amount of cats.Volunteering can offer the chance to develop skills such as time management, interpersonal skills and teamwork, making CVs much more attractive and, of course, helping cats.Anyone who is interested in becoming a volunteer can go to our website www.cats.org.uk/get- involved/volunteering  to find out more.Julie Meredith, head of volunteering development, Cats Protection,Sir,I really love being active, especially the feeling after and that’s why I’m supporting Bowel Cancer UK and Beating Bowel Cancer’s latest fundraising campaign to get sponsored to do 30 minutes of physical activity for 30 days in June.Step up for 30 is a fantastic way for you to be more physically active to reduce your risk of bowel cancer – the UK’s second biggest cancer killer.

After a pit stop in the Royal Burgh it was on to Fort William, then Inverness and back home again- all to raise money for Cancer Research UK and Target Ovarian Cancer.Spokesperson for Breast Way Round, Laura White, said: ‘This year was full of fun, laughter, meeting new family members and although the daily miles are hard going, the weather and the beauty of the Scottish scenery made it that little bit easier.’As well as the sponsored trek, the bikers raised money in more traditional ways, such as bucket shaking (the men wearing bras) and hosting a raffle and auction in Caol Community Centre. The most coveted item, a patchwork quilt made by rider Cathy Anderson, went for a whopping £700.The annual trip was started in 2008 by Shirley-Ann McKnight as a last tour of Scotland for fellow biker and close friend, Alyson Porter, who was suffering from cancer. Sadly, Alyson never made it to her trip and now each year the journey is retraced in celebration of her life and all those affected by cancer.Since 2008, more than 600 riders have participated, each clad with a pink mohawk courtesy of Hairy-RS, and the team has raised £347,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

The pair were seeded car 30 in the two wheel drive section, run first on the day in a new schedule being piloted by the rally, the two wheel drive cars covering the stages before the four wheel drive cars followed in the afternoon.With the dry conditions in the weeks running up to the event dust would be the main problem for those running further down the field. Douglas attacked the first stage, Twiglees, and was catching the car in front when, unfortunately due to the dust being created by that car, came out of a 90 degree corner with zero visibility and connected heavily with a rock, damaging the suspension and forcing his early retirement.The car, and the driver, are noticeably quicker  each event they compete in and it\u0026#8217s only a matter of time before the results are there.The other Argyll car out on the stages was Ally Currie from Mull and Grant McNiven in the Ford Fiesta ST picking up 9th overall and 1st in Class 6.The next round of the Scottish Championship is Argyll Rally, based in Dunoon on June 23 \u0026#8211 the closest round for most Argyll rally enthusiasts and one not to be missed. The stages look absolutely breathtaking this year and well worth a watch.The Scottish Tarmac Rally Championship continues as well with round three being the Granite at Leuchars Stages hosted by Aberdeen and District Motor Club at the MOD base in Leuchars, Fife.Argyll was well represented both in the drivers seat and the co-drivers. All Argyll crew Willie and Steven Beattie were out in the newly finished and beautifully finished Escort MkII. They were absolutely flying and really getting to grips with the car when a sixth gear lock-up threw them into a spin and off the stage, clouting a fairly substantial fence post in the process.The navigators side now looks decidedly second hand, but nothing a few hours in the workshop won\u0026#8217t sort. A bent bottom suspension arm put paid to them re-joining but they will take the positives and the blistering pace into the next round for sure.Willie Beattie Snr in his equally exquisite Escort was also beginning to get the hang of the car, with some more seat time this year, not to mention experienced co-driver, Phil Sandham, pushing him on. He, after making sure his boys were okay when they didn\u0026#8217t show up at service after their spin, continued on to secure 12th overall and second in class: his first honours since building the car.The next round may see some family ties severely stretched, at least until the final results are announced.Ian Parker was also out in familiar machinery, co-driving for Fraser Smith in his Canal Garage-prepared Honda Civic. The pair were also making good progress up the class rankings until the diff decided to implode and finished their rally on Stage six.The drive of the day was not in question. Alan Kirkaldy led from start to finish despite some interesting issues in the first test. His door came loose after about a third of stage and he continued, holding the door shut by the open window whilst steering, changing gear and waving with the other.Astonishingly he still managed quickest stage time by five seconds. His co-driver for the day could forgive himself for being a little green about the gills after that.Eoghan Anderson from Cairnbaan was lucky enough to win the seat in a charity auction at the Annual STRC Dinner earlier in the year. An experience he is unlikely to forget in a hurry, although some of the memories may be a little bit blurry and perhaps just a little sideways. The top three were rounded out by Ian Forgan, ably guided round in his Subaru by his daughter in her first rally and the final position on the podium went to Ian and Allan Paterson, also in a Subaru.The next round is this weekend at Crail where the Beattie boys will be back out, Ian Parker swaps a Civic for an Escort MKII and Donald Bowness is set to get back out in the Nova.PICS:Photos: Gavin Brown, West Coast PhotosRed Escort (Car 1) Alan Kirkaldy/Eoghan Anderson (first overall) no_a24rally01\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"high tech preparation for mid argyll art show","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 14/06/18, 7:45 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowThis year has seen a lot of preparatory work ahead of the 2018 Mid Argyll Art Society exhibition in August.The popular show will again be held in the Drill Hall, Lochgilphead and will run from August 6-11.As in the last few years, the Mid Argyll Camera Club will have photos on display.The society is harnessing modern technology in a campaign to raise the profile of this year\u0026#8217s event.There is now a Mid Argyll Art Society Facebook page that can be used to get updates on what is happening.There will shortly be a website giving details about the art society, its history, information on the exhibition and how to participate, and photos of past exhibits to give a flavour of what the event is like.A lot of work has been done on modernising the entry process.

Now scientists from the University of Aberdeen have added a third species to the mix \u0026#8211 the European pine marten. These native squirrel predators are recolonising Britain after years of persecution, and so the scientists set out to uncover the impact of this on red and grey squirrel populations.Three study sites in Scotland were in the Highlands (marten recolonisation for over 45 years, no grey squirrels), Central Scotland (marten recolonisation for 8-14 years, grey squirrels since 1945) and the Borders (early stages of marten recolonization, grey squirrels since 1980).Populations were monitored for five months using cameras and multi-species feeders \u0026#8211 the latter with glue strips on the underside of the lid to obtain visitor hair samples. This material provided DNA to determine visitor species and identify individual martens.The results showed that while red squirrels avoided feeders used by martens, greys were equally likely to use feeders whether frequented by martens or not. So grey squirrel numbers were reduced where exposure to pine martens was high, whereas numbers of red squirrels increased – unequivocal evidence that recovering marten numbers affect competition between red and grey squirrels.This finding is likely explained by the fact that reds, having co-evolved with martens, instinctively avoid areas used by martens but invasive greys, having no such instincts, showed no avoidance behaviour at all.Since pine martens’ range is increasing and extending southwards, scientists are optimistic that this will control the invasive grey squirrel species.As they say in the title to their report, in this case ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend’.PIC:The native grey squirrel may have an unlikely ally.

We simply don\u0026#8217t have enough children playing shinty in each school to make up separate clubs.Surely, in 2018, this shouldn\u0026#8217t be allowed to happen?It is only three clubs that are being affected by this, and they\u0026#8217re all in the south of Scotland,  half way through a season, leaving all our kids devastated at the though of losing their chosen sport.My son has been playing shinty since Primary One. He is now heading into Primary Four and is even more passionate about the sport. He enjoys quality team time, striving to be the best he can and just loving playing the game.It\u0026#8217s very difficult to explain something like this to an eight-year-old child, never mind the Primary One children we have in our club.One quote from a child was: \u0026#8216Everyone is going to be so sad if we don\u0026#8217t have shinty. Why would shinty people do this to us?\u0026#8217It\u0026#8217s a very sad day indeed for the children of Argyll and Bute who are simply being punished for what school they go to and where they live. We have to stand together and fight for our club and our children.The Camanachd Association needs to step up and find a solution to allow all children to compete nationally and stand as one united shinty community.Ailsa and Alastair Crawford, LochgilpheadSir,The Camanachd Association has put politics before the needs of the children and the development of the sport in Argyll.The kids are disappointed and the coaches who have worked tirelessly to set the club up are deflated. Surely the association knows this is a mistake that needs rectified immediately.Personally, Kilmory and Dunadd children\u0026#8217s club has inspired our son and daughter to get involved with the sport and to grow in confidence amongst other like-minded children.Stuart and Simone Charnock, LochgilpheadSir,My son has trained with Kilmory/Dunadd shinty club since he was in Primary One. The club has always treated the kids equally and welcomed all kids to participate.After years of hard work, the team was progressing well and was worthy of competing at national level.In his last year before high school, to be told he is no longer allowed to play is not only devastating to my son but greatly confusing and he is left wondering what he has done wrong.I fail to see how this can be classed as progress by the Camanachd Association. This needs to be readdressed to allow kids to compete in the game they love.Susan Jackson, LochgilpheadI was very angry to hear from local residents in Portnahaven that their recycling bins have been used by numerous motorhomes for disposing of general waste, including food waste.I have visited the recycling bins site in Portnahaven and spoken to my constituents in person about this and I can confirm that unfortunately Portnahaven\u0026#8217s recycling bins are full of general waste.This is as unacceptable as it is disrespectful. I have contacted the appropriate department with the council and asked for an investigation to be done. I also asked for some addition signage for the bins area.I made it very clear that my constituents should not lose their recycling facilities as a result of their bins being misused by someone else.I will continue to monitor this situation and provide an update as soon as I have more information.Alastair Redman, Isle of IslaySir,It is fitting to mark this Diabetes Week (June 11-17) for Scotland’s 30,000 adults and children living with type one diabetes by noting that life-changing monitors are now available on the NHS.A child diagnosed with type one diabetes at five faces 50,000 finger prick blood glucose tests by the time they are 18.Each painful finger prick is part of a daily routine which also includes calculating carbohydrate intake and frequent insulin injections, all to prevent life-threatening hypoglycaemia and long term complications.But since November last year, a \u0026#8216flash glucose monitoring\u0026#8217 system called the Freestyle Libre can be prescribed by local GPs, offering an alternative to such intensive finger-pricking.The roll out of flash glucose monitoring, which gives a reading via a simple sensor, however, is not consistent across all local health boards. So, our message for Diabetes Week is to call for health boards in Scotland to speed up prescription policies and step up much needed prescriptions.As someone who has lived with type one diabetes for 21 years, new technology, such as the FreeStyle Libre, makes a world of difference.Type one diabetes cannot be prevented and until we find the cure for it, research and technology are vital.Holly Davies, development manager, Aberdeen\u0026nbsp\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"a poignant prizegiving for tarbert afc","story":"\t\tLaura MaxwellUpdated: 20/06/18, 6:08 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.Subscribe NowTarbert AFC’s annual football dance was held on Saturday June 16 in the Islay Frigate Hotel.Players and their partners were joined by the wider circle of people who are involved with the club.This annual dinner dance is also the end of season awards presentation.Nikki MacDougall took home awards for Top Goal Scorer and Referees\u0026#8217 Player of the Year.

This is the same distance Mark averaged every day during his epic cycle round the world in 80 days last year.In other words the team of 80 intrepid cyclists will pedal the equivalent of Mark’s incredible feat – taking them around the world in a day.Participants are asked to raise a minimum of £240 each for the STV Children’s Appeal, which supports children and young people affected by poverty in Scotland, with the hope of raising as much as £80,000 for the charity.Mark said: \u0026#8216This stunning route from Argyll to Aberdeen was my last 16-hour training ride before I set out on the world challenge and it holds fond memories \u0026#8211 but it is very long and very hilly, so I’ll be impressed by everyone who signs up for this epic day of endurance.\u0026#8216The STV Children’s Appeal has gone from strength from strength, supporting so many brilliant charities and causes across Scotland.

STV’s cameras will be there – and trying hard to keep up! – to capture the highs and lows of this incredible marathon venture\u0026#8217After a 4am start in Argyll, Mark’s 240-mile cycle route will pass through Tarbert, Ardrishaig, Lochgilphead, Inveraray, Tyndrum, Crainlarich, Killin, Aberfeldy, Pitlochry, Glenshee, Braemar, Ballater and Peterculter \u0026#8211 among many other towns and villages \u0026#8211 before finishing in Aberdeen.If you think you’re up for this epic feat of endurance, get in touch with Mark on aroundtheworld@thehunterfoundationA corporate offer is also available with four-person relay teams invited to enter for a minimum donation of £5,000.Can’t face the cycle but still want to be involved?

This could threaten future trade deals, environmental standards and food safety.The Tories think they can do whatever they want to Scotland and get away with it.The SNP tabled amendments to the EU Withdrawal Bill to safeguard the Scottish Parliament from the threat of constraints on existing powers.This is something which Holyrood refused consent for last month by an overwhelming majority including all parties, except the Scottish Conservatives.It would simply be a democratic outrage and it would fly in the face of the fundamental principles of devolution. This Conservative government seems determined to destroy the founding principles of devolution and Labour and the Lib Dems must join us in defending it.Brendan O’Hara, MP for Argyll and Bute.Sir,It seems that almost every day I\u0026#8217m contacted by farmers in my constituency with concerns about their future.This is hardly surprising as farmers are borrowing more and having to pay staff less, according to figures released by the Scottish Government.According to ‘Agricultural Facts and Figures’ published recently, agricultural borrowing has doubled in the last 10 years, capital investment has stayed the same and agricultural workers are earning £1,560 less on average compared to last year.The figures show farm borrowing has almost doubled from £1.38 billion to £2.28 billion between 2007 to 2017, while capital investment has stayed the same at £210 million.This demonstrates that farmers are investing much less in their machinery and equipment while still having to borrow ever-increasing sums to remain viable.This is on top of the fact farmers are still struggling with debts they incurred as a result the CAP payment fiasco caused by the SNP Government several years ago.Time and time again the separatists have shown complete disregard to the plight that our hard pressed farmers are facing. It seems our agricultural industry is just one more sector that is ignored by the separatists in their relentless push for a second independence referendum.Councillor Alastair Redman, Isle of Islay.Sir,Claims by Theresa May that a so-called ‘Brexit dividend’ will help pay for a boost to NHS spending in England worth £20 billion a year within five years are highly disingenuous.The UK will continue to pay into the EU through the transition until the end of 2020 and will pay £20 billion of the \u0026#8216divorce bill\u0026#8217 through to 2028. In addition, the UK Government has committed to keep EU funding for agricultural subsidies, research and development and other key areas at the same level in the short-term.These are set figures so it will be at least 10 years before any so-called ‘Brexit dividend’, if it were ever to materialise, is to be realised. Add to that, if the Office for Budget Responsibility forecasts are accurate, public finances are set to be £15 billion a year worse off by 2021, equivalent to £300 million a week.Interestingly, if taxes are set to rise, which they will clearly have to, it is staggering hypocrisy for the Tories to have attacked the Scottish Government’s boosting of the NHS in Scotland through progressive tax changes and then look to hike taxes themselves.Alex Orr, Edinburgh.Sir,Local government spending cuts have left councils in Scotland unable to meet the needs of local communities and, in some cases, are putting the public at risk.A survey of more than 2,000 local government employees working across all services reveals almost eight in 10 council workers have no confidence in the future of local services and half are thinking of leaving their jobs for less stressful work elsewhere.While local authorities have protected spending on statutory service areas such as adult and children’s social care, the amount they spend on other areas including parks and libraries has fallen sharply.Local authorities have had to cut so many vital services that they have now reached a point where vulnerable children and the elderly struggle to get the help that they need, entire communities are suffering and the public is being put at risk.There have been cuts to road and bridge maintenance, potholes in roads are left unfilled and bridges are at risk of crumbling. Crematoriums are not maintained, streetlights stay broken and parks are in disrepair as councils don’t have the equipment or the staff to adequately maintain them.There are now more than one million people with an unmet need for social care because councils do not have the resources to support them. Now is the time to reverse these cuts and invest in local government once more or the fabric of our society will come unstuck.Mark Ferguson, chairman, UNISON Scotland local government committee.\t\t\t"},{"url":null,"title":"argyllshire advertiser leader column week 25","story":"\t\tColin CameronUpdated: 24/06/18, 3:39 pmLikeGoogle +1TweetEmailWant to read more?We value our content and our journalists, so to get full access to all your local news updated 7-days-a-week – PLUS an e-edition of the Argyllshire Advertiser – subscribe today for as little as 56 pence per week.There is no denying Lochgilphead could benefit from a wash and brush up.

It is the latest diversification at Corton Farm, just outside Ayr. Customers can buy a litre glass bottle for \u0026pound2 and use it again and again at the milk machine. And farmer Alison Kerr said: “You cannot get any fresher. “We’re really hoping it catches on so we can sell more and more directly to local people.” The Kerrs – five generations at Corton since 1925 – have constructed The Milk Hoose and the Milkbot vending machines providing “untampered, non-homogenised” milk from the Corton herd.  Customers on Friday gushed praise on the creamy taste, saying it is nothing like mass-produced products. The Kerrs are charging \u0026pound1.50 per litre and say it cuts out plastic waste from supermarket bottles. Although it is more expensive than supermarket pricing, they say their milk compares favourably to speciality gold top products. Willie and Alison, both 46, have been joined working the farm by son David,19, and are being helped by daughter Joanne,16, when she is not at Belmont Academy. Willie said: “It would be a dream to sell every litre we produce right here. “But we have had a great start and it has been so well received.” The farm produces between 5000 and 6000 litres of milk a day, depending on the time of year.  That is courtesy of the 220 Friesian-Holstein milkers. The Kerrs own 260 acres and rent another 250. Fourteen years ago they expanded into the Corton Plants nursery and 14 months ago the Coo Shed coffee shop. But Alison said: “The Milkbot really completes the story of selling your own product. “We siphon off what we need into churns to be pasteurised and it is put into the Milkbot. “I guarantee it tastes completely different as all the fats and proteins have not been stripped out. “It is non-homogenised and the cream settles on top like the the old-fashioned milk.” At the moment it is thought only three farms in Scotland are selling direct via a vending machine.  Alison added: “People now are so detached from where the food comes from and I think supermarkets are to blame for that. “Some kids think milk comes from a bottle in a supermarket. “Plastic has just become a huge issue and it has been good timing for us. “People are loving our branded glass bottles.” Peak time for the new vended milk is between 5pm and 7pm and there can be 20 cars in the car park at a time with people leaving work keen to top up their supply. Alison added: “Hopefully this continues to grow. Milk is sold too cheaply in supermarkets and farmers have been down-trodden for a long time. “We have just had to take what we can get and be paid sub-30p a litre. At the moment the Milkbot is doing a couple of hundred litres a day so we have a long way to go to reach 5000 a day.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"girl 4 stuck playpark equipment","story":"NewsGirl, 4, gets stuck in playpark equipment and needs fire brigade to rescue herPetrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle near Ayr.\u0026nbspShareBySarah Hilley16:44, 20 JUN 2018Updated19:45, 20 JUN 2018NewsLittle Lily-Mags had her leg stuck in the toy car for 40 minutes\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA four-year-old girl got stuck in playpark equipment for 40 minutes as firefighters struggled to get access to her. Petrified Lily-Mags Rodman ended up wedging her wee leg in a metal car in Belleisle. Her father David and other parents were unable to free her, sparking an emergency services rescue. But crews faced a major delay as access to the park through the main entrance was blocked off due to fencing at the Belleisle Hotel. The crew had to abandon their fire engine some distance away and run across the grass to reach Lily-Mags. After assessing the situation, they were forced to backtrack their appliance through the main exit and find another way in.  Mum Clare said: “Luckily my daughter wasn’t badly hurt, but if it was a life-or-death situation and a child had fallen from equipment it may have been too late.” Clare, who was working from home outside Ayr, rushed to the park after her husband phoned. Clare, 33, said: “I drove in a panic. “Her leg was wedged in the car at a funny angle. “I could hear her screaming over the phone. My husband and others tried to get her out but it hurt so they called the fire brigade.” Firefighters calmly cut off the side of the car to free the tot.  She emerged unscathed but with bad pins and needles during the incident a week past last Wednesday. Now Clare and Lily-Mag’s gran Anita O’Connor are calling for an emergency services route to the wooded park. Clare said: “The fire service were really fantastic but it took them 10 minutes to figure out how to get the fire engine in.” Anita said: “She was stuck for well over 40 minutes as the fire engine couldn’t find a route through to the park because of the fencing. “Fortunately she has not sustained any injuries, but she is extremely traumatised. “This issue regarding access needs to be addressed ASAP and not sat on for days until the council have their next meeting.”  Belleisle Hotel owner Campbell Inns erected more fencing on June 6, which has blocked off access to the playpark through the main driveway. The alternative entrance is now through Greenfield Avenue. Anita said emergency services should have been notified of the issue. A council spokesman said: Due to layout changes affecting the main access road at Belleisle, emergency services had to enter via an alternate route. “We are contacting the emergency services to advise them to use the alternative entrance for the time being.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article10202187.ece/ALTERNATES/s482b/JS115682009.jpg","title":"pair young lads saved squirrel","story":"NewsPair of young lads saved squirrel that was lying in agonyNow the caring boys - Max Bryson and Ben Edwards - have been praised for their caring capers.\u0026nbspShareByStephen Houston10:10, 21 JUN 2018NewsMax Bryson, left and Ben Edwards (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailA squirrel lay in agony after plunging from a tree in a park ... only to be protected and saved by two young lads.

They came across the bashed-up critter at the side of the duck pond and sprang into action. Onlooker Lorna Barclay said the boys deserve recognition. She said: “The squirrel was obviously hurt and fretting on the path. “We approached to see if we could help but were pleasantly surprised they had the situation under control.” They had already called the SSPCA and protected the frightened furry animal from dogs. When the charity said they’d be an hour the boys went home and got a strong bag filled with straw - leaving Lorna on guard.  And Max’s mum Liz and dad Douglas, who own the Inverlea Guest House in Ayr, said: “He loves animals so wanted to help. “I am so happy both boys decided to intervene. “They did it all on their own and I knew nothing about it. “What the lady said about the boys was amazing.” The lads returned to the squirrel within 15 minutes with their custom-made bed all ready for the SSPCA inspector. Lorna added: “It was lovely to see how concerned and compassionate the boys as well as using their problem- solving skills.  “Many other people would have walked on by without any interest in helping.” Ben already has a busy household with dad James, mum Sarah, sisters Lizzie and Emily, two cats, a tortoise and a fish. Scottish SPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said: “At this time of year we receive a lot of calls about people concerned about wildlife. “We all have a responsibility to look after and care for the wildlife in Scotland and these two boys went above and beyond on this occasion to help this poor squirrel. “They should be very proud.” "},{"url":"https://i2-prod.dailyrecord.co.uk/incoming/article12713526.ece/ALTERNATES/s615b/emp_ayp_070618ecrepont_10JPG.jpg","title":"talented youngster finn ecrepont walking","story":"NewsTalented youngster Finn Ecrepont is walking on AyrDubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football.\u0026nbspShareByLochlin Highet12:00, 18 JUN 2018NewsAyr United\u0027s Finn Ecrepont (Image: Ayrshire Post)\u0026nbspShareGet daily updates directly to your inbox+ SubscribeThank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid EmailMost success stories in football start with a rejection somewhere along the line. And 15-year-old Ayr United starlet Finn Ecrepont is no different. Dubbed a hot prospect with a bright future, the local Ayr lad kicked off his footballing career with a knock back from Grange Academy’s Performance School of Football. The Kilmarnock school has dedicated facilities for bright talents in the footballing world. And after leaving Alloway Primary, Ecrepont’s aim was to join the set-up at the Grange - but he was told he wasn’t good enough at his trial for the performance school. But the left-back, who also went to Glenburn Primary, refused to give up on his dream. Ecrepont, who has played with Ayr United since he was nine, said: “Getting that knock back is key to where I am today, because that has made me realise it’s not as easy as just walking into a team. “I didn’t get through the first trial so that made me focus and I knew I had to work hard. “I guess there was choices to make and sacrifices to make, but I was willing to make these changes for my football.  “I had training at Ayr the night after I got my knock back so I went to ask my coach Ross Armour for advice, so that’s when the work began. “I went away and worked on my game and a year later I got into the performance school at the Grange, which is one of the best things that has ever happened to me.” Ecrepont worked his way up through the ranks at Ayr and has now signed a three year deal with the first team. Just last season he was training with the under 17s, but his progress has been off the scale and he is now training with the senior side. He has been getting day release from school on a Thursday to train with the first team, but after signing his new deal he will train four mornings a week with Ian McCall’s side. And despite most schools refusing to take him in due to his football commitments, Ayr Academy were good enough to take him in. And dad Eddy, who runs Cafe Ginger in Ayr, claims teachers from Ayr Academy have offered to work overtime to help Ecrepont through his studies. Ecrepont is delighted to get his chance so early with Ayr.  He said: “The coaches thought I was playing well so I got more of a chance through my training and playing more with the under 20s last season. “I just love being in and around the first team, and the boys have been great with me so I am happy to be where I’m at at the moment. “Everyone at the club has been brilliant with me, through all the age groups. All the senior players and coaches have been really accepting of me and I couldn’t have asked for anything more. “Ian McCall and all of the other coaches are great because they always give me feedback. “Whether it’s positive or negative they are always keeping me right. That has been key to my progression. “If I was to ask anyone a question at Ayr they would answer it no problem, and that’s exactly what I look for and it’s why I’m here.” Despite the gruelling schedule of being a footballer, Ecrepont claims he is still fully focused on his school work.  He said: “Adapting to be a footballer hasn’t been much different as I enjoy it and it’s more like a hobby. I play football for fun and that’s what’s most important to me, so I guess it’s just normal. “It can take a lot out of me, but again because I enjoy football so much I don’t really realise how much I am doing. “I don’t think it’s had an effect on my school and I think it’s going good. Hopefully I have done well in my exams which I’ll find out in August. “I’ll get a Wednesday off from training so I can hopefully work towards getting my highers. “This year I’m studying higher English and PE, next year I’ll do something like Chemistry and Biology. And despite his age, Ecrepont has already been involved in a number of big games. He scored for Scotland under 16s against England, but for Ayr under 20s he was involved in a league decider last season against Morton. He said: “Unfortunately we lost the game 1-0 from a penalty, but I played the full game and it was a great experience and the boys played really well.  “There was quite a few Ayr United fans there so they gave us a great support.” But Ecrepont refuses to forget where he came from, he is sure to consistently help his dad Eddy in Cafe Ginger. Ecrepont said: “I signed for Ayr on the Tuesday, I was washing dishes for my dad on the Friday and on the Monday I was training with Scotland. “I work with my dad at the cafe which has been key to keeping me grounded. I know for a fact he wouldn’t let me get big-headed so I couldn’t thank him enough for that. “I’ve been asked before where I see myself in five years, but the honest answer is I don’t know. “For all I know I could get injured tomorrow and break my leg. “I have been told many times that I haven’t made it, and I know that. “My hard work starts now, so I just need to take everything as it comes and take each day on its own.” "},{"url":null,"title":"NOSTALGIA  How horse power kept Innerleithen moving","story":"THIS week, Ross McGinn looks back at Innerleithen\u0026rsquos journey from horses to horse-power engines as a mode of transport...\nWhile much is currently talked about the transition to electric and driverless cars, here we look back to the last transition, in the early 1900s, with a move from horse to fuel-burning, engine-powered vehicles.\nThe High Street Smiddy (pictured below right), now the High Street Garage, was the very core of Innerleithen\u0026rsquos powerhouse.\nEach powerful animal had to be shod and fitted with appropriate pulling tackle.\nNot only was the horse used for its pulling power but many of the smaller breeds were used for leisure purposes.\nAs can be seen in the second photo (bottom right), a family group of riders prepare for a ride from outside Caerlee House in around 1910, no doubt off to explore the many trails by the river and on the hills around the town.\nFeaturing in the various processions of the day \u0026ndash pictured right at the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Games Week in Innerleithen and photographed by Thomas Colledge in 1907 \u0026ndash horse drawn carriages were the limousine of the day for local dignitaries such as the town Provost and Baillies.\nDaily coaches also ran to a time table from Innerleithen to St Mary\u0026rsquos Loch and Tibbieshiels and to the other Border towns of Peebles and Galashiels.\nThe change finally came in the early 1920s, as seen on the High Street in Innerleithen with a car outside the St Ronan\u0026rsquos Hotel (below).\nThereafter the horse and its power was gradually replace by horsepower provided by the internal combustion engine for transport, working the land and of course for leisure.\nIs the day approaching for the next transition?\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Line up unveiled for 16th Innerleithen music Festival","story":"NOW in its 16th year, Innerleithen Music Festival is gearing up for another feast of entertainment later this summer.\nAlways a hit with locals and visitors alike, this year promises to be another super showcase of, not only musical talent, but with other dance and drama events and for the first time ever \u0026ndash an art exhibition.\nFestival-goers can expect the usual great atmosphere and live music from local talent at the Live and Local event in the Vale Of Leithen Social Club throughout the weekend of August 17 to 19.\nHeadliners are soon to be announced, but firm favourites such as Unfinished Business, The IV Drips and Cameron Boak will all be there for your entertainment.\nThis event is Free all weekend and more details will be posted, including the full line up on the Live and Local facebook page.\nThe Friday evening kicks off with Act!

Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest.\nOn Friday morning the 26-year-old joiner led his town with both authority and calmness as Souters celebrated and honoured their historic traditions.\nYet the countdown couldn\u0027t have been more nerve-racking or distracting.\nDelays in Selkirk town centre renovations meant a reshuffle of vantage points for the iconic Casting of the Colours ceremony.\nAnd on the eve of the Common Riding itself, Storm Hector rampaged through the Royal Burgh tearing down bunting and leaving a trail of destruction and debris.\nIf the build-up wasn\u0027t distracting enough, a thoughtless thug spent the Nicht Afore the Morn spray-painting graffiti on landmarks including the War Memorial.\nBut just a few hours later the 2018 Standard Bearer remained the picture of calm as the sun gently rose on Friday morning.\nThe weather had relented, the debris had been cleared, the bunting had been restrung, and the vandalism was covered.\nAnd as Souters frae a\u0027 the airts linked arms and belted out the songs they\u0027d learned as children, all the woes were soon forgotten.\nSelkirk shone as it always does on Common Riding morning.\nAfter returning the Burgh Flag, Standard Bearer Forrest told us: \"I have been calm all week and even managed to get a good three hours\u0027 sleep last night.\n\"I\u0027m not sure how I manage it, but I don\u0027t get nervous at all, and despite everything that has happened, for me the Common Riding couldn\u0027t have gone any better.\n\"I\u0027ve loved the build up and I have loved every second of being Standard Bearer - I don\u0027t think the smile has left my face since the minute I got up this morning.\"\nWhether it was the four years he served as an Attendant - behind James Cheyne in 2009, Douglas Gunn in 2010, Gavin Henderson in 2012 and Kieran Riddle in 2017 - that equipped Peter for taking his duties in his stride, we\u0027ll never know.\nBut his composure and welcoming smile wasn\u0027t lost on any of the dignitaries around him.\nHonorary Provost Jake Wheelans said: \"After all the bad weather and everything else it was great to have Peter as our Standard Bearer.\n\"He was impeccable in every part of his duties today, and he upheld all of our traditions as a Standard Bearer should.\n\"Selkirk has enjoyed a tremendous Common Riding with a fantastic Standard Bearer.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Keep calm - it  39 s only the Common Riding","story":"THE calming influence of Standard Bearer Peter Forrest made sure Selkirk Common Riding ran like clockwork on Friday.\nJust hours after Storm Hector had ripped through the region, Souters awoke to a serene and surprisingly relaxed morning.\nAnd about to head their day-long celebrations was to be the most relaxed of them all - Standard Bearer Forrest.\nThe Flute Band\u0027s Rouse Parade set the tone for a day few will forget.\nHundreds gathered at the War Memorial to honour the brave sons of Selkirk who didn\u0027t come home.\nAnd as the First Drum was sounded at 6am in the Market Place, the hundreds who do come home year after year from far off lands burst into song.\nHer Bright Smile has rarely sounded so good.\nThe build-up had well and truly begun.\nAnd by the time Standard Bearer Forrest was officially installed by Lady Busser, Dylis Wheelans, on the balcony of the Victoria Hall the hundreds had grown to thousands.\nA total of 281 riders followed the 2018 Standard Bearer doon the Green, across the Ettrick and up the Linglie.\nEveryone one of them was safe oot and every one of them returned safe in, some two-and-a-half hours later.\nOfficial reports later confirmed only three minor falls occurred throughout the entire procession.\nAs Standard Bearer Forrest, duly assisted by his Attendants Craig Monks, Robbie Reilly, Thomas Willmott and Liam Cassidy, led the cavalcade beyond Tibbie\u0027s towards the Three Brethren, beneath in the ancient streets of Selkirk the Hammermen, the Weavers, the Fleshers, the Colonials, the Merchants and the Ex-Soldiers began to muster ahead of their march to the Toll.\nAll the pomp and ceremony, headed by the trusty Silver and Pipe bands, brings out the best in this small rural burgh.\nIt\u0027s a place where pride and passion go hand in hand with smiles and laughter.\nSongs are sung, friendships rekindled and customs observed as the crowds patiently await the Coming in of the Burley.\nAnd they didn\u0027t have to wait long at Selkirk\u0027s northern most entrance as Standard Bearer Forrest, aboard the grey-dappled Lizzie, arrived to a cacophony of cheers and shouts of encouragement.\nProud parents, Ann and Rob, as well as girlfriend, Emma Pearce, were the first to offer him their congratulations as a well-deserved breather is taken at The Toll.\nAnd, in time-honoured fashion, his mounted followers made their own spectacular galloping return to the auld toon.\nJoyce Wright, representing the Ladies section of the Rig Committee, presented the traditional riding crop to Standard Bearer Forrest before he remounted to conclude his duties.\nAnd what a conclusion it is.\nThe Casting of the Colours pays homage to the heroic Fletcher, who returned from Flodden with a captured English banner and defiantly cast it around his head before dying.\nTo Up wi\u0027 the Souters Standard Bearer Forrest brought his ceremonial duties to an end with an impeccable cast.\nReflecting on his day, Peter told us: \"Being Standard Bearer was everything I knew it would be and more.\n\"I enjoyed the Marches - really enjoyed it - and my horse Lizzie was great.\n\"You think it can\u0027t get any better then it does. Coming in at The Toll was unbelievable and the Casting was something that will live with me forever.\n\"It has been a truly amazing day and I\u0027d like to thank everyone who came out and supported me.\"\n"},{"url":null,"title":"Casting their places in history","story":"SELKIRK Common Riding is undoubtedly a festival steeped in tradition and commemoration.\nBut it is also a day of contrasts for the followers as well as the ones lucky enough to take part.\nFrom the high-adrenaline riders returning at the Toll, the ecstasy and elation is quietly absorbed by reflection and respect as the colourful procession heads into town.\nBeneath silver skies the rearranged scarlet plinth within the Market Place awaited not only Royal Burgh Standard Bearer Peter Forrest, but the six accompanying Standard Bearers selected by the town\u0026rsquos ancient Societies and Associations.\nTo the growing thrum of expectation, as the hidden clock ticked past eleven, all seven gathered beneath the steps to await a brief minute or two that will live with them forever.\nSince the tragic cast of a blood-soaked English banner more than 500 years ago, this re-enactment both commemorates and celebrates, defiance and pride in equal measure.\nAnd as the Silver Band leads the way with Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters, each Standard Bearer in turn re-enacts and relives this defiant and proud act.\nStandard Bearer Forrest, as he had been all morning, was assured and relaxed as he turned the Royal Burgh Standard above his head.\nIt was as deserved a cheer as any Standard Bearer has received as he smiled, waved and made his way from the gaze of five-thousand eyes.\nCollege lecturer Mark Easson \u0026ndash a painter by trade \u0026ndash resumed where Standard Bearer Forrest had left off. Armed with the Incorporation of Hammermen Banner, the 49-year-old showed a steady hand and perfect timing to provide an impeccable cast.\nHis smile was as deserved as the loud cheer that followed him down the steps.\nFletcher himself was a weaver before that bloody battle in 1513, and Michael Pepper made sure the fabric of the historic Corporation continued unblemished for another year.\nThe 27-year-old textiles worker may have looked a little nervous but as his cast continued his smile grew. Again, the appreciation was richly deserved.\nFormer farmer Jackie Johnston brought experience with him as he provided a perfect cast of the Incorporation of Fleshers Flag.\nIf there were nerves, they didn\u0026rsquot show as the self-employed excavator took it all in his stride, even managing a thumbs-up to the conductor of the Silver Band before dismounting.\nWhile the other Standard Bearers have enjoyed several weeks\u0026rsquo of practice under the guiding gaze of those who have gone before them, Colonial Standard Bearer Alisdair Piercy has been using two broom-handles taped together with an old Scotland flag in his garage in Toronto.\nBut casting the colours is in his blood - the 39-year-old was following in the footsteps of his father, Drew, and grandfather, Archie, by casting the colours.\nAnd the 2018 Colonial Standard Bearer was perfect in every way as he cast the striking yellow banner above his head.\nFollowing the ceremony Alisdair revealed: \u0026ldquoI watched the casting so many times when I was a boy growing up in Selkirk.\n\u0026ldquoBeing up there was amazing \u0026ndash I was ready to start but when that drum sounds it hits you right in the heart.\n\u0026ldquoI was trying not to listen to the band and keep counting in my head, like I\u0026rsquod been told, and I think it worked.\nThe wave and grin from Alisdair were deserved as he savoured every moment on the scarlet plinth.\nOne Standard Bearer who is more familiar with the new-look Market Place than most is architect Stuart Davidson.\nThe 37-year-old dad-of-three has been heavily involved in the ongoing redesign of the town centre.\nStuart was a picture of concentration throughout most of his faultless cast, only allowing himself a huge smile of relief during the final bars of Up wi\u0026rsquo the Souters.\nArguably the most poignant of all is saved for last.\nFormer KOSB Martin Young brought with him all the military discipline and reliability you would expect as he carried the Ex-Soldiers\u0026rsquo Association Flag onto the scarlet plinth.\nThe father of two, who is a now a traffic policeman, provided another faultless cast with the Union banner before leading this close-knit community in two minutes of silence and reflection.\nWith the centenary fast approaching of the end of the Great War, the sacrifice made by so many is being brought even clearer into focus.\nThat defiance of tyranny and pride in one\u0026rsquos own beliefs and customs, shown by Fletcher, has carried on in Souters down the centuries as decade after decade they have made the ultimate sacrifice.\nThose two minutes of impeccable silence and reflection were only broken by the haunting strains of The Liltin.\nAnd for yet another year, Souters can return home safe in the knowledge that the past won\u0026rsquot be forgotten and the future is one of hope.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"New route planned for tonight s Melrosian s rideout","story":"FOLLOWERS of Melrosian

InChorus subsequently performed with Dougie at the Amber Festival in Perth.\nThe trip to New York was hugely memorable with the choir singing on the Red Steps in Times Square, at the annual NYPD concert, at various September Concerts in the city, and, most poignantly, at the British Memorial Garden to the relatives of the British people who had died on 9/11.\nMoira Pearson, who is one of the founding members and choir manager from 2009 to 2012, told us: \" When the advert for a New Peebles Choir was placed in the Peeblesshire News in September 2008 no-one could have imagined just how important InChorus would become to so many people.\n\"It was a great privilege to be the choir manager for three years, during which time we travelled to New York to support and sing at commemorative events for the 10th Anniversary of 9/11.\n\"The fundraising effort to enable the journey was immense but made much easier by the unstinting support of the Peebles community.\"\nAlthough the 9/11 concert will remain a highlight of the InChorus story, the successes and landmark achievements continued after they came home.\nThe next year, 2012, saw the choir performing to another full house at the Festival Theatre, this time raising funds for other charities which is what InChorus likes to do.\nThe following year they embarked upon their \u0026lsquoChoirathon\u0026rsquo in aid of Comic Relief, when they sang from 9.30am to 9.30pm in the sleet, but raised \u0026pound3,500 in the process.\nIn 2013 they also had their first foray to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in what was to be come a biennial venture, winning the covered sell-out laurels in 2013, 2015 and 2017.\nIn 2014 the choir decided to try its hand at competition winning themselves a \u0026lsquoChoir of the Day\u0026rsquo award at the Scottish auditions of Choir of the Year, proving that even a very large choir can be sufficiently disciplined in all the nuances of choral singing to make a good impression.\nOver the years InChorus members discovered they rather liked performing at music festivals and have sung at T in the Park, Meadows Festival, Fringe by the Sea at North Berwick, Big Burns Supper in Dumfries, Eden Festival, Lindisfarne, and last year on the main stage between Texas and the Manic Street Preachers, at the BBC Children in Need\u0026rsquos Carfest in front of an audience of 20,000 people. How do they top that?\nThey also love weddings and travelled to Dublin in 2016 to sing at the wedding of a choir member\u0026rsquos son. While there, they performed on the bandstand in St Stephen\u0026rsquos Green and at the famous Cobblestone pub, as well as appearing as a flash mob all over the city.\nAly Skidmore, herself a long serving choir member, took over as Musical Director in 2014.

Views were sought on the Borderlands\u0026rsquo key themes: Digital Energy Destination Borderlands Rural Productivity Business Growth Transport Innovation and Skills and Quality of Place.\nThe conference had backing from both governments who have pledged support for a deal.\nKeith Brown MSP, Cabinet Secretary for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work, said: \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government has made clear our support for a proposed Borderlands deal in our budget statements. And we look forward to negotiating the detail of that deal when the partners are ready with their proposals. This is a key part of our commitment to 100 percent coverage of deals across Scotland.\n\u0026ldquoWe want to see an ambitious deal that focuses on driving inclusive growth and the priorities that will make a difference and help the economy thrive. We want a deal that helps address the area\u0026rsquos connectivity challenges, supports growth in sectors particularly important in the Borderlands, and creates more opportunities for all to attract people to the area.\n\u0026ldquoWe are working to tackle the economic challenges in the South of Scotland, having already committed to establishing a South of Scotland enterprise agency, and we want to ensure that priorities align to maximise impact and success.\nSpeaking ahead of the conference the Secretary of State for Scotland, David Mundell said:\n\"The Borderlands Growth Deal represents a unique opportunity to provide a real shot in the arm to the economy of our region, a region that faces similar challenges wherever you live or work within it.\n\u0026ldquoWorking with the proposals that have been prepared by local authorities, businesses and individuals, we will spend the summer shaping these in to a coherent deal that will support the economy of the region by encouraging people to invest in new opportunities, by building on our strengths and improving the lives of those who live here.\n\u0026ldquoIn that way, we will bring to the Borderlands the benefits that are now being seen across the UK as investment in City and Growth Deals progresses.\nDumfries and Galloway Council Chief Executive Gavin Stevenson said: \u0026ldquoCrucially we now sit between the emerging powerhouses of the central belt of Scotland and the Northern Powerhouse in England. Unless we act they will continue to suck up our young talent and skills.\n\u0026ldquoWe need to re-position ourselves, we need to stabilise and to stop our productivity falling and then we also need to reinvent. This feels like a once in a generation opportunity.\n\u0026ldquoWe know our potential, our children will not forgive us if there are no jobs in the future.

Before that, in December 1828, Peebles Town Council had agreed that if a gas company was set up, it would be allowed to open up and lay pipes in the streets and if that proved successful, it would then have the street lamps lit by gas.\nInitially a site for a gasworks on the Old Town Green (now Greenside) was chosen, but it proved to be unsuitable. A site was found on the area of ground lying to the west of the Parish Church. Today the site is still visible and forms part of the parkland and walkways close to the modern swimming pool.\nOne of the factors which made the development of a gasworks feasible was the great improvement in major roads serving the town following the Turnpike Acts. That allowed coking coal to be brought to the town from the coalfields of Lanarkshire and Midlothian.\nTo begin with gas was produced for only ten months of the year and the street lights were lit for only about a third of the year, during the darkest winter months.\nBy the end of the 19th century, the demand for gas had greatly increased and as well as street lighting, was beginning to be used for household appliances such as gas cookers. In 1898 the assets of the Peebles Gas Company were acquired by the Town Council. Within a few years demand was outstripping supply and in 1905 it was decided to build a new gas works at Eshiels as the existing site, which also served as the council yard, was too restricted to allow for expansion. By then the existence of railways made it possible to import coal directly to the Eshiels site.\nIn 1948 the Town Council starting converting all street lighting to electricity. The gas works at Eshiels became part of the national system and continued in operation until the advent of North Sea gas in the late 1960s.\n"},{"url":null,"title":"  39 We  39 re so proud of him  39   parents of Galashiels scout with ADHD hope to inspire others to join group","story":"THE parents of a Galashiels Scout with ADHD hope others will be inspired after the youngster won a prestigious award.\nAfter weeks of working hard to complete an array of challenges and tasks, Blair Valentine took home the Reiver Award at the Gala Scout Group annual general meeting last month.\nThe 10-year-old, who attends St Peter\u0026rsquos Primary School in Galashiels, received the award in recognition of his hard work after being nominated by numerous members of the Scouts.\nProud parents Dave and Mandy now hope their son\u0026rsquos success story will inspire other parents of children with ADHD.\nThe youngster was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder in July 2013 at the age of six.\nBlair\u0026rsquos mum Mandy told the Border : \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore so proud of him, Blair has worked very hard to get where he is, and we want others to know that just because a child has ADHD, it shouldn\u0026rsquot hold them back from going on to do great things.\n\u0026ldquoBlair gets especially inspired when hearing that celebrities have the same condition as him.\n\u0026ldquoUntil we looked into it, we had no idea just how many well-known people were also affected by it.

Six-year-old Maisie, who plays the main character, Libby, in the film, in what was her first ever acting role, was accompanied to the glitzy ceremony in Los Angeles by her mother Elizabeth, co-star and writer Rachel Shenton, and the short film\u0026rsquos director Chris Overton.

The Silent Child follows Libby, a profoundly deaf child born to a hearing family who struggle to communicate with their daughter.  As a result, she grows up isolated and develops behavioural problems until a social worker, played by Rachel Shenton, comes in to help.  Rachel, most famous for her role as Mitzeee Minniver in Channel 4\u0026rsquos Hollyoaks, wrote the film to raise awareness of the issues around hearing impairment and to improve viewers\u0026rsquo understanding of the condition.  She was inspired to do so by her experiences with her father, who became deaf following chemotherapy when she was 12.  The film was directed by Rachel\u0026rsquos fianc\u0026eacute Chris Overton, with a \u0026pound10,000 crowdfunded budget.  Maisie earned her role following a nationwide search, during which over 100 children auditioned for the part.  After filming, a surprise screening of The Silent Child was organised by Rachel at Maisie\u0026rsquos school, Red Oaks Primary, in August.  Maisie then flew with her proud parents, Elizabeth, who is also deaf,\u0026nbspand Gilson, who is partially deaf, to the film\u0026rsquos international premiere in Rhode Island \u0026ndash her first visit to the US, and her first time on a plane.

East Lothian Council intends to create a new primary school, operating from the existing school buildings, which will cover nursery through to primary seven. The proposal was approved by East Lothian Council in April after a public consultation. It has now also been approved by the Scottish Government.  Combined, the two schools currently have a school roll of about 700 pupils. However, it remains unclear who the new headteacher for the primary school, which is yet to be named, will be.

Fiona Robertson, head of education at East Lothian Council, said: \u0026ldquoWe believe that the decision to establish one new primary school, operating under a single management structure, offers the best solution to not only developing a stronger and more cohesive curriculum, but that local children will benefit from improved progression planning and transition as they progress from infant to upper stage.  \u0026ldquoOur education service will work closely with our current headteacher Mrs McGillivray, and the chairs of both parent councils, to recruit a headteacher for the newly established school.

Five retail units are planned for a site at Gateside previously earmarked for a Sainsbury\u0026rsquos supermarket and petrol station.  The site, which totals about 60,000 sq ft, could be made up of units ranging from 7,500 sq ft to 20,000 sq ft in size.  Alastair Dickie, development director with Ediston Real Estates, which now owns the site, attended the town\u0026rsquos community council meeting on Tuesday, one week before plans are unveiled to the public.  He told members the proposal was for the site to include three food retailers, with the other two units including \u0026ldquoa household-type retail business and a coffee drive-through facility.  However, he was keeping tight-lipped on the identity of the businesses until legal agreements were in place.  Mr Dickie hoped planning permission for the site, off Oak Tree Roundabout west of Haddington, could be achieved by the end of the year.  He said: \u0026ldquoIf we submit an application in August, we would hope. . . we would hopefully have a consent in December or January next year.  \u0026ldquoWe could be on site quarter one of 2019.  It is then hoped that the retailers could be trading in the lead-up to Christmas that year or early in 2020.  The development, which has been described as \u0026ldquoEast Lothian\u0026rsquos first retail park, will involve in the region of \u0026pound14 million investment, with 150 jobs potentially created, as well as those during the construction process.  It has already been revealed that talks are ongoing with \u0026ldquoa number of major retailers who will be new to East Lothian.  Concerns have been expressed by a number of retailers in the town centre that the creation of a retail park on the outskirts would be detrimental to their business.  But Mr Dickie, who previously lived in the town and continues to stay in the county, was hopeful the additional retailers would encourage people to remain in the area rather than heading further afield to retail parks in Edinburgh.  The proposals are on display to the public from 2pm to 7pm on Tuesday at the John Gray Centre.  The developer is also continuing to make progress at a second Haddington site for retail development \u0026ndashat Harperdean, between the A1 and the A199, east of Aberlady Road.

The new scheme offers people an opportunity to support Our Community Energy \u0026ndash a partnership between not-for-profit Scottish firm Our Power and Mongoose Energy, which manages community energy assets \u0026ndash and hopes to find investors in the county.  They say that the site at Pogbie Windfarm \u0026ndash already home to the turbines \u0026ndash will create enough energy to power 7,200 homes and believe that, when they combine it with a second site in Berwickshire, the scheme will raise an estimated \u0026pound1.9 million in surplus profit over 25 years.  Our Power said that profit from the wind turbines it takes over would then be used to keep energy prices down, helping people who are struggling with the costs.  They need to raise just over \u0026pound3 million for the project, which covers both sites, and community groups and individuals are being invited to invest in bonds and shares to raise the money needed to get the project up and running, with investments ranging from \u0026pound500 to \u0026pound100,000.  Andrew Smith, Our Community Energy acting chairperson, said: \u0026ldquoFuel poverty is a huge issue for Scotland and we\u0026rsquore proud to be launching such an important fundraising opportunity to directly tackle it.  \u0026ldquoInvesting with a social purpose is something close to the hearts of many Scots, and these bond and equity offers provide the chance to have a huge impact locally.  \u0026ldquoThese offers aim to support those who struggle to afford sufficiently heated homes, as well as providing investors with an exciting new option which not only targets a significant social impact but a positive environmental one too.  \u0026ldquoHowever with these types of investments there are some risks and funds are not readily realisable.  \u0026ldquoInvestors should note that capital is at risk and returns are not guaranteed.  A fuel poor household is defined as one which needs to spend more than 10 per cent of its income on all fuel use and to heat its home to an adequate standard of warmth.  Last year, the East Lothian Poverty Commission found that almost half of local pensioners were forced to spend more than 10 per cent of their income on energy bills.  Mark Kenber, CEO of Mongoose Energy, added: \u0026ldquoWith the majority of Scots recognising the critical level that fuel poverty has reached, it is now more important than ever for investors to put their money into causes that work for the social good, not just their own.  \u0026ldquoOur Community Energy not only gives investors the potential to earn competitive interest rates on their money, but also the opportunity to support the wider Scottish community.

Councillor Jeremy Findlay, ward member and former chairman of Gullane Area Community Council, said: \u0026ldquoAll three ward councillors are behind the campaign to save the club and we hope that the members understand the feeling in the village.  \u0026ldquoI understand that the committee own the club and it would be the members who benefit from any potential sale.  About 50 residents gathered outside the bowling club on Monday evening to show their displeasure at the possible loss of the club.  The group told the Courier they had had hundreds of offers of support.  Catherine MacKenzie said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquove had people phone up, email and text us \u0026ndash and face-to-face \u0026ndash to tell us that they\u0026rsquore willing to become a member.  \u0026ldquoSome of them don\u0026rsquot live locally, or won\u0026rsquot be able to bowl, but they are willing to pay the membership fees.

Billy Mellors, the county\u0026rsquos bowls development officer, said: \u0026ldquoThe overwhelming support from the local community indicates to me the future of Gullane Bowling Club can be sustained if the current members accept it.  Many locals have tried to sign up as members but have been turned away by the club, it has been claimed.  Another member of the group said: \u0026ldquoWhat has shocked us as a group is how many people have been refused membership in recent years \u0026ndash young and old have come forward with their personal experience of being turned away.  Mr Mellors added: \u0026ldquoTime will tell on the way the club want to go but we all hope a common sense approach is taken to preserve this community facility.  East Lothian MSP Iain Gray met representatives of the Bowls for Gullane group last week and is keen to find a solution to ensure the club\u0026rsquos survival.  He said: \u0026ldquoThis is an unfortunate situation Gullane has lost too many local assets recently, so every effort should be made to avoid losing another. I did meet with representatives of the campaign and have said that I will support them in trying to find a way the land, and preferably bowling too, can remain part of the village community.  Ian McMillan, CEO of Bowls Scotland, said that he was \u0026ldquodelighted to see local residents lend their support to the campaign to save the 116-year-old club.  He added: \u0026ldquoI would encourage all in the village to support their historic club, get on the green, enjoy the great game of bowls and ensure future generations can benefit from the opportunity to play an accessible, inclusive sport. Bowls Scotland fully supports the work being undertaken to keep bowls an important part of Gullane\u0026rsquos community fabric.  Les Ritchie, secretary of East Lothian Bowling Association, told the group: \u0026ldquoWe are ready to support you and the community in whatever steps might secure a future for bowling in Gullane.  Attempts by the Courier to speak to Michael Baxter, vice-president and secretary at the bowling club, were unsuccessful this week. In April, Mr Baxter told us: \u0026ldquoThere are not enough members to support the running of the club.  He had said then that the club was \u0026ldquotrying to find a solution but that it was not viable to continue with a dwindling membership.

Colin Beattie stressed that \u0026ldquoradical thinking needed to be done to create a solution, highlighting a possible extension of a tram or light rail system out to Musselburgh.  During a recent Holyrood debate, he said: \u0026ldquoPeople meet the queues of traffic heading on to the bypass on the main roads around my constituency before they are even near the bypass. This causes more congestion and more air pollution.  Mr Beattie later said: \u0026ldquoYou can go along the road at any time of the day and there are queues of traffic, mainly at Sheriffhall Roundabout.  \u0026ldquoIt is important that when the Government are looking at all the possible changes required to the bypass, all options are considered. The main priority should be that it is cost-efficient and done as soon as possible.  \u0026ldquoIt may be that it is more economic to extend a tram or light rail system out to the main population centres such as Musselburgh than to take on the eye-watering cost of enlarging the A720. This would also benefit the environment and be much faster than using road transport.  \u0026ldquoClearly more radical thinking needs to be done on creating a sustainable solution. I am not convinced that simply replicating a system which moves traffic speedily and efficiently into new choke points is the answer.  Miles Briggs, Lothian region MSP who led the Parliamentary debate, said: \u0026ldquoThe transport information company Inrix in late 2016 identified the bypass as the most congested trunk road outside London, with four of the UK\u0026rsquos worst bottlenecks.  \u0026ldquoI continue to be contacted by frustrated constituents and businesspeople who face frequent delays when using the bypass to commute or transport goods, especially but not exclusively at peak times or when there is an accident on the route. Many drivers tell me their experience is that these tailbacks and traffic jams are becoming more and more regular.  He said that while proposed work at Sheriffhall would be an important improvement, he added: \u0026ldquoIt is only one part of what needs to be a far broader, long-term and coordinated programme of improvements to the bypass which will ensure traffic can keep moving in the decades ahead.  \u0026ldquoThis means looking at innovative solutions, assessing whether extra lanes will be needed, looking at the possible use of hard shoulders in some situations and utilising technology so the bypass can become a smart motorway.  Mr Briggs called on the Scottish Government to take forward a feasibility study into widening the city bypass and new options to address the growing congestion.  A Transport Scotland spokesperson said: \u0026ldquoThe Edinburgh and South East Scotland City Region Deal includes investment of up to \u0026pound120m in the A720 city bypass for the grade separation of Sheriffhall Roundabout and \u0026pound20 million investment in public transport infrastructure in west Edinburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis investment will improve journey reliability and safety for all users and support significant planned investment in Edinburgh and South East Scotland.  \u0026ldquoThe Scottish Government remains committed to undertaking the improvements at the Sheriffhall junction at the earliest opportunity. We are continuing to progress the detailed design development and assessment of the preferred option and expect to publish draft orders in 2019."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7930076.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Haddington pub seeking new owners","story":"              A TOWN centre pub which changed its name less than a year ago is on the lookout for new people to run it.

Inspectors found the following strengths in the school\u0027s work:  - Strong relationships exist between staff and children across the school and nursery which are based on shared values  - In the nursery, children are motivated and confident, and are able to make choices about their play, particularly outdoors. Across the primary stages, children are committed to and proud of being part of their school community  - The committed staff team, led by the headteacher, work well together in their goal to secure positive outcomes for children. Wellbeing is central to the whole school community and staff provide a nurturing learning environment where children receive effective support.

Brave Ruth Quilietti-Bird \u0026ndash who at one point was the most ill person \u0026ldquoin the whole of the UK, according to her husband \u0026ndash moved hospital several times to receive specialist treatment for multiple organ failure, spending her 40th birthday in intensive care rather than on a planned holiday.  She has had both her feet amputated after they suffered tissue damage due to sepsis \u0026ndash a serious complication of an infection.\u0026nbsp It was also feared that Ruth, who taught art at Knox Academy in Haddington and Preston Lodge High School, Prestonpans, might also lose her hands.  She is recovering at the Astley Ainslie Hospital in Edinburgh, where she is getting used to her newly-fitted prosthetic legs with the aid of physiotherapists.  The health of her hands improved and she is keeping them busy by resuming her love of creative activities such as drawing, weaving and needlework.  Ruth is now looking forward to getting out of hospital to rejoin her family: husband Mark, 47, and their daughters, seven-year-old Lucia and Isabella, five.    But she can\u0026rsquot return to her New Street home in Musselburgh as it has an outdoor staircase and is no longer suitable, so the search for a new home is under way.  Now her friend Jacqueline Campbell has launched a crowdfunding campaign to raise \u0026pound20,000 to help fund a mobility scooter and adapt a new property.  In March, Ruth suddenly started to have breathing problems along with vomiting and diarrhoea.  Mark, a nurse at the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, said she was rushed to the accident and emergency unit at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh by paramedics who assessed that she was suffering from sepsis, which can be triggered by an infection and affected her immune system.  He said: \u0026ldquoHer health deteriorated more and more and she was taken to the high dependency unit. They said they needed to ventilate Ruth and that was the last time I spoke to her for two-and-a-half weeks. She went into a medicalised coma.  Mark said it was still unknown what was causing the infection, so Ruth received multiple antibiotics.  \u0026ldquoThe consultant told me to prepare myself because we were losing Ruth, he said.  The medical team decided to take Ruth into theatre to connect an ECMO (extracorporeal membrane oxygenation) circuit to help her breathing.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoThey managed to stabilise her but her vital organs were failing. Her respiratory had already failed and her kidneys had failed.  \u0026ldquoThere was no one as ill as Ruth in the whole of the UK at that time, receiving that amount of support to keep her alive.  Ruth was then transferred to a specialist ECMO unit at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoHer liver was failing and her heart was beginning to fail.  \u0026ldquoThey said again that they were losing Ruth and she wouldn\u0026rsquot last the in-patient stay.  \u0026ldquoThey made the decision to fit a second ECMO circuit to support her heart and this stabilised her.  \u0026ldquoI was told several times I might be potentially losing Ruth. Then things started improving and they were able to withdraw some of the support and her blood tests were showing very small improvements.  \u0026ldquoRuth was infected with group \u0026lsquoA\u0026rsquo streptococcal, a very aggressive bacteria which is around us all the time.  \u0026ldquoRuth\u0026rsquos immune system was already affected, so it was able to take over very quickly, causing failure to the vital organs. She was diagnosed with sepsis and pneumonia.  Ruth began to make progress with her breathing, her heart started to stabilise and her kidneys started to improve. Doctors felt they could remove the ECMO circuit for the heart and rescind the \u0026lsquodo not resuscitate\u0026rsquo notice.  As doctors brought Ruth out of sedation, she faced the risk of haemorrhaging throughout the body because of blood thinning and medications.  Mark said: \u0026ldquoI remember her opening her eyes and looking at me.  \u0026ldquoWe put our foreheads together and looked into each others\u0026rsquo eyes. I knew that Ruth was back.  \u0026ldquoHow close she was to dying on several occasions is still difficult to comprehend.  A special moment for Ruth was a visit by her daughters for her birthday when they took her cuddly toys and held her hand. Her mum and dad were also at her bedside.  Ruth was moved back to the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, where her ventilator was removed and she was able to start to speak.  But as she got better, she was to face a huge decision as a result of the tissue damage, caused by the lack of blood flow, which had turned her feet black.  She was told she would have to lose her right foot and possibly half of her left foot, with surgery carried out at St John\u0026rsquos Hospital in Livingston.  But Ruth, determined to get the best quality of life, made the decision to lose both feet below the knee, which would give her more choices in terms of prosthetics and improve her recovery.    Mark paid tribute to the \u0026ldquowonderful hospital staff who had \u0026ldquogiven everything for Ruth.  He highlighted the help he had received from friends and family over the past few months, including the network of \u0026lsquoSupermums\u0026rsquo who looked after Lucia and Isabella, friends, neighbours and colleagues at the Western General.  He said: \u0026ldquoThe kindness of people has been overwhelming. They want to help so much.  The family have also received support from the charity \u0026lsquoFinding Your Feet\u0026rsquo, which helps families affected by amputation or limb difference.

Two of the school\u0026rsquos four P6 classes had already taken part in the one-night camp last month.  In total, 54 youngsters were expected to camp out this week.  However, Jill Wareham, the school\u0026rsquos headteacher, contacted parents on Monday to say that a decision had been taken to cancel the overnight stays after \u0026ldquoa group of people camped near the field they use.

Mrs Wareham told parents in an email: \u0026ldquoYou may be aware that there is a group of people camped near the field at Yellowcraig where we usually hold our camp out.

A study is being launched to examine how the six secondary schools could work together to ensure they all start and end at the same time and follow a common timetable.  A meeting of East Lothian Council\u0026rsquos cabinet heard that high schools had historically been given considerable autonomy in planning their school days and \u0026ldquocurricular arrangements. But this had resulted in \u0026ldquosix different structures, length of the school day and different levels of access in terms of experience and opportunity. And there was \u0026ldquosignificant variation throughout East Lothian in the range of Advanced Higher and Higher courses offered and the number of qualifications available in S4.  The report, backed by councillors, said the feasibility study would aim to lead to the creation of \u0026ldquoa common secondary school day and a common curricular structure.  The move would also see a change in hours for primary schools to match the new secondary day, with proposals to extend P1 and P2 pupils\u0026rsquo week from 22.5 hours to the same 25 hours that their older school-mates follow. A failure to synchronise primary school start and finish times to match the high school changes would cost the council an estimated \u0026pound190,000 in additional transport costs.  A public consultation will now be launched with the schools to establish the best standard timetable, with options for a 27, 32 or 33-period week. A 33-period week, for instance, could see secondary students\u0026rsquo first period of the day start at 8.30am, with a finish time of 3.40pm Monday to Thursday and 12.55pm on Fridays.  The council said a common school day would lead to joint delivery, mutual support, sharing of best practice and collaborative professional development opportunities, as well as meaning greater equity of resource and opportunity for young people across East Lothian and barriers to travel would be reduced.  Councillor Shamin Akhtar, cabinet spokesperson for education, said: \u0026ldquoThese proposals are all about improving inclusion, wellbeing and equality. We\u0026rsquore always keen to look for new ways of raising attainment and improving positive destinations for our children and young people.  \u0026ldquoThere are a number of potential practical benefits associated with such changes.

The operation at the site off Edinburgh Road took place last Thursday.  Sculptor Michael Johnson\u0026rsquos work, called \u0026lsquoMemory and Reflection\u0026rsquo, is 12ft high and 6ft feet wide.  The stainless steel sculpture depicts aspects of Musselburgh\u0026rsquos history with images of agriculture, people, connections to the sea, the river and the Romans. The face of the sculpture is mirror polished and reflects whatever stands before it.  Mr Johnson, from Nottinghamshire, sees these two aspects of the shell, the memory and reflection, as metaphors for a work which interprets the history of the town and offers a reflection of how the town is viewed now.  A working group made up of community representatives selected the mussel shell for the commission. Mr Johnson undertook activities with local groups and schoolchildren to create designs for bronze inserts incorporated onto the main sculpture.  The fisherfolk stone sculpture at Murdoch Green will be moved to a seating area in front of the Shell petrol station, also off Edinburgh Road.

These machines reward people for recycling by providing money or vouchers in return for empty containers.  Iceland\u0026rsquos reverse vending machine will accept Iceland\u0026rsquos empty plastic beverage bottles and repay customers with a 10p voucher for each recycled bottle to be used in store.  The Musselburgh installation follows Iceland\u0026rsquos industry-first trial in London last month.  The six-month trials are designed to help the company better understand consumer perceptions and appetite for plastics-recycling technology across the UK.  They come ahead of the expected launch of a national deposit return scheme to which the Scottish, UK and Welsh Governments have all announced their commitment in principle.  The trials will help Iceland to provide government and industry with insights that might support the creation of a national scheme.  Environment Secretary Roseanna Cunningham MSP said: \u0026ldquoThis reverse vending machine will provide valuable evidence on how to help reduce single-use plastic waste and encourage customers to change their own behaviour as we look to end Scotland\u0026rsquos throwaway culture.  \u0026ldquoI would urge all manufactures and retailers to follow Iceland\u0026rsquos example and consider what action they can take to reduce the use of single-use plastics.  \u0026ldquoIn the coming months the Scottish Government will be consulting on a new deposit return scheme for drinks containers that will be one step to increase recycling rates right across Scotland.  \u0026ldquoAs part of our action to reduce the blight of waste littering our communities and polluting our seas we are also consulting on proposals to ban the manufacture and sale of plastic-stemmed cotton buds and have appointed an expert panel to consider what further steps can be taken on items like plastic straws and disposable cups."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959630.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Future of the Hollies Day Centre safeguarded","story":"              THE future of the Hollies Day Centre at its present location in Musselburgh has been safeguarded.  It has been confirmed that the much-loved facility for older people will continue as it is in its High Street home.  Fears were raised back in 2016 that the day centre might be forced to relocate or even cease to exist in its present form because a new day centre facility could not be accommodated within the current building.  East Lothian Health and Social Care Partnership needed to provide at least 18 places of registered day care for people with complex care needs in Musselburgh given that it was the largest town in East Lothian. This was in line with need identified as part of a wider review of older people\u0026rsquos day centres.  This led to the partnership and the Hollies exploring the options available, which ranged from potentially adapting the current building to accommodate 18 people through to looking at possible other buildings if the Hollies couldn\u0026rsquot be adapted.  After nearly two years of talks, and Care Inspectorate and architects\u0026rsquo input, it was found that, in order to adapt the Hollies premises, the lunch club and public cafe would be lost at the expense of more than 100 users.  A joint decision remains to be made about the eight day care places already in existence at the Hollies current premises but, at present, there is agreement that these places will continue.  The health and social care partnership is now looking for somewhere else in Musselburgh to accommodate the other 10 places.  Following a meeting this month, the Hollies trustees have confirmed that agreement has been reached with the health and social care partnership that the status quo will remain at the day centre.  In a joint statement, the trustees said: \u0026ldquoThe Hollies distributed a consultation paper to service users and had 271 responses completed in two weeks. The overwhelming consensus of the people consulted is for the Hollies to continue providing the service it does now for the people of Musselburgh and surrounding areas. We have also received positive feedback on our proposed expansion of activities in the hall in the afternoons.  \u0026ldquoWe have agreed with the health and social care partnership that the Hollies should remain as it is. We are looking forward to continuing to work as before and to embark on exciting new projects to meet the wishes of all those who attend the Hollies.  Liz Shannon, centre manager, said: \u0026ldquoFunding is a constant battle for us all at the Hollies and we have been in limbo whilst these talks were taking place and have been unable to approach funders as we were unclear what funding we were asking for.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership has assured us they will continue to give funding at the current level for this financial year which is \u0026pound82,000 to continue to fund the eight registered places which we are grateful for in this transition period. However, that is less than a third of what it costs to run all our services and maintain the building.  \u0026ldquoThings are going to be very tight for the near future while we submit funding applications to funders like the lottery however, we are very excited at the prospect of moving forward and very grateful for the support from the people of Musselburgh and beyond.  Councillor Fiona O\u0026rsquoDonnell, health and social care spokesperson, said: \u0026ldquoI am pleased that the Hollies will continue to provide a wide range of services in Musselburgh.  \u0026ldquoThis was a really positive meeting and the plans to provide more activities in the Hollies are good news for local people.  \u0026ldquoThe health and social care partnership will continue its work to increase the amount of day support in Musselburgh for older people with complex care needs."},{"url":"http://www.eastlothiancourier.com/resources/images/7959839.jpg?display=1\u0026amp;htype=0\u0026amp;type=mc1","title":"Phonebox removed from centre of Haddington","story":"              A TRADITIONAL red phonebox has been removed from the centre of Haddington after it was used just once in a year.

No, not because it\u0026rsquos the time of year when thousands of children come knocking on your door, dressed as all kinds of demonic demons, demanding sugary snacks. This October is the deadline for all Scottish public bodies to achieve Cyber Essentials or Cyber Essentials Plus certification. The start of Scotland\u0026rsquos Cyber Resilience Strategy, one that ministers hope will be paralleled across the globe.    Deputy First Minister John Swinney\u0026rsquos vision is for Scotland to become a world leading nation in this field of expertise. If Scotland is to achieve this goal then its public sector must set a precedent for all others to follow. But with 60% of small businesses having been breached in the last year and with almost 40% of Scottish SMEs spending nothing on IT security* it seems that most of the public sector still need to act.  With the fears around cyber security more heightened than ever before, the Scottish Cyber Resilience scheme was developed in 2017 to lay the groundwork for minister\u0026rsquos long-term goal. The WannaCry ransomware attack of May 2017 accelerated the entire program after more than 300,000 computers were infected. Since then several requirements have been issued to those in the public sector regarding how government departments, local authorities and NHS boards can become more secure online.  While a large portion of Scottish public bodies already have cyber security measures in place, it\u0026rsquos the aim of Scottish ministers for the entire public sector to become exemplar in this field.  The following info gives an overview of cyber resilience and explains the steps the public sector should be taking:  What is Cyber Resilience?  Cyber Resilience means an all-encompassing approach that covers not only protective measures but also measures to respond and recover if you are attacked. Since cyber security is a risk management exercise, you should always be prepared for the worst to happen as there is always a margin of risk for things to creep through. That\u0026rsquos why, to cover all your bases, you need to be resilient and not just secure.  Products such as ISO 27001 is the international standard for information security best practice, and specifies the requirements for implementing an information security management system (ISMS). An ISMS offers organisation-wide protection of all information in all its forms. By implementing an ISMS you would be in a position to identify risks and continue to protect against them.\u0026nbsp All leading cyber resilience programmes incorporate requirements that ISO 27001 lays out and eases the process of implementation.  How do I become compliant?  By taking the necessary steps, sooner rather than later.\u0026nbsp Steps such as confirming a Cyber Essentials pre-assessment has taken place, ensure staff have undertaken cyber resilience training, and have a cyber incident response plan, are just some of the initial actions the Scottish Government has proposed the public sector to take.  Alan Calder, the founder and executive chairman of IT Governance, one of the Scottish public sector\u0026rsquos preferred providers, says that it is critical that Scottish organisations start their compliance journey as soon as possible. \u0026nbsp  He said: \u0026ldquoCyber-crime is perhaps the single biggest threat to modern businesses and attacks are continually on the rise. The Scottish Government\u0026rsquos legislation is something that we as an industry welcome to encourage more organisations to effectively incorporate cyber resilience into their practices.  \u0026ldquoWhat\u0026rsquos fantastic to see is that the scheme incorporates the requirements of leading examples of cyber security such as the international information security standard ISO 27001 and the UK Cyber Essentials Scheme. That the Scottish Government has acknowledged that effective business continuity management makes up a crucial part of a comprehensive cyber resilience programme.    Where can I get support?  IT Governance has helped thousands of companies with their compliance journey\u0026rsquos including the University of Edinburgh and Glasgow city council.\u0026nbsp  The Scottish Government has listed a range of existing standards, guidelines and controls that can contribute to increased cyber resilience. IT Governance can help organisations meet compliance obligations through the implementation of an ISO 27001-compliant ISMS, business continuity management, incident response management and penetration testing.

Jim Monaghan, who was the spokesman for the Defend Tommy Sheridan Campaign, will be paid around \u0026pound30,000 a year to help build a \u0026ldquosustainable coalition for \u0026ldquosocial change.  However, a senior party source blasted the move, saying: \u0026ldquoThis is an absolutely staggering decision that has stunned the party. Jim Monaghan is a wild conspiracy theorist who has defended convicted perjurer Tommy Sheridan. Organisers are among the most vital party staff members, in charge of local campaigning operations and responsible for speaking directly to voters. This is like the SNP putting the cybernats in charge of door knocking. It\u0026rsquos utterly bewildering.  Labour advertised for seven organiser posts in February, three of which were to be based north of the border.  The job advert stated that successful applicants should have the ability to work with a \u0026ldquovariety of stakeholders and Monaghan landed one of the jobs. However, he has had strong ties to Sheridan, who is considered to be a toxic figure on the left.  The former Glasgow MSP, who used to lead the Scottish Socialist Party, won a \u0026pound200,000 defamation case against the now-defunct News of the World in 2006 amid claims he was an adulterer and swinger.  Conflicting evidence led to a police investigation and Sheridan was charged with perjury, after which a lengthy criminal trial took place in 2010. Monaghan was a defence witness in the trial.  A jury found Sheridan guilty of perjury, part of which explicitly related to a trip Sheridan and others made to a sex club in Manchester.  BBC footage on the day of Sheridan\u0026rsquos sentencing showed Monaghan clapping the former MSP as he walked to court. He had also previously carried out paid work for Sheridan\u0026rsquos then solicitor.  Monaghan was also a volunteer on the campaign to \u0026ldquodefend the politician and planned a book - A Parcel o\u0027 Rogues: The Tommy Sheridan Conspiracy - which he later abandoned.  He also acted as \u0026ldquonational press and media spokesperson for Solidarity - the party Sheridan helped form after quitting the SSP - before joining Labour in 2010.  Monaghan wrote at the time: \u0026ldquoObviously, there is a long and hard battle within Labour and it isn\u0026rsquot one that will even take place, never mind be decided, in the context of the current leadership election. I am confident that, for at least the next few years, it is best for me and for my community that I work within the Labour party.  In December, the Sunday Herald revealed that Monaghan was one of the warm up acts at a Labour event attended by UK and Scottish leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Richard Leonard. He read poetry on the night.  Asked last year if he still believed Sheridan was the victim of a conspiracy, Monaghan said: \u0026ldquoYes, absolutely.  Monaghan\u0026rsquos Facebook page stated that he started a \u0026ldquonew job as a community organiser on June 18.  In 2016, the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission (SCCRC) - the official body that considers potential miscarriages of justice - declined to refer Sheridan\u0027s case to the High Court.  Sheridan pursued a judicial review of SCCRC decision, but it emerged last week that this latest legal bid had failed.

Nia Griffith stressed it was party policy to support the nuclear deterrent, adding uncertainty in the world meant this is not the time to be \"descaling\" it.  Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn voted against Trident renewal in July 2016.  The Commons vote saw MPs back the replacement of the existing submarine fleet carrying the missiles with four new Successor submarines.  Renewal of the submarines for the continuous-at-sea deterrent has been predicted to cost \u0026pound31 billion, with a \u0026pound10 billion contingency fund also set aside.  Ms Griffith told BBC One\u0027s The Andrew Marr Show: \"It\u0027s Labour Party policy that we keep Trident.  \"The decisions have been taken, the work is being undertaken and that is not a decision we\u0027re going back on.  \"So we\u0027re very, very clear - having a nuclear deterrent is a very important part of our defence policy. It\u0027s also an important part of being a tier-one nation and being in the UN Security Council.\"  Asked about her previous remarks in which she questioned the need for Trident, Ms Griffith said: \"I think if you look at the world today it\u0027s a more uncertain place than it\u0027s ever been.  \"I think if you look at the way the United States is not stepping up to the mark, I don\u0027t think this is the right time to be getting rid of our nuclear deterrent.  \"Of course we need to keep an eye on costs, of course we need to make sure we get value for money, and it is a challenging situation when it\u0027s a single-source purchase - much more difficult than when you have competition.  \"But at the end of the day, this is not the time to be descaling our nuclear deterrent.\"  Ms Griffith later said she would \"absolutely\" support sending more British troops to Afghanistan.  Last month, Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson was understood to have written to Prime Minister Theresa May recommending that the UK increased its numbers to bolster efforts to counter the Taliban.  It was said between 400 to 450 soldiers could be sent to join the roughly 600 already deployed in non-combat roles following pressure from US President Donald Trump for international allies to do more.  Ms Griffith, asked if Labour would support sending more troops to Afghanistan, said: \"We certainly support the idea that you cannot abandon a process halfway through.  \"We know it\u0027s not going to take one year or two years, it\u0027s going to be 20, 30 years for the government of Afghanistan to become stable and as stable as we would like - so it will take longer.  \"And if we have the expertise that we can offer, then certainly we\u0027re willing to put that in.\"  Pressed again if she would support putting more British troops into Afghanistan, Ms Griffith replied: \"Absolutely.\""},{"url":null,"title":"scotlands-railways-must-be-brought-back-into-public-hands-labour-demands","story":"              RAILWAYS must be brought back into public ownership to finally bring to an end the \u0026ldquogamble of overcrowded, late-running trains, Labour has demanded on the week the East Coast Mainline was taken out of private hands.

It comes after VTEC \u0026ndash a joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin \u0026ndash was forced to axe its contract early after failing to meet cash targets.

LNER will operate until a public-private partnership takes responsibility for both trains and track operations in 2020.  UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn insisted all railway lines \u0026ldquoshould be run in the interests of passengers and taxpayers, not private profit.  He said: \u0026ldquoPassengers, our economy and our environment need affordable fares and reliable services, which Tory policy is failing to deliver.  \u0026ldquoThe next Labour government will take our railways back into public ownership as franchises expire, using savings to cap fares, and would upgrade and expand the rail network.  Meanwhile, Manuel Cortes, general secretary of transport union TSSA, slammed UK ministers for failing to include Scottish representatives on the board of LNER, which serves stations including Edinburgh, Aberdeen, and Inverness.  He said: \u0026ldquoIt is typical of the pure anti-public sentiment held by privateer Tory Grayling that LNER will be running trains across Scotland without any Scottish representation on its board.

The ancient mythical story of Deirdrie and Naoise is also one of the first documenting the shared destiny of the people of Scotland and Ireland.  Now a romantic landmark has been unveiled on the west coast of Scotland in honour of the legend, close to a spot where the couple were said to have found some tranquillity together.  The \u0026ldquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise was officially unveiled at a ceremony on Saturday, attended by Michael Russell MSP and Mark Hanniffy, the Consul General of Ireland to Scotland, along with more than 100 guests and local dignitaries.  The sheiling itself \u0026ndash a Gaelic word for a hut, or collection of huts, once common in wild and lonely places in the hills and mountains \u0026ndash is on the slopes of Beinn Ghlas, near Taynuilt, overlooking Loch Etive, Argyll.  It marks a personal love story as well as it was commissioned by Sam Macdonald, whose wife, Evelyn Day, died of cancer last year, six weeks after being diagnosed. Mr MacDonald, 76, said that when his 83-year-old Irish wife of 50 years was told she did not have long to live, she asked him to build a memorial to mark her favourite story, so famed in Irish mythology.  Mr Macdonald said: \u0026ldquoWe decided on the garden when we knew that time was running out. We came out of the consultants, and after we gathered ourselves together, we started working on some lasting memory.  The tale itself, which links Ireland with Scotland, was first featured in the Glenmasan Manuscript, which is held in the National Library in Edinburgh and has just celebrated its 780th anniversary.  Known as \u0026ldquoDeirdre of the Sorrows, legend has it that before she was born, the most famous woman in Irish mythology was prophesied to become so beautiful, kings and lords would wage war over her. Urged to kill her at birth, King Conchobar of Ulster decided to put her into seclusion until she was old enough for him to take as a wife.  But fate intervened and Deirdre met Naoise, a handsome warrior in the King\u0026rsquos court and the pair fell instantly in love, fleeing to Scotland where they lived a happy life alongside his brothers for a number of years, until word reached them that the King would allow them to return to Ulster. However, upon so doing, Naoise was killed and the distraught Deirdre went on to take her own life.  The President of Ireland, Michael Higgins, was unable to attend the ceremony at the weekend, but sent a message of support, which read: \u0026ldquoThe tragic tale of the two doomed lovers is one of the great tales of an Ruraiocht, the Ulster Cycle, a mythic arc that is the shared inheritance of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland.  \u0026ldquoThere is perhaps no place on our islands more representative of that shared inheritance than Argyll, once the home of the ancient Gaelic Kingdom of Dal Riada. It was there that Cu Chulainn, the warrior-hero of the Ulaid, was said to have learned the arts of war, and it was there that Deirdrie sought sanctuary with Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle.  \u0026ldquoI am so pleased that a magnificent memorial will now rest forever on Beinn Ghlas, not far from Gleann \u0026Egraveite, the place Deirdre and Naoise were said to have found a moment of peace. May it stand as a monument, not only to the common past of the peoples of Scotland and Ireland, but to the shared destiny of our two ancient countries.  The sheiling is on land once owned by Mr Macdonald, now taken over by onshore wind generation firm Ventient Energy. It features within it the statue of Deirdre and Naoise that was originally created by Glasgow School of Art graduate, Fiona McLeod, for Scotland\u0026rsquos National Gardening Show, held in Strathclyde Park in 1997. The golden statue had been in Mr Macdonald\u0026rsquos garden since the show closed.  Visually, the sheiling, situated near one of the turbines on the Ventient Energy wind farm, looks like it has been on the site for 1,000 years due to its historic features, looking across the stunning Scottish landscape to where Deirdre and Naoise were said to live in the 7th Century AD.  Scott Mackenzie, CEO of Ventient Energy, said: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore delighted to support Sam Macdonald in creating the stunning \u0026lsquoSheiling for Deirdre and Naoise\u0026rsquo. Its creation is being celebrated by the entire community and is something that can be visited and enjoyed by locals and visitors from further afield, including Ireland.  Mr Macdonald said the stories preserved largely through oral tradition are from a time when \u0026ldquoan aristocratic warrior class dominated, \u0026ldquo characterised by dramatic stories of fighting and adventure on the part of the chiefs.  He said Deirdre\u0026rsquos powerful tale, with its \u0026ldquoelements of lust, treachery and ultimate death, is vividly told and that while one may question whether the characters in the story ever existed, recent research into place names in the North Lorn area of Argyll suggests they may well have done. The findings raised the idea that perhaps Deirdre, Naoise and his brothers Arden and Ainle were real and did indeed reside in Glen Etive, given the number of place names that memorialise them in the landscape.  In raising the Sheiling for Deirdre and her lover, Mr Macdonald said he hopes to revitalise the ancient myths and reinforce the strong social and cultural ties that link the people of the west Highlands with their Irish neighbours across the water.  He is hopeful it will draw visitors from around the world as well.  \u0026ldquoI think it\u0026rsquos going to be a very romantic spot, he said. \u0026ldquoIt will be lovely if someone proposes there \u0026ndash and there\u0026rsquos the possibility of weddings, as outdoor weddings are very much in vogue now."},{"url":null,"title":"laird-questions-snp-government-tactics-during-ulva-buyout","story":"              The former owner of Ulva has claimed he was \u0026ldquokept in the dark and \u0026ldquostonewalled during the community buyout of the island.  Criticising both the buyers and the Scottish Government, Laird Jamie Howard questioned the tactics involved and accused the SNP of \u0026ldquoignoring its elected duty.  The community buyout of the island, located north-west of Mull, was finalised last week as the Howard family relinquished their private ownership of the site after 70 years.  It came after the government prohibited Mr Howard from selling on the open market as a community interest had been lodged by the North West Mull Community Company.  The Howards eventually sold to the community company in a deal worth \u0026pound4.650million.  However, the family have now released a statement taking sweeping blows at those who aided the publicly funded \u0026ldquotakeover of Ulva.  The statement claims: \u0026ldquoThe strong indication is that the driving impulse for this acquisition has been, and is, not so much for the welfare of Ulva and its resident community but more to satisfy the long held personal ambitions of a few relatively local individuals on the island of Mull to benefit SNP party politics and prejudices, and to feed media headlines.  \u0026ldquoOn multiple occasions, during the course of the acquisition procedure, the legislative guidelines (as published by this Scottish Government) were cast aside, with key, mandated deadlines mendaciously ignored by Ministers and Scottish civil servants in order to coincide with keynote party speeches by the First Minister and to facilitate the acquisition of Ulva, regardless of the merits or otherwise, or the fiscal viability of the community plans.  \u0026ldquoIt entirely ignored its elected duty to be even-handed to all Scottish constituents.  The community deal was backed by an unprecedented Scottish Land Fund award of \u0026pound4.415million.  The shortfall was made up by fundraising and a \u0026pound500,000 donation from Australian company, the MacQuarie Group, which takes its name from Lachlan MacQuarie - the Scottish soldier who became the country\u0026rsquos founding father.  Criticising the buyers, the statement adds: \u0026ldquoAt every stage of the proceedings Jamie Howard was kept in the dark and stonewalled with no access or recourse to official information or assistance.  \u0026ldquoTheir dissemination of false and misleading information through the general media has been astonishing and disappointing.  \u0026ldquoWe hope the SNP party activists concerned treat the long-standing Ulva residents with respect despite their track record thus far.  The Howards also took a swing at Argyll SNP MSP Mike Russell, accusing him of \u0026ldquoindulging in ubiquitous and tedious SNP partisan sound bitesinstead of communicating with his constituents.  The statement went on: \u0026ldquoTime will tell if Ulva continues to be the rural, natural beauty that it is today.  An SNP spokesman said: \u0026ldquoScotland\u0026rsquos land is a valuable asset which should benefit the many. The SNP is committed to empowering communities through land reform \u0026ndash enabling them to determine their own futures.  \u0026ldquoUlva was once home to over 800 people, and now has only a handful. This is a story which is, sadly, all too common to many of our islands.  \u0026ldquoWe wish the local community the very best as they seek to regenerate and repopulate the island of Ulva.  The North West Mull Community Company declined to comment.  Mike Russell said he received no contact from the family at any point to discuss their concerns, but would have been happy to meet with them."},{"url":null,"title":"scotland-to-bask-in-temperatures-higher-than-marbella","story":"              SCOTLAND is ready to bask in a summer heatwave with temperatures due to rise higher than Spanish sunspot Marbella.

But now conservation groups are hoping to bring back the lynx and the wolf to Scotland as part of a controversial process known as rewilding.  Parts of the country have already experienced rewilding, with eagles, red squirrels and beavers already reintroduced, as well as trees and forests being protected and encouraged to grow.  However, calls are mounting to take things further and allow predators back on Scottish soil in a move conservationists claim will help to transform the country\u0026rsquos wildlife.  Steve Micklewright, chief executive of pro-rewilding charity Trees for Life, said: \u0026ldquoDespite its raw beauty, the Scottish landscape is today an ecological shadow of its former self.  \u0026ldquoIt wasn\u0026rsquot so long ago that vibrant, wild forest stretched across much of Scotland, with beavers and cranes at home in extensive wetlands and lynx and wild boar roaming in woodlands.  \u0026ldquoYet now our large carnivores are extinct, our woodlands reduced to small fragments, and a degraded landscape supporting little life stretches across millions of acres. But it doesn\u0026rsquot have to be this way.  The charity is about to publish a book which it hopes will spark debate about rewilding and offer a vision of how things could be for Scotland\u0026rsquos wildlife.  Scotland: A Rewilding Journey will look at the benefits and pitfalls of reintroducing predators - including addressing concerns over the potential threat to livestock.  Farmers have long opposed rewilding because of this issue, as well as concerns over replacing food production with wilderness.  However, Mr Micklewright believes farmers could look to other countries where wolves exist, such as Romania, for advice on how to protect livestock.  \u0026ldquoOur farmers are used to working in a landscape that doesn\u0026rsquot have these predators and so they don\u0026rsquot need to think about it, he said.  \u0026ldquoWolves were last seen in Scotland in the 1700s and lynx, in the late middle-ages, so they\u0026rsquove never had to deal with it.  \u0026ldquoBut in other countries, it means that farmers have to look after their animals differently. In Romania, for example, they use a big dog to scare the wolves off.  \u0026ldquoObviously farmers feel that they have the most to lose from rewilding, and no-one wants to risk anyone\u0026rsquos livelihood, so we need to look at how we address that and how we might compensate for that.  The charity boss claims that the book, which will be published in Autumn, is honest and addresses the potential pitfalls of rewilding, but also focuses on the opportunities for Scotland - particularly the tourism industry.  He said: \u0026ldquoPeople might think that rewilding means creating a wilderness where people don\u0026rsquot go, but that\u0026rsquos not the case.  \u0026ldquoWe believe we would have more people living in the Highlands if we did this, not less, and we\u0026rsquod have more jobs, not less, because people would want to see and experience it.  \u0026ldquoThere\u0026rsquos a big opportunity here for Scotland to become a world class environment that people want to come and visit.  Mr Micklewright believes the Highlands could become the Scottish equivalent of Yellowstone National Park in the US - where rewilding, despite some difficulties, has proven to be a success and regularly draws millions of visitors to the site each year.  Wolves were reintroduced to the park in 1995 and have been credited with increasing beaver populations and bringing back aspen trees and vegetation.  Trees for Life is already being recognised for the work it has done on Dundreggan estate in the Highlands, which was being overgrazed by deer and sheep.  The charity is reforesting the area and by 2058, expects to see red squirrels, beavers and wild boars return to the area.  However, Mr Micklewright claims reintroducing wolves in the Highlands is still a long way off.  \u0026ldquoWolves and lynx are already making a comeback in other parts of Europe, but - obviously - they can\u0026rsquot get to Scotland unless we decide to bring these animals back.  \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore a bit scared of that idea. When it comes to the bigger predators, that\u0026rsquos still a big, scary thing for a lot of people.  \u0026ldquoI doubt that wolves will be reintroduced in my lifetime, but I\u0026rsquom hopeful that the lynx is more of a possibility.  \u0026ldquoThe actual practicalities of reintroducing the animals is not the difficult part in all of this - it\u0026rsquos the social stuff, the conversations that need to be had, that\u0026rsquos the hard part.  \u0026ldquoWe need to start conversations with politicians, with farmers and landowners - we need to have a national debate about rewilding.  \u0026ldquoAnd hopefully the book will help to start that process.  Trees for Life has launched a crowdfunding appeal to help fund the publication of Scotland: A Rewilding Journey.

Ian Blackford, the party\u0026rsquos Westminster leader, insisted its priority was making sure Scotland could stay in the single market and customs union, but added it was \"watching developments\" over the prospect of another EU vote.  He said a hard Brexit would signal a \"clear road map towards a second independence referendum that for me would be the priority\".  It comes as SNP Brexit minister Michael Russell said he was \u0026ldquoabsolutely not hostile to a second vote on any future deal, but suggested the result in Scotland would need to be respected.  He told the BBC: \u0026ldquoThere will have to be a vote at some stage. The question is what vote and when, and how it\u0026rsquos going to be achieved, and presently we don\u0026rsquot have answers to that.  Mr Blackford said the SNP was not \u0026ldquoin all circumstances diametrically opposed to a further referendum, adding: \u0026ldquoWe have an open ear to developments on that front, but for us it\u0027s the priority of staying in the single market and the customs union that\u0027s most important.\"  He argued that if the UK Government did not listen to the SNP\u0027s \"power grab\" concerns over its Brexit legislation, then an independence vote could follow and the Scottish Government had a mandate.  He said: \"What I\u0027m seeking to do is to defend the rights of the Scottish people and the powers that they have in their parliament, that is the immediate priority for us.  \"Of course I would make the point that if we cannot get the UK Government to listen on this then ultimately we will be having a discussion with the people of Scotland as to how we best protect our parliament, I would argue that independence is the best way of doing that.\"  He added: \"We\u0027re not at the moment talking about a timing of an independence referendum, what we have said is that we\u0027ll make a judgment on that once we\u0027ve got to the end of the Brexit process, so we\u0027ll concentrate on making sure we\u0027re standing up for our rights through the Brexit process.  \"We will have that debate with the people of Scotland and the economic future of Scotland, but we will only come back to a discussion on the timing of a referendum once we\u0027ve got through the Brexit process.\"  As Theresa May narrowly won another crunch vote on the Government\u0027s European Union (Withdrawal) Bill last week, Mr Blackford branded the Prime Minister \"very weak\", adding \"at some point that luck will run out\"."},{"url":null,"title":"alan-roden-brussels-has-accepted-brexit-but-it-remains-to-be-seen-if-britons-are-ready-to-accept-the-terms-of-departure","story":"              THIS Thursday in Brussels, all eyes will be on Belgium as they attempt to inflict defeat on a country which knows all too well about trudging away from the international stage.  But while fans gather in Place du Luxembourg to cheer on Les Diables Rouges against England, 27 European leaders will meet in a nearby building to ask why the UK can\u0026rsquot decide how to walk away from the EU.  Two years on from the Leave vote, they will gravely agree there has been a lack of progress. Then they will move on.  For while the Brexit soap opera continues to play out here in the UK, the attitude in Brussels is a collective shrug of the shoulders. Or \u0026lsquobof\u0026rsquo, en fran\u0026ccedilais.  Brexit is not even on the agenda for the main business being discussed at this week\u0026rsquos European Council meeting in the Belgian capital.  At the top of the to-do list is migration, and control of the EU\u0026rsquos external borders. Security and defence, tax evasion and avoidance, and how to regulate data across the continent will also come up - critical national issues only resolved with close international working relationships between neighbours.  Last week, I was in Brussels to witness what our European allies think about Brexit, two years since the vote.  In one sentence, it\u0026rsquos this: \u0026ldquoWe\u0026rsquore sorry you\u0026rsquore leaving, but get on with it.  The EU and its institutions have moved on, accepting the UK is on the way out and getting on with their work which affects citizens in 27 other countries.  In the European Parliament last week there was a hotly-contested internal debate about fertiliser \u0026ndash no doubt a headline writer\u0026rsquos dream for Britain\u0026rsquos Eurosceptic tabloids if they still employed Brussels-based journalists.  The debate centres on how much cadmium \u0026ndash a toxic-heavy metal \u0026ndash should be used in fertiliser, and the outcome will eventually affect every farm in the EU. It will also affect anyone wanting to import fertiliser from the EU after Brexit, but by then we\u0026rsquoll have no say over it.  There was a vote on copyright reform, which is designed to give publishers more control over how their content is used digitally. It\u0026rsquos gone too far and could remove links to the quality Press on social media sites, allowing \"fake news\" and the conspiracy theorist blogs that appeared during the indyref and EUref to prosper.  Tory, Labour and SNP MEPs from the UK are fighting it \u0026ndash but they lose their seat at the negotiating table next March.  For the people who work in Brussels and shape policy across Europe, Brexit is a decision made in the past while they look to the future.  One seasoned observer said the EU member states have never been more united on this \u0026ndash they are sticking together.  And they are sticking together because of the impact on Ireland. The warnings of a negative impact on the UK economy were made clear during the EUref, and ignored by voters, but the people of Ireland should not have to suffer as a result.  If Brussels is shrugging its shoulders when it comes to the UK, it is putting its arms around the shoulders of Ireland.  \u0026ldquoWe want to make it clear again and again that Ireland is not alone,\" Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in Dublin last week.  It\u0026rsquos not what Theresa May, David Davis or Liam Fox says that interests Europe, it\u0026rsquos what Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says. If he isn\u0026rsquot happy, the EU isn\u0026rsquot happy.  The UK Government can come up with as many inventive solutions to the border problem as it wants it will only happen if the Irish agree.  The \u0026lsquoBaileys test\u0026rsquo must be met: millions of gallons of milk travel unhindered across the border during the production of Irish cream liquor, and that must continue to be the case.  The solution, to everyone in Brussels at least, is obvious: the UK can remain in both the single market and a customs union. That\u0026rsquos achieved by being in the European Economic Area.  Earlier this month, Brussels\u0026rsquo chief negotiator Michel Barnier confirmed this model is possible to a Green MEP.  It would require some sort of renegotiation \u0026ndash the EEA agreement does not cover agriculture, which is vital to preventing a hard border in Northern Ireland.  But while tailoring for off-the-shelf options is possible new bespoke deals are not.  Labour\u0026rsquos suggestion that Britain can somehow negotiate single market access while also securing changes to the principle of freedom of movement is simply dismissed.  The Norway-style option of EEA membership is opposed by Jeremy Corbyn because it would make the UK a \"rule-taker\" not a rule-maker. The Eurocrats agree that UK influence would reduce in this scenario, but that\u0026rsquos not their problem.  The UK would become a \"lobbying nation\", holding joint parliamentary summits like Norway does in a desperate attempt to influence decisions.  But, despite that, most in Brussels still can\u0026rsquot understand why the UK would consider shunning this option when the only alternative \u0026ndash apart from reversing Brexit \u0026ndash is a \"no-deal\" scenario.  Airbus last week explained in stark terms what that means: one of the country\u0026rsquos largest companies which employs 14,000 people leaving the UK. If that threat to jobs isn\u0026rsquot enough to spur Labour into action, it\u0026rsquos hard to understand what will.  So it looks more and more likely that we are heading for a \"no-deal\" option.  Liam Fox has insisted that Theresa May is not bluffing when she threatens to walk way without a deal.  Nobody in Brussels thinks she\u0026rsquos bluffing anyway. They have laid out the options and have moved on while they wait for her to decide.  If this is what the Prime Minister presents to MPs this autumn, what happens next is a huge unknown.  Will Labour and Tory rebels join forces to defeat the government? Will Theresa May be forced to resign? Could a two-thirds parliamentary majority be assembled to trigger a General Election?  Or will, as the tens of thousands who marched in London on Saturday demanded, there be a \"people\u0026rsquos vote\" on whether to proceed with Brexit? One poll at the weekend suggested there is now a narrow majority for Remain.  Brussels may have accepted that Britain is leaving, but it remains to be seen if the people of Britain are ready to accept the terms of that departure."},{"url":null,"title":"labour-calls-for-rail-public-ownership-as-quickly-as-possible","story":"              Jeremy Corbyn has insisted train companies need to be put under public ownership as soon as possible as Labour launched a Rail Mayhem campaign day.

The Speaker of the House of Commons was elected in June 2009 and promised to serve for nine years, a commitment he has since reneged on.  As the ninth anniversary of his election passed, Mr Bercow told a reception in Speaker\u0027s House at the Palace of Westminster: \"Notwithstanding occasional rumours to the contrary, I have got absolutely no intention of going anywhere.\"  He first took the Speaker\u0027s chair on June 22 2009, promising to serve \"no more than nine years in total\".

Audrey Glover, who headed an Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) delegation said unbalanced media coverage in favour of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his ruling party resulted in voters not being able to make an informed choice.  She said Turkey had \"work\" to do to ensure that future elections meet democratic standards.  Ignacio Sanchez Amor, the mission\u0027s special coordinator, said the observers \"profoundly regret\" that two observers were denied entry into Turkey over alleged bias against the country.  He called the move an \"utterly unacceptable attempt to influence\" the process.  Monitors, however, praised the high turnout in the Turkish vote, which was reported to be more than 87% by the state-run Anadolu Agency.  Mr Erdogan, who has dominated Turkish politics for the past 15 years, is set to extend his rule and take on sweeping new powers after winning landmark presidential and parliamentary elections.  Turkey\u0027s High Electoral Board declared Mr Erdogan, 64, the winner of Sunday\u0027s polls, which usher in a new executive presidential system which was approved in a referendum last year.  Under the system, the office of the prime minister is eliminated and executive powers are transferred to the president, who can rule with only limited checks and balances.  The Turkish leader, who is accused by critics of adopting increasingly authoritarian tactics but is loved by supporters for bringing prosperity and stability, may be facing rough times ahead, however. Analysts are predicting an economic downturn amid rising inflation and a struggling currency.  His win could deepen Turkey\u0027s rift with Western allies, who are already concerned by setbacks in democracy and human rights as well as Turkey\u0027s closer ties with Russia.  However, Turkey\u0027s currency, the lira, rallied on Monday over Mr Erdogan\u0027s victory, which allows the country to avoid instability in the short-term.  In his victory speech, Mr Erdogan said he would work towards achieving his goal of making Turkey one of the world\u0027s top 10 economies by 2023, when the Turkish Republic marks its centenary.  He also pledged a more \"determined\" fight against outlawed Kurdish rebels and alleged members of a movement led by US-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whom he accuses of orchestrating a 2016 failed coup against his government. Mr Gulen denies any involvement.  \"Turkey made its choice in favour of a more determined fight against the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party) and (Gulenists),\" Mr Erdogan said.  \"We will go after terror organisations with stronger determination.\"  Under the new system, Mr Erdogan will appoint ministers, vice presidents and high-level bureaucrats, issue decrees, prepare the budget and decide on security policies.  According to unofficial results that have yet to be confirmed by the electoral board, Mr Erdogan garnered 52.5% of the votes, while his ruling Justice and Development Party, or AKP, won 42.5% in the parliamentary vote. Mr Erdogan\u0027s closest contender, Muharrem Ince of the main opposition Republican People\u0027s Party, won 30.7%.  Mr Erdogan\u0027s AKP fell short of a parliamentary majority but a better-than-expected performance by its nationalist ally should allow the party to control the 600-seat legislature.  Mr Ince, who complained of unfair elections, accepted Mr Erdogan\u0027s victory during a news conference on Monday.  He told reporters: \"There are no significant differences between our records and the Supreme Election Council\u0027s records. I accept the results of the elections.\"  The politician, who led a robust campaign against Mr Erdogan, called on him to end his divisive policies.  \"Be the president of 81 million (Turks), embrace everyone,\" he said. \"That\u0027s what I would have done if I had won.\"  The 54-year-old politician criticised Turkey\u0027s new system, saying: \"Turkey has cut off its ties with democratic values... (Turkey) has transitioned to a one-man regime in the fullest sense.\"  The pro-Kurdish People\u0027s Democratic Party, whose presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas was forced to campaign from inside prison, received the more than the 10% of votes required to win seats in parliament, spilling thousands of its supporters into the streets in celebration."},{"url":null,"title":"banksy-artwork-on-migration-appears-in-centre-of-paris","story":"              (adds details in pars 4 and 6-9 - with AP pix)  Provocative street artist Banksy is believed to have taken his message on migration to Paris.

The court was told that the victim, who was aged 14 at the time, would be scarred for life as a result of the assault.  The accused, who gave a new address in Aberdeenshire, travelled to Livingston Sheriff Court in West Lothian with his mum for the brief hearing on Monday.  Wearing smart black school trousers and a white shirt with an embroidered tie, he spoke only to confirm his identity.  The youth admitted assaulting the other pupil by punching him on the head and \"struggling with him whereby he was struck on the head with a knife\".  He was originally charged with striking the boy with the blade, but the Crown agreed to amend the wording of the indictment.  He also pled guilty to assaulting another 14-year-old pupil by repeatedly punching him on the head and body during the same incident.  The youth further admitted having a knife on school premises without reasonable excuse or lawful authority.  However, the Crown accepted his not guilty plea to sending threatening messages the previous day to the boy he punched and a 15-year-old boy.  A charge of attempting to defeat the ends of justice by hiding the knife he used in the assault in order to conceal or dispose of evidence implicating him in the commission of the crime was also dropped.  Despite the seriousness of the crimes, neither the accused, his victims, nor the school they then attended can be named because the law bars identification of all juveniles under the age of 18.  Jim Robertson, prosecuting, moved for sentence and said there was no record of previous offending to put before the court.  Andy Aitken, defending, suggested that the Children\u0027s Reporter should be asked for advice on sentencing options, given his client\u0027s young age at the time of the offence.  He added: \"He\u0027s on bail and his current address is in Aberdeenshire. He\u0027s travelled to court today with his mother.\"  He asked the court to continue the accused\u0027s bail while background reports were prepared, and Sheriff Martin Edington agreed to do so.  Adjourning the case until 19 July, Sheriff Edington told the youth: \"In terms of what Mr Aitken has had to say to me today, I\u0027m going to to ask advice from the Children\u0027s Panel with regards to this matter.  \"At the same time I\u0027m also going to defer sentence on you so the social work department can prepare a report for the court in relation to matters such as whether you might require supervision or be able to carry out any form of court-imposed sentence.  \"Your bail will be continued on exactly the same basis as it is now.\""},{"url":null,"title":"business success for kintore couple","story":"\t\t\t\tDonna and Jason Orton, who have been helped by Business Gateway Aberdeen City \u0026amp Shire, opened the doors to their unique business in Abercrombie Court, Westhill, just over a year ago. Since then customer numbers have soared, with up to 200 hour-long sessions now running each week.                                                    Clients, who suffer from a range of respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and allergies, spend their time relaxing in one of two treatment rooms where the walls and floor are clad in salt. A specialist machine then finely grinds medical grade salt that is released into the air at prescribed concentration levels for the duration of each session.                                                    The therapy, also known as halotherapy, dates back to the ancient Greeks who sought the benefits offered by naturally occurring salt caves for improved health and wellbeing. Providing a 100% natural and drug free complimentary treatment, halotherapy, derived from the Greek alas, meaning \"salt\", is believed to loosen mucus and reduce inflammation making breathing easier.        Donna said: \u0026ldquoWe were increasingly aware of the vulnerability of the oil and gas industry, and although we both had good jobs, our working days were getting longer and more stressful which began to impact on our family life, so the timing seemed to lend itself to a total lifestyle change.\"My mum and grandmother are regulars at Salt Caves in Inverness and Edinburgh, and both had seen a significant reduction in their respective symptoms and an upturn in their general wellbeing. My grandmother, who\u0026rsquod had to give up singing due to breathing problems a number of years ago, is now back performing with her choir and she says that\u0026rsquos thanks to The Salt Cave.\u0026ldquoTheir positive experiences coupled with our desire to change career direction, led us to research the industry. When we realised there was a local Salt Cave franchise available we jumped at it. It hasn\u0026rsquot been an easy journey, and securing the right premises was difficult.\"It was at this point we met with Business Gateway. Our adviser undertook a property search on our behalf and provided invaluable information on commercial leasing and the documentation we needed to provide to secure it. Since then we\u0026rsquove had help with our business plan, HR, marketing, and have attended workshops on sales and customer care. Having access to impartial advice like this has given us greater confidence in our own abilities.                                                                                                        Carron Taylor, Business Gateway, said: \u0026ldquoDeciding to take a new career path can be a gamble but it\u0026rsquos one that is paying off for Donna and Jason as their enterprise has proven to be a hit. The couple have always had a clear vision of what they want to achieve, and have used our support to establish the franchise in Aberdeen. Continued support through our European funded Business Boost programme will help them access additional advice to grow their customer base further.Having worked in the nuclear industry in Caithness, Donna moved to Aberdeen in 2014 where she took up a position in commercial leadership in North Sea brownfield and decommissioning while Jason continued to work offshore while studying for a degree in Mechanical Engineering.Knowing first-hand the strain that long hours and stress can have on people\u0026rsquos health, the couple are now focusing their attention on attracting clients from the corporate world for whom salt therapy can offer relief from health issues and aid with stress management and relaxation.Donna added: \u0026ldquoWe know from experience that work, more often than not, comes before taking care of ourselves. That is why we want to encourage more people to make the time to visit us and have recently introduced lunch break sessions to compliment the traditional working day.                                                                                                        \"A drop-in session in one of our treatment rooms will bring numerous benefits \u0026ndash from better sleep, enhanced mental clarity and improved sporting performance due to increased blood oxygenation.

It will provide on-board workshops, spare parts storage, crane and office facilities but will get supplies from another large vessel. By contrast the BOWL project will use smaller crew transfer vessels on a daily basis to provide crew and supplies.\u0026ldquoIt is just a different strategy being used at MORL and we could not accommodate that size of vessel at Wick as we do not have the shelter and water depth required, he said. \u0026ldquoIf we had our new quay at Shaltigoe we would have been able to accommodate it.But Mr Watt is confident the harbour will still play a part in servicing the MORL project and in other renewable projects in the Moray Firth basin. He pointed out that Wick is 33 kilometres from the wind farm while Fraserburgh is 70km away.\u0026ldquoWe wish Fraserburgh and Moray East well and will continue to develop Wick harbour, Mr Watt said. \u0026ldquoWe will move forward on a strong footing in the renewables market as well as in the fishing and cargo sectors.He added that work on the BOWL base is progressing well and will create upwards of 150 jobs.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay said: \u0026ldquoIt is very disappointing news. Hopes were high this project could come to Wick. There have been a lot of improvements going on at the harbour which has the potential for a positive future.\u0026ldquoI hope other projects can come to Wick and I look forward to seeing improvements on the platform the BOWL project creates for the town and the community in general. I hope we can bring lots of jobs and apprenticeships to the area.Trudy Morris, chief executive of Caithness Chamber of Commerce, was \u0026ldquovery disappointed by the decision as the Wick harbour team has worked \u0026ldquoextremely hard to make the port an attractive base.\u0026ldquoAs the larger of the two offshore wind projects proposed for this area, it would have been a significant boost to the harbour and the region to have MORL based here, she said.But she added: \u0026ldquoIt has been fantastic to see the progress made at Wick harbour this year in preparing for the Beatrice Offshore Windfarm Ltd operations and maintenance contract, and we look forward to the benefits this will bring to the area.Eann Sinclair, programme manager for the Caithness and North Sutherland Regeneration Partnership, was also disappointed by the decision.

The move would save \u0026pound300,000.Five of the proposed closures were in Caithness and included Thurso harbour, the Camps at Wick, Halkirk, Keiss and Lybster.The council hoped nearby local businesses would adopt the Highland Comfort Scheme and provide public toilets at their premises in exchange for a monthly fee.But there was widespread opposition throughout the north to the closure plan which was seen as damaging to the area and its tourism industry.Caithness civic leader Willie Mackay backs the reprieve.\u0026ldquoI absolutely welcome this, he said. \u0026ldquoThis review will give us the opportunity to look at local needs and those of the tourists. It may also give us an incentive to reintroduce the comfort scheme and think about other ways of running the public toilets.\u0026ldquoIf we could get a fixed rate for things like electricity and get development trusts or local communities to look after the toilets that would be a great help. I am pretty confident we could get people throughout the county to help out.\u0026ldquoElectricity companies make huge amounts of money and a little consideration from them would go a long way.Highland Council announced the review after it listened to feedback from communities across the north.Councillor Allan Henderson, the chairman of environment, development and infrastructure, said there is \u0026ldquono quick fix to the problem.But he added: \u0026ldquoThis is about working with communities and potential Highland Comfort Scheme providers to enable a different public toilet delivery model that is sustainable and affordable in local communities.The decision means the toilets under threat of closure will now remain open until the end of October.The controversy over the proposed toilet closure plan has led to local MP Jamie Stone writing to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon.In his letter he stresses the contribution tourism makes to the local economyHe describes the plan as \u0026ldquoa backward step which will lead to \u0026ldquogreat inconvenience for locals and visitors alike and said it is being driven by the need to make budget savings.The Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross MP asked the First Minister if additional financial support could be provided to keep the toilets open.\u0026ldquoAny help that can be afforded by the Scottish Government would be very gratefully received by the Highland Council and the people of my constituency, he said.Meanwhile, Highland Council has agreed to review its car-parking policy.The local authority\u0026rsquos redesign board has recommended a new \u0026ldquovision for parking that will addresses traffic management, integrated transport and local economic growth and tourism.

That simply makes it a must-attend event for Orkney’s premium food and drink firms, giving them the chance to showcase their products to a very wide audience of potential customers.

Orkney topped the table in Scotland and was placed tenth in the UK as a whole.While is the responsibility of businesses to make sure they are meeting hygiene standards, local authorities play an important role in ensuring food safety compliance, with enforcement overseen by the Food Standards Agency and Food Standards Scotland.Chairman of Orkney Islands Council’s Development and Infrastructure Committee, Councillor Graham Sinclair, said the results demonstrate constructive working between the Council’s Environmental Health team and the local business community:“We’re delighted yet again to see Orkney feature at the top of this survey.“This consistency speak volumes not only about the quality of the advice and guidance the council team provides, but also the commitment of local businesses to their food safety responsibilities and on providing safe premises and products for their customers.“It reflects very well on Orkney and on the quality eating and dining out experience for locals and visitors alike.

The plans represent an investment of £125 million for investors and would create 385 new jobs.According to the hotel chain, the letter it has sent to OIC sets out how it has supported 12 local authorities in England and Wales, supporting local regeneration, creating jobs and boosting local economies.With similar letters being sent to 19 other councils in Scotland, including Shetland Islands Council, the hotel chain is attempting to show how it could similarly support local communities around the country.These agreements offer a funding structure which the hotel chain says enables local authorities to utilise their existing assets, create jobs, generate income, and help to regenerate land in strategically important locations.Hotels in the programme are built on surplus local authority land, with the funding provided either through the local authority’s internal resource or via low-cost funding from the Public Works Loan Board or third party resources.Upon completion of the hotel development, local authorities would either have the choice of either retaining ownership of the hotel and receive an annual rent into the council’s revenue budget or selling the hotel with Travelodge as its operator.Brian Wallace, Travelodge chairman said: “Many local authorities are in possession of large amounts of property and assets that are not being utilised. Investing in a low-cost hotel like Travelodge is an increasingly attractive choice, as it draws visitors, creates jobs and helps boost the local economy.”“We operate 44 hotels across Scotland. However, the country is growing at pace and attracting visitors from all corners of the globe but there still remains a huge shortage of good quality and great value hotels. To fill this gap, we want to extend our Scottish network with a further 20 hotels and this includes our first hotel in Kirkwall. To help us achieve this, we are writing to Orkney Council, to invite them to consider how Travelodge can act as a catalyst to drive their local development agenda.”A spokesman for Orkney Islands Council has said the local authority is unable to comment at this stage as to date, a proposal has not been received by the council.\u0026copy The Orcadian - 2018A division of Orkney Media Group Ltd Co.
